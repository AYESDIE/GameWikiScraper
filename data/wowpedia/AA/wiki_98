Note that the forge is not a subzone of Blackrock Depths, it exists only as a static object in the Molten Bridge subzone.\nIn the RPG.\nThe deep-dwelling dwarves of Blackrock Mountain employ a forge constructed directly into a river of molten lava, the only place they could find that could generate the required amount of consistent heat. There are also rumors that a similar forge exists in the heart of the Elemental Plane, where dark iron is much more common. A journey to this site would not be for the faint of heart."}

To that end, he has dispatched the Black Knight to eliminate promising candidates from Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;'s army. The undead's mere presence defiles the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, and those who prevail against him will prove their worthiness.\"\nStrategy.\nEach phase is about killing The Black Knight once: \nPhase 1: Corporeal form\nThe Black Knight will end his introduction and engage in combat. The Tank should immediately start building threat while melee and ranged begin their dps. A few seconds after the Black knight begins his attack an add will spawn that should quickly be picked up by the tank. The Black Knight has an attack that sends a targeted team member flying back, much like the one he uses on the NPC at the beginning. Once the add is dead DPS can resume on the Black Knight. The ghoul add can also be kept completely out of the fight by a priest with Shackle Undead, a hunter using Ice Trap, or a Paladin using Fear Undead. Once the Black Knight dies in phase 1, the ghoul will explode on its own.\nPhase 2: Skeleton form\nThe raid should group up on the corpse of the Black Knight before he spawns into his second form. Upon respawning he will cast an \"Army of the Dead\" spell. The risen ghouls Have very low HP and if killed fast enough, their explosive aoe spell can be bypassed. \nIn a very AOE heavy group this can be achieved simply by AOEing in a tight group, this will ensure that all the adds are evenly AOED and die at relatively the same time.\nAn alternate strategy for these adds is a quick focus fire order in which a DPS member can be focused to burn down each add down fast enough to avoid any explosion damage.\nIn either of these strategies The Tank must make sure to give off as much initial threat pull as possible without damaging them to the point where their aoe explode spell begins to channel.\nAfter the ghouls are dead, finish off the \"flesh wounded\" Black Knight. Don't bother Desecration since it does negligible damage.\nIf you have a death knight in your group, it is HIGHLY recommended that you have them cast &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; during phase 2. This makes this phase very easy. \nAlternatively, you can just focus killing the Black Knight and leave the ghouls up. At the end of the phase, they will all explode. Make sure no players are standing next to them at the end, or too many explosions could be fatal.\nPhase 3: Ghost form\nKeep an eye on the player who receives the Marked For Death debuff since he gets definitely the most damage.

As mentioned above, the chain lightning effect can end up hitting the tank multiple times. This on top of the static charge effect can drop any where from a quarter to half of your tank's health. Try to stay at max healing range. You will also be trying to balance your time between healing and dispelling the levitate. It helps to have either a back up healer, or a back up \"cleanser\" (priest/pally) to worry about dispelling the levitate.\nMelee- Positioning yourself on the opposite site of the tank, you can avoid being hit by the Chain Lightning. Most important is keep an eye on the enemy cast bar. Chain lightning has a long casting time (approx 3 sec). There is time to run out of range during the Chain Lightning cast even if you are a bit laggy.\nHeroic.\nSpawns several non-elite mobs with 5,000 health every 10 seconds which cast lightning bolts for about 600 - 800 nature damage. It is suggested you simply burn the boss as the adds despawn when the boss is downed.\nTanking the boss inside the alcove near the entrance to the Black Stalker's room will reduce the number of adds spawned during combat.\nIf healing is a problem, the adds can be killed by a single damage dealer at their spawn rate.\nAdds.\nThe adds in heroic mode are the only things that seem to bring about a wipe on this boss. The spawn rate can sometimes seem like a lot faster than every 10 seconds and then in other encounters the adds hardly materialise at all. Generally there will be 3 or 4 adds at once and they can be burned very quickly with decent dps or ignored completely if they spawn towards the end of the encounter. Occasionally you will quickly seem surrounded by adds and have 8 or 9 in the room as well as the boss. This seems to be completely random. Their attacks generally do very limited damage on mail armour, between 500-750 damage every 3 or 4 seconds. As they only have around 5,000 health, they can be 2 or 3-shot killed by most dps at this level. When you have a room full of the adds it can become problematic as their attacks interrupt the casting time on abilities such as Aimed Shot and Steady Shot - this obviously makes burning them quickly more difficult. What would otherwise be an almost straight forward tank and spank encounter can quickly become a wipe. If the adds become overwhelming, run around the corner and reset the encounter - beware that unlike the Black Stalker, the adds will follow for a short distance beyond the reset point. (Netherstorm Pride [Sporeggar])\nResets and resurrecting group members.\nThis boss may be reset by running out of her room. While not in combat, she moves around the room, so be careful when trying to resurrect fallen comrades. If you do pull her while resurrecting, you can always run out to reset her and try again. It is also possible for the boss to reset in the middle of a fight unintentionally, restoring the boss to full health and dropping the threat list. This usually happens when all DPS is ranged and stands near the entrance to the room, and the tank gets levitated out of range. When this happens it is best to have the whole group run out of range, re-buff and get mana to full before trying again."}

You can get new samples of fruit, grain and nut, but without the bowl you cannot summon Xabraxxis again. The only solution (at the time of this writing) is to abandon the quest and restart it. You will lose any quest items that you have, but Thundris Windweaver will then give you a new bowl. It's not known if this will be fixed by a future patch."}

In contrast to the stories told by &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;, where the characters are images conjured up, the Blank Scroll has the ability to make any story become true. Having realized how dangerous a reality-warping artifact was, the Lorewalkers took on the burden of keeping the world safe from their creation and the possible consequences.\nGarrosh's world.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ziya\"&gt;Ziya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Shuchun\"&gt;Lorewalker Shuchun&lt;/a&gt; located the Blank Scroll, Druz decided to bring it back to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;. In order to keep him from making this horrible mistake, Shuchun began telling a story of what would happen should he do so, causing the Blank Scroll to alter reality and reflect her narration.\nAs Druz expected, Gallywix decided that the scroll was far too dangerous and hid it in secrecy within the lowest vault of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. However, rumors inevitably spread throughout the land that he had kept a powerful weapon from Pandaria for himself and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, believing he had done so because he was planning to rebel, attacked the goblins of Bilgewater Harbor to obtain it. In a duel between Gallywix and Garrosh, Druz fired his gun but hit the wrong target, killing the Trade Prince and bringing the scroll into Garrosh's hands.\nWith the Blank Scroll's powers, Garrosh destroyed the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and empowered the orcs into a mindless, unkillable army under his total control. Appalled by these actions, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; fled to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and united with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in a final stand against Garrosh at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but fell before the power of the Blank Scroll.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; gained control over the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and an evil rose from Azeroth's oceans. In the end with no heroes to fight back, the world was destroyed and all life vanquished.\nAs the last words in her story, Shuchun narrated that none of what Druz and Ziya saw ever happened, and the Blank Scroll returned Azeroth to the way it should be. Having witnessed its terrifying power first-hand, the shaken Druz decided that such a powerful object should be left in the hands of the Lorewalkers, and gave Ziya paid time off to escort Shuchun in taking the Blank Scroll to another safe hiding place."}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20Race\"&gt;Allied Race&lt;/a&gt;s in \"World of Warcraft\".\nArticle.\nBoth Alliance and Horde heroes discover new allies by exploring faraway lands. The races below need to be recruited to your faction\u2019s cause in-game before you can play them.\nVoid Elf.\nMany have sought to harness the corruptive magic of the Void. Most who tried have fallen into madness. Determined to use this power for the good of Azeroth, Alleria Windrunner is the first mortal to succeed at defying the shadow's whispers. Coming to the aid of a group of her kin who nearly gave in to the darkness, Alleria has vowed to train these Void elves to control the shadows within them and pledge their newfound powers to the Alliance.\nLightforged Draenei.\nFor untold millennia, the Army of the Light waged war against the Burning Legion throughout the Twisting Nether. The draenei most committed to their long crusade would undergo a ritual to become Lightforged, infusing their bodies with the very essence of the Holy Light. After finally achieving victory on Argus, the Lightforged draenei have undertaken a new mission: protecting Azeroth from rising threats and helping the Alliance push back against Horde aggression.\nDark Iron Dwarf.\nKnown for their fiery tempers and fierce determination, Dark Iron dwarves have a turbulent history with the other clans. A failed coup in Ironforge ignited the War of the Three Hammers, and many of the Dark Iron once fought in the service of Ragnaros the Firelord. Though one faction of the dwarves is pledged to Queen-Regent Moira Thaurissan, others refuse to stand alongside their kin. The Alliance seeks a united Dark Iron clan to harness the power of Azerite and aid their struggle against the Horde.\nKul Tiran.\nKul Tiras was founded by fearless explorers who sailed uncharted waters in search of adventure. As a key member of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Kul Tiran navy dominated the seas of Azeroth with its legendary fleet. But after years of turmoil and hardship, the kingdom grew isolated and vulnerable to dark influences. Thanks to the help of brave heroes, House Proudmoore has been restored and Kul Tiras is poised to fight alongside the valiant Alliance once more.\nMechagnome.\nLong ago, a faction of zealous gnomes set out on a quest to improve their bodies and minds. Settling on the isolated isle of Mechagon, they experimented with ancient technology to reverse the Curse of Flesh and become living machines. After facing the perils of full mechanization, they found the ideal balance between flesh and steel. Now reunited with their gnomish cousins, the mechagnomes bring both tenacity and ingenuity to the Alliance.\nNightborne.\nIsolated behind a protective barrier for 10,000 years, the elves of Suramar grew increasingly dependent upon the arcane magic of the Nightwell. To protect this font of power, the leaders of the Nightborne struck a bargain with the Burning Legion that plunged their kingdom into civil war. After fighting for freedom from their demonic masters, the Nightborne seek allies in the Horde to help reclaim their place in the world.\nHighmountain Tauren.\nDescended from Huln, brave hero of the War of the Ancients, the Highmountain tauren honor the spirits of earth, river, and sky. Though the Legion invaded their lands and sowed seeds of distrust between them, the tribes of Highmountain stand united once more. At long last they are ready to venture beyond their sacred mountain and stand beside their kin from Kalimdor, lending their nobility and strength to the mighty Horde.\nMag'har Orc.\nFor untold generations, the orc clans of Draenor battled one another in endless war. But when Gul'dan offered them the blood of his demonic masters, the disparate tribes of Mag'har\u2014the orcish word for \"uncorrupted\"\u2014refused the dark bargain and banded together to drive out the Burning Legion. In the aftermath of the fall of Hellfire Citadel, the Mag'har pledged to one day repay Azeroth's heroes for aiding their cause. As war against the Alliance intensifies, the Horde must call upon the might of the Mag'har to seize victory.\nZandalari Troll.\nThe Zandalari are a proud people whose origins date back to the early days of Azeroth's history. Their fierce warriors ride dinosaurs into battle, and they possess one of the most formidable naval fleets in the known world. But enemy attacks on their borders\u2014as well as unrest within the king's council\u2014have threatened the kingdom's foundations. By returning stability to Zandalar, the heroes of the Horde can gain a powerful new ally.\nVulpera.\nClever and resourceful, the vulpera have survived amidst the harsh desert of Vol'dun for generations. Traveling in close-knit caravans, they watch out for each other as they scavenge supplies from across the dunes. Despite their small stature, they are fierce and cunning in battle, bringing down any enemy foolish enough to underestimate them. Now full-fledged members of the Horde, their wagons have left the sands in search of adventure."}

As its name suggests, it is a land devoid of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u201cBut it was not always so...\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, made his home in Deadwind, in the bright tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was the greatest &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; of his day (and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's intended custodian) Medivh was secretly possessed by the dark spirit of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Destroyer of Worlds. Through Medivh, Sargeras opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and allowed the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to wage war upon the mortal &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; progressed, Medivh fought against Sargeras' control. The raging conflict within him finally drove the wizard irrevocably insane. His childhood friend and &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;the king&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;-at-arms, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, suspected the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of treachery. With the aid of Medivh's young apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar stormed Karazhan and killed his one-time comrade. Since that day, a terrible curse has pervaded both the tower and the lands around it - casting a dark pall over Deadwind Pass and the region that is now known as Duskwood.\nIn recent years, &lt;a href=\"nobles%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;nobles of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; ventured into Deadwind Pass to investigate the blight that had settled over the region. They entered the dark tower \u2013 but never emerged. In fact, witnesses maintain that the dread &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the nobles now reside within Karazhan's walls, cursed to revel in the tower's crumbling opera house for eternity. Yet far more perilous spirits reside within Medivh's macabre study, for it was there that demonic entities responded to the deranged wizard's summons.\nDespite the myriad terrors that lie within, adventurers are still drawn to Karazhan - tempted by rumors of unspeakable secrets that may be found within the tower's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; libraries. It is said that the vast, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al halls house the powerful spellbooks of Medivh himself.\nOnly one thing is certain when visiting the dreaded tower of Karazhan...\n...you may never find your way out.\nThe decrepit tower of Karazhan once housed one of the greatest powers Azeroth has ever known: the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; Medivh. Within its halls and corridors, he summoned all manner of otherworldly beings, researching magics no other would dare touch. Karazhan now stands abandoned; with its master gone, the monstrous things and untamed powers have grown unchecked, waiting to pounce on whoever is brave or foolish enough to enter its halls. Forge a group of ten stalwart &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and journey to the wasted land between Duskwood and the Swamp of Sorrows known as Deadwind Pass, where the mystical tower lies. Only the strongest need apply: only those who have achieved level 70 are skilled enough to face what lies within.\nZul'Aman.\nThe latest major content patch for World of Warcraft, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gods%20of%20Zul%27Aman\"&gt;The Gods of Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, adds an impressive array of new challenges, features, changes, and rewards to World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; is a 10-person raid dungeon located in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, with enemies and spoils that pick up where Karazhan leaves off. This outdoor raid dungeon is home to the vicious &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and their leader, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;. You and your band of heroes will battle the dungeon's six bosses, including four avatars of Zul'Aman, each bearing the aspect of a different ferocious creature. Zul'Aman also features a challenging bonus reward structure based on completing certain objectives within a time limit, which provides an extra level of challenge \u2013 and thrills \u2013 for seasoned raid groups.\nThe other defining characteristic of The Gods of Zul'Aman is the bounty of rewards, both material and intangible, that it offers many types of players. The powerful epic items found in Zul'Aman are just the beginning. There is a host of new purchasable rewards as well, from the gladiator rewards of Arena Season 3, to the dozens of new Badge of Justice rewards and the full set of new Honor rewards. There are also more useful and fun items such as the new Flying Machine flying mounts, which can be built and operated by skilled engineers. Among the more abstract benefits to players are faster leveling to 60, the revamping of Dustwallow Marsh with new quests, new &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s for dungeons and &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, and many &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; balance changes. This is just a sampling of the bounty that awaits in The Gods of Zul'Aman.\nVengeance for Zul'jin.\nBanished from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; long ago for their use of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;forebears&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; sailed to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and made landfall on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As the elves headed farther inland, they were drawn to the verdant woods of the north, which resembled the elves' former homeland. The native forest trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20empire\"&gt;Amani empire&lt;/a&gt; fought the elves' advance to no avail. Unable to overcome the elves' arcane magic, the Amani were driven south, and the triumphant elves founded their &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; on land that had belonged to the Amani for millennia.\nThe embittered trolls regrouped and assembled a massive army. Roughly four thousand years after their defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, they unleashed a furious assault on Quel'Thalas, determined to reclaim their ancestral lands. The high elves' magics were no match for such overwhelming numbers. In desperation, the elves allied with the human nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and turned the tide of battle, decimating the troll warbands. Over two thousand years later, the trolls began to rise up again, their once-scattered &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s uniting under the cunning warlord Zul'jin.\nDuring the First War, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; offered the forest trolls a place in the Horde. At that time Zul'jin refused, for he felt that his people needed no assistance in battling the elves. He only agreed to join the Horde's ranks when the orcs proved their worth by rescuing a group of trolls shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; began. Yet Zul'jin grew furious when &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; not only failed to destroy Quel'Thalas, but also abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;siege against the high elves&lt;/a&gt; in favor of an attack on &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The forest trolls stayed behind and kept fighting. Zul'jin slaughtered countless elves, but even so, he was captured. Chained to a crumbling pillar, he endured hours of torture that cost him his right eye. When his captors were attacked by a small troll warband, the resourceful Zul'jin capitalized on the opportunity, using a fallen spear to cut off his own arm and secure his freedom. Returning home, he began rebuilding his army, and even as he remained behind Zul'Aman's walls, his legend grew.\nYears later, as the trolls slowly recovered from their devastating defeat, Zul'jin learned that the high elves had nearly been annihilated by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He planned a final campaign to end the bloodline of the elves permanently, but soon thereafter many of his mortal enemies (now calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;) joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Furious at the Horde's latest betrayal, Zul'jin was pleased when the &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacrass\"&gt;Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; approached him with a devious plan to crush the elves once and for all. Malacrass had studied the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"high%20priest\"&gt;high priest&lt;/a&gt;s and their ability to call upon the favor of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;animal gods&lt;/a&gt;. He also knew that the elves had magically bound &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the mighty &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, using it to channel the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;their own ranks&lt;/a&gt;. Malacrass had devised a similar plan: to seal the power of the animal gods within the bodies of the Amani's strongest &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Zul'jin quickly approved the plan and lent his full support. Malacrass experimented tirelessly and succeeded in imbuing four warriors with the essence of mighty animal gods: the &lt;a href=\"lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;. Some adventurers fear that Malacrass may have bound a fifth, even darker essence within his own soul...\nMany treasure hunters still seek out the legendary relics of the forest troll empire inside Zul'Aman, ignoring the danger of Zul'jin's return. As more would-be heroes disappear, the warlord's loyal army grows ever stronger from the sacrificial pyres burning within the walls of the city. Soon the time for Zul'jin's vengeance will come. \n[\"The Gods of Zul'Aman Trailer, and The Gods of Zul'Aman Wallpaper\"]\nMagtheridon's Lair.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; controlled all but small pockets of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, he was taken largely by surprise when &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and his allies conquered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Many believed that Magtheridon had been slain in the attack. However, it was discovered that Magtheridon's blood could be used to corrupt the orcs. Beaten and bloodied, the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; was dragged to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Bound by chains both physical and magical, Magtheridon survives, wounded to the brink of death and drained of his blood each day by Illidan's minions. From his tainted blood a new army of barbaric &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s has risen.\nLearn more about Magtheridon's Lair in this special .\nSerpentshrine Cavern.\nWhoever controls the water controls Outland.\nThis is the law passed down by Lord Illidan Stormrage to his most trusted lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when Illidan requested the aid of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, a group of naga led by Lady Vashj answered his call. Ever since, Vashj has displayed a fierce dedication to Illidan. Now the naga witch carefully monitors &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s operations from her seat of power within &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Far more at home here among the waters of the reservoir than locked within the cold stone walls of Black Temple, Vashj maintains a close eye on her minions and personally oversees the draining of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhether her loyalties belong to Illidan alone, however, remains to be seen.\nGruul's Lair.\nHigh King Maulgar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; was once among the weakest &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, lacking the numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt; or the physical strength of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt;. The birth of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;Maulgar&lt;/a&gt; changed their fate forever. Maulgar was stronger and hardier than any other ogre of his age, and his prowess in battle swiftly drew the attention of the previous high king. The king demanded a demonstration of Maulgar\u2019s might, and Maulgar granted it, snapping the king\u2019s neck where he stood. This action shifted the balance of power from the Boulderfist to the Bladespire, and drew the attention of mighty &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nFanatically loyal to the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, Maulgar now serves as Gruul\u2019s right hand and the guardian of the gronn lord\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;. Maulgar surrounds himself with only the most powerful of his clan and leads these elite few into battle, commanding them to augment his tremendous fighting abilities with their potent magic. With such powerful allies at his side and the rest of the Bladespire clan at his command, Maulgar has become the most dangerous ogre in all of Outland.\nGruul the Dragonkiller.\nOn Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has long been hated and hunted by both mortals and other &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Not so on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, dragons are not a species native to Draenor. When the infamous &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the Dark Portal and Draenor, he felt sure that few of Draenor's denizens would dare challenge the dragons. Thus it was that during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled to Draenor and hid clutches of his eggs all over the world. Returning to Azeroth, he left behind only a small number of drakes to guard the eggs.\nHowever, Deathwing had made a serious miscalculation by leaving some of his eggs in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The gronn living in the area were not pleased by this potential challenge to their sovereignty. Tension soon erupted into conflict. Led by the mighty Gruul, the gronn and their ogre servants proved too much for the outnumbered black dragon guardians to handle. Nearly every dragon was torn from the sky by the diabolic incantations of the Bladespire clan, and then impaled by Gruul on the stone spires of the mountains. The bones still scattered about &lt;a href=\"Dragons%27%20End\"&gt;Dragons' End&lt;/a&gt; serve as a stark reminder of the dragons' defeat.\nToday Gruul the Dragonkiller is worshipped as a deity by the ogres of the Blade's Edge Mountains. His powerful sons ravage both the Blade's Edge Mountains and the plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Gruul's unparalleled strength and experience in battle would pose a serious threat if he ever chose to attack &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in Outland. \nThe Eye.\nWith Outland serving as the strategic battlefront in the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru recently used &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; to reach the shattered land. However, when the naaru set out from their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures.\nNow, guided by some unknown purpose, Kael'thas manipulates the keep's otherworldly &lt;a href=\"Technology\"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt;, using them to harness the chaotic energies of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nThough Kael'thas and his minions maintain a tight hold on the keep, a band of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; recently hijacked one of its satellite structures, the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to escape Outland. In seeking out other &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s, the draenei, led by the ancient prophet, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, hoped to find allies who would stand with them against the Legion and its nihilistic Crusade.\nHyjal Summit.\nDeep within the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, the brooding &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; has awakened.\nSince the world was young, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s to ensure that the delicate balance of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is upheld.\nBut now the ancient Dragon Aspect Nozdormu has been roused by an elusive threat to his beloved caverns: &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;dark, sinister agents&lt;/a&gt; have infiltrated the timeways, embarking on shadowy missions to alter the course of the past, present and future.\nAs a result, the bronze dragonflight has begun enlisting heroes to prevent the fabric of history from unraveling forever. For the first time, adventurers will enter the domain of the Timeless One, where they will undertake missions to prevent the sabotage of three key historical events:\nThe momentous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in turning the tide against the dreaded &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;...\nThe assault on the timeways has begun. The balance of time is in jeopardy, and if the past is not saved...there will be no future.\nBlack Temple.\nLong ago on Draenor, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; was the center of draenei worship. But the devout &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who prayed there are long dead, slaughtered by marauding, demonically corrupted orcs. In the massacre's aftermath the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; seized the structure and bestowed upon it a new name: the Black Temple.\nFor years the Shadow Council bloodied the Black Temple with foul demonic rituals, but after the Second War the dark spellcasters fell to the Alliance's devastating &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; hastily opened several &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20portal\"&gt;dimensional portal&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stage a retreat, and the resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. In what had become the fractured realm of Outland, Ner'zhul's portals were a strategic advantage that appealed to the demon &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; , who quickly seized the Black Temple as his seat of power.\nMagtheridon commanded many of the orcs remaining in Outland and bolstered his army with Legion forces streaming in through the portals. The pit lord's might remained unchallenged until &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; decided to claim the Black Temple for himself. Illidan and Magtheridon fought a desperate battle on the temple walls, but in the end the pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Blades%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Twin Blades of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan battered Magtheridon to the point of death, but the thrill of victory was short-lived...\nThe skies of Outland darkened as &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared before Illidan, furious at Illidan's failure to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The Betrayer was forced back to Azeroth for a disastrous attack on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. Bloodied by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; but not fully beaten, Illidan returned to Outland and established his throne within the Black Temple. And yet, despite Illidan's efforts to seal Ner'zhul's portals, Kil'jaeden's wrath will not be denied. Even now the merciless &lt;a href=\"Doomwalker\"&gt;Doomwalker&lt;/a&gt; batters at the temple gates.\nDetermined to maintain his grip on Outland, Illidan awaits any and all who would challenge his rule. \n[\"Back Temple Trailer, and Back Temple Wallpaper\"]\nSunwell Plateau.\nLong ago the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; radiated its magic to all of the high elves on Azeroth. Now the remnants of this ancient fountain have become the Burning Legion's latest target as the demons prepare to summon their &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28rank%29\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden, with the last of the Sunwell's energy. Warriors from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; have joined under the &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, endeavoring to crush the Legion's invasion before it becomes insurmountable. More heroes join the Offensive every day, but the might of the Legion cannot be easily suppressed. Fierce demonic servants guard the Sunwell Plateau, attacking anyone who interferes with their proceedings. As the time of Kil'jaeden's arrival draws near, Azeroth's heroes have one final chance to save their world from blistering devastation.\nRaid Encounters.\nDoom Lord Kazzak.\nWhen the Burning Legion began its &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; served as one of the unholy army's greatest generals. At that time the Legion possessed a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Glaive of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Forged by demons during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the glaive was imbued with the forces of earth, time, &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;dream&lt;/a&gt;, magic, and life: powers taken from the mighty dragons. Even so, Archimonde and his champions were defeated during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and the glaive was shattered. Knowing the Third War had been decided, Kazzak was forced to withdraw. In the war's aftermath, the shards of the glaive were hidden away for safekeeping.\nRecently Kazzak and his minions reactivated the Dark Portal, and Kazzak went through the portal to take command of the Legion's forces in Outland. In his absence, he entrusted his most powerful lieutenant, Highlord Kruul, with retrieving the Aspect Shards. In time Kruul succeeded, and the mighty glaive was reforged.\nWith the Glaive of the Aspects and the raging desire to scour all life from the universe, the Legion may prove unstoppable.\nDoomwalker.\nThe cunning &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Burning Legion pushed their &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; workers for weeks in the construction of the first &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;, a massive construct that could easily raze fortified &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s or tear the wings off an airborne &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;. Though pleased by the success of their construct, the engineers quickly realized that they could improve upon the design. While the &lt;a href=\"forge%20camp\"&gt;forge camp&lt;/a&gt;s began to mass-produce these fel reavers to smash the mortal forces of Outland, all the manpower of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Hold\"&gt;Legion Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated to the creation of a superior machine. \nNow unleashed, &lt;a href=\"Doomwalker\"&gt;Doomwalker&lt;/a&gt; rages throughout Shadowmoon Valley, annihilating everything in its path. Infused with the captured &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of martyred draenei, the Doomwalker is empowered with unparalleled fury and might. With the fortified strength of its gargantuan body and the unbridled power of countless tortured souls, this newest fel reaver is among the most powerful weapons of the Burning Legion.\nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20101107213509/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/bcraidarea.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

For years this gargantuan fortress was thought to be abandoned...\n\"Until recently.\"\nThough much of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was shattered by the reckless &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the Hellfire Citadel remains intact\u2013 inhabited now by marauding bands of red, furious &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Though the presence of this new, savage breed presents something of a mystery, what's far more disconcerting is that the numbers of these fel orcs seem to be growing.\nDespite &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s successful bid to end the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption by slaying &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, reports indicate that the barbaric orcs of Hellfire Citadel have somehow managed to find a new source of corruption to fuel their primitive bloodlust.\nWhatever authority these orcs answer to is unknown, although it is a strongly held belief that they are not working for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps the most unsettling news to come from Outland are the accounts of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;thunderous, savage cries&lt;/a&gt; issuing from &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;somewhere deep beneath the citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Many have begun to wonder if these unearthly outbursts are somehow connected to the corrupted fel orcs and their growing numbers. Unfortunately those questions will have to remain unanswered.\nAt least for now.\nMagtheridon's Lair: An Inside Look.\nLearn more about Magtheridon's Lair in this special .\nCoilfang Reservoir.\nCoilfang Reservoir: The Slave Pens.\nThe sinister &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; recently began enslaving &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to bolster the naga's workforce and further their agenda in Outland. Nearly all of the &lt;a href=\"Wastewalker%20tribe\"&gt;Wastewalker tribe&lt;/a&gt; has been captured and put to work in the dismal &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang&lt;/a&gt;, toiling day and night beneath the yoke of their ruthless naga masters.\nSome of the Broken have seemingly accepted their fate. Others pray for the intervention of some outside faction to provide an opportunity for escape. Still others, shameless members of the tribe who see no other alternative, have found a way to turn the situation to their advantage. &lt;a href=\"Mennu%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Mennu&lt;/a&gt; is one such example: a former Broken &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; who has betrayed his fellow &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and gained favor with his naga overlords.\nDespite their differences there is one lesson the downtrodden members of the Wastewalker tribe have learned all too well: those unlucky enough to find themselves inside the Coilfang Slave Pens do not always find a way out.\nCoilfang Reservoir: The Underbog.\nThis teeming ecosystem deep within Coilfang Reservoir represents the caverns as they existed for countless millennia. Here exotic flora and fauna have remained largely undisturbed, even from the encroaching naga. Many of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;'s inhabitants have speculated that the abundance of dangerous creatures within the bog has prevented the naga army from gaining a lasting foothold. Others believe the cunning &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; has special plans for this surprisingly bountiful area.\nNaga presence in the bog is minimal, but other creatures such as lurkers, &lt;a href=\"bog%20giant\"&gt;bog giant&lt;/a&gt;s, and underbats thrive in these caverns. Though these creatures roam free, at least one of the &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt;'s deadliest denizens has apparently been quelled by the naga: a horrific, three-headed monstrosity called &lt;a href=\"Ghaz%27an\"&gt;Ghaz'an&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoilfang Reservoir: The Steamvault.\nSprawling pumping systems operate day and night throughout Coilfang Reservoir, built by the naga and their servants to drain the waters of Zangarmarsh. At the heart of this industrial complex is the &lt;a href=\"Steamvault\"&gt;Steamvault&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; drives the machinery used in the distillation process. To command the &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s who maintain and operate this machinery, Lady Vashj hired the renowned &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%20Steamrigger\"&gt;Mekgineer Steamrigger&lt;/a&gt;, a gifted &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"technician\"&gt;technician&lt;/a&gt; whose illness has damaged his sanity, but not his fierce dedication to his craft.\nGiven the strategic importance of the Steamvault, it is no surprise that Coilfang\u2019s nerve center is defended by elite naga warriors. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kalithresh\"&gt;Warlord Kalithresh&lt;/a&gt;, has an unwavering loyalty to Vashj that is matched only by his prowess in battle. He shows no mercy toward any who dare to threaten the security of the Reservoir.\nCoilfang Reservoir: Serpentshrine Cavern.\nWhoever controls the water controls Outland.\nThis is the law passed down by Lord &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to his most trusted &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Vashj. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when Illidan requested the aid of the naga, a group of naga led by Lady Vashj answered his call. Ever since, Vashj has displayed a fierce dedication to Illidan. Now the naga witch carefully monitors Coilfang\u2019s operations from her seat of power within &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Far more at home here among the waters of the reservoir than locked within the cold stone walls of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj maintains a close eye on her minions and personally oversees the draining of Zangarmarsh.\nWhether her loyalties belong to Illidan alone, however, remains to be seen.\nAuchindoun.\nThe original exiles on Draenor found &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, and so loyal draenei &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, a labyrinthine marvel located deep within the &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;forests of Terokkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said that long ago, a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;shadowy cult&lt;/a&gt; invaded Auchindoun and in its depths discovered an immensely powerful, malevolent being held captive by arcane mechanisms. Through arrogance or mischance the &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s released the creature from its &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, and the resulting power surge blasted the decrepit city apart. The surrounding land was littered with skeletal remains that earned it a new name: the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor many years Auchindoun remained largely abandoned. Yet recently many unwelcome guests have ventured into its mysterious depths, seeking powerful artifacts. Among these graverobbers are the vengeful &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; and the opportunistic &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAny &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s brave enough to enter Auchindoun would do well to remember the warnings of the city\u2019s original guardians, the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt;: that those who do not respect the dead...\n... may become entombed along with them.\nCaverns of Time.\nDeep within the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, the brooding &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; has awakened.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt; was young, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s to ensure that the delicate balance of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is upheld.\nBut now the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; Nozdormu has been roused by an elusive threat to his beloved caverns: &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;dark, sinister agents&lt;/a&gt; have infiltrated the timeways, embarking on shadowy missions to alter the course of the past, present and future.\nAs a result, the bronze dragonflight has begun enlisting heroes to prevent the fabric of history from unraveling forever. For the first time, adventurers will enter the domain of the Timeless One, where they will undertake missions to prevent the sabotage of three key historical events:\nYoung Thrall's &lt;a href=\"escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the first step on the path to his ascension as the greatest &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s have ever known...\nThe momentous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in turning the tide against the dreaded &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;...\nAnd the &lt;a href=\"opening%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;opening of the original Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; by the crazed &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 an action that ushered in the First War and introduced the mighty orcs to the world of Azeroth.\nThe assault on the timeways has begun. The balance of time is in jeopardy, and if the past is not saved...there will be no future.\nTempest Keep.\nThe mighty &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; was created by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye.\nWith Outland serving as the strategic battlefront in the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru recently used Tempest Keep to reach the shattered land. However, when the naaru set out from their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures.\nNow, guided by some unknown purpose, Kael'thas manipulates the keep's otherworldly technologies, using them to harness the chaotic energies of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nThough Kael'thas and his minions maintain a tight hold on the keep, a band of draenei recently hijacked one of its satellite structures, the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to escape Outland. In seeking out other worlds, the draenei, led by the ancient prophet, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, hoped to find allies who would stand with them against the Legion and its nihilistic Crusade.\nMagisters' Terrace.\nAfter his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas has returned to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; to make the final preparations for his master's arrival. Situated on a ridge in the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; serves as a convenient base for Kael'thas and his underlings as they assist the proceedings in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shivan\"&gt;shivan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, has treated the former prince's injuries, allowing him to recover a measure of his former power. Now Kael'thas stands poised to desecrate the ancient lands of his people with an incomparable evil. Should he succeed, the Legion's darkness will rapidly spread to all corners of Azeroth, extinguishing everything in its path.\nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20101107213456/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/bcworlddungeons.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

These articles overviewed the different various &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s available in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nOne of the core tenets of the Warcraft universe is the raging conflict between the Horde and the Alliance. Old hatreds die hard, as they say, and the hate shared between these two ancient foes is deep and primal. That's why the player-versus-player gameplay has always been a staple of the design for World of Warcraft; the war between the Horde and the Alliance simply isn't over.\nIn the battle for Azeroth, certain territories have become focal points for conflict between the Horde and Alliance. Battlegrounds represent key locations where this struggle has escalated into all-out war. Each battleground presents a different challenge and environment, and victory here must be achieved not through sheer numbers, but through strategy, skill, and grit. \nCurrent Battlegrounds.\nThe Isle of Conquest.\nAn island somewhere off the shores of Northrend. A rock, hardly worth a second look. But as insignificant as it may seem, this is no ordinary place. A sound of thunder as waves crash endlessly against rocky cliffs; a sound of fury as swords clash on the blood-stained fields of this island on the edge of forever.\nAn Alliance and a Horde general are fighting for dominance, overseeing the action from the safety of their keeps. Whichever side manages to eliminate the enemy general first will triumph on the island; failure to protect your leader will bring shame, dishonor, and defeat. There is no peace accord here, and it's an all-out war between the factions.\nStrand of the Ancients.\nOn Strand of the Ancients, the Horde and Alliance must race against the clock-and each other-to capture a relic protected in an island fortress. In alternating turns, up to 15 players on each side use siege engines and explosive charges to fight their way from a beach landing and through a series of gates, until they reach the relic. The side that can capture the relic in the shortest amount of time is declared the victor!\nEye of the Storm.\nEye of the Storm is an exciting new Battleground located in the Outland zone of Netherstorm that combines capture-and-hold style gameplay with capture-the-flag. The game pits up to 15 high-level Alliance members against 15 Horde counterparts in a battle over two floating land masses. These aerial islands are connected by three bridges. Additionally, four towers overlook the battlefield and serve as focal points for the skirmish, while a single, capturable flag spawns in the center of the map for the teams to fight over. \nAlterac Valley.\nLong ago, before the First War, the warlock Gul'dan exiled a clan of orcs called the Frostwolves to a hidden valley deep in the heart of the Alterac Mountains. It is here in the valley's southern reaches that the Frostwolves eked out a living until the coming of Thrall.\nAfter Thrall's triumphant uniting of the clans, the Frostwolves, now led by the Orc Shaman Drek'Thar, chose to remain in the valley they had for so long called their home. In recent times, however, the relative peace of the Frostwolves has been challenged by the arrival of the Dwarven Stormpike Expedition.\nThe Stormpikes have set up residence in the valley to search for natural resources and ancient relics. Despite their intentions, the Dwarven presence has sparked heated conflict with the Frostwolf Orcs to the south, who have vowed to drive the interlopers from their lands.\nArathi Basin.\nArathi Basin, located in Arathi Highlands, is a fast and exciting Battleground. The Basin itself is rich with resources and coveted by both the Horde and the Alliance. The Forsaken Defilers and the League of Arathor have arrived at Arathi Basin to wage war over these natural resources and claim them on behalf of their respective sides.\nWarsong Gulch.\nNestled in the southern region of Ashenvale forest, Warsong Gulch is near the area where Grom Hellscream and his Orcs chopped away huge swaths of forest during the events of the Third War. Some orcs have remained in the vicinity, continuing their deforestation to fuel the Horde's expansion. They call themselves the Warsong Outriders.\nThe Night Elves, who have begun a massive push to retake the forests of Ashenvale, are now focusing their attention on ridding their land of the Outriders once and for all. And so, the Silverwing Sentinels have answered the call and sworn that they will not rest until every last Orc is defeated and cast out of Warsong Gulch.\nBattleground Holidays.\nHolidays occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning. During a holiday, emmissaries from one Battleground can be found in the major cities, and honor/faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased. To find out when the next Holiday is happening, check out the Events Calendar. \nCross-Realm Battlegrounds.\nPatch 1.12: The Drums of War introduced cross-realm PvP Battlegrounds, linking Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so that players from several realms will be combined into one huge matchmaking pool. You can check out the full battlegroup list to find out which battlegroup you're in and which realms you'll be competing against. "}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nThe BGs, where half the battle is stayin\u2019 alive, are points of strategic importance to both the Alliance and the Horde. In the trenches, forests, and plains of these instanced areas, players fight members of the opposite faction while completing a wide range of objectives. Don\u2019t get carried away in the heat of battle, focus on the mission and stick to your battle brothers and sisters. Keep what you capture, don\u2019t leave anything undefended and never, EVER, fight on the roads (to hell). Remember, there are more honor points in victory; all else is dust, easily swept away.\nResource Race.\nKeep the resources flowing into the stores of your faction by capturing and holding nodes. Stall the enemy, disrupt their operations and you may soon be cruisin\u2019 the road to victory.\nArathi Basin.\nArathi Basin is a mountain-rimmed valley with some of the most arable acres in the Eastern Kingdoms. The basin has long been a prime point of societal development, offering lumber, gold and prime grazing land for livestock. It was only a matter of time before this fertile place was viewed through the sights of bows and guns.\nThe Basin\u2019s earliest days (and original owners) aren\u2019t even footnotes in history \u2013 the land frenzy driving Alliance and Horde now dominates the landscape. The League of Arathor, the remnants of the once-proud kingdom of Stromgarde (now occupied by ogres and the criminals of the Syndicate), would claim the basin to profit their allies in Stormwind (and, through them, the whole of the Alliance). Set against them are the forsaken Defilers, free-willed undead who strive to savage the human kingdom of Lordaeron and secure their home in the Undercity \u2013 and they demand Arathi\u2019s resources to do it. \nEye of the Storm.\n\u201cEye of the Storm\u201d would be a florid name for most regions \u2013 but for the floating isle suspended high above Netherstorm, it\u2019s just right. Coruscating mana storms suffuse the island\u2019s towers with energy, even as they wear away the barrier between Outland and the Twisting Nether, realm of the demonic Burning Legion.\nThese nexuses of power (and the Eye\u2019s proximity to the Naaru fortress of Tempest Keep) make an otherwise barren rock irresistible to the Light-worshipping draenei refugees of the Exodar and the driven blood elves of Silvermoon City.\nBattle for Gilneas.\nIsolationism has long shaped the nation of Gilneas, affecting its people inside and out. The enormous Greymane Wall once protected them from a plague of undeath; now that the wall has fallen, the citizens who huddled behind it are forced to confront that particular fear. The rotting Forsaken seethe to spread their contagion throughout the whole region of Lordaeron, claiming it as their own - and they see opportunity in Gilneas' rubble.\nFortunately for the people of Gilneas, their own particular curse transformed them into bestial wolf-human hybrids.\nNow, the Horde will support their undead allies' attempt to seize resources from a damaged nation, while the Alliance comes to the aid of a tainted people seeking new lives. Regardless of the victor, monsters will rule over the ruins.\nDeepwind Gorge.\nThe verdant Valley of the Four Winds has long enriched the continent of Pandaria with bountiful fruit, fields of grain, grandiose vegetables, and\u2026gold?\nDeepwind Gorge dips below even the Valley\u2019s normal depth, and it\u2019s here that the pandaren have turned the earth, exposing rich veins of gold. Ever since they freed themselves from the tyrannical mogu, the inhabitants of the Valley have made careful, cautious use of these riches, taking only what they need and paying attention to the limits of their land.\nBut the Alliance and Horde have their own plans for the gleaming metals of the Gorge. Amidst the quarry, filled with dislodged rock and connected by makeshift wooden bridges, both factions will rush for a bonanza of riches that only one can walk away with.\nSilvershard Mines.\nDiamonds! Stranglethorn Vale\u2019s Silvershard mines are full of the gleaming gems, and, while they\u2019re pretty to look at, they\u2019re far more important for what they can buy: new blades, ballistae and battle-gear for the soldiers of the Alliance and Horde. Neither faction wants its opposition digging up diamonds \u2013 not when the other option is to spill their enemies\u2019 blood on the rocks and make off with the loot in Venture co. mine carts!\nTemple of Kotmogu.\nDuring the lost days of ancient Pandaria, the ruling mogu built temples not unlike themselves \u2013 immense in size, vast in scope, and steeped in forces as old as the ground beneath their feet. Stony statues of the mogu still glare down from their long-vacant temples, and echoes of their supremacy persist to the present day. Inside the autumnal Temple of Kotmogu, a vicious melee has erupted over artifacts the mogu left behind: treasures older than the bloodlines of human kings and the clans of orcs, orbs of power that have bathed in the energies of Pandaria for ages. Will they bring the might of the mogu to the Horde or Alliance?\nCapture the Flag.\nSneak into the enemy\u2019s fort, take their symbol of pride (flag) and return triumphantly (means: alive) to your own flag. Do not allow the enemy to take your flag or you will be unable to capture theirs. \nWarsong Gulch.\nThe gleaming purple-and-emerald forests of Ashenvale are more than just pleasant woodland. To the Warsong orcs who name themselves Outriders, they\u2019re a prize cache of building planks; to the night-elven Silverwing Sentinels, they\u2019re home. Where the turned soil and tree stumps surrounding Horde lumber mills start to encroach on Ashenvale\u2019s timberlands, these two factions clash.\nEach group recruits heroes from far and wide \u2013 the Horde to batter back the defenders and clear the forests, and the Alliance to shatter the aggressors and stop the disappearance of their precious land. Capturing flags might seem like an unorthodox method of settling this dispute, but it\u2019s symbolic (and hardly without bloodshed). Whoever holds their defeated foes\u2019 banner will show all who look upon the forest that their claim is the strongest \u2013 and dictate the future of one of the most important, ancestral lands of the Kaldorei.\nTwin Peaks.\nThe Twin Peaks are a strategic chokepoint crucial to Horde and Alliance assaults on the Twilight\u2019s Hammer cult and the forces of Deathwing. These craggy mountains are so vital to the war effort that the Dragonmaw clan of orcs and the Wildhammer dwarves remain locked in seemingly endless battle to this day, each hoping to claim definitive ownership of the peaks.\nWarfare.\nCRUSH YOUR ENEMIEEEES, NYAHHHHHHHHHHHH! What? Oh\u2026 *ahem*. Ride into the fields of battle and clash with the enemy force. Burn down their towers, obliterate their defenses and eliminate, or secure, high priority targets. \nAlterac Valley.\nLong ago, the warlock Gul'dan exiled a clan of orcs called the Frostwolves to a valley hidden deep in the heart of the Alterac Mountains. The Frostwolf Clan eked out a living until Thrall triumphantly united many of Azeroth\u2019s orcs. The Frostwolves, however, chose to remain in the valley rather than joining Thrall in Orgrimmar \u2013 and their relative peace has since been challenged by the arrival of the dwarven Stormpike Expedition. The Stormpike Expedition\u2019s desire to mine and plumb the underexplored caves for relics has invited conflict with the Frostwolf Clan, but opinions are divided on who struck first. Were the dwarves who arrived in the valley peaceful explorers who were massacred by the orcs, or did they plan to poach and conquer? \nStrand of the Ancients.\nThe world-shaping titans have left their mark on frozen Northrend, though often their presence is embedded in the ground, as in mysterious Ulduar. Yet, on a narrow island chain, a sliver of titan handiwork is out in the 'open'.\nAs Horde and Alliance vanguards began to course over the continent of Northrend, their mystics awoke to dizzying visions of an isle, and a gleaming power behind heights of stone. The Strand\u2019s long-abandoned citadel towers and great gates loom mightily...but there\u2019s crumbling rock and rust among those fortifications. They can be brought down.\nDisembark on the Strand with your war machines and fellow soldiers, smash the walls of yesteryear and claim a prize of eons\u2019 past. Or seize the titans\u2019 once-magnificent bulwark, man their guns, and blast your enemies back into the sea.\nIsle of Conquest.\nJust offshore of the immense Icecrown Glacier, crawling with frozen dead and coated in ice cracking under the wheels of invading siege engines, lies an oil-rich island. It\u2019s strategically perfect \u2013 a quick trip by boat to the greatest point of conflict in Northrend.\nThe elite among Horde and Alliance armies \u2013 the Kor\u2019kron Guard and the 7th Legion \u2013 have arrived on the isle in force, and put down roots. Smiths and machinists have begun their work, turning this nameless landmass\u2019s natural resources into smoke and steel. Highly secure keeps, exited only through mage portals, allow the generals of each faction to issue commands to their armies without leaving the safety of their fortresses.\nThe engines of war are churning. All that remains is for two heavily armed forces to agree about the territory lines.\nWintergrasp.\nA vast body of cobalt water, frozen into diamond stillness by Northrend's chills. An alabaster-white keep, built to gaze over one of the most austere examples of Azeroth's natural beauty. And a promising mine, one whose plunder could power exploration of the entire cold continent.\nIt's no accident that Lake Wintergrasp is the seat of ceaseless battle. Every few hours on the lake brings another skirmish, the thunder of cannon fire and crunching tread of tons-weight vehicles re-powdering the snow. Every outbreak of violence is a chance for a peon or peasant to find riches in the mines, or for an adventurer to seek treasure in the unearthly vault below the keep.\nHorde and Alliance fight for Wintergrasp's plunder, but not blindly. If they bolster the war machine that brings down Northrend's horrifying undead, they buy their soldiers the hope to return home.\nTol Barad.\nThe decaying remains of this island stronghold tell a story of blood and flames. Built by the first nation of men, the citadel of Tol Barad was once a strategic staging area for Alliance forces in the Second War. The Horde viewed Tol Barad as an obstacle in their path to the Eastern Kingdoms and mounted an assault on the island. Unprepared for such aggression, the Alliance were expelled from Tol Barad and the citadel was razed, a charred symbol of the Horde\u2019s brutal victory. What remained of the blackened, derelict battlements was left to languish until the wizards of Kul Tiras claimed the isle for a new purpose.

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nBlood Elf.\nHorde \nFor nearly 7,000 years, high elven society centered on the sacred Sunwell, a magical fount that was created using a vial of pure arcane energy from the first Well of Eternity. Nourished and strengthened by the Sunwell\u2019s potent energies, the high elves\u2019 enchanted kingdom of Quel\u2019Thalas prospered within the verdant forests north of Lordaeron.\nDuring the Third War, however, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth. Led by the death knight Arthas, a Scourge army stormed into Quel\u2019Thalas, slaughtering almost ninety percent of the kingdom\u2019s population. Arthas then used the mystical Sunwell to resurrect the fallen necromancer Kel\u2019Thuzad, irrevocably tainting the fount in the process.\nFearing that the befouled well would obliterate his dwindling race, Prince Kael\u2019thas Sunstrider gathered a group of Quel\u2019Thalas\u2019s defenders and destroyed the fount to avert catastrophe. Although the high elves were spared from continued exposure to the Sunwell\u2019s dark energies, in the fount\u2019s absence they suffered terribly from withdrawal. As a result, Kael\u2019thas desperately searched for a means to help his people\u2014whom he had renamed the blood elves\u2014and thus he set out for the shattered world of Outland. There he allied with the renegade demon Illidan Stormrage in the hopes of finding a cure for the blood elves\u2019 crippling withdrawal.\nKael\u2019thas had assured his people that one day he would return to Quel\u2019Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet time revealed that his promises were nothing more than lies. On Outland, the prince became twisted due to his reliance on fel energy, the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion itself. Unbeknownst to Illidan, Kael\u2019thas also came under the sway of the Legion\u2019s commander, Kil\u2019jaeden.\nAt the bidding of his new master, the wayward prince eventually returned to Azeroth and seized the site of the Sunwell, hoping to use the fount as a means to usher Kil\u2019jaeden into the world. Ultimately, Kael\u2019thas was slain before his recklessness could bring ruin to Azeroth. In the wake of Kil\u2019jaeden\u2019s defeat, the draenei prophet Velen purified the Sunwell with the Light-infused heart of a fallen naaru, transforming the fount into a source of both holy and arcane energies.\nInspired by the Sunwell\u2019s rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race\u2019s history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel\u2019Thalas. Yet only time will tell if the blood elves can avoid repeating the tragic mistakes of their past.\nStart Location: Eversong Woods.\nThe blood elves have called the resplendent Eversong Woods home for millennia, but the stewardship of this forested region has not been without its perils. Bent on harnessing the elves\u2019 mystical Sunwell, Prince Arthas and the Scourge carved a path of destruction through the heart of Quel\u2019Thalas during the Third War, leaving a tainted scar across Eversong Woods. Thus far the elves have worked extensively to drive the lingering undead from their lands and cleanse the wounds of Arthas\u2019s assault, but the task is far from over. As Quel\u2019Thalas looks toward a new future, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of Eversong will be a critical first step.\nHome City: Silvermoon City.\nLess than a decade ago, the wondrous high elven capital of Silvermoon was nearly destroyed during a brutal Scourge invasion. Under the command of Prince Arthas, the undead ravaged the city and went on to corrupt the sacred waters of the Sunwell. Despite this horrific event, the high elves\u2014now known as the blood elves\u2014have labored to rebuild their ruined capital. Most recently, the rebirth of the Sunwell has lifted spirits among the elves, and they have continued to heal Silvermoon\u2019s scars in the hopes of returning the crown jewel of Quel\u2019Thalas to its former glory.\nRacial Mount: Hawkstrider.\nWhen Kael\u2019thas led his followers to the ruined world of Outland, the vibrant hawkstriders that were brought with them proved to be welcome reminders of the blood elves\u2019 beauteous home in Quel\u2019Thalas. Valued for their trustworthiness and speed, these colorful avian creatures embody the inherent splendor of the forests within the blood elven kingdom. While tragedy has befallen Quel\u2019Thalas in recent years, the hawkstriders remain an integral part of the elves\u2019 day-to-day lives.\nLeader: Lor\u2019themar Theron Regent Lord of Quel\u2019Thalas.\nRegent Lord Lor\u2019themar Theron is well-aware of the suffering that the blood elves have faced in recent years. After surviving the brutal Scourge invasion of Quel\u2019Thalas, he was entrusted with watching over the elven kingdom while Prince Kael\u2019thas journeyed to Outland. Not long afterward, Lor\u2019themar\u2019s will was tested when the prince, twisted by demonic energies, returned to Azeroth and attempted to use the Sunwell for nefarious purposes. Kael\u2019thas was later killed for his treachery, leaving Lor\u2019themar to guide the fate of the blood elves. With the Sunwell reborn, a bright future now lies ahead for Quel\u2019Thalas. Fittingly, it will be Lor\u2019themar, who weathered many of the kingdom\u2019s darkest days, leading his people toward their new destiny."}

The US variant is vastly different and can be found &lt;a href=\"Game%20Guide/Burning%20Crusade%20Reputation%20%28US%29\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle Content.\nA &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; is a group of people that share same interests. Many of the factions in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are not involved in the on-going tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and, thus, are generally open to members of both sides. These \"non-aligned\" factions can provide you with information, equipment, and experience. Other factions are actively involved in the disputes between Alliance and Horde and are thus open only to members of one of those two sides. These factions are often attached to the various &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHellfire Factions.\nHonor Hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; stands to the south of both the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; was sent through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat once and for all. Led by the valiant &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the expedition did its best to fulfill its mission, &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;waging fierce battles&lt;/a&gt; on the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Yet when &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;reckless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; began to tear Draenor apart, the expedition members had to sacrifice their only chance of returning home by closing the Draenor end of the Dark Portal. Back on Azeroth, the expedition members were honored for their sacrifice and presumed dead.\nCut off from Azeroth for almost twenty years, the expedition fought to maintain a foothold on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They took to calling themselves the Sons of Lothar in honor of the late &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. The recent reactivation of the Dark Portal brought turmoil to Outland, but also led to Azeroth's discovery that there were survivors from the long-lost expedition. Reinforcements from Azeroth hastened to aid the Sons of Lothar, who were still holding several strongholds on Outland, including Honor Hold. Although the orc race remains undefeated, the Sons of Lothar, including those in Honor Hold, have new hope. Bolstered by fresh troops, the expedition members struggle to complete their original mission and return home to Azeroth at last.\nSuch a task remains fraught with peril, though, for Honor Hold is caught between two dangerous enemies. In Hellfire Citadel, orcish forces are assembling once again. Whatever the reason for the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s' presence at the citadel may be, their growing military strength could have dire consequences for both Outland and Azeroth. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has arrived in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s are pouring out of Legion &lt;a href=\"Portal\"&gt;gateways&lt;/a&gt; near the Dark Portal in alarming numbers, threatening to overrun the portal. Fresh troops from Azeroth, both Horde and Alliance, are fighting to keep the demons from entering the portal.\nThrallmar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s newly established base of operations in Hellfire Peninsula is &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the Path of Glory and Hellfire Citadel from the north. Shortly after arriving in Outland, a Horde expeditionary force set up this new base, but they were soon cut off from Azeroth by Legion forces that moved in to retake the Dark Portal. Now the people of Thrallmar are caught between a rock and a hard place.\nTo the north and east, the Burning Legion has constructed &lt;a href=\"Forge%20site\"&gt;forge camps&lt;/a&gt; that provide the Legion with regular reinforcements. These camps are fortified by powerful &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, and the demons there are a constant threat to Thrallmar. If the forge camps are allowed to remain, it will be only a matter of time before Legion forces invade Thrallmar. To the south of Thrallmar, at the massive stronghold dominating the Path of Glory, an orcish army is forming once again. However, these orcs are different from the original occupants of the gargantuan fortress: the forces amassing at Hellfire Citadel are red, furious fel orcs. Whatever authority these orcs answer to is unknown, but it is a strongly held belief that they are not working for the Burning Legion.\nFor the most part, Thrallmar has been cut off from regular reinforcements. As a result, its inhabitants are forced to rely on the help of Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to aid Thrallmar in its struggle against the many threats of Hellfire Peninsula.\n[\"Tips, Rewards, and PvP Rewards\"]\nNagrand Factions.\nThe Mag'har.\nSouth of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; lie the grassy plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, homeland of the orcs. Travelers following the northeastern roads of Nagrand will come upon a settlement of brown-skinned orcs: a place called &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;. This village belongs to &lt;a href=\"the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, a group of orcs who managed to escape any form of demonic corruption. Though they endured great change, the Mag'har have retained their traditional way of life. Nonetheless, the Mag'har are far from safe.\nWith the rise of the brutish &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in Nagrand, the Mag'har find themselves facing a truly terrifying enemy. To make matters worse, the foul &lt;a href=\"Murkblood\"&gt;Murkblood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; have sacked the orc village of &lt;a href=\"Sunspring%20Post\"&gt;Sunspring Post&lt;/a&gt;, the Mag'har's only other territorial holding in Nagrand. While the orcs combat both ogres and Broken, whispers of yet another threat linger: a force emanating from some hidden place, stirring the spirits of the orcs' long-dead ancestors.\nThe Mag'har have been separated from their kin for a long time, but they still have strong ties to their Azerothian brethren. Like the Horde, the Mag'har are hostile towards all members of the Alliance.\nThe Kurenai.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; are a group of Broken who have escaped the grasp of their various &lt;a href=\"slaver\"&gt;slaver&lt;/a&gt;s in Outland. They recently took possession of &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in the far south of Nagrand. Unlike many other Broken, the Kurenai are trying their best to overcome their demonic taint. Nevertheless, despite their noble intent, the Kurenai are cautious toward all outsiders, who sometimes mistake the Kurenai for their wretched brethren. A number of Kurenai also dwell in Zangarmarsh at the &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, where they are trying to strengthen the ties between the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; and the Kurenai home city of Telaar. Yet the path of the Kurenai's destiny is long and dangerous, and many threats lurk on the winding road ahead... quite literally. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads of Zangarmarsh must be secured. The task will prove difficult, considering the marsh's abundance of mostly aggressive wildlife.\nThe most imminent danger to the Kurenai, though, comes from ogres. In Zangarmarsh, the &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh\"&gt;Ango'rosh&lt;/a&gt; ogres are moving in from the west, while in Nagrand, ogres from the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; and Warmaul &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s are a constant threat to the safety of Telaar. Infighting between the ogre clans has displaced some of the big brutes from their mounds, sending them out searching for food in regions that had previously been spared the ogres' insatiable appetite. Another problem the Kurenai face in Nagrand is being caused by a different group of Broken: the Murkblood tribe. These savage Broken sacked the Mag'har settlement of Sunspring Post, slaying many orcs and destroying any chance of peaceful coexistence between Kurenai and Mag'har in the near future. To make matters worse, the Murkblood tribe seems to be planning to use their newfound strength against the people of Telaar.\nBecause the Kurenai are trying to mend their ties to their draenei brethren, they are supporting the draenei's decision to join the Alliance by allowing all Alliance members to enter Telaar unharmed. Those who seek out Telaar will find that the Kurenai, although wary of strangers at first, are good people who greatly honor the friendship of their proven allies.\n[\"Tips, and Rewards\"]\nAldor, Scryers, and the Sha'tar (Shattrath City Factions).\n&lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; was once the draenei capital of Draenor. Its name means \"dwelling of light.\" When the Burning Legion &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;turned the orcs against the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the fiercest battle was fought there. The draenei fought tooth and nail, but in the end, the city fell. The city was left in ruins and darkness until the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; arrived. The Sha'tar, whose name means \"born from light\", are the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who came to Outland to fight the demons of the Burning Legion. The naaru were drawn to the ruins of Shattrath City, where a small remnant of the draenei priesthood conducted its rites inside a ruined temple. The priesthood, known as the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, quickly regained its strength as word of the Sha'tar's arrival spread. Reconstruction of Shattrath was soon underway. It wouldn't be long, however, before the city came under attack once again. \nThis time, the attack came from the armies of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;large regiment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; had been sent by Illidan's ally, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, to lay waste to the city. As the regiment of blood elves crossed the bridge, the Aldor's &lt;a href=\"exarch\"&gt;exarch&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s lined up to defend the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Then the unexpected happened: the blood elves laid down their weapons in front of the city's defenders. Their leader, a blood elf elder known as &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal\"&gt;Voren'thal&lt;/a&gt;, stormed into the Terrace of Light and demanded to speak to the naaru A'dal. As the naaru approached him, Voren'thal knelt and uttered the following words: \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\" \nThe defection of Voren'thal and his followers was the largest loss ever incurred by Kael'thas' forces. Nor were these just any blood elves. Many of the best and brightest amongst Kael'thas' &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; had been swayed by Voren'thal's influence. The naaru accepted the defectors, who became known as the Scryers. They dwell on the &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryer's Tier&lt;/a&gt; in the southern section of Shattrath City. Only those initiated with the Scryers are allowed there. The Aldor are followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and so forgiveness and redemption are values they understand. However, they cannot forget the deeds that the Scryers committed while they were still under Kael'thas' command. Indeed, many of the Aldor had been slain by the same magisters who now serve the naaru. The Aldor are therefore deeply unhappy at sharing the city with their former enemies. The Aldor's holiest temple and its surrounding dwellings lie on the &lt;a href=\"Aldor%20Rise\"&gt;Aldor Rise&lt;/a&gt; overlooking Shattrath City from the west. As a holy site, the temple only allows the initiated inside.\nAfter the formation of the Scryers, attacks against Shattrath continued, but the city did not fall. On the contrary, the naaru known as &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt; led a successful incursion into &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;: Illidan's doorstep. There Xi'ri continues to wage war on Illidan with the assistance of the Aldor and the Scryers. The two rival factions have not given up on their old feuds, though. Such is their animosity that they vie for the honor of being sent to assist Xi'ri. Each day, that decision is made by A'dal, and the chosen fighters gather at the Terrace of Light to receive A'dal's blessing before heading to Shadowmoon Valley. To serve the Sha'tar, every adventurer will most likely have to ally with the Aldor or the Scryers. It should come as no surprise that seeking the favor of one group will incur the other's dislike.\n[\"Tips, Rewards, Token Rewards, Badges of Justice, and Badges of Justice 2\"]\nCenarion Expedition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;'s main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, the expedition has become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition is based at &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Refuge\"&gt;Cenarion Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in the far east of Zangarmarsh, immediately west of &lt;a href=\"Thornfang%20Hill\"&gt;Thornfang Hill&lt;/a&gt; in Hellfire Peninsula.\nThe &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s' original goal in coming to Zangarmarsh was to study the rich wildlife there, but the group has discovered troubling goings-on in the marsh. Water levels in many parts of Zangarmarsh are decreasing, and some areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Mire\"&gt;Dead Mire&lt;/a&gt;, have already suffered greatly from this strange phenomenon. The druids of the Cenarion Refuge believe that the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; are to blame, but the expedition cannot afford a direct confrontation with the many naga in Zangarmarsh and &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. The Cenarion Expedition needs the aid of adventurers willing to assist the druids in their dangerous fight against those who seek to disturb the marsh's natural balance. Anyone brave enough to combat the naga at Coilfang Reservoir will be well rewarded.\n[\"Tips, and Rewards\"]\nKeepers of Time.\nAt the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; desert lie the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his flight work to safeguard the &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; stream against all who might disturb the delicate pathways of fate. Lately a &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;malevolent force&lt;/a&gt; has infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s, and the efforts of this mysterious enemy could lead to a destabilization of the world, and even time itself. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; have detected interference at several key points in the history of Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; is being sabotaged to prevent the son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; from fulfilling his destiny of freeing his people and becoming the greatest &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; the orcs have ever known.

Many of these rewards feature unique mechanics which will be explained below.\nThe Ogri'la faction is loosely affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt;, as they are close neighbors in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, if you're doing Skyguard quests, you will be in close proximity to the Ogri'la quests, and vice versa \u2013 it makes sense to work on both factions simultaneously. Like other factions who offer daily quests, the daily quests of the Ogri'la faction are a great money source in addition to the reputation gains they award.\nOgri'la is located on a high plateau on the western edge of Blade's Edge Mountains, midway between and . However, you must first prove your worth to Ogri'la before any of the NPCs there will speak with you and offer quests. What would impress these ogres enough to give an outsider access to their most carefully guarded sanctuary? Read on...\n[\"Tips, Reputation Level Daily Quests, and Rewards\"]\nSha'tari Skyguard.\nThe Sha'tari Skyguard is a faction related to the Sha'tar that is closely associated with a special epic flying mount, the &lt;a href=\"nether%20ray\"&gt;nether ray&lt;/a&gt;. There are other reputation-based rewards as well, such as epic &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s. Once you reach &lt;a href=\"honored\"&gt;honored&lt;/a&gt; reputation, you will have access to a free direct flightpath between the two Skyguard camps in Terokkar Forest and Blade's Edge Mountains. While using this flightpath, you get to ride a nether ray, as a preview of what you will look like when you get your very own.\nA combination of daily and one-time quests allows you to raise your reputation from the starting state of &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"exalted\"&gt;exalted&lt;/a&gt;. You do not need to have 300 riding skill to do any of the Skyguard quests or to purchase the Nether Rays at Exalted. You will need 300 riding skill to ride a nether ray, however.\nTo begin the process of befriending the Skyguard, talk to &lt;a href=\"Yuula\"&gt;Yuula&lt;/a&gt;, who is located near the &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt; in Shattrath City. If you have the requisite 225 riding skill, she will send you out to slay &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; Ogres in the &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Hills\"&gt;Barrier Hills&lt;/a&gt;, which are only a few seconds by flying mount from Shattrath City. Once you've slain the requisite number of ogres, Yuula will be impressed enough with your prowess to recommend you to the Skyguard camp of &lt;a href=\"Blackwind%20Landing\"&gt;Blackwind Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlackwind Landing, Terokkar Forest.\nThis camp is located southeast of Shattrath City, north of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; near the river's fork. The entire region is surrounded by impassable mountains, so the only access to Blackwind Landing and Skettis itself is by flying mount. From this outpost, the Skyguard launches attacks against the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of Skettis \u2013 and they're looking for new recruits to aid their cause. The questgivers in the camp offer an assortment of one-time quests, which may lead to group quests with powerful rewards. \n[\"Daily Quests\"]\nSkyguard Outpost, Blade's Edge Mountains.\nThe second quest hub for the Skyguard is found in Ogri'la, which is in the western section of Blade's Edge Mountains. There are more one-time and daily quests you can do here for Skyguard reputation. However, to unlock them you need to be neutral with Ogri'la, which itself is unlocked by completing an associated group quest chain, and then completing the Ogri'la quest \u201cOur Boy Wants to be a Skyguard Ranger.\u201d Talk to &lt;a href=\"Grok\"&gt;Grok&lt;/a&gt; in Shattrath's Lower City to start the Ogri'la quest chain.\n[\"Daily Quests\"]\nSporeggar.\nIn the far west of Zangarmarsh, nestled between &lt;a href=\"Marshlight%20Lake\"&gt;Marshlight Lake&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Glen\"&gt;Spawning Glen&lt;/a&gt;, lies &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar%20%28town%29\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s. The sporelings, a mostly peaceful &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;-men native to Outland, are facing numerous threats to their quiet way of life. Historically the greatest threat to the sporelings has been the &lt;a href=\"marsh%20walker\"&gt;marsh walker&lt;/a&gt;s. However, &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s in the marsh recently began devouring &lt;a href=\"Mature%20Spore%20Sac\"&gt;spore sacs&lt;/a&gt;, which contain the sporelings\u2019 offspring. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodscale\"&gt;Bloodscale&lt;/a&gt; naga have settled just to the northeast of Sporeggar, where they pose a clear threat to the village's safety. The sporelings have therefore begun appealing to travelers passing through Sporeggar, asking the strangers for help in these dire times.\nThe sporelings may seem primitive at first glance, but they possess a natural bond with the marsh, and they gladly share their home\u2019s secret blessings with their friends. True to their shy and careful nature, the sporelings have learned to craft &lt;a href=\"cloak\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt;s that let their wearer slip through the marshes. The sporelings also possess an intuitive knowledge of &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, and so they know how to extract wondrous properties from the marsh\u2019s many mushrooms. One final piece of advice for adventurers seeking to befriend the sporelings: the people of Sporeggar have little use for your coin. They prefer to trade their goods for the &lt;a href=\"glowcap\"&gt;glowcap&lt;/a&gt; mushrooms found throughout Zangarmarsh.\n[\"Tips, and Rewards\"]\nThe Consortium.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; is a loosely affiliated &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"smuggler\"&gt;smuggler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;traders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; who have come to Outland to benefit from its riches. To this end, the Consortium has set up several bases of operation in Outland. Their camp in Nagrand, located due south of Sunspring Post, has been tasked with gathering the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; treasures of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, and they have been authorized to subcontract any adventurers willing to assist them with this task. The Consortium also has plans to explore the ruins of ancient &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; in the Bone Wastes south of Terokkar Forest, but apparently their efforts have been impeded by unforeseen complications. Adventurers planning to visit the &lt;a href=\"Mana-Tombs\"&gt;Mana-Tombs&lt;/a&gt; of Auchindoun would be well advised to speak to the Consortium representatives outside the entrance before setting foot in this dungeon. The Consortium's most important settlements, however, are in the ravaged wastelands of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Consortium takes a certain amount of well-justified pride in its &lt;a href=\"eco-dome\"&gt;eco-dome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;. The domes' protective energy fields allow the ethereals to work in a controlled and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;-sustaining atmosphere. Lately there have been an increased number of technical difficulties surrounding the eco-domes in Netherstorm, and the Consortium is looking for outside help to find a way to stabilize the situation. In addition, a hostile group of ethereals called the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; has built a staging area close to the &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt;, the Consortium's main base of operations. The Ethereum's destructive tendencies are a threat to the Consortium and the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt;, a third group of ethereals in the area. Also, the presence of the Ethereum's leader, &lt;a href=\"Nexus-King%20Salhadaar\"&gt;Nexus-King Salhadaar&lt;/a&gt;, means that &lt;a href=\"Dimensius\"&gt;Dimensius&lt;/a&gt;, the ethereals' ancient enemy, must be near.\nThe Consortium has access to a vast collection of the most exotic treasures and artifacts. As a result, the Consortium has the right kind of reward for every adventurer. Heroes who are deemed worthy by Nexus-Prince Haramad will be allowed a share of some of the Consortium's wealth... for a price.\n[\"Tips, and Rewards\"]\nThe Scales of Sands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Scale of Sands&lt;/a&gt; is closely linked with the Keepers of Time.\n[\"Rewards\"]\nThe Violet Eye.\nLooming over &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the eldritch tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; casts its shadow on the lands below. From the outside, the ruined tower looks as if it was abandoned long ago. Yet those who have come face to face with true evil know that some horrors never truly disappear. The tower's last master, the &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; Medivh, is gone, but the echoes of his evil deeds linger within the walls of Karazhan.\nAlthough there seems little hope of ever lifting the shadows from these Light-forsaken lands, there are still people who will stand against the sinister presence that has taken up residence in Karazhan. The &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; is a secret sect of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling council of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. The Violet Eye was assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and Medivh, in case things got out of hand. And things in Karazhan have indeed gotten out of hand. In recent years, several &lt;a href=\"nobles%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;nobles of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; ventured into Deadwind Pass to investigate the blight that had settled over the region. They entered the dark tower, but never emerged. The Violet Eye, too, sent agents into Karazhan to investigate, but none of them ever reported back. To make matters worse, the wizards of the Violet Eye have discovered what might very well be demonic emanations coming from the tower.\nWhatever haunts the halls of Karazhan, it must be stopped at all costs. The tower was built at a powerful convergence of magical energies: only disaster could result if Karazhan fell into the hands of an enemy unencumbered by conscience or mercy. Members of the Violet Eye are keeping watch at the base of the tower, and they will gladly accept the aid of any adventurer willing to help.\n[\"Violet Rewards, Violet Rings\"]\nReferences.\nThis page and the articles it contained can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20090217002248/http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/factions/index.html%3Frhtml%3Dy\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; was sent through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat once and for all. Led by the valiant &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the expedition did its best to fulfill its mission, waging fierce battles on the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Yet when reckless &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; began to tear Draenor apart, the expedition members had to sacrifice their only chance of returning home by closing the Draenor end of the Dark Portal. Back on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the expedition members were honored for their sacrifice and presumed dead.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s newly established base of operations in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the Path of Glory and Hellfire Citadel from the north. Shortly after arriving in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde expeditionary force set up this new base, but they were soon cut off from Azeroth by &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces that moved in to retake the Dark Portal. Now the people of Thrallmar are caught between a rock and a hard place.\nCenarion Expedition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;'s main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, the expedition has become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition is based at &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Refuge\"&gt;Cenarion Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in the far east of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, immediately west of &lt;a href=\"Thornfang%20Hill\"&gt;Thornfang Hill&lt;/a&gt; in Hellfire Peninsula.\nSporeggar.\nIn the far west of Zangarmarsh, nestled between &lt;a href=\"Marshlight%20Lake\"&gt;Marshlight Lake&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Glen\"&gt;Spawning Glen&lt;/a&gt;, lies &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar%20%28town%29\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s. The sporelings, a mostly peaceful &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;-men native to Outland, are facing numerous threats to their quiet way of life.\nThe Kurenai/The Mag'har.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; are a group of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; who have escaped the grasp of their various &lt;a href=\"slaver\"&gt;slaver&lt;/a&gt;s in Outland. They recently took possession of &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in the far south of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many other Broken, the Kurenai are trying their best to overcome their &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic taint. Nevertheless, despite their noble intent, the Kurenai are cautious toward all outsiders, who sometimes mistake the Kurenai for their wretched brethren. A number of Kurenai also dwell in Zangarmarsh at the &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, where they are trying to strengthen the ties between the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; and the Kurenai home city of Telaar. Yet the path of the Kurenai's destiny is long and dangerous, and many threats lurk on the winding road ahead... quite literally. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads of Zangarmarsh must be secured. The task will prove difficult, considering the marsh's abundance of mostly aggressive wildlife.\nSouth of Zangarmarsh lie the grassy plains of Nagrand, homeland of the orcs. Travelers following the northeastern roads of Nagrand will come upon a settlement of &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;brown-skinned orcs&lt;/a&gt;: a place called &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;. This village belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, a group of orcs who managed to escape any form of demonic corruption. Though they endured great change, the Mag'har have retained their traditional way of life. Nonetheless, the Mag'har are far from safe.\nAldor and Scryers.\n&lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; was once the draenei capital of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Its name means \"dwelling of light.\" When the Burning Legion &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; the orcs against the draenei, the fiercest battle was fought there. The draenei fought tooth and nail, but in the end, the city fell. The city was left in ruins and darkness until the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; arrived. The Sha'tar, whose name means \"born from light\", are the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who came to Outland to fight the demons of the Burning Legion. The naaru were drawn to the ruins of Shattrath City, where a small remnant of the draenei priesthood conducted its rites inside a ruined temple. The priesthood, known as the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, quickly regained its strength as word of the Sha'tar's arrival spread. Reconstruction of Shattrath was soon underway. It wouldn't be long, however, before the city came under attack once again.\nThis time, the attack came from the armies of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. A large &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; had been sent by Illidan's ally, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, to lay waste to the city. As the regiment of blood elves crossed the bridge, the Aldor's &lt;a href=\"exarch\"&gt;exarch&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s lined up to defend the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Then the unexpected happened: the blood elves laid down their weapons in front of the city's defenders. Their leader, a blood elf elder known as &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal\"&gt;Voren'thal&lt;/a&gt;, stormed into the Terrace of Light and demanded to speak to the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. As the naaru approached him, Voren'thal knelt and uttered the following words: \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\"\nLower City.\n&lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; is located on the underside of Shattrath in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Populated by the &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s from the many wars that have wracked Outland, it is home to a diverse array of beings who owe allegiance to no group. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can gain reputation by doing &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s located in Lower City itself, as well as aiding citizens of Lower City in other places, such as the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%20Caravan\"&gt;Refugee Caravan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Consortium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; has access to a vast collection of the most exotic treasures and artifacts.

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;s in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nAzeroth is a fractious and war-stricken world, and standing alone can be deadly. To survive and prosper, members of all races gather together along cultural and ideological lines. Each of these factions holds to a unique philosophy, and they often disagree with one another \u2013 violently. Yet, despite the danger, allegiance to a faction never goes unnoticed; those heroes who are willing to risk taking sides can expect handsome rewards. \nAvengers of Hyjal.\nInfuriated by the destruction wrought by the Lord of Flame, the Cenarion Circle seize the initiative, fighting back against Ragnaros and driving deep into the very heart of the Firelands.\nFor the first time since the Burning Legion's invasion during the Third War, Mount Hyjal and the World Tree Nordrassil stand at the edge of annihilation. This dire state has caused many brave individuals to converge on the sacred mountain to protect it from harm. These heroes, hailing from all walks of life, have joined with the druidic Cenarion Circle and its green dragonflight allies under the banner of the Guardians of Hyjal. As one, they have struggled against the raging elemental armies of Ragnaros the Firelord, who seek to burn Nordrassil to ashes.\nYet another united offensive has formed, much less concerned with the defensive maneuvers of the Guardians of Hyjal. This group, the Avengers of Hyjal, has instead focused on ending the threat of the Firelord once and for all by invading his own realm - the deadly, smoldering Firelands. While this effort might seem suicidal, the Avengers insist that if they don't act against Ragnaros while they have the opportunity, they may not have a world left to defend.\nThe majority of these fearless combatants have already stormed the Firelands and begun carving out a permanent encampment. There, the Avengers continue seizing objectives and battling elementals as well as the tainted Druids of the Flame, traitors who have rejected their commitment to the natural world in order to serve Ragnaros.\nThe Avengers of Hyjal have accumulated a number of invaluable accessories - cloaks, belts, rings, and trinkets - during their time in the Firelands. These potent items are certain to be of use to the Horde and Alliance heroes who have recently chosen to help the organization wage war against Ragnaros and his servants. The assistance of these mortal champions is crucial to the world's safety. If the Avengers' gambit fails, the Firelands' rampaging elementals will waste no time erupting into Azeroth and reducing the world to a molten wasteland.\nBaradin's Wardens.\nOnce led by Duke Reginald Baradin II, this fierce army has historic ties to the island stronghold of Tol Barad. They have joined the forces of the Alliance in an effort to repeal the Horde invaders and gain control of this strategic island.\nBaradin's Wardens are a motley collection of soldiers based on the island of Tol Barad. Though they bolster their ranks with mercenaries at many opportunities, several prominent members of Baradin's Wardens claim ancestry from Stromgarde, a human-led nation that battled against the Horde on the shores of Tol Barad in the past. Still others speak of years of service to the magi of Kul Tiras, claiming that they were charged with ensuring that the deadly prisoners locked away in the mystic Baradin Hold never again walk free on Azeroth.\nWhether these claims are simple bravado or truth remains to be seen, but the effect of invoking the bloody history of the island's guardians cannot be denied. Baradin's Wardens are fiercely dedicated to their mission.\nThese champions seek aid from anyone willing to cross swords with the Horde armies scattered throughout the island of Tol Barad. The favors they extend to their champions are equally militant: mighty battle standards, peerless weapons, and other combat aids, all of which they hope will serve their continued goal of controlling the prison island once more.\nDragonmaw Clan.\nThis wayward orc clan was once empowered by Deathwing himself to enslave red dragons, including Alexstrasza. Currently less numerous and powerful, the Dragonmaw make their home in the Twilight Highlands.\nThe orcs of the Dragonmaw clan have been a force of destruction since the moment their race set foot on Azeroth. During the Second War, they captured red dragons through the use of a dark artifact known as the Demon Soul; later, many of the clan traveled to Outland, where they came to serve Illidan the Betrayer, applying their knowledge of all things draconic to enslave that world's native nether dragons.\nHowever, the history of the Dragonmaw extends beyond their more recent depredations. In times past, they were as noble and proud as any orcish clan. Following the Cataclysm, Azeroth's situation has become increasingly dire, and the soldiers of the new Horde are now presented with an opportunity to redeem their old allies. Despite their past crimes, it is the will of the warchief that the once-maligned Dragonmaw join the Horde in battle once again.\nThose members of the Horde who endorse the Dragonmaw clan will find themselves rewarded with masterfully crafted pieces of armor and mystic trinkets that reflect the clan's history of domination.\nGuardians of Hyjal.\nFaced with the impending devastation of Mount Hyjal, the most powerful members of the Cenarion Circle have joined forces with their Emerald Dragonflight allies to fend off Ragnaros' elemental hordes and the Twilight's Hammer.\nThe immense Mount Hyjal has been under increased protection since it was the site of a great battle between Archimonde (a commander of the demonic Burning Legion) and the defenders of Azeroth. It's no longer the charge of any one particular race to protect the mountain; instead, that duty has fallen to an alliance between the Cenarion Circle and green dragonflight known as the Guardians of Hyjal.\nThe guardians have brought their veneration of the land and ancient demigods like the forest lord Cenarius to Hyjal in times of peace, but it's only now that their presence has become truly crucial. Ragnaros the Firelord and his army of minions have set the mountain aflame with their presence, and they will not rest until Hyjal is reduced to ash around them.\nThose heroes who would join with the guardians to heal the land and drive off the invading elementals and their cultist allies can count Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage and the green Dragon Aspect, Ysera, among their supporters, and they can add equipment born of the mountain and the World Tree Nordrassil to their arsenal.\nHellscream's Reach.\nHellscream's Reach is an elite Horde regiment comprised solely of veterans of multiple tours of duty. Handpicked by Garrosh himself, he has commanded them to take complete control of Tol Barad. Failure is not an option.\nThe handpicked members of Hellscream's Reach, named for Warchief Garrosh Hellscream, are among the most battle-hardened veterans of the Horde. Several have seen multiple tours of duty come and go, and their demeanors instantly communicate that they brook neither cowardice nor weariness. Their current objective, the prison island of Tol Barad, may be viciously contested by the Alliance, the site of truly potent magics, and home to some of the deadliest prisoners on Azeroth, but to the elite of the Reach, it's just another job.\nThose who aid Hellscream's Reach in their siege of Tol Barad will find that they have access to the elite soldiers' armory and the mighty blades that have been clutched by numerous champions of the Horde throughout its history of conflict.\nRamkahen.\nThe cat-like people of Ramkahen are the descendants of the Tol'vir, guardians of Uldum. Though they've lost their stone bodies, protecting the secrets of the titans is still a part of their rigid tradition.\nThe stalwart, cat-like Ramkahen people can claim a history truly unique on Azeroth: they are the descendants of an ancient race, the stone-skinned tol'vir shaped to guard the oases and tombs of the titans. The Ramkahen have long since lost their stone skin because of a curse laid upon them by the Old Gods, but they have held firm to their sacred mission, and spread throughout Uldum in the hope of protecting its ancient tombs and vaults from those who would defile them.\nWith Deathwing's reemergence into Azeroth, the Ramkahen have found themselves pitted against their closest cousins, the Neferset tol'vir, who serve Deathwing and his allies for the promise of a return to their ancient, stony forms. The Ramkahen still cling to their charge of defending Uldum, but they can do little for their ancestral land if they are annihilated, and so they prepare for war.\nThose who support the Ramkahen in their fight against the Neferset can earn arcane trinkets and garments created in the image of the titans themselves.\nThe Earthen Ring.\nThis gathering of the most powerful shaman of Azeroth seeks to maintain the balance between the world's elemental forces. Their main focus during the cataclysm has been to repair and stabilize the damage caused by Deathwing's arrival.\nThe organization known as the Earthen Ring is a collection of mighty shaman and other followers of the elements. Unlike its sinister adversary, the Twilight's Hammer cult, the Ring sees balance and harmony in the elements - not simply chaos and destruction.\nThe destructive properties of the elements are in full display following the events of the Cataclysm, and so the Earthen Ring has traveled to places as distant as the waters of Vashj'ir and the domain of Deepholm in the hopes of preventing or repairing the worst damages of Deathwing and his followers. The Ring's present goal-preventing the total destruction of Azeroth-seems impossibly broad, but it attracts followers from nearly every walk of life.\nThose who would assist the Earthen Ring will find themselves rewarded with items that reflect the wisdom and primal power of the elements. \nTherazane.\nThe elemental plane of earth, Deepholm, is ruled by Therazane and her children, the Stone Lords. After witnessing the devastation Deathwing and his followers caused her realm, Therazane treats all outsiders with open hostility.\nTherazane, also known as the Stonemother, is the elemental lord of earth, an ancient and immensely powerful counterpart of Ragnaros, Al'Akir, and Neptulon. Unlike the realms of Al'Akir and Ragnaros, however, her domain-that of the earth, rock, and mountains-has put her in immediate conflict with Deathwing, whose emergence from Deepholm has pushed her stony realm to the point of collapse.\nThough Therazane has no love for mortals, she recognizes the role that these races might play in restoring Deepholm and evicting the Twilight's Hammer, who have flocked to her kingdom to bask in the glory of Deathwing's former sanctum.\nHeroes who seek the aid of the Stonemother will find that her favor can confer many blessings; among them are powerful augmenting stones borne up from Deepholm itself to strengthen the armor of those who serve Therazane's will.\nWildhammer Clan.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves are known for their near-reckless courage as well as their unsurpassed gryphon-riding skills. After losing their home of Grim Batol to a Dark Iron Curse, they've spread their dwellings around the Twilight Highlands.\nSince they were driven from the keep of Grim Batol, the nature-dwelling Wildhammer dwarves have resided in isolated territories and prized their independence above all else. Yet, when their Bronzebeard cousins and their Alliance allies have found themselves threatened by orcs or undead, the gruff and free-willed Wildhammers have stepped in to help out.\nIt is only recently that the Wildhammer clan has found itself facing the same problems as the rest of Azeroth at precisely the same time. The rampaging of black dragons and maniacal cultists near the Wildhammers' homes in the Twilight Highlands is simply an echo of the devastation occurring in every other corner of the world. As Azeroth quakes, Magni Bronzebeard, the ruler of the mightiest dwarven city in the world, has been rendered unable to govern his people by an ancient ritual.\nNot even the reclusive Wildhammers can ignore these signs. They have pledged themselves to the Alliance, and those who champion their cause can avail themselves of mighty enchanted armors and relics unlike any forged by city dwarves."}

These articles overviewed the playable classes available in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to \"\". The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe articles also laid out class abilities, armor types, roles, races and other basic gameplay information about each class. However, that information is omitted in this copy.\nArticle Content.\nWhat type of hero will you be? This is one of the first questions you'll answer when playing World of Warcraft. After deciding what race to play, each character will choose one of several classes. Each race has its own list of class options available to it. Throughout their entire careers, characters will be able to learn from a pool of over 1000 spells and skills. A character's class will help determine which spells and skills he or she can master; this page lists just a few for each class. Below you will find information detailing each of the classes you'll be able to play in World of Warcraft, including a few examples of the numerous spells and skills available to each class.\nDruids.\nDruids are the keepers of the world and masters of nature with a diverse array of abilities. They are powerful healers, capable of curing poisons and raising fallen comrades in the thick of battle. Druids also command nature's wrath, calling down ranged blasts of energy, summoning swarms of insects, or entangling their foes in the earth. But druids are also masters of the wild, able to shapeshift into a great bear, cat, or even sea lion, gaining their powers in combat or travel. Druids are a diverse class with a variety of playstyles, capable of filling any role.\nThe Druid gives players several play style options. A Druid in normal form is a caster that can fight with spells or weapons. In Bear form the Druid becomes a Warrior with Rage. While in Cat form the Druid becomes a Rogue with Energy and stealth. The Druid can also transform into two other special animal forms. With its ability to heal itself and fellow characters, the Druid can also take on the role of a Priest. A Druid is not as versatile in its abilities as a Priest is, lacking the spells Power Word: Shield, but is otherwise a very capable healer.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nHunters.\nHunters are deadly marksmen, capable of bringing their enemies down from a distance with bows or rifles. Skilled survivalists, they can track enemies or lay traps to damage and entrap their foes. Hunters also possess a primal connection to the beasts of Azeroth, capable of taming and training them to keep as loyal guardians. Wearing light to medium armor, hunters can also dual wield weapons in combat, fighting beside their pets in battle.\nThe Hunter is a vicious damage dealer. With their ability to pull extremely well and hit monsters hard from far away, they certainly help take down monsters more quickly. Their pets add to the damage count and can aid somewhat in managing monster aggro. The variety of traps allows the Hunter to control crowds to an extent, as well. The combination of their extreme range, decent damage, and trap capability, Hunters are the perfect pullers for any group.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nMages.\nMages wield the elements of fire, frost, and the arcane to destroy or neutralize their enemies. They are a robed class that excels at dealing massive damage from afar, casting elemental bolts at a single target, or raining destruction down upon their enemies in a wide area of effect. Mages can also augment their allies' spell-casting powers, summon food or drink to restore their friends, and even travel across the world in an instant by opening arcane portals to distant lands.\nWhen seeking someone to introduce monsters to a world of pain, the Mage is a good choice. With their elemental and arcane attacks, it's a safe bet something they can do won't be resisted by your chosen enemy. Damage is the name of the Mage game, and they do it well. Their arsenal includes some powerful crowd control spells, also, giving them the ability to keep hordes at bay -- in fact, these abilities can be used on the most common creatures in the game, thus making them extremely valuable for this purpose.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nPaladins.\nGuardians of the Holy Light, paladins bolster their allies with holy auras and blessing to protect their friends from harm and enhance their powers. Wearing heavy armor, they can withstand terrible blows in the thickest battles while healing their wounded allies and resurrecting the slain. In combat, they can wield massive two-handed weapons, stun their foes, destroy undead and demons, and judge their enemies with holy vengeance. Paladins are a defensive class designed to outlast their opponents.\nThe Paladin is a mix of a melee fighter and a secondary spell caster. The Paladin is ideal for groups due to the Paladin's healing, Blessings, and other abilities. Paladins can have one active aura per Paladin on each party member and use specific Blessings for specific players. Paladins are pretty hard to kill, thanks to their assortment of defensive abilities. The Paladin can also heal with Holy Light, unlike other combat classes. The Paladin is an Undead specific fighter as well, with several abilities designed to be used against the Undead.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nPriests.\nPriests are the masters of healing and preservation, restoring their wounded allies, shielding them in battle, and even resurrecting their fallen comrades. While they have a variety of protective and enhancement spells to bolster their allies, priests can also wreak terrible vengeance on their enemies, using the powers of shadow or holy light to destroy them. They are a diverse and powerful class, highly desirable in any group, capable of fulfilling multiple roles.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nRogues.\nRogues are a lightly armored melee class capable of dealing massive damage to their enemies in a flurry of attacks. They are masters of stealth and assassination, passing by enemies unseen and striking from the shadows, then escaping from combat in the blink of an eye. Rogues can also use poisons that damage or cripple their enemies, reducing their effectiveness in battle. Groups will find rogues valuable, for not only do they deal massive damage, but they can open locked doors or chests, and disarm hidden traps as well.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nShaman.\nShaman are the spiritual leaders of their tribes and clans. They are masters of the elements, using spells and totems that heal or enhance their allies in battle while unleashing the fury of the elements upon their foes. Shamans can wear medium armor, and even wield massive two-handed weapons in combat. They are a versatile class that can wade into battle, restoring their allies while hurling elemental bolts of lightning at their enemies.\nThe old phrase \"jack of all trades, master of none\" is an excellent way to describe the Shaman; they are the only real \"hybrid\" class in World of Warcraft. While they do not excel at any one aspect of their repertoire, they function passing well when performing most tasks called upon by a party. Need a support healer? Looking for a secondary tank? After another damage-dealer? Have an empty slot that needs someone to support the group in general? The Shaman can provide. They have a number of utility spells as well that help make life easier for any party.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nWarlocks.\nWarlocks are masters of shadow, flame, and demonic power. They are a robed class that excels at plaguing their enemies with disease or curses, hurling bolts of fire or shadow energy across the battlefield, and summoning demons to aid them in combat. While warlocks are powerful casters that deal damage from a distance, their demonic powers can also protect or support their allies in battle, or even summon other players from across the world using ritual magic to conjure portals.\nWarlocks have both powerful damage spells (primarily dealing over time) and debuff spells that work well in conjunction with each other and with the abilities of their group mates. They have Curses for many occasions; in fact, they can easily be considered the best debuffers in the game. Their pets, too, help with the damage dealing and grant the Warlock extra abilities to put to use. They can also control crowds well with Seduction and Banish, and provide limited support in the form of their summoned stones.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nWarriors.\nWarriors can be a raging berserker or an iron-clad juggernaut, capable of withstanding tremendous attacks while protecting their allies from harm. They have a wide variety of attacks that do everything from cripple their enemies, to dealing massive amounts of damage in a single retaliatory blow, and enhancing their allies' fighting ability with battle shouts. They excel at fighting multiple opponents at once, gaining rage from every blow dealt or received to unleash their attacks. Warriors are a versatile class with a variety of play-styles to choose from.\nThe Warrior can be a defensive, shielded tank, a damage-dealing powerhouse, or a mixture of the two. Their abilities obviously pertain to the art of close combat; their stances carry with them different moves for different situations and party setups. All in all, the Warrior is one of the prime candidates to capture and hold the attention of creatures while they die to sword and spell.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nDeathKnight.\nThe fearsome death knight, World of Warcraft's first Hero class, is not your average adventurer seeking to prove his or her worth on Azeroth's fields of battle. No longer servants of the Lich King, they begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries, heavily armed and armored and possessing an arsenal of deadly and forbidden magic learned in the Lich King's thrall.\n[\"Class Information\"]\nReferences.\nThis page and the articles it contained can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20101203151841/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "725435", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=725435", "title": "Game Guide/Classes (2010)", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Classes\", an official article from the 2010 BattleNet World of Warcraft Site. These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nThis new and improved class guide contains more information about each of World of Warcraft\u2019s classes with a description of their abilities, playstyles, and history in the world of Azeroth.\nWarrior.\nFor as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons.\nThe warrior\u2019s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel.\nEvery dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war.\nPaladin.\nThis is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead.\nReady to serve, paladins can defend their allies with sword and shield, or they can wield massive two-handed weapons against their enemies. The Light grants paladins additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.\nPaladins are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the Light would shine upon. The Light radiates from paladins, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power. \nHunter.\nFrom an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. Masters of their environment, they are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies.\nThese expert marksmen drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow or rifle. Thanks to their pinpoint timing, hunters are able to fire their ranged weapons quickly \u2013 even at enemies who close to melee range with them.\nThe art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.\nRogue.\nFor rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground.\nRogues can dip their weapons in paralyzing toxins that render foes unable to defend themselves. These silent stalkers wear leather armor so they can move unencumbered, ensuring that they land the first strike.\nWith the rogue\u2019s poisons and speed, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow.\nPriest.\nPriests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders.\nThese masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest\u2019s command can also be turned against foes, smiting them with holy fury.\nAs light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them.\nDeath Knight.\nWhen the Lich King\u2019s control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose.\nFrost sharpens their strikes; blood fortifies their bodies; and undeath allows them to erupt in unholy rage in the heat of battle. A thousand atrocities are etched in the eyes of every death knight, and foes who gaze into them too long will feel the warmth pulled from their bodies, replaced with cold steel.\nShaman.\nShaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman\u2019s allies or punish those who threaten them.\nThese masters of the elements can also call upon elemental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder.\nThe experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile heroes and valued members of any group.\nMage.\nStudents gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze.\nMasters of ice can command blizzards that tear into flesh and limit movement. Should enemies manage to survive this assault, the mage can shrink them into harmless sheep in the blink of an eye.\nPowerful magi can even generate enhancements and portals, assisting allies by sharpening their minds and transporting them instantly across the world.\nWarlock.\nIn the face of demonic power, most heroes see death. Warlocks see only opportunity. Dominance is their aim, and they have found a path to it in the dark arts. These voracious spellcasters summon demonic minions to fight beside them. At first, they command only the service of imps, but as a warlock\u2019s knowledge grows, seductive succubi, loyal voidwalkers, and horrific felhunters join the dark sorcerer\u2019s ranks to wreak havoc on anyone who stands in their master\u2019s way.\nWarlocks can ignite distant enemies in searing flame, send them fleeing in terror and pain, or afflict them with corrupting diseases and curses that steal the victim\u2019s vitality.\nThese practitioners of the profane are feared across Azeroth, and many who have felt their wrath now prefer to fight alongside a warlock than against one.\nMonk.\nWhen the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.\nMasters of bare-handed combat, monks never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their hands to defend against their enemies. Although most widely known to the outside world for their fearsome jabs and flying kicks, they refuse to limit themselves to a single method of combat. Many monks prefer instead to \u201csoak it up\u201d and seem to revel in the intoxicating effect of absorbing blow after blow while their companions press the attack. Other monks specialize in calling upon the restorative power of the mists to balance the good and bad energy within people, returning them to good health and fortune. \nDruid.\nDruids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature\u2019s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.\nDruids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. They are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth.\nAs master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, storm crow, or sea lion with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment\u2019s notice.\nAdded to Game Guide In Legion.\nDemon Hunter.\nDemon hunters, disciples of Illidan Stormrage, uphold a dark legacy, one that frightens their allies and enemies alike. The Illidari embrace fel and chaotic magics\u2014energies that have long threatened the world of Azeroth\u2014believing them necessary to challenge the Burning Legion. Wielding the powers of demons they\u2019ve slain, they develop demonic features that incite revulsion and dread in fellow elves.\nDemon hunters ritually blind themselves in exchange for spectral sight that enables them to better sense their prey. This enhanced awareness, together with their great agility and magical prowess, makes demon hunters unpredictable adversaries. An Illidari\u2019s quarry has much to fear.\nAdded to Game Guide In Dragonflight.\nEvoker.\nWielders of Draconic Power\nDracthyr Evokers were created to wield the magic of all five dragonflights, and seek to forge their own path in Azeroth. They can empower their draconic abilities through magic, charging up their attacks and unleashing them at the right moment to devastating effect, and use their superior mobility to dart in and out of the fray as the situation demands.\nEvokers possess special Empowered abilities that they can use to change the strength of a spell or ability as it is cast. Wise Evokers take advantage of those empowered spells and fight from a moderate range, demolishing foes with fiery breath attacks or restoring allies to keep them in the fight."}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt;s in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nAzeroth is a fractious and war-stricken world, and standing alone can be deadly. To survive and prosper, members of all races gather together along cultural and ideological lines. Each of these factions holds to a unique philosophy, and they often disagree with one another \u2013 violently. Yet, despite the danger, allegiance to a faction never goes unnoticed; those heroes who are willing to risk taking sides can expect handsome rewards. \nArgent Dawn.\nAn organization focused on protecting Azeroth from the threat of the Scourge. Strongholds of the Argent Dawn can be found in the Eastern and Western Plaguelands. \nBloodsail Buccaneers.\nThese bloodthirsty corsairs are the bane of many a merchant in the high seas. Sworn enemies of Booty Bay. \nBrood of Nozdormu.\nThe descendants of the Bronze Dragonflight are the guardians of time and care little for the mortal races. \nCenarion Circle.\nThe druids of Cenarion Circle are guardians of nature and make their home in tranquil Moonglade. \nDarkmoon Faire.\nA carnival that showcases the weird and the extraordinary, located on a mysterious island only accessible for the first week of every month. \nGelkis Clan Centaur.\nThese centaur have made their home in the southern region of Desolace. Mortal enemies of the Magram Centaur. \nHydraxian Waterlords.\nThese elementals have made their home on the islands east of Azshara. Sworn enemies of the armies of Ragnaros. \nMagram Clan Centaur.\nThese centaur have made their home in the eastern region of Desolace. Mortal enemies of the Gelkis Centaur. \nRavenholdt.\nThis guild of thieves and assassins welcomes only those of extraordinary prowess into its fold. Sworn rivals of the Syndicate. \nShen'dralar.\nA remnant of the once powerful elves living in Dire Maul, yet still wise and knowledgeable about great secrets. \nSyndicate.\nA primarily human criminal organization that operates mostly out of the Alterac Mountains and Hillsbrad Foothills. \nThorium Brotherhood.\nThe dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood epitomize excellence in craftsmanship and are bent on unlocking the secrets of Blackrock Mountain. \nTimbermaw Hold.\nAs the last uncorrupted furbolg tribe, the Timbermaw seek to preserve their spiritual ways and end the suffering of their brethren. \nWintersaber Trainers.\nThis small group of reclusive night elves raises and trains wintersabers in the Winterspring area. \nZandalar Tribe.\nThese trolls have come to Yojamba Isle in an effort to recruit help against the resurrected Blood God and his Atal'ai Priests in Zul'Gurub. \nAlliance.\nDarnassus.\nThis Alliance capital is populated by Night Elves and is located in the Island of Teldrassil. Ruled by the Priestess of the Moon, Tyrande Whisperwind.\nHigh atop the boughs of the great tree Teldrassil lies the wondrous city of Darnassus, the new refuge of the reclusive Night Elves. Druids, Hunters, and Warriors alike make their homes among the rows of woodcrafted lodges and delicately tended groves. The Temple of the Moon rises like a shining beacon above the trees, flanked by the colonnaded Hall of Justice, where the vigilant Sentinels gather to safeguard the land. Ruled by the high Priestess, Tyrande Whisperwind, Darnassus stands as a tranquil testament to all that the Night Elves hold sacred. A city in tune with the rush and flow of nature, Darnassus was built along the shores of a large lake, with elegant bridges spanning its crystalline waters. Elsewhere, the falling leaves of the forest carpet the soft pathways of the city.\nThose who earn the esteem of Darnassus also earn the right to sit astride the traditional mounts of the night elves -- the fierce and dedicated nightsaber cats.\nExodar.\nThe naaru vessel that brought the draenei to Azeroth. Though stranded in the Azuremyst Isles, it acts as a home city for this noble race.\nThe massive dimensional vessel known as the Exodar houses the draenei on Azeroth, the result of a reclamation effort after its crash landing on the shores of the Azuremyst Isles. After seizing the vessel in a daring escape from the modular fortress of dimensional vessels now known as Tempest Keep, the Exodar appeared in the skies of Kalimdor one fateful night - where it made its dramatic plunge to the islands below. Now, the noble draenei have established their new base of operations in the remains of the fortress-like craft.\nThose who aid the Draenei in establishing themselves on Azeroth can earn permission to ride their mighty Elekks.\nGilneas.\nThe people of Gilneas are a nation of survivors. Having walled themselves off from the rest of humanity, they must now face new threats from within.\nAfter the fall of the Greymane Wall, which had kept the nation of Gilneas isolated from the rest of Azeroth, most of the surviving population established themselves elsewhere in Azeroth thanks to an offer of allegiance and aid from the night elves of the Alliance. The worgen curse still plagues Gilnean refugees, but, even as they wear the forms of beasts, their shared history and pride have prevented the total collapse of their besieged nation. Gilneans now dwell in Darnassus, Felwood, and Duskwood, among other locales, and their king, Genn Greymane, stands at the side of the leader of Stormwind, Varian Wrynn.\nThose who earn the faith and confidence of the proud Gilneans can avail themselves of some of the finery their nation is known for: capes, tabards, bags, and more.\nGnomeregan.\nThe former denizens of Gnomeregan, now living in New Tinkertown and in league with the Alliance.\nAfter their home was devastated by troggs and the release of toxic radiation, the denizens of Gnomeregan fled, finding sanctuary among the dwarves of Ironforge. Today, the gnomes have returned to reclaim their former capital, and they've begun by claiming a swath of Dun Morogh at the gates of Gnomeregan, which they've dubbed New Tinkertown. They continue pursuing their racial predilections for technology, but their considerable talents are now geared even more towards reclaiming the city they've lost.\nHeroes who are able to gain the esteem of the sons and daughters of Gnomeregan can employ one of the gnomes' most ingenious inventions-the mechanostrider-as a mount.\nIronforge.\nThis Alliance capital is the pride of the Dun Morogh dwarves. Home to King Magni.\nWhile many Dwarven strongholds fell during the Second War, the mighty city of Ironforge--nestled in the wintry peaks of Dun Morogh--was never breached by the invading Horde. A monument to the Dwarves' expertise in shaping rock and stone, Ironforge was constructed in the heart of the mountain itself: an expansive underground city of craftsmen, explorers, miners and Warriors. Although the Alliance is faced with new challenges each day, the Dwarves of Ironforge, led by the Council of Three Hammers, hope to forge a new future in the world.\nDwarves have historically traveled Azeroth astride mighty war rams, and they are willing to share the reins of these creatures with heroes who build a strong reputation in Ironforge.\nStormwind.\nOne of the last bastions of human power, this Alliance capital is ruled by the prodigal king, Varian Wrynn.\nThe city of Stormwind stands as the last bastion of Human power in Azeroth. Rebuilt after the Second War, Stormwind is a marvel of Human design and engineering. Stormwind's guards keep the peace within the city's walls, while the returned king, Varian Wrynn, rules from his mighty keep. The Trade District bustles with wares from across the continent and beyond, while warriors of every sort can be found wandering the streets of Old Town. Unaffected by the ravages of the Scourge in the north, Stormwind still faces its own threats, both from without and from within.\nHeroes whose valor is known in Stormwind can call upon the city's famed horses to serve as their loyal steeds.\nAlliance Forces.\nSilverwing Sentinels.\nStaunch defenders of Ashenvale, locked in battle against the Warsong Outriders in Warsong Gulch. \nStormpike Guard.\nThe Stormpike Dwarves have set up residence in Alterac Valley, where they're locked in battle with the Frostwolf Orcs. \nThe League of Arathor.\nThe League of Arathor seeks to reclaim the lost land of Arathi Basin for their benefactors in Stormwind. \nHorde.\nBilgewater Cartel.\nRun by the ruthless Trade Prince Gallywix, the Bilgewater Cartel is the most powerful trading company on the Isle of Kezan. From their headquarters at Bilgewater Port, the cartel dominates trade all over the South Seas.\nIn general, the goblin cartels of Azeroth prefer to remain neutral profiteers in the conflicts that rage throughout the kingdoms of other races, providing aid and equipment to multiple sides and raking in as much money as they can with minimal involvement. The Bilgewater Cartel is different - its members see opportunity in commitment, and, so, when the chance came to join the Horde, they hurried to offer their aid. Or, at least, that's the story their trade prince tells - rumors abound that Gallywix was pressured to join the Horde after a defeat at the hands of its former warchief, Thrall.\nThe cartel's home base was once Bilgewater Port on the Isle of Kezan, but the vast majority of its operations are now concentrated in Orgrimmar's slums and Bilgewater Harbor in Azshara.\nThose in good standing with the cartel can purchase and learn to ride its wondrous high-speed trikes.\nDarkspear Trolls.\nThis tribe of exiled trolls has joined forces with Thrall and the Horde. They now call Durotar their home, which they share with their orc allies.\nThe exiled Darkspear trolls joined forces with the Horde after their tribe was rescued from Zar'jira, the sea witch of the Darkspear isles by then-warchief Thrall. Though they shared Orgrimmar with the orcs for several years, the Darkspears have recently retaken their former home from the forces of the witch doctor Zalazane, and they've returned in numbers to the forested islands.\nThe Darkspears can be found most prominently on the Echo Isles, in Sen'jin Village, and in Orgrimmar. They hold Horde-aligned outposts and cities throughout Azeroth and Outland.\nThe Darkspears offer training in riding their swift and steadfast jungle raptor mounts to those who become strongly allied with them.\nOrgrimmar.\nFounded by Thrall, this Horde capital city is home to many of the proud orc clans of Durotar.\nNamed in honor of the legendary Orgrim Doomhammer, Orgrimmar was founded to be the capital city of the Orcs' new homeland. Built within a huge, winding canyon in the harsh land of Durotar, Orgrimmar stands as one of the mightiest Warrior cities in the world. Behind Orgrimmar's immense walls, elderly Shamans patiently share their knowledge with the Horde's newest generation of leaders, while Warriors spar in the gladiatorial arena, honing their skills in preparation for the trials that await them in this dangerous land.\nThe orcs of Orgrimmar reward well-regarded members of the Horde with access to their riding wolves.\nSilvermoon City.\nThe capital of Quel'Thalas, home of the blood elves. Though nearly destroyed by Arthas' attack on the Sunwell, Silvermoon is once again a thriving city.\nThe crown jewel of the blood elves is their capital of Silvermoon City, nestled in the Eversong Woods in their ancestral lands of Quel'Thalas. The beauty of the spires and thoroughfares of Silvermoon stand in stark contrast to the Dead Scar, the tainted path that Arthas tore through the city in his quest for power. Though nearly destroyed by Arthas' attack on the Sunwell, Silvermoon is once again a thriving city - although the permanent devastation to their capital serves as a grim reminder of an uncertain future for the blood elves.\nAny who manage to prove their worth to the blood elves of Silvermoon can call upon their trained hawkstrider mounts.\nThunder Bluff.\nBaine Bloodhoof leads his people, the proud Tauren, from this mighty Horde capital.\nThe great city of Thunder Bluff lies atop a series of mesas that overlook the verdant grasslands of Mulgore. The once nomadic Tauren recently established the city as a center for trade caravans, traveling craftsmen and artisans of every kind. The proud city also stands as a refuge for the brave hunters who stalk their dangerous prey through the plains of Mulgore and its surrounding areas. Long bridges of rope and wood span the chasms between the mesas, topped with tents, longhouses, colorfully painted totems, and spirit lodges. The mighty chief, Baine Bloodhoof, watches over the bustling city, ensuring that the united Tauren tribes live in peace and security.\nThose members of the Horde who earn the trust and support of Thunder Bluff can ride their domesticated kodos into battle.\nUndercity.\nLed by Sylvanas Windrunner, the Forsaken have joined a tenuous alliance with the Horde and established this capital in the vast depths under the Ruins of Lordaeron.\nFar beneath the ruined capital city of Lordaeron, the royal crypts have been turned into a bastion of evil and undeath. Originally intended by Prince Arthas to be the Scourge's seat of power, the budding \"Undercity\" was abandoned when Arthas was recalled to aid the Lich King in distant Northrend. In Arthas's absence, the Dark Lady, Sylvanas Windrunner, led the rebel Forsaken to the Undercity, and claimed it for her own. Since taking up residence, the Forsaken have worked to complete the Undercity's construction by dredging the twisted maze of catacombs, tombs, and dungeons that Arthas began.\nAdventurers who grow to wield significant influence with Undercity are permitted to ride the tireless skeletal horses favored by the Forsaken.\nHorde Forces.\nFrostwolf Clan.\nThe Frostwolf Clan seeks to drive out the dwarves of the Stormpike Expedition from Alterac Valley. \nThe Defilers.\nThe Defilers seek to claim Arathi Basin's valuable resources for the Horde. \nWarsong Outriders.\nFierce orcs of the Warsong Clan, locked in battle against the Silverwing Sentinels in Warsong Gulch. \nSteamwheedle Cartel.\nBooty Bay.\nThis booming coastal city is run by Baron Revilgaz of the Blackwater Raiders. Mortal enemies of the Bloodsail Buccaneers and part of the Steamwheedle Cartel. \nEverlook.\nThis trading post is run by the goblins of the Steamwheedle Cartel and it sits in the crossroads of Winterspring's main trade routes. \nGadgetzan.\nCapital of the Steamwheedle Cartel and home to goblinhood's finest engineers, alchemists and merchants. \nRatchet.\nPart of the Steamwheedle Cartel, this goblin city provides a neutral haven for those that wish to trade goods and services in the Barrens.

These articles overviewed the classic reputations available in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to \"\". The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe articles also laid out vendor rewards, quests, and tips. However, that information is omitted in this copy.\nArticle Content.\nIn Azeroth, players will encounter many different factions throughout the world. By completing certain quests or killing certain creatures, players are able to gain favor with some of these factions. Gaining reputation with certain factions allows players to purchase items or undertake quests that are unavailable to other players.\nArgent Dawn.\nSome say that it is always darkest just before the dawn. Whenever darkness falls, the light of hope will drive away the shadows; wherever the forces of evil work in secret, the brave men and women of the Argent Dawn will be there to thwart their dark designs. The Argent Dawn is an organization that makes no distinction between Alliance or Horde, but instead tries to unite the people of Azeroth in the fight against evil. Though the agents of the Argent Dawn are always wary of the sinister and the wicked in all their various disguises, they have recently focused their efforts on a region of Azeroth where evil has run unchecked for a long time: the Plaguelands of Lordaeron. Detachments of the Argent Dawn are guarding the entrances to the Plaguelands at the Bulwark between the Tirisfal Glades and the western Plaguelands, and at Chillwind Point, a narrow pass leading south from the Western Plaguelands to the Alterac Mountains. They have also gained a foothold deep in the eastern Plaguelands at the Light's Hope Chapel, east of Corin's Crossing.\nThe Argent Dawn is always looking for more fighters to join their cause, and the numbers of those wearing the Argent Dawn Commission, the organization's insignia, are growing each day. Adventurers seeking to aid the Argent Dawn by rooting out the Scourge's corruption in the Plaguelands and taking on the Lich King's powerful servants in the Scholomance and Stratholme will be well rewarded; the organization has many powerful enchanters among their ranks who craft special enhancements that provide the wearer with added protection against all forms of magic attacks. The Argent Dawn also offers those who have proven their dedication to their cause insight into their craftsmen's designs, enabling these adventurers to craft the armors the Argent Dawn created in their ongoing campaign against evil.\n[\"Vendor Rewards, Armaments of the Dawn, Craftsman Recipies, and Tips\"]\nBrood of Nozdormu.\nIn the lives of most mortals, time is nothing more than a simple hourglass, its sands quietly trickling away. Only few ever realize that in truth, time rages like a storm, untamed and chaotic. When the Titans first descended on Azeroth, vanquishing the Old Gods and bringing order to the world, the Highfather of the Pantheon himself empowered the great dragon Nozdormu with some of his own cosmic powers, enabling the dragon to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. And so, the stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One. Ever since then, Nozdormu's Brood has guarded the timestream from all who would seek to disrupt its flow, guided by the Timeless One's wise, all-knowing counsel.\nNow, the bronze dragon Anachronos has returned outside the Caverns of Time in the Tanaris desert, the Bronze Dragonflight's home and province. Events have been set in motion that will shape the future of all of Azeroth, as the attention of the Brood of Nozdormu is focused on Ahn'Qiraj, the fortress city of the Qiraji. It is there that those who are brave enough to heed the dragon's call should travel. A terrible darkness is building up beyond the Scarab Wall, enough to give pause even to the Timeless One himself. The dragons are rallying their champions to descend into the nightmarish hives beneath Ahn'Qiraj and to finish what they have begun.\nThe fated hour draws near...\n[\"Quest Rewards, and Tips\"]\nCenarion Circle.\nWar is brewing in the distant lands of Silithus. All over the world, men and women are gearing up for one final push into the heart of the Qiraji empire to end the threat which has been lying in wait, barely contained behind the barrier erected by the Night Elven druids and the mighty dragon Anachronos during the climactic battle at the end of the War of the Shifting Sands. Ever since that fateful day, the members of the Cenarion Circle have kept a close watch on the wastes from their base at Cenarion Hold at the center of northern Silithus. There, the Night Elven and Tauren disciples of the magnificent demigod Cenarius have been waiting for the time when a hero would step forward to unleash the might of all the mortal races against the sinister Qiraji and their innumerable legions of Silithid minions. But the druids have not been idle during their long watch; they have crafted formidable weapons, armors and enchanted ornaments to assist all those who will brave the terrors of Ahn'Qiraj. Adventurers who have proven their worth in battle against the Qiraji forces beyond the Scarab Wall will be granted access to the ancient order's arsenal.\nAt last, the long watch has ended - the hero has risen, to mend that which was broken, to unite those who were divided. But the true test is yet to come. When the gates of Ahn'Qiraj open, will the mortal races stand united once again and face the onrushing terror\ufffd or will they fade silently into the darkness that has risen once again in the distant lands of Silithus?\n[\"Vendor Rewards, Field Duty Quests, Class Quest Rewards, and Tips\"]\nDarkmoon Faire.\nA gathering of the exotic from around the world and beyond, Silas Darkmoon has brought together the Darkmoon Faire as a celebration of the wondrous and mysterious found in Azeroth. While the Faire spends most of its time in parts unknown, they do stop by some major cities each month. The Faire rotates between Terokkar Forest, Elwynn Forest, and Mulgore, in that order. You can consult the Events Calendar for the current schedule\nWhen the Faire is on its way, barkers will stop by Shattrath City, Orgrimmar, or Ironforge to announce its arrival. The Faire's workers begin setting up at midnight, three days prior to when the Darkmoon Faire opens. Upon commencing, the faire will begin early in the morning and last for seven days.\n[\"Gameplay Trailer, Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain, Screenshots, Rewards, Fortune Teller\"]\nThorium Brotherhood.\nThe Searing Gorge is home to a group of exceptionally stout dwarves who have split from the Dark Iron clan. On the cliffs overlooking the region called the Cauldron, in the far north of the Searing Gorge, the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood have established a base of operations, Thorium Point. From here, they keep a close eye on the Dark Iron dwarves' activities in the Searing Gorge and beyond. Adventurers seeking out Thorium Point will find that the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood hold great rewards for those who aid them in their neverending struggle against their former brethren.\nThe Thorium Brotherhood comprises many exceptionally talented craftsmen, and the blacksmiths of the Brotherhood are rumored to be among the finest Azeroth has ever seen. They possess the knowledge required to make the arms and armaments of Ragnaros, the Fire Lord, but lack the manpower to obtain the materials required for the crafting. It is rumored that one member of the Thorium Brotherhood has been empowered to trade the dwarves' fabled recipes and plans with those who can prove their loyalty to the Brotherhood. Of course, proving one's loyalty at some point may include venturing to the heart of the Molten Core, the domain of Ragnaros, the Fire Lord himself, to supply the dwarves with the rare raw materials found there. A daunting task, no doubt, but gaining access to the Thorium Brotherhood's secrets should prove to be a reward well worth the effort.\n[\"Vendor Rewards, and Tips\"]\nTimbermaw Hold.\nWhen the corruption of the Burning Legion crept into the sacred forests of Kalimdor, it was the creatures of the wild who first felt its monstrous power. Once gentle animals were transformed into abominable, rabid killers; their flesh rent and their spirits desecrated, they quickly succumbed to the demons' influence. Soon after, the furbolgs, the ursine children of the forest, suffered the same fate, as their entire species was driven mad by the surrounding corruption. However, amidst the chaos and the madness, one furbolg tribe escaped the darkness that had fallen on Kalimdor. In the safety of Timbermaw Hold, the furbolgs of the Timbermaw tribe weathered the storm, yet they were forced to watch helplessly as the forest they had loved so much was slowly turned into a twisted, festering perversion of its former self. When the spirits of the forest spoke to them no more, the Timbermaw knew that their home was gone... possibly, forever. The corruption had sunk in deep, so that even long after Illidan the Betrayer had consumed the source of the corruption, a powerful warlock artifact called the Skull of Gul'dan, and vanquished the demons' leader Tichondrius, the taint on the woods still remained.\nWith the Burning Legion defeated, the Timbermaw furbolgs have recently taken their first, careful steps outside of the safety of Timbermaw Hold. They are wary of all strangers, fearing that they may mistake them for their corrupted brethren and attack. However, the Timbermaw are painfully aware that they will not last on their own; adventurers who seek out Timbermaw Hold in northern Felwood and prove themselves as friends of the Timbermaw will learn that the furbolgs value their friends above all else. Though they possess no fine jewels or any worldly riches, the Timbermaw's shamanistic tradition is still strong. They know much about the art of crafting armors from animal hides, and they are more than happy to share their healing talismans with friends of their tribe. The Timbermaw's main concerns are putting an end to their corrupted brethren's suffering and finding a cure to heal the wounds the corruption of Felwood has inflicted upon the land, so that one day, the ancient forests will once again resound with the peaceful chants and the soft laughter of the children of the forest.\n[\"Vendor Rewards, Quest Rewards - Exalted, and Tips\"]\nZandalar Tribe.\nThe Zandalarians were the earliest known trolls, the first tribe from which all tribes originated.\nOver time two distinct troll empires emerged- the Amani and the Gurubashi. They existed for thousands of years until the coming of the Night Elves, who warred with them and eventually drove both empires into exile.\nFollowing the Sundering, the defeated Gurubashi grew ever more desperate to eke out a living. Searching for a means to survive, they enlisted the aid of the savage Blood God Hakkar, also known as the Soulflayer. Hakkar grew into a merciless oppressor who demanded daily sacrifices from his devotees, and so in time the Gurubashi turned on their dark master. The strongest tribes (including the Zandalar) banded together to defeat Hakkar and his loyal troll priests, the Atal'ai. The united tribes narrowly defeated the Blood God and cast out the Atal'ai... despite their victory, however, the Gurubashi Empire soon fell.\nIn recent years the exiled Atal'ai priests have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient and once-deserted capital of the Gurubashi Empire, Zul'Gurub. Unfortunately, the priests have met with success in their quest to call forth Hakkar\u2014 reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins.\nAnd so the Zandalar tribe has arrived on the shores of Azeroth to battle Hakkar once again. But the Blood God has grown increasingly powerful, bending several tribes to his will and even commanding the avatars of the Primal Gods\u2014 Bat, Panther, Tiger, Spider and Snake. With the tribes splintered, the Zandalarians have been forced to recruit champions from Azeroth's varied and disparate races to battle, and hopefully once again defeat, the Soulflayer.\n[\"Tips, Vendor Rewards, and Class Quest Rewards\"]\nReferences.\nThis page and the articles it contained can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060205010309/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/reputation.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nDraenei.\nAlliance \nLong before the fallen titan, Sargeras, unleashed his demonic Legion on Azeroth, he turned his baleful gaze upon the world of Argus and its highly intelligent inhabitants, the eredar. Believing that this magically gifted race would be a crucial component in his dark quest to undo all of creation, Sargeras contacted the eredar\u2019s three leaders \u2013 Kil\u2019jaeden, Archimonde, and Velen \u2013 and offered them knowledge and power in exchange for their loyalty.\nOnly Velen abstained, for he had seen a vision. In it, his people were transformed into hideous demons, and they joined the ranks of Sargeras\u2019 Burning Legion: an army of unspeakable evil that would grow vast and decimate life on countless worlds. With the aid of the naaru, benevolent energy beings who had resolved to combat the fallen titan\u2019s nihilistic crusade, Velen gathered other like-minded eredar and narrowly escaped Argus. Forever after, these renegades would call themselves the draenei, or \u201cexiled ones.\u201d\nKil\u2019jaeden, who had loved Velen like a brother, was infuriated by the draenei\u2019s flight from Argus and their ungrateful refusal of Sargeras\u2019 offer. In retaliation, Kil\u2019jaeden led the Legion\u2019s armies on a relentless pursuit of the draenei throughout the cosmos. Eventually, Velen and his beleaguered people eluded their hunters and found sanctuary on a remote world that they would name Draenor, or \u201cExiles\u2019 Refuge.\u201d Having been instructed by the naaru in the ways of the Light, the draenei developed an extraordinary society on their new home and came to know the shamanistic orc clans native to Draenor.\nYet the draenei\u2019s peaceful existence did not last. Upon discovering the renegades\u2019 home, Kil\u2019jaeden corrupted the noble orcs into a single, bloodthirsty force of destruction: the Horde. Blinded by rage, the orcs wreaked havoc upon the draenei, slaughtering over eighty percent of the race and forcing Velen and other survivors into hiding. Many draenei also mutated into lesser forms known as the Krokul, or \u201cBroken,\u201d after being exposed to the fel energies wielded by orc warlocks. Decades after the Horde\u2019s genocidal campaign, the shaman Ner\u2019zhul opened magical portals throughout Draenor, and the resulting magical stress tore the dying world apart.\nIn the wake of the calamity, what remained of Draenor \u2013 known henceforth as Outland \u2013 devolved into a battleground among the Burning Legion and other factions vying for control of the ruined landscape. To escape the mounting chaos, Velen and a number of his followers commandeered the Exodar, a satellite structure of the stunning naaru dimensional fortress named Tempest Keep. Using this craft to search for new allies, the draenei left Outland and later crash-landed upon the world of Azeroth.\nInspired by heroic tales of the Alliance and its victories against the Legion, the draenei sought out and pledged their loyalty to this courageous faction. Not long afterward, Velen and his noble refugees played a key role in urging the Alliance to invade Outland and disrupt the Legion\u2019s nefarious activities. Armed with their unshakable faith in the Light, the draenei ventured to their embattled former home as steadfast members of the Alliance and defeated their ancient demonic rivals.\nThe return to Outland offered many draenei a chance to reconnect with their brethren who had been left behind. While some of Velen\u2019s race chose to rebuild their society in the shattered land, the majority of draenei remained on Azeroth, vowing to uphold their commitment to the Alliance. Recently, Velen was granted a dire vision concerning a war between the forces of light and darkness that would take place on Azeroth. Thus, the draenei and their sage leader are now bravely preparing to stand against the shadow that they believe is fast approaching.\nStart Location: Azuremyst Isle.\nLocated off of the coast of northern Kalimdor, Azuremyst Isle is home to the draenei, refugees who fled Outland aboard the massive dimensional vessel named the Exodar. When the draenei crashed on Azeroth, powerful crystals from their vessel were scattered about Azuremyst Isle, mutating flora and fauna near the debris. Following the ill-fated landing, the draenei worked feverishly to find survivors and mend any damages inflicted on the isle due to their disastrous arrival. The draenei have since taken to the isle and established the remains of the Exodar as their base of power. Having suffered a long and arduous history of exile, the draenei are now resolved to give their lives in defense of Azuremyst Isle.\nHome City: The Exodar.\nOnce a satellite structure of the mighty Tempest Keep, the dimensional craft known as the Exodar was used by a group of draenei to escape their perilous home on Outland. After departing the shattered draenei world, the Exodar appeared above northern Kalimdor when a spectacular explosion ripped open the skies. The great vessel impacted on the shores of Azuremyst Isle, which has since become home to Outland\u2019s refugee draenei. Following their dramatic landing, the draenei have utilized the remains of the Exodar to great effect, transforming it into a base of operations for their dealings on Azeroth.\nRacial Mount: Elekk.\nThe recent influx of different races to Outland, particularly the ethereals, has resulted in increased hunting of the native elekk of Nagrand for their prized tusks. Yet in addition to being seen as game, these massive beasts are also valued for their ability to act as mounts. When the draenei fled Outland aboard the Exodar, they carried with them a number of species, including tamed elekk. Upon landing on Azeroth, these tusked-creatures played a large role in helping the draenei establish themselves on their strange new home. While much of Azeroth\u2019s own native wildlife has served other races as trustworthy mounts, the draenei still prefer the hearty and unyielding elekk above all else.\nLeader: Prophet Velen.\nAlongside Kil\u2019jaeden and Archimonde, the wise prophet Velen ruled over the eredar race on the world of Argus. Unlike his brethren, however, Velen was gifted with the ability to foresee events to come. Thus, soon after the dark titan, Sargeras, approached the three leaders with offerings of knowledge and power, Velen received a vision that his people would ultimately become members of the demonic Burning Legion. While Kil\u2019jaeden and Archimonde readily allied with Sargeras, Velen gathered other wary eredar and found sanctuary on the world of Draenor with the help of the enigmatic naaru race.\nNot long ago, a number of draenei resettled on Azeroth, hoping to put a halt to the Legion\u2019s murderous activities in Outland. Sensing great courage in the Alliance, Velen and his followers pledged themselves to this noble faction. The strengthened Alliance then helped the draenei reclaim their former holdings from the Legion. Most recently, Velen used the heart of a fallen naaru to sanctify the blood elves\u2019 tainted Sunwell, transforming the sacred fount into a source of holy and arcane energies. Although the Legion\u2019s forces in Outland have been greatly diminished and the demonic invasion of Azeroth has been driven back, Velen remains fearful of an upcoming war between light and shadow."}

She is the protector of nature and imagination, and it is the charge of her flight to guard all of the Great Trees across the world, which only druids use to enter the Dream itself.\nIn recent times, Ysera's most trusted lieutenants have been warped by a dark new power within the Emerald Dream. Now these wayward sentinels have passed through the Great Trees into Azeroth, intending to spread madness and terror throughout the mortal kingdoms. Even the mightiest of adventurers would be well advised to give the dragons a wide berth, or suffer the consequences of their misguided wrath.\nLethon.\nLethon's exposure to the aberration within the Emerald Dream not only darkened the hue of the mighty dragon's scales, but also empowered him with the ability to extract malevolent shades from his enemies. Once joined with their master, the shades imbue the dragon with healing energies. It should come as no surprise, then, that Lethon is considered to be among the most formidable of Ysera's wayward lieutenants.\nEmeriss.\nA mysterious dark power within the Emerald Dream has transformed the once-majestic Emeriss into a rotting, diseased monstrosity. Reports from the few who have survived encounters with the dragon have told horrifying tales of putrid mushrooms erupting from the corpses of their dead companions. Emeriss is truly the most gruesome and appalling of Ysera's estranged green dragons.\nTaerar.\nTaerar was perhaps the most affected of Ysera's rogue lieutenants. His interaction with the dark force within the Emerald Dream shattered Taerar's sanity as well as his corporeal form. The dragon now exists as a specter with the ability to split into multiple entities, each of which possesses destructive magical powers. Taerar is a cunning and relentless foe who is intent on turning the madness of his existence into reality for the inhabitants of Azeroth.\nYsondre.\nOnce one of Ysera's most trusted lieutenants, Ysondre has now gone rogue, sewing terror and chaos across the land of Azeroth. Her formerly beneficent healing powers have given way to dark magics, enabling her to cast smoldering lightning waves and summon the aid of fiendish druids. Ysondre and her kin also possess the ability to induce sleep, sending her unfortunate mortal foes to the realm of their most terrifying nightmares.\nSample Items.\nBelow are four of many items which can only be found on the Dragons of Nightmare.\nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nDwarf.\nAlliance \nThe bold and courageous dwarves are an ancient race descended from the earthen\u2014beings of living stone created by the titans when the world was young. Due to a strange malady known as the curse of flesh, the dwarves\u2019 earthen progenitors underwent a transformation that turned their rocky hides into soft skin. Ultimately, these creatures of flesh and blood dubbed themselves dwarves and carved out the mighty city of Ironforge in the snowy peaks of Khaz Modan.\nFor many long centuries, three dwarven clans\u2014the Bronzebeards, the Wildhammers, and the Dark Irons\u2014lived united in Ironforge under the wise rule of High King Modimus Anvilmar. When Modimus passed away from old age, tensions boiled over among the clans, and war erupted for control of the city. Thus began the War of the Three Hammers, a savage conflict that raged for many years, during which time the Bronzebeard clan won sole ownership of Ironforge and expelled its rivals. The war severed relations among the clans, and they went on to forge new destinies apart from one another.\nWhen the orcish Horde invaded Azeroth, Ironforge\u2019s dwarves offered to join the Grand Alliance. Led by King Magni Bronzebeard, the city\u2019s resilient inhabitants proved to be the backbone of the Alliance forces, helping to secure victory after victory against the orcs. Ever since that time, Ironforge\u2019s dwarves have remained an invaluable part of the Alliance.\nApart from reveling in the prospect of battle, the dwarves have long been interested in uncovering the truth of their enchanted past. Due to the efforts of dwarven archeologists scattered throughout the world, much has been learned about the race\u2019s origins and the curse of flesh that afflicted the earthen. Many mysteries still remain, however, and the dwarves have continued excavating Azeroth\u2019s ancient sites for answers.\nMost recently, a twist of fate has drawn the rival clans back to Ironforge after they\u2019d spent centuries apart\u2026.\nWhen freak natural disasters began rocking much of Azeroth just prior to the Cataclysm, the dwarven lands were not spared from the calamitous upheavals. A series of violent quakes tore through areas surrounding Ironforge, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent dwarves in the process. To glean answers as to the troubling state of the world, King Magni selflessly underwent a mystic ritual to commune with the earth. The archaic ceremony, however, had an unexpected effect: Magni was transformed into diamond and became fused to the depths of Ironforge itself.\nIn the power vacuum that followed, his estranged daughter, Moira, who had married into the much despised Dark Iron clan, briefly claimed Ironforge\u2019s throne and effectively locked down the city. If not for the intervention of King Varian Wrynn of Stormwind and his son, Prince Anduin, her brash actions might have sparked another civil war. With Varian\u2019s guidance, control of Ironforge has since been divided equally among the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans through the Council of Three Hammers. Yet as bitterness and prejudice fester among the clans, the council\u2019s ability to govern as one remains uncertain.\nStart Location: Dun Morogh.\nEncircled by jagged mountain peaks, the snowy region of Dun Morogh has been the cultural heart of Ironforge\u2019s dwarves for ages. Not long ago, quakes roused numerous troggs from their subterranean dwellings and drove the bestial creatures toward the dwarven settlement of Anvilmar in Coldridge Valley. The sudden influx of troggs also caused the savage Frostmane trolls to abandon their usual holdings on Shimmer Ridge and encroach upon dwarf-occupied areas. Threatened on two fronts, Dun Morogh\u2019s mountaineers are spread thin. Without additional assistance, the prized lands of Dun Morogh might soon fall to the dwarves\u2019 barbarous foes.\nHome City: Ironforge.\nCarved into the stone heart of Khaz Modan, the mighty city of Ironforge is a testament to the dwarves\u2019 strength and resilience. During the Second War between orcs and humans, many dwarven strongholds fell to the onslaught of the Horde, yet Ironforge was never breached. Now ruled over by the Council of Three Hammers, the city has entered into a tense and potentially violent era. Yet should the council rule with equality and justice, this new period in Ironforge\u2019s history might very well be its greatest.\nRacial Mount: Ram.\nDistinguished by their shaggy coats and massive horns, Barak Tor\u2019ol mountain rams are simple yet proud animals whose fearlessness is matched only by that of their dwarven masters. What these good-natured animals lack in ferocity, they compensate with uncommon durability and strength. Recently, other types of rams have been discovered in the frigid continent of Northrend, yet the amicable species native to Dun Morogh and its surrounding regions is still preferred by Ironforge\u2019s dwarves.\nLeader: Council of Three Hammers.\nFormed in the wake of King Magni\u2019s petrification, the Council of Three Hammers is composed of one representative from each of the three dwarven clans. Muradin Bronzebeard, Magni\u2019s younger brother and a veteran of the war against the Lich King, represents the Bronzebeards. Falstad Wildhammer, renowned gryphon rider and high thane of his clan, represents the Wildhammers. Moira Thaurissan, legal heir to the throne of Ironforge due to her lineage, represents the Dark Irons, the clan ruled by her late husband, Dagran. Despite their varying backgrounds and ideological differences, the three representatives have pledged to rule united for the good of Ironforge."}

These articles overviewed the various world &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;s and holidays available in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nFor many of Azeroth's inhabitants, combat on both a grand scale and at the level of individual skirmishes has become ritualistic and in some ways even ceremonial. This page documents some of the ongoing confrontations and celebrations in the game - and those events in between which the line has blurred.\nAlso, be sure to check out our Events Calendar for a more complete listing of events and to find out when these events occur.\nRecurring (Ongoing Events).\n\"Participate in regularly scheduled events.\"\nGurubashi Arena Booty Run.\nEvery 3 Hours starting at midnight\nThe Bloodsail Pirates have a penchant for illicit after-hours activities, especially those involving mass combat and treasure. To see that his crew has its nightly fill of extracurricular entertainment, a lone pirate captain will drop a chest in the center of Gurubashi Arena every three hours starting at midnight (Server Time). Be the first to get to the chest and loot it - while fighting off everyone else trying to do the same - and you'll reap the reward it holds. And the pirates will rejoice! \nCall to Arms: Battlegrounds!\nEvery Weekend\nCalls to Arms occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning. During a Call to Arms, emmissaries from that Battleground will be found in the major cities, and honor/faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased. Check out the Events Calendar for exact dates. \nElemental Invasions.\nReports of elemental incursions in different parts of Kalimdor are increasing. Every few days, a new wave of elementals blasts its way into the regions of Silithus, Un'Goro Crater, Azshara, and Winterspring; ostensibly, for the sole reason of seeing just how far into these territories they can penetrate before being beaten back by the forces of the Horde or the Alliance. Investigate these regions and aid your allies in countering these mysterious invasions. \nKalu'ak Fishing Derby.\nThe esteemed tuskarr of the Kalu'ak are proud to introduce to Northrend the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a healthy dash of luck! Every Saturday beginning at 2 p.m. players can try to catch the elusive Blacktip Shark. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him the first catch of the night. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for his or her fishing expertise. Those who aren't able to return with the first catch will still receive a just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave.\nIt is said that these sharks' favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick. Because of the increased concentration of fish, you have a higher chance to catch a shark from fishing pools.\nThe derby winner will receive a substantial chunk of experience (or money at maximum level) and gain 5,000 reputation with the Kalu'ak. In addition, the champion will be given a choice between two unique rewards\nThe Spirit of Competition.\nType: Holiday Event&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Cities, Battlegrounds\nThe Spirits of Competition grow especially fervent, and draw close to the mortal realm. During such times, members of both the Alliance and Horde can honor the spirits and earn Competitor's Tabards by seeking to defeat one another in the battlegrounds. For victory in competition, they can also earn the spirits' favor in the form of a prized gold medal - and the special pet it summons.\nGoing for Gold.\nTo participate in the Spirits of Competition event, simply enter any battleground and do your best to help your team win. All participants will earn a special tabard honoring their competitive spirit. The Competitor's Tabard is a rare (blue) tabard and can be seen on the commoners proclaiming the event. For each victory, you'll also have the chance of winning a gold medal as well. You'll receive these rewards in the mail. Continue winning battlegrounds for the duration of the event to increase your chances for the gold medal. \nThe Argent Tournament.\nLocation: Icecrown\nThe Argent Tournament will begin with the launch of Secrets of Ulduar. The Argent Crusade invites all players to this permanent in-game event to test their abilities against others who oppose the Lich King and his Scourge. Representatives of all ten faction home cities, from Orgrimmar to Stormwind, have travelled to the tournament grounds on the northeastern coast of Icecrown to take part in this event. Anybody who wishes to join in the event is welcome to make the trip to the Argent Pavilion located on the west side of the Argent Tournament grounds and start their journey to become a champion of their factions\u2019 cities while preparing to face the enemy of all living beings.\nGetting Started.\nThe Argent Tournament is located on the far northeastern coastline of Icecrown. You can get a free flight here from Jean Pierre Poulain on Krasus' Landing in Dalaran or travel there yourself. Just make sure you pick up the new flight path to make your return trips easier.\nOnce you arrive, head to the Argent Pavilion tent on the west side of the area. Justicar Mariel Trueheart will welcome you to the event and get you started on your journey to becoming a champion of the tournament. Depending on your faction, you will be directed to either the Silver Covenant Pavilion in the north east or the Sunreaver Pavilion in the south east. You will then be able to pick up quests and begin your training.\nRise to a Champion.\nWhile not all of the daily quests here involve mounted combat, it is the focus of the tournament. All participants will begin as an Aspirant and be given quests to let you practice the basic mechanics of mounted combat against target dummies.\nOnce you have the quests to practice, pick up a lance off one of the racks around the area and hop on the mount outside your respective pavilion to complete them.\nEach of the daily quests you complete will reward you with an Aspirant\u2019s Seal. After a couple days of practicing your skills you will be able to gather enough of these seals to challenge an NPC and should you succeed, you will attain the rank of valiant of your race\u2019s respective home city.\nAs a valiant you will be given a similar set of daily quests to continue your training, but the time for fighting target dummies is over, you will now be facing valiant rank NPCs in the ring.\nThere are representatives of each city ready to face you. You will also begin using your new mounted combat skills to battle the Scourge!\nEach of these daily quests will reward you with a Valiant\u2019s Seal and after enough days of practicing you will be ready for another challenge, if you complete this challenge you will become a champion of your city!\nA Champion's Dutie.\nAs champions of the Argent Tournament, players will now accept quests directly from members of the Argent Crusade in the Argent Crusade Pavilion; except for death knights who will go the Knight of the Ebon Blade camp next to the construction in the northern area of the grounds.\nChampions will have the most challenging daily quests available to them as well as champion rank NPCs to battle against. At this rank the daily quests will provide a new currency called Champion\u2019s Seal. These seals can be used to purchase new epic items, new mounts, or new companions that are available through each city's respective quartermaster. On top of the seals, the daily quests can provide you with either a Champion\u2019s Writ that can be redeemed for city reputation or a Champion\u2019s Purse that contains some extra money to go on top of the regular gold reward for a quest.\nYou will also have the option of becoming a champion of another city. To do this, you will have to become a valiant for whatever city you pick, but after some more hard work you will be able to prove your dedication to the cause and become a champion again and have access to the new city\u2019s quartermaster along with the previous one.\nYou will also attain a squire (or gruntling) at the champion rank who will follow you around and display the city (or cities) you have become a champion of!\nWrap Up.\nThe Argent Tournament Grounds also contain profession trainers, daily quests to help goblins build a great structure, and a mystery to solve behind the deaths of some tournament participants along with new mounts, non-combat pets, shirts, and epic items to purchase.\nThe Argent Tournament challenges you to perfect the art of battle and become one of its champions. If you are brave enough to handle the pressure of the training and honorable enough to take up the cause of the Argent Crusade, head out to Icecrown when Secrets of Ulduar launches!\nArgent Tournament Mounts.\nCheck out the mounts you can earn in the Argent Tournament.\nArgent Tournament Updates in Patch 3.2.\nThe Argent Crusade continues to call forth the bold and brave to take up arms against their enemies and overcome the threat of the Lich King. In the content patch, Call of the Crusade, the Argent Tournament expands into two new points of interest, adding new dailies, new rewards, and new challenges for the heroes of Azeroth. Read more about these new additions.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nWithin the Crusader's Coliseum only the greatest champions of the Argent Tournament are given entrance. Here they will face new challenges, new foes, and achieve new glory. The coliseum includes new gameplay options for the most hardened of veterans in ten and 25-player Heroic modes as well as a five-player dungeon. Read more about this new addition here.\nCrusaders' Coliseum Sneak Peek.\nThe Argent Crusade has sent out a call to arms for all heroes far and wide to meet at the very doorstep of the Lich King's domain and to prove their might in a tournament the likes of which Azeroth has never seen. Of course, a tournament such as this needs a fitting stage. A place where potential candidates are tested to the limits of exhaustion. A place where heroes... become champions. A place called the Crusaders' Coliseum.\nLooking for more Tips?\nCheck out our General Links for some guides to the Argent Tournament. \nScourge Invasion.\nThe day many have feared for years has finally come: the Scourge has launched a direct attack on the lands of Azeroth! Reports of necropolis sightings are coming in from all over the world, the massive structures looming ominously on the horizon, ready to move at Kel'Thuzad's command. A dreadful dawn is rising in the east as the Lich King's dark minions prepare to descend upon Azeroth. Soon the Scourge will march again, and this time there is no prophet to speak the warning, no gallant knight to fight the coming darkness, no legendary hero to thwart the monstrosity on the Frozen Throne.\nIt is up to you now to become the fire that burns against the cold, the light of hope that prevails beneath the shadow of the necropolis! \nInformation.\nThe Scourge Invasion.\nSeveral regions of Azeroth have come under attack by Scourge forces. Members of the Argent Dawn are already organizing a worldwide counter to the Scourge invasion, keeping an eye out for any necropolis sightings and passing on their information to all adventurers willing to aid them in their struggle.\nWith each victory against the Scourge, the defense grows stronger. As more and more invasion attempts are beaten back by the defenders, the Argent Dawn will be able to bestow increasingly more powerful blessings upon those fighting the invaders. If the mortal races focus on clearing the Scourge camps all over the world that have sprung up beneath each necropolis, perhaps the invasion can effectively be halted or even repelled. Those who wish to take up arms against the undead invaders should speak with a representative of the Argent Dawn to learn what regions need help and how the defense is holding up.\nThere are also reports of Scourge agents showing up in Stratholme, the Scholomance, Dire Maul, the Scarlet Monastery, Shadowfang Keep and the Razorfen Downs. Whatever their purpose there may be, the world will surely be better off if they are destroyed before their evil plans are fulfilled.\nEnemy at the Gates.\nA necropolis has appeared outside Stormwind and Undercity, and soon the assault on these capitals will launch in full force. Skeletal shock troops are standing by to commence the attack, led by abominations and gruesome undead officers. The city guard will need all the help they can get once the Scourge unleashes its wrath on the cities. The Argent Dawn has already heeded their desperate call for help, setting up camps inside the besieged cities and rallying the defense against the encroaching darkness."}

It\u2019s used to gather resources, recruit followers and prepare your faction's army to stand against the Iron Horde.\nThe Iron Horde presents an incredible threat to Azeroth. As such, the Alliance and the Horde have sent their greatest champions to Draenor, the Iron Horde\u2019s home world, to put an end to this danger once and for all. You are one such champion, and you\u2019re going to need an army of your own to stand a chance in this perilous new land.\nIt is your duty to plan the stronghold\u2019s layout, recruit followers and lead them into battle. Command and inspire your army, and they\u2019ll support you with their wares, build your base, or even complete missions on your behalf. Not even Azeroth\u2019s greatest champions can be everywhere at once. To get started, after thwarting the Iron Horde\u2019s invasion through the Dark Portal, alliance players should seek out Prophet Velen in Shadowmoon Valley. Horde players can begin construction of their garrison by going to Frostfire Ridge and looking for Farseer Drek\u2019Thar.\nBuildings.\nAny self-sufficient fortress needs different structures to support its activities. Each building can give you access to different powers or resources, from crafting materials to consumable items or benefits for the troops stationed at your garrison. Your architect, found in your garrison\u2019s Town Hall, can assist you with the planning and placement of your buildings. It is also possible to assign followers to work on certain buildings, and they will grant you special benefits (for example, if you assign a follower to your Enchanter\u2019s study, he or she can unlock special cosmetic weapon enchants).\nYour Troops.\nFollowers.\nThroughout your travels in Draenor, you will find others that will join your cause against the Iron Horde. These followers range from common laborers and artisans to merchants and aspiring heroes. Every single one is dedicated to making your garrison the best it can be, and only through your guidance will they succeed.\nMission Specialists.\nAssign followers their duties and missions, and your field commanders will take care of the rest.\nArchitects.\nDictate where you want to place a building, and the Architects will make it happen - just provide them with the resources they need.\nLeaders.\nAzeroth\u2019s greatest leaders make camp at your base of operations from time to time in order to discuss war strategies.\nActivities.\nInvasions.\nAs an important strategic resource, your garrison is a prime target of attacks. It is your duty to rally your troops and allies to defend it against any threats. Bring your friends, make use of your followers, and make your stand. The Garrison must not fall!\nMissions.\nAspiring heroes working under your guidance can be sent on missions, and they\u2019ll earn rewards from their quests. Upon returning from their assignments, your followers will occasionally bring you powerful loot that you can equip to battle the Iron Horde.\nUnited Front.\nAs busy as you\u2019ll be with the war effort, you shouldn\u2019t forget your friends and family! Invite them over to your Garrison and awe them with a display of your accomplishments, like monuments, statues specially commissioned to celebrate your victories on Draenor.\nOutposts.\nExtend your Garrison beyond the reaches of Frostfire Ridge and Shadowmoon Valley by constructing outposts, unique buildings that offer you bonuses in Gorgrond, Talador, Spires of Arak and Nagrand. Those range from experience bonuses while in those zones to mounted speed increases and summoning vehicles that assist in the extraction of Resources for your Garrison.\nItems.\nBlueprints.\nAs you explore Draenor, you\u2019ll find intricate blueprints that will allow you to construct unique buildings within your Garrison. Let your Architect review them as soon as possible!\nResources.\nA garrison requires resources to feed the troops, construct buildings, fund artisans and keep missions and other operations going. Resources can be obtained in several ways, such as questing or sending your followers on missions. Spend your Resources wisely!"}
{"id": "725336", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=725336", "title": "Game Guide/Gnome", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Gnome\", an official article from the 2010 BattleNet World of Warcraft Site.

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nGnome.\nAlliance \nThe clever, spunky, and oftentimes eccentric gnomes present a unique paradox among the civilized races of Azeroth. Brilliant inventors with an irrepressibly cheerful disposition, this race has suffered treachery, displacement, and near-genocide. It is their remarkable optimism in the face of such calamity that symbolizes the truly unshakable spirit of the gnomes.\nA race of diminutive beings, gnomes have made their mark on Azeroth through the application of a collective intelligence and ambition overshadowing that of their larger peers. Gnomes are renowned mechanics, engineers, and technicians, widely respected for their knowledge of the scientific facets of the world and their ability to transform said knowledge into surprising tools, vehicles, armor, and weapons.\nLittle is known concerning gnomish history previous to the Second War\u2014even among gnomes themselves. Much of gnomish philosophy is focused on forward-thinking, inventive concepts; little thought has ever been given to history or non-scientific records. However, recent developments have uncovered evidence of prehistoric mechagnomes created by the titans to help shape the lands of Azeroth. Like many of the titans\u2019 creations, these helpers were afflicted with the curse of flesh, and they became what is known as the gnome race today.\nIt wasn\u2019t until their discovery by the dwarves centuries later that gnomes were recognized as a viable and important race. The dwarves were impressed with the ingenuity and quickness of their smaller \u201ckin\u201d (for they had also been titan-forged and similarly cursed), and they assisted the gnomes in constructing a capital city, Gnomeregan, in the foothills of Dun Morogh near the dwarves\u2019 own capital of Ironforge. From their wondrous techno-city, gnomes provided invaluable support in weaponry, vehicles, and energetic troops to the Alliance of dwarves, humans, and high elves.\nBut when the Burning Legion invaded, the gnomes strangely refused to send aid to their allies. It wasn\u2019t until the war had ended that the Alliance learned the reason for the gnomes\u2019 withdrawal. Around the time of the Third War, an ancient menace had risen from the bowels of Azeroth to strike at Gnomeregan. Knowing that their allies\u2019 priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the gnomes decided to make their stand alone. Though they fought valiantly to save their beloved city, Gnomeregan was lost.\nMost of the gnome race was wiped out during the fall of Gnomeregan; some say that as much as 80 percent of the gnomes died during those horrible days. The few survivors fled to the safety of nearby Ironforge. There they quietly went about rebuilding their forces, healing their wounds, and preparing to retake their ravaged city.\nJust prior to the Cataclysm, the gnomes\u2019 leader, High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, led an attack on Gnomeregan\u2019s invaders. It was a successful first maneuver, but there will be much more bloodshed before the entirety of the gnomeland is liberated.\nStart Location: Gnomeregan.\nIn the ongoing effort to reclaim Gnomeregan from Sicco Thermaplugg and his twisted cohorts, the gnomes have carved out a tenuous foothold in New Tinkertown, near the techno-city\u2019s gates. Although work is now under way to retrieve and decontaminate irradiated survivors from Gnomeregan itself, another battle has ignited in Dun Morogh against one of Thermaplugg\u2019s henchmen, Razlo Crushcog. The perils of Gnomeregan are many, but the gnomes and their ingenious leader, High Tinker Mekkatorque, are resolute in facing any threat\u2014be it trogg, toxic sludge, or sentry-bot\u2014to take back their beloved gnomeland. To that end, neutralizing Crushcog before he can further disrupt Gnomeregan\u2019s liberation has become pivotal to achieving victory.\nHome City: Gnomeregan.\nA technical marvel, the subterranean city of Gnomeregan is wrought-iron evidence of gnomish brilliance, ambition, and ingenuity. It was carved into the stony foothills of Dun Morogh, and winds deep into the heart of the land. Currently a battleground between the founding gnomes and the traitor Sicco Thermaplugg, the once-gleaming metal hallways of this labyrinthine city are slowly being retaken.\nRacial Mount: Mechanostrider.\nThe gnomes\u2019 revolutionary mechanostrider is yet another marvel of their engineering prowess. Each strider is specifically designed with the individual rider in mind. Mechanostriders are constructed using state-of-the-art steam compression, servo-motor dynamics, and duro-steel plating, offering the rider a reliable and durable means of transportation. Some claim that the mechanostrider\u2019s lack of true sentience makes for a very dumb mount. However, gnomes counter that, under a skilled rider, the mechanostrider is more responsive than even the best-trained live mount.\nLeader: High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque.\nHigh Tinker Mekkatorque has been at the helm of the gnome race during some of its most difficult and trying times. Since his title is an elected one, the fact that he has held his position throughout such hardship is a testament to the love his people have for him.\nA brilliant inventor, Gelbin Mekkatorque rose quickly to prominence among the meritocratic gnomes with his innovative designs and creative problem-solving skills. He built the very first functioning mechanostrider, assisted in the development of the dwarven siege engine, and was instrumental in the creation of the Deeprun Tram running from Ironforge to Stormwind City.\nAlthough one wouldn\u2019t know it from looking at him, the loss of Gnomeregan weighs heavily on the high tinker. He was unprepared for the invasion that swept through his beloved city, and he was betrayed by a trusted advisor who convinced him to react hastily, resulting in unnecessary deaths. Now Mekkatorque\u2019s brilliant mind has taken on a surgical focus with one single outcome: the retaking of Gnomeregan."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nGoblin.\nHorde \nOriginally the slaves of jungle trolls on the Isle of Kezan, goblins were forced to mine kaja\u2019mite ore out of the volcanic bowels of Mount Kajaro. The trolls used this potent mineral for their voodoo rituals, but it had an unexpected effect on the slaves who were in constant contact with it: kaja\u2019mite generated a startling new cunning and intelligence in the goblin race.\nCrafting powerful artifacts of engineering and alchemy in secret, the goblins soon overthrew their oppressors and claimed Kezan for their homeland. The mines that had once been the goblins\u2019 prison, their slave camp, and the base of their rebellion now became the city of Undermine. Weaving through the heart of the island in a dizzying network of tunnels, vaults, and lava tubes, Undermine epitomized the goblins\u2019 complex, unpredictable mindset. It was there that they built the foundations of an empire, and the natural elements of craftiness (some would call it duplicity) inherent to the race were honed to a razor edge. The goblins\u2019 inventions would help them rule the world\u2014or at least own a profitable percentage of it.\nTo the goblins\u2019 great dismay, the effects of the kaja\u2019mite began to wear off, and their intelligence waned. Even worse, the ore itself became harder and harder to find. Supplies dwindled. Desperation ensued. The goblins\u2019 once-brilliant inventions started to look haphazard and makeshift (a look that has become synonymous with the term \u201cgoblin-made\u201d), and Kezan\u2019s native swindlers soon realized that they would need to find other ways to supplement their avarice.\nThe goblins\u2019 remaining craftiness (coupled with undiminished natural greed) soon lifted the race to preeminence as masters of mercantilism. Prominent trade princes rose to power during the First War as the cleverest goblins took advantage of the strife. Great fortunes were amassed, and the Isle of Kezan became a hub for fleets of goblin trading ships. One of the more ambitious trade princes agreed to lend his cartel\u2019s services to the Horde in the Second War. Following the Horde\u2019s defeat, the goblins learned from that trade prince\u2019s failed example, realizing that their profits could double if they weren\u2019t stuck in a restrictive relationship. By the end of the Third War, goblins were providing weaponry, vehicles, and devious services to both the Horde and the Alliance. But the gravy train wouldn\u2019t last forever\u2026\nRecently, the Bilgewater Cartel\u2014the goblin faction centered in Kezan\u2014has found a new enemy in the Alliance. Unexpected and unprofitable encounters with the secretive SI:7 branch of King Varian\u2019s forces have driven Trade Prince Gallywix from his comfortable neutrality. Reforging old pacts with their colleagues\u2019 one-time allies, the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel have been welcomed into the Horde with open arms.\nStart Location: Kezan.\nThanks to Kezan\u2019s prominence as a mercantile hub, it\u2019s been divided into dozens of districts by the trade princes, who view every inch of land as an opportunity waiting to be converted into gold and silver. Kezan\u2019s tropical palms are bisected with miles of roadway, and even the beaches are beginning to be paved over by goblin ambitions. Now, nature is reclaiming the island of Kezan \u2013 massive Mount Kajaro has erupted with the Cataclysm, flooding the island with searing lava and sending tidal recoil sweeping through Kezan\u2019s harbors. \nHome City: Bilgewater Harbor.\nFollowing the destruction of Kezan\u2019s port homes, many of the Bilgewater Cartel\u2019s surviving goblins have fled for their lives, joining their new Horde comrades and settling in Azshara\u2019s Bilgewater Harbor. The town\u2019s origins are often speculated on by non-goblins; Bilgewater Harbor sprang up in record time after the Kezan refugees\u2019 arrival, and its\u2019 quintessentially goblin construction has fostered an atmosphere of debauchery and disorder. Orgrimmar\u2019s military has only recently set boots down in Bilgewater, but the harbor\u2019s value as a strategic front conflicts with some pushy goblins\u2019 desire to turn it into a new version of their ancestral home (abounding with gambling dens, pleasure houses and other commercial luxuries). This cultural rift is likely to breed tension in the ranks of the Horde sooner rather than later.\nRacial Mount: Trike.\nWith the Bilgewater goblins now in the trenches with the bigger brutes of the Horde, a significant number of trampling deaths have been reported. Normally unconcerned with such matters, Trade Prince Gallywix was alarmed to learn that Garrosh\u2019s Forsaken accountants refused to pay soldier death benefits if the soldiers never got to the actual battle, and accidental stomps caused by tauren maneuvers made it extremely difficult to calculate how many goblins had made it to the battlefield before they were rendered flat. Gallywix offered a substantial cash reward for an invention that could both lift goblins out of hoof traffic and speed them along at comparable velocities so that goblin soldiers could die in \u201ca calculate-able and reimbursable fashion.\u201d\nHundreds of submissions were made. Most exploded upon delivery. In the end, the clear (and relatively undamaged) winner was the sturdy transport trike created by the remarkably aged Jibidiah \u201cNo Fingers\u201d Gragglefutz. Gragglefutz had been a street-side grenade salesman for decades, and years of product-related mishaps had borne fruit in this speedy, durable, and mostly unexplodable vehicle. Jibidiah gained some renown for his creation, and he now claims that Gallywix has him hard at work on a speedier \u201cturbo\u201d version of the trike. Jibidiah\u2019s one complaint is that the substantial cash reward for designing the trike has been stuck in a particularly insidious mess of red tape and mail delivery issues. The trade prince apologizes for this and promises to put his top goblins on it immediately.\nLeader: Trade Prince Gallywix.\nAfter the Cataclysm reawakened a volcano on his home island, Trade Prince Gallywix realized that there was good money to be made in offering panicked refugees a ticket to safety on his ship, taking their life savings\u2014and then selling them into slavery. A clever plan, until it (and the ship) fell apart in the naval crossfire between an Alliance fleet and a lone Horde ship. The goblin survivors washed ashore on the Lost Isles off the coast of Kalimdor, where they discovered that the islands\u2019 dense jungles harbored many mysteries and more than a few unpleasant surprises."}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Human%20%28playable%29\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nHuman.\nAlliance \nRecent discoveries have shown that humans are descended from the barbaric vrykul, half-giant warriors who live in Northrend. Early humans were primarily a scattered and tribal people for several millennia, until the rising strength of the troll empire forced their strategic unification. Thus the nation of Arathor was formed, along with its capital, the city-state of Strom.\nAfter several centuries of peace, however, the increasingly prosperous and independent city-states of Arathor split into separate kingdoms: Gilneas to the west, Alterac, Dalaran, and Lordaeron to the northwest, Kul Tiras to the southwest, and Stormwind to the far south. Strom itself was renamed Stromgarde and remained a significantly powerful kingdom.\nBut disaster struck when the orcish Horde appeared on Azeroth, reducing Stormwind to ruins during the First War between orcs and humans. The city\u2019s survivors, including the young prince, Varian Wrynn, fled to Lordaeron, where the leaders of the seven kingdoms resolved to unify once again in the Alliance of Lordaeron. Joined together, they succeeded in defeating the Horde during the Second War.\nTensions grew among the kingdoms, however, as the costs for maintaining the Alliance rose much higher than originally anticipated. Unwilling to pay the taxes, the leaders of Gilneas and Stromgarde chose to withdraw their kingdoms from the Alliance. Further disaster came when the kingdom of Lordaeron was decimated by a mysterious plague that killed thousands of humans and converted them into undead servants of the Lich King. Even Lordaeron\u2019s prince, Arthas Menethil, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own father and journey to Northrend, where he merged with his master. For the next five years, the Lich King remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his armies.\nBut unleashing the plague of undeath was merely preparation for an invasion by the demonic Burning Legion, which had long sought to destroy all life on Azeroth. When the Legion struck, humans banded together with other races and secured a costly victory during the Third War. Recently, members of the Horde and the Alliance launched separate campaigns in Northrend, and their efforts resulted in the Lich King\u2019s crushing defeat.\nSince the fall of Lordaeron, the kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful force in the now multiracial Alliance. Led by King Varian Wrynn, the people of Stormwind hold fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defend their settlements and their families.\nThough humans are among the younger races on Azeroth, they have faced many challenges with fortitude and resilience. Their continued ability to adapt and rebuild has made them a vital force in an ever-changing world.\nStart Location: Elwynn Forest.\nThe peaceful woodlands to the south of Stormwind City seem more tranquil than ever since the fall of the Defias Brotherhood, but the inhabitants of Elwynn Forest are hardly idle. There are fields to sow, mines to work, and lumber to harvest. For all its pomp and grandeur, Stormwind wouldn\u2019t last long without a constant stream of food and supplies to support the city\u2019s population. This exchange has become increasingly threatened by kobold invasions, vicious feuds among farmers, and attacks from wild animals. Northshire Abbey remains dedicated to recruiting and training any adventurers brave enough to help keep the peace. Likewise, the Blackrock orcs are gathering their forces in the nearby Redridge Mountains. With Stormwind\u2019s militia stretched thinner than ever, these renegade orcs stand ready to finally annihilate their old human enemies in Elwynn Forest.\nHome City: Stormwind.\nNo city better demonstrates human determination than Stormwind. Destroyed during the Horde\u2019s initial invasion of Azeroth, Stormwind was painstakingly reconstructed by the Stonemasons\u2019 Guild after the Second War. Parts of the city were razed again when Deathwing, the corrupted black Dragon Aspect, brutally attacked Stormwind, but the other undamaged districts are more beautiful than ever thanks to their hardworking inhabitants. From the magnificent Cathedral of Light, which serves as a major spiritual hub, to the awe-inspiring Valley of Heroes, which commemorates the sacrifices of Stormwind\u2019s loyal champions, the city truly represents the courageous heart of humanity.\nRacial Mount: Horse.\nThese trusty steeds have carried their human masters to battle since before the First War. Known for their swiftness and spirited temperaments, these mounts are perfectly suited for their heroic riders. The Evendales of Elwynn Forest are especially prized by adventurers for their loyalty and steadiness in the face of danger. Due to their overwhelming popularity, these horses can also be found in Theramore and even the Wetlands.\nLeader: King Varian Wrynn.\nVarian\u2019s life has been defined by tragedy and conflict. The murder of his father by the assassin Garona Halforcen weighs heavily on him, along with the accidental death of his wife, Tiffin, during a riot. The king has recently returned to the throne following his abduction by the Defias Brotherhood and the black dragon Onyxia, who disguised herself as Lady Katrana Prestor. Robbed of his memories and enslaved by a Horde gladiatorial trainer in Kalimdor, Varian fought his way to freedom, earning the nickname \u201cLo\u2019Gosh,\u201d or \u201cghost wolf,\u201d while in battle. With the help of his comrades, he was able to recover his true identity and finally defeat Prestor. Known for his tenacity and fierce will, King Varian Wrynn is committed to protecting the Alliance\u2019s interests and raising his son, Anduin, to follow in his place."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nAzeroth is a fractious and war-stricken world, and standing alone can be deadly. To survive and prosper, members of all races gather together along cultural and ideological lines. Each of these factions holds to a unique philosophy, and they often disagree with one another \u2013 violently. Yet, despite the danger, allegiance to a faction never goes unnoticed; those heroes who are willing to risk taking sides can expect handsome rewards. \nWhat are Factions?\nFactions are groups of people with shared goals that you can choose to support, ignore, or even outright oppose. Most commonly, you\u2019ll find them in major towns and cities, but they\u2019re also present in out-of-the-way places.\nIf you help a faction out by killing a certain type of monster or completing a particular quest or task on their behalf, your reputation among that faction will increase. As your reputation reaches certain thresholds (e.g. Friendly, Honored, etc.), you can purchase unique, faction-exclusive equipment from their quartermasters, either with gold or special currency. At higher reputation levels (Revered, Exalted), you\u2019ll earn access to the best faction-specific rewards \u2013 epic-level weapons , decorated war mounts, and more.\nWhere do I start?\nTake a look at the list below to find a faction that\u2019s appealing to you \u2013 either because you like what they\u2019re saying, or because you like what\u2019s in their quartermaster\u2019s inventory. Then, head to their home base and speak with their leader. Factions have diverse tasks to complete and rewards to offer, so if you\u2019d rather win acclaim by slaying foes on the battlefield instead of searching ancient ruins for lost lore, there\u2019s a faction who\u2019ll agree with you, and pay you for it.\nThis isn\u2019t a comprehensive list of every faction in Azeroth \u2013 there are over a hundred, and not all of them work in the open. Hunting down the banner or signature blade of a lesser-known faction can give you a unique look, new power or a wild story to tell.\nShaohao.\nLevel 90 | The Celestial Court, Timeless Isle\nThe last emperor of the pandaren and the source of their unique worldview, Emperor Shaohao became one with the land thousands of years ago to protect Pandaria from the horror of the Sundering.

Brewing it isn\u2019t easy, requiring travel to one of the highest peaks of the Jade Forest... During a raging thunderstorm. And what is it about heavy rain that always brings out the saurok? Blanche is going to need some mercenary help to brew her masterpiece, preferably some fleet-footed adventurers who know how to fight off a saurok incursion while dodging lightning strikes. When the saurok take the fight to the nearby monastery, it might just be the Boomer Brew that helps turn the tide of battle!\nA Little Patience.\nDrive the Horde from the occupied temple of the Red Crane!\nThe blessed Temple of the Red Crane is the ancestral home of Chi-Ji, the celestial embodiment of hope. From within the temple\u2019s ornate halls, the Red Crane wings out to oppose the despair that spread through the murky Krasarang Wilds like a cancer. But, with the recent arrival of Horde occupation forces, the sacred site has become a fortification, and the Crane\u2019s servants hostages.\nLeaders of the Alliance, foremost among them Varian Wrynn, are divided on how to deal with the problem. To remove the Horde from the temple without needlessly sacrificing Alliance lives, you\u2019ll need to lure them out and take them down with carefully placed traps.\nArena of Annihilation.\nAre you ready to rumble? Gurthok and Wodin invite you to prove your might once again!\nGurgthock and Wodin are at it again! This time they\u2019ve set up their pit-fighting operation in Pandaria\u2019s snow-swept Kun-Lai Summit, at the Temple of the White Tiger:\n\"Ah, I can still remember running fights out of a muddy hole in the ground back in Nagrand.

Big money, big prizes!\"\nAssault on Zan'vess.\nYou can\u2019t step on these bugs.\nThe mighty amber trees of the Dread Wastes have long been a crucial part of Mantid society; the Mantid farm and harvest the issue of these trees, which they use to build structures throughout the Wastes. One of the greatest and largest of these trees, Zan\u2019vess, towers over the small ridges south of the Briny Muck \u2013 and its imminent sha corruption endangers not only the local Mantid who rely upon it, but all those they might attack in their resulting madness.\nTo end the threat, you\u2019ll need to take to the skies, destroying the wavering energy fields that protect the great tree while being blasted by the mantid\u2019s natural defenses. After your aerial assault, you\u2019ll break through insectoid monstrosities and battle to the tree on foot, where you\u2019ll fight face to mandible with the mantid guardians who\u2019ve dedicated their very lives to Zan\u2019vess\u2019s protection.\nBattle on the High Seas.\nTip the scales of naval warfare in your favor, and send your enemies\u2019 ships to the deeps!\nAs Alliance and Horde vessels surge towards Pandaria, looking to load up loot and leave soldiers, they clash along the open ocean. It\u2019s up to you to launch yourself aboard the battling ships, right into the center of a boarding melee, and make sure your side sails away into the sunset. You\u2019ll use cannons and ropes to travel between ships, deploy explosives to scuttle them to the bottom of the sea, and pick off key crew members to make sure the enemy navy can\u2019t recover.\nBattle on the High Seas.\nTip the scales of naval warfare in your favor, and send your enemies\u2019 ships to the deeps!\nAs Alliance and Horde vessels surge towards Pandaria, looking to load up loot and leave soldiers, they clash along the open ocean.

With the support of Moira Thaurissian\u2019s Dark Iron Dwarves, you must fight through a brutal storm in order to interrupt the troll rituals, weakening their forces and preventing dwarven scouts from become their victims. Your fight alongside Moira will help prove her worth to the other dwarf clans, and ultimately the whole of the Alliance.\nBrewmoon Festival.\nTake part in Pandaria's biggest brewfest, but beware: trouble is brewing!\nHidden in the shadow of Kun-Lai Summit, the quiet village of Binan has become well known for its yearly Brewmoon Festival. Young Pandaren travel from all over just to taste Brewmaster Boof\u2019s famous Kun-Lai Kicker and take part in the village\u2019s extensive celebration.

Only the bravest adventurers can hope to overcome the mogu's ancient defenses and finish what the brave Shado-Pan could not.\nDagger in the Dark.\nAid Vol\u2019jin in investigating a mysterious source of power\u2026and defend him from attempts on his life.\nA cave along the Veiled Stair houses an ancient mogu secret that might shed light on the origins of the saurok, and Garrosh has sent Vol\u2019jin, the chieftain of the Darkspear, on a mission to investigate. But the Warchief may have ulterior motives, and Vol\u2019jin doesn\u2019t trust him. That\u2019s where you come in.

Acting on Garrosh\u2019s orders, you must journey into the mine to retrieve whatever remains of the botched excavation. The risks are high, and you might pay with your life \u2013 something the Warchief is more than willing to sacrifice if you fail.\nDomination Point.\nFend off the Alliance invasion of Domination Point!\nDomination point is the fulcrum of Horde expansion onto Pandaria, and it\u2019s no sooner begun construction and reinforcement than it\u2019s begun to be threatened.\nThe soldiers of Lion\u2019s Landing and the fleet of the 7th Legion descend upon the nascent base, hoping to nip Garrosh\u2019s fortifications in the bud. As champion of the Horde, you\u2019ll show the enemy that your people are not easily taken advantage of by pushing them off the beach. But the Alliance\u2019s finest have varied and dangerous talents in warfare \u2013 expect to battle one particular regiment and you\u2019ll almost certainly be surprised.

A local earth spirit, Hui, has recently become incensed with the villagers upon finding out they\u2019d paid adventurers to forcibly remove the indigenous wood sprites from the area.

And perhaps more importantly, who will recover the stolen brew?!\nLion's Landing.\nExpel Horde forces from the keep of Lion\u2019s Landing!\nThe Alliance has found a foothold on the continent of Pandaria, and begun to build up their holdings on the defensible beachfront of Lion\u2019s Landing.\nAs if on cue, the Horde has responded, dispatching a squad of trained soldiers to strike at Lion\u2019s Landing, and shatter Alliance pride and defenses in one brutal assault. In order to ensure that the Landing survives long enough for Alliance forces to expand deeper into Pandaria, you\u2019ll first fight off waves of attackers and then crush the Horde\u2019s commander. Beware \u2013 the Horde\u2019s forces can and will surprise you with their tactics and abilities.

After thousands of years the trolls succeeded in splitting the &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;insect empire&lt;/a&gt; in half, sending them fleeing to the northern and southern reaches of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time the mighty troll empires collapsed, while in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; the aqir slowly evolved into a new, terrifying race - the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to legend, in the aftermath of the war the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vek%27lor\"&gt;Vek'lor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vek%27nilash\"&gt;Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged a need for loyal soldiers of great strength to stand against any future opposition. It is said that the Emperors themselves oversaw the construction of the first &lt;a href=\"Anubisath\"&gt;Anubisath&lt;/a&gt;s in the ever-burning fires beneath &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; - even so the massive warriors were not completed for millennia. When the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the few remaining mortal tales of the once-fearsome aqir were lost, yet still the Qiraji waited, biding their time to strike at an unprepared world. \nAnd so it was that a thousand years ago the Emperors once again commanded an assault to conquer Kalimdor. This time their newest weapons of war were ready, and the mighty Qiraji demonstrated their strength against the prolific &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, a lone Anubisath often smashing through an entire unit of &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough imbued with minimal intelligence, the colossal warriors proved to be highly effective killing machines. While the strongest of these constructs served as elite shock troops, &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; placed most of the Anubisaths on the front line, knowing that the massive warriors would strike fear in the hearts of the elves.\nDuring the war, as the elves faced impending defeat, the Arch-Druid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; persuaded the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to join the fray. Amid the frenzied battle outside Ahn'Qiraj the dragons directed their wrath at the Anubisath constructs.\nThe few Anubisaths capable of casting spells were far from the front lines, and so the dragons were able to concentrate their attacks on the giants with little threat of being countered. Nearly every Anubisath was destroyed in the initial assault, but among them one in particular would prove to be more resourceful than all others combined...\n&lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, three great &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s - &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra of the Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed themselves to aid in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the wall prevented the Qiraji from venturing out, the insect empire refused to remain idle. In preparation for their reemergence in the world, the shadowy master of Ahn'Qiraj commanded Emperor Vek'lor to create a new obsidian statue superior to all other Destroyers. Vek'lor sought his twin brother's aid in the task, and while Vek'nilash used his physical might to craft a grand body of volcanic rock, Vek'lor fortified the shell with powerful magic.\nEmperor Vek'lor named the finished construct &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt;, and observed as the dark master infused it with life. He was pleased and surprised to find that the improved &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; was far more versatile than its earlier counterparts. The Twin Emperors intended to use Moam as a colossal weapon, knowing that its strengths would help it survive in the thick of melee as well as magical combat-but they did not expect for the construct's abilities to advance further without their own assistance.\nFar more surprising, even to the arcane emperors, was Moam's ability to summon burning elementals crafted of pure mana.\nIt was only after Vek'lor witnessed this demonstration of Moam's unbridled power that the source of the construct's seemingly limitless energy was revealed - three tortured dragons: Arygos, Merithra and Caelestrasz, trapped alive within Ahn'Qiraj but not granted the mercy of death as the emperors had believed.\nThe twins were stunned to learn that their overseer had somehow bound the three dragons, then drained their inherent magical energy and corrupted it for his own use - fortifying not only Moam, but the rest of his twisted creations as well. Truly, it seemed as if there was no limit to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;Ancient One&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian Destroyers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe combined forces of the night elves had proven themselves a formidable enemy to the Qiraji, but during the War of the Shifting Sands it was the Bronze Dragonflight that first taught the insect race the meaning of fear.\nAs the dragons slaughtered wave after wave of &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;, losing few of their own in the process, the Twin Emperors realized their forces were ill-equipped to deal with such powerful creatures of magic.\nTo combat this shortcoming, Emperor Vek'lor focused his efforts on designing a mechanism capable of fighting the ancient wyrms. These preliminary efforts, however, were wrought with failure.\nAided by whisperings from his ancient master, Vek'lor pressed on and developed a new kind of construct. Though pleased with his progress, even the Qiraji emperor could not guess what dark purpose lay in store for the machines.\nLittle is known about how the first Obsidian Destroyers were created, but legends speak of Vek'lor himself hammering out the first statue in a molten forge beneath the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj. To Vek'lor's surprise, his inert creations were quickly imbued with limited sentience by his shadowy overseer, as well as a mysterious power - the ability to drain the magical energies of living creatures. In addition these energies could be stored and then released in a tremendous burst of incendiary mana, making Vek'lor's latest creations among the deadliest in the Qiraji arsenal.\nThe first Destroyers proved extremely effective; the dragons were not accustomed to fighting enemies that were capable of retaliating from a distance, and they never found an effective way to counter the mana-draining powers of these obsidian statues. And so &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, child of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, sought the aid of the remaining dragonflights and history tells us that the Qiraji were sealed behind the Scarab Wall shortly thereafter.\nThose dragons who survived the war still dread the return of these magic-stealing monstrosities. \n&lt;a href=\"Ossirian%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Ossirian the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the War of the Shifting Sands, as the Anubisath constructs crumbled under the Bronze Dragonflight's assault, a single Anubisath did the seemingly impossible - he found a way to fight back.\nOssirian targeted one of the leaders, the massive dragon &lt;a href=\"Grakkarond\"&gt;Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt;, and hurled his obsidian sword through the beast's wing. The crippled wyrm descended, crushing the Qiraji as it fell. The dragon mauled Ossirian nearly to death, but the remaining Anubisaths and Qiraji now had a target on the ground to focus on, and they swiftly converged and overwhelmed the noble dragon.\nOssirian's beaten body was dragged back to the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj following the battle, where he should by all rights have perished. It is whispered that Ossirian found the favor of the malevolent force that reigns over the Qiraji, for in spite of his wounds, the construct survived.\nWhen the mighty Anubisath awoke, he found himself transformed, his strength bolstered and his wounded head bound in the visage of a hawk. Emperor Vek'nilash himself explained what had occurred: Where all others - including the Qiraji &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; - had failed to find a way to counterattack, the Anubisath had succeeded. For that he received a gift; Ossirian's essence had been bound to several ancient crystals of distant origin, which would grant the Anubisath champion near invulnerability. There was a price for this boon however; Ossirian's life was maintained by the crystals, and if he should ever stray too far from them, the Anubisath would swiftly die.\nAs others learned of Ossirian's survival, the Anubisaths began to refer to him as the \"Unscarred\", revering him as a nearly invincible hero.\nThe legends say that Vek'nilash secretly entrusted Ossirian with the responsibility of maintaining a watch over General Rajaxx, to ensure that the commander would never fail again.\nOssirian serves the Emperors to the best of his ability, despite the frustration of being eternally bound to a single location. The bones of Grakkarond have become a sacred site to the Anubisaths; a testimony to their ability to defeat even the most powerful of enemies."}

These articles overviewed the different mounts available in World of Warcraft prior to Cataclysm. The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nWorld of Warcraft offers a variety of mounts for the different races of Azeroth. Humans, for example, generally ride horses, and Orcs tend to favor their trusted wolf mounts. A mount is a special type of permanent pet that a player can own. Using one requires the riding talent, and with extensive training, riding specialists will be able to use mounts not generally available to their particular race.\nMore than mere status symbols, mounts allow players to travel over land more quickly than on foot. When a player is mounted, he or she has full control over the mount. To avoid exploiting monsters, players cannot attack while mounted. Also, monsters are unable to attack mounts. Instead, when a player is mounted, all attacks and damage are directed at the player and not at the mount. If a player dies while on a mount, the mount will \"unsummon\" and be available for \"resummoning\" once the player reenters the world of the living.\nRacial Mounts.\nAlliance.\nElekks\nHorses.\nThe strong bond between the humans of Azeroth and their warhorses has existed for generations. However, since the fall of Lordaeron, only select varieties continue to be bred throughout Alliance-controlled lands. Most prized among these are the stately Evendales of Elwynn Forest, renowned for their loyalty and even tempers. These horses command a hefty sum, but they reward their owners with steadiness and speed.\nMechanostriders.\nThe gnomes' revolutionary mechanostrider represents yet another marvel of their engineering prowess. Each strider is specifically designed with the individual rider in mind. They are constructed using state-of-the-art steam compression, servo-motor dynamics, and duro-steel plating. This offers the rider a reliable and durable means of transportation. Some claim that the mechanostrider's lack of true sentience makes for a very dumb mount. However, the gnomes counter that under a skilled rider, the mechanostrider is more responsive than even the best trained live mount.\nNightsabers.\nBefore they were domesticated by the Sentinel Army and trained as mounts, Kalimdor's savage nightsaber panthers were considered to be among the continent's most vicious inhabitants. While many of these grand predatory beasts still prowl the dusky shores and forests of the night elves' homeland, the finest pedigrees of the species, recognized by their superior swiftness and agility, now serve a more practical purpose for those skilled enough to ride them.\nRams.\nDistinguished by their shaggy coats and massive horns, Barak Tor'ol mountain rams are simple yet proud animals whose fearlessness is matched only by that of their dwarven masters. While these good-natured animals lack ferocity, they compensate with uncommon durability and strength. The thickness of their fur helps them withstand the biting winds of Khaz Modan and the sharp claws of the mountain beasts that populate the region.\nHorde.\nHawkstriders\nKodos.\nSwifter and slightly smaller than their wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders.\nRaptors.\nThe savage ferocity of Kalimdor's raptors has enthralled the Darkspear trolls since their arrival. They consider a raptor to be the truest form of a hunter, and as such, the tamed Troll Raptor is their mount of choice. A tamed raptor is truly a fearsome beast, as a skilled troll is able to channel the reptilian steed's savagery to suit the rider's will. A tamed raptor is also one of the most auspicious signs of status amongst the trolls; many have died trying to tame these swift and deadly hunter beasts, and to possess one indicates great station. \nSkeletal Horses.\nNot even the noble steeds that succumbed to the Plague are allowed any rest in the hands of the Forsaken. Through an arcane mix of alchemy and necromancy - the Royal Apothecary Society has raised numerous fallen steeds to serve as mounts for the vengeful dead. These undead steeds are as strong as they were in life, and far more resilient. An unfortunate characteristic, however - one that the Forsaken are none too enamored with is the steeds almost universal stubbornness. From death and beyond, the mighty steeds still cling to the willful spirit that served them in life.\nWolves.\nWolves are indigenous to many parts of Azeroth. They live on every known continent and have a wide variety of subspecies and social habits. Although most are hostile toward anyone who trespasses on their territories, a few unique dire wolf packs have befriended the Horde in recent years. These cunning and ferocious creatures have found an especially welcome home among the orcs, who admire their endurance and keen survival instincts.\nFlying Mounts.\nLess than twenty years ago, the orcs' former homeworld, Draenor, was ripped apart by the violent energies of several dimensional portals that tore the very fabric of the planet to pieces. This catastrophic event left Draenor a broken, shattered world that the survivors came to call Outland. To this day, some parts of Outland are still unreachable by foot or boat, floating eerily on the horizon as silent reminders of the terrible fate that befell Draenor. Yet the denizens of Outland have adapted and learned to harness some of the indigenous species as flying mounts, allowing adventurers to reach even the most remote and dangerous regions of this wild, untamed world.\nClass Specific Mounts.\nPaladin.\nPossessed of a noble spirit and deceptive intelligence uncommon among its kind, the warhorse is a regal charger that only the most inspiring of paladins can call to service. Once it pledges its service to a worthy master, the warhorse holds to its responsibility as a loyal mount and steadfast companion with a devotion that cannot be found in its lesser cousins. The paladins warhorse is more than a steed; it is a tireless cohort for its valorous master, carrying the paladin across Azeroth on a ceaseless crusade to vanquish evil wherever it may lurk. \nWarlock.\nThe remote plains of Desolace were once home to a unique breed of horse too proud and wild to countenance riders. Yet it is precisely this willful conceit that enticed the elders of the Shadow Council to bind these majestic steeds to their service with dark rituals too horrific to perform by any but the most depraved of warlocks. Although they retain their imposing forms, these newly-christened felsteeds have become twisted with infernal energies, treading flames and breathing fire. Where their eyes once shone with exuberance and a zest for life, they now burn with hatred for the warlocks who corrupted them and anguish at the passing of the lives they once knew. \nDeath Knight.\nDeathcharger.\nDuring their training, every death knight learns to summon the deathcharger land mount. \nWinged Steed of the Ebon Blade.\nThe Death Knight can purchase a special flying mount from the Knights of the Ebon Blade. The speed of this mount automatically scales to your current Riding skill level.\nPlayer vs. Player.\nStormpike Riding Ram.\nNot long after Prospector Stormpike and his expedition arrived in the Alterac Mountains, they began tracking the movements of these massive rams, hoping to tame them for use as beasts of burden. This proved to be no easy task, as the rams possessed the most cantankerous demeanor of any beasts the adventurers had ever come across. Even after the prospectors managed to wrangle the animals into pens, only one out of every fifty responded to training.\nIt is said that the Stormpike Rams reserve their loyalty for riders of the most exceptional character. It is also believed, however, that once this trust has been established the rams will maintain fierce devotion to their masters up until the very moment of their death. \nFrostwolf Riding Wolf.\nLong ago, before the First War, the warlock Gul'dan exiled a clan of orcs called the Frostwolves to a hidden valley deep in the heart of the Alterac Mountains. These orcs befriended much of the indigenous wildlife, including the massive Frostwolf Worgs. These wolves proved to be not only swift, but deadly as well, helping the orcs turn the tide of countless battles throughout the years.\nIn recent times, after Thrall's successful uniting of the clans, the Frostwolf orcs have consented to share their beloved mounts with Horde members everywhere as a sign of solidarity. The worgs themselves have answered the call, and many Horde riders now count the wolves as their most trustworthy companions. \nOther/Special Mounts.\nAside from the more customary racial and class mounts associated with your character, there are many special mounts that can be obtained through non-conventional means. All of the special mounts listed below are \"very fast\" (increases your speed by 100%) unless noted otherwise.\nMiscellaneous.\n[\"List of Miscellaneous Mounts\"]\nWorld Event Mounts.\nThese mounts can only be earned during particular world events. Some only last for the duration of the particular world event, while others are permanent. \n[\"List of World Event Mounts\"]\nTalbuks.\nTalbuks are a type of wild, stag-like creatures indigenous to Nagrand, and a favored food of the draenei. Talbuk mounts are available to both factions. They are purchased from vendors in Telaar, Nagrand (Alliance) and Garadar, Nagrand (Horde).\nQiraji Battle Tanks.\nAdventurers in the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj may come across and obtain resonating crystals of various colors. These crystals emit a high frequency sound, forcing a silithid tank to burrow out from its home beneath the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. The silithid is obedient to the summoner and can be used as a mount within the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj only. Any hostile action towards the rider forces the tank underground."}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nNight Elf.\nAlliance \nThe ancient and reclusive night elves have played a pivotal role in shaping Azeroth\u2019s fate throughout its history. More than ten thousand years ago, their heroics during the War of the Ancients helped stave off the demonic Burning Legion\u2019s first invasion. When the scattered remnants of the Legion on Azeroth rallied together with the vile satyrs centuries later, the night elves again rose to meet the threat. The ensuing War of the Satyr exacted a heavy toll from the night elves, but ultimately they vanquished the forces that had set out to wreak havoc on their world.\nThe Legion\u2019s emergence, however, had forever changed night elven society. The night elves had resolved to shun the practice of arcane magic because its reckless use had attracted the Legion to Azeroth. They cultivated a peaceful, naturalistic existence along the slopes of Mount Hyjal under the leadership of Tyrande Whisperwind. For many long years, Tyrande oversaw night elven governance, ever vigilant for signs of further demonic incursions. Much of this time was spent apart from her love, Malfurion Stormrage, who, alongside his fellow druids, upheld the balance of nature from within the Emerald Dream.\nThe night elves\u2019 tranquil existence was shattered again when the Burning Legion launched a new invasion of Azeroth. At the height of this conflict\u2014known as the Third War\u2014the Legion and its terrifying undead Scourge assaulted the night elves\u2019 lands. After awakening Malfurion and his druids from their slumber in the Dream, Tyrande gathered the other night elves, and they fought alongside the Horde and the Alliance to defeat the demon lord Archimonde and his minions at the summit of Mount Hyjal.\nAlthough victorious, the night elves suffered greatly from the battle. Their beloved World Tree Nordrassil, created and blessed by the Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu to grant the night elves immortality, had given off a massive blast of energy to slay Archimonde. To facilitate this colossal explosion, the night elves had chosen to forever sacrifice their protection from aging, disease, and frailty.\nOver time, Nordrassil slowly began to heal its wounds, but a number of druids led by Fandral Staghelm desired to create another World Tree that would restore the night elves\u2019 immortality. Malfurion warned against this act of self-interest, but when he suddenly fell into a coma, his spirit lost within the Dream, Fandral forged ahead with his plans unopposed. The second World Tree, Teldrassil, was planted off the northern coast of Kalimdor, and eventually it towered among the clouds.\nUnlike Nordrassil, this new World Tree was not blessed by the Dragon Aspects, and thus it did not restore the night elves\u2019 immortality. Rather, Teldrassil became tainted due to the Emerald Nightmare, a dark malady that had taken root within the Dream. In addition, it was learned that Malfurion\u2019s dire ailment had been caused by this shadowy force. When he was finally awakened from his comatose state, Malfurion set about cleansing Teldrassil of its corruption, and he led efforts to contain the sinister Nightmare.\nThese momentous events have raised spirits throughout night elven society. Even so, this valiant race now faces many new challenges. Recent Horde attacks have seized night elven lands in Ashenvale, while areas along Kalimdor\u2019s western coast have been decimated by the catastrophic upheavals unleashed in the wake of the Cataclysm. Still struggling to cope with the loss of their immortality, the night elves must prepare to stand against any threat as Azeroth itself breaks apart at the seams.\nStart Location: Teldrassil.\nThe loss of the first World Tree, Nordrassil, during the Third War ushered in a new era in night elven history\u2014one in which this venerable race would no longer be immune to aging, disease, and frailty. As the night elves struggled to cope with their fate, Fandral Staghelm and a group of like-minded druids conspired to create a new World Tree that would restore the night elves\u2019 cherished immortality. Through these druids\u2019 efforts, Teldrassil was planted off the coast of northern Kalimdor, and the bulk of night elven society took up residence atop the new World Tree\u2019s mighty boughs.\nTeldrassil, however, was not blessed by the Dragon Aspects as Nordrassil had been, and thus the new World Tree did not change the fact that the night elves were mortal. Even worse, the World Tree and its inhabitants began to manifest signs of an unnatural ailment, later revealed to have been caused by the Emerald Nightmare. Much to the night elves\u2019 dismay, it was discovered that Fandral had fallen to the Nightmare\u2019s influence and had allowed Teldrassil\u2019s corruption to take hold. Ultimately, Fandral\u2019s wayward schemes were thwarted by the powerful archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, and Teldrassil was cleansed. To punctuate the victory over the Nightmare, the Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza and Ysera blessed the tree to ensure its vitality in the years to come. Yet as great and noble as this blessing was, it did not restore the night elves\u2019 immortality.\nOf late, Teldrassil\u2019s recovery has slowed, and signs of the Nightmare\u2019s corruption have resurfaced. Already burdened by political tension and the vast destruction unleashed by the Cataclysm, the night elves must now ascertain the cause of their beloved World Tree\u2019s ailment and refocus their efforts on the dire situation facing Azeroth.\nHome City: Darnassus.\nAtop the massive boughs of the second World Tree, Teldrassil, lies the wondrous city of Darnassus. The elegant bridges, beautiful groves, and leaf-covered pathways that dot the city\u2019s landscape are testaments to the night elves\u2019 reverence for nature. One of Darnassus\u2019s most notable structures is the stunning Temple of the Moon, the center of worship for High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and her Sisters of Elune.\nDarnassus is home to night elves of all vocations, and the city has recently opened its doors to human refugees from Gilneas as well. Many of these embattled humans have contracted a strange curse that transforms them into feral wolf-beasts known as worgen. Although they\u2019re usually reclusive, the night elves have allowed these outsiders into Darnassus because they know the perils of the Gilneans\u2019 cursed state all too well: it was, in fact, a group of night elf druids that created Azeroth\u2019s first worgen millennia ago. Despite the arrival of these new residents, Darnassus remains a symbol of the night elves\u2019 rich culture and glorious history.\nRacial Mount: Nightsaber.\nNightsabers are considered to be among Kalimdor\u2019s most vicious creatures. In ancient times, none of the continent\u2019s denizens was safe from these agile beasts\u2019 swift and ruthless attacks. The night elves saw great potential in the ferocious nightsabers, domesticating the species\u2019 finest pedigrees to act as battle mounts. In particular, the highly trained Sentinels used them to great effect while patrolling the borders of night elven lands. To this day, nightsabers remain an invaluable part of the night elves\u2019 culture as companions, hunters, and mounts.\nLeader: High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage.\nSince the War of the Ancients, High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and her mate, Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, have led the once-immortal night elves. Time and again, Tyrande\u2019s and Malfurion\u2019s wise guidance has helped the night elves prevail against the demonic Burning Legion and other perilous enemies. For many of the past ten thousand years, however, Tyrande has borne the mantle of leadership alone while Malfurion has spent long stretches of time preoccupied with his duties in the Emerald Dream.\nShortly after the Third War, Malfurion became trapped within the Emerald Nightmare, a shadowy affliction that had spread throughout the Dream. Due to Tyrande\u2019s brave actions, Malfurion was later freed, leading to a grand reunion and wedding between the two leaders. Now, amid political turmoil, natural disasters, and violent Horde incursions into night elven lands, Malfurion and Tyrande are focused on leading their people into Azeroth\u2019s uncertain future, just as they have done in ages past."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nOrc.\nHorde \nUnlike the other races of the Horde, orcs are not native to Azeroth. Initially, they lived as shamanic clans on the lush world of Draenor. They abandoned their peaceful culture when Kil\u2019jaeden, a demon lord of the Burning Legion, corrupted the orcs and used them in his vengeful plot against the draenei, who were exiles from Kil\u2019jaeden\u2019s homeworld.\nBecause of the demons\u2019 manipulation, most of the orc chieftains drank the blood of a Burning Legion pit lord, Mannoroth the Destructor. This act infused the orcs with power, but at a great price: they were now enslaved to the Legion. Constant exposure to fel energies turned the orcs\u2019 naturally brown skin to a sickly green, and the orcs\u2019 usage of fel magic caused their ancestral lands to wither and die.\nAs Kil\u2019jaeden had planned, the orcs succeeded in killing most of the draenei population. Now Kil\u2019jaeden was ready to test the orcs\u2019 effectiveness against another old enemy. Thousands of years before, the demons had launched an invasion of Azeroth that had ultimately failed, but this time the orcs could fight in the Legion\u2019s stead. To that end, the corrupted human archmage Medivh contacted the orc warlock Gul\u2019dan. Together they constructed the Dark Portal, which allowed the orcs to travel to Azeroth.\nAfter their arrival, the orcs crushed the unsuspecting human kingdom of Stormwind. The mighty orc armies, known as the Horde, then pressed north through the Eastern Kingdoms, and their victory was nearly assured for a time. Eventually, however, internal conflicts resulted in the orcs\u2019 defeat, and those who did not die in battle were rounded up and placed in internment camps. But a young slave named Thrall managed to escape from captivity and join a liberation force consisting of Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer and other free orcs. When Doomhammer fell in combat, Thrall became the new warchief of the Horde and the inheritor of Doomhammer\u2019s namesake weapon.\nThrall and his people later journeyed across the sea to the distant continent of Kalimdor. Within the forests of Ashenvale, the warchief and his mentor, Grommash Hellscream, confronted Mannoroth. In the end, Grom gave his life to kill the pit lord and remove the blood-curse from the orcs forever. A new chapter began for the orcs: war was no longer the driving focus of their culture, and they settled the land along Kalimdor\u2019s eastern coastline, which Thrall named Durotar.\nYears later, the warchief and many others returned to the remnants of Draenor, now known as Outland, to prevent another attack from the Burning Legion. There Thrall met Garrosh, son of Grom Hellscream, and convinced him to join the Horde and return to Azeroth as an advisor. Garrosh was a leading commander during the battles against the Lich King in Northrend, and also gained popularity for his fiery personality.\nIn addition to his commitments as leader of the Horde, Thrall was a dedicated shaman with close ties to the elements. When he noticed severe disturbances in the elemental spirits, Thrall knew that he had to step down as warchief in order to investigate the situation lest all of Azeroth fall into chaos. Given his options, Thrall believed that Garrosh was the clear choice for warchief. But the impulsive young Hellscream is much more aggressive than his diplomatic predecessor. With the equally tempestuous King Varian Wrynn back on the throne of Stormwind, it seems likely that the orcs will need their famed strength now more than ever.\nStart Location: Durotar.\nThe dry, harsh land of Durotar is home to some of the toughest creatures on Azeroth. Unwary travelers may fall prey to venomous scorpids, ferocious crocolisks, or angry quilboar. Thrall chose to settle this inhospitable area after the Third War as penance for the orcs\u2019 past transgressions. He named the land after his father, Durotan, former chieftain of the Frostwolf clan. Following the Cataclysm, many of the orcish settlements were flooded or destroyed, and the Northwatch soldiers at Tiragarde Keep have become more aggressive than ever. As relations worsen between the Alliance and the Horde, it is essential that the orcs contain these threats swiftly to ensure the survival of their people.\nHome City: Orgrimmar.\nNamed for the former Horde warchief Orgrim Doomhammer, this capital was rapidly constructed when the orcs first settled in Durotar. Garrosh Hellscream has recently rebuilt most of the city\u2019s architecture, and now Orgrimmar\u2019s fortresses rank among the most imposing on Azeroth. Spiked metal towers line the city\u2019s streets, and the red-and-black banners of the Horde wave from every post. Most of the various races have separated into their own districts, from the tauren in the Valley of Wisdom to the trolls in the Valley of Spirits. Grommash Hold towers over all else, allowing Garrosh Hellscream to keep a close watch on his people.\nRacial Mount: Wolf.\nLong ago, the orcs tamed the large and swift wolves of Draenor. These massive canines came to be the orcs\u2019 chosen companions as well as their favored method of transportation. The wolves\u2019 unflinching temperament made them especially well-suited for battling large prey. When the orcs became more warlike and invaded Azeroth, their wolves were bred for size and stamina so they could bear armored riders into battle. Dire wolves remain the favored mounts for orc fighters and can be purchased in the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar.\nLeader: Garrosh Hellscream Warchief of the Horde.\nGarrosh grew up on Draenor in the shadow of his father, the great warrior Grommash Hellscream. Chieftain of the Warsong clan, Grom was the first orc leader to drink the blood of Mannoroth, subjugating the orcs to the Legion\u2019s will. Before this event, Garrosh was among several orcs who had become ill with the red pox. They had been quarantined far away in Nagrand, allowing them to escape the demonic corruption. The younger Hellscream was ashamed of his father for many years until he met Thrall and learned of Grom\u2019s heroic redemption. Garrosh has since embraced his potential as a strong leader, most notably in Northrend, where he directed the Horde advance through the Borean Tundra and won the hearts of his people. Uncompromising and fiercely proud, Hellscream intends to restore the orcs\u2019 glory by any means necessary."}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nPandaren.\nAlliance / Horde \nCouched in myth and legend, rarely seen and even more rarely understood, the enigmatic pandaren have long been a mystery to the other races of Azeroth. The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of man and before even the sundering of the world.\nDenizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu and established a pandaren empire that would prosper for thousands of years. \nHonorable and filled with a love of good company, good food -- and every now and then, a good friendly brawl -- the pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world. However, every now and then, a pandaren is born with a thirst for adventure that rivals his or her thirst for a strong drink, and he or she strikes out to explore beyond Pandaria\u2019s shores. One of the most famous such wanderers was the brewmaster Chen Stormstout, who set out looking for exotic ingredients for his special ale and wound up an integral part of the founding of the Horde.\nDuring the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since...\nStart Location: The Wandering Isle.\nIt is the rare pandaren indeed who sought a way beyond the mists of Pandaria. Generations ago, pandaren explorers began to gather on the back of a giant turtle: Shen-zin Su. This great sea turtle roamed Azeroth's oceans for hundreds of years, eventually losing contact with their mist-shrouded homeland.\nHere on the \u201cWandering Isle\u201d young, eager pandaren train and learn, engaging in mock combat against one another and mastering the tools and forms of martial arts.\nWhen Shen-zin Su travels near the Maelstrom, life on the Wandering Isle\u2014once pacific and enlightening\u2014is cast into crisis. The ground becomes unstable and Shen-zin Su\u2019s very life is threatened as the great turtle drifts into an unsteady pattern which may be a death spiral.\nAs one of the most promising pandaren wanderers, you must uncover the true threat to the Wandering Isle. But the problem facing the great turtle has several potential solutions, and the students of the isle are split on how to handle it. Your decision will shape the future, and mark the path of the pandaren in a changed world.\nHome Continent:Pandaria.\nShrouded in fog since the world was sundered more than ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures. It is the homeland of the enigmatic pandaren, a race that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace.\nThe new continent reveals itself to a broken world just as the Alliance and Horde are spiraling ever closer to a war that will consume all of Azeroth. Will the mists of Pandaria part to reveal the world's salvation? Or will the battle to control this rich and breathtaking new land push the two mighty factions over the brink of war and into total annihilation?\nRacial Mount: Dragon Turtle.\nThe pandaren have long sought mounts that embody their values: patience and strength. With a naturally armored hide, even gait (no matter how heavy the passenger), and the relaxed attitude that welcomes long journeys, the Dragon Turtle is perfect for the pandaren adventurer. Indigenous to mainland Pandaria, these fine steeds are easily outfitted with the essentials: maps, cushions, footstools, and brew-storage. Comfortable and hardy, the dragon turtle\u2019s slow, even stride will gently ease passengers into new parts of the world and/or a relaxing nap time.\nAlliance Representative: Aysa Cloudsinger.\nAysa Cloudsinger is a follower of the path of Tushui who believes in living a venerable life through meditation, rigorous training, and moral conviction. Graceful and poised, Aysa has attained impeccable form and a refined intellect through diligent practice. To Aysa, to follow the way of Tushui is to defend what is right above all else. She believes that success in any endeavor never justifies dishonorable deeds. While the Alliance contains a diverse mix of cultures, Aysa is attracted to the high ideals and values that cement the Alliance together.\nHorde Representative: Ji Firepaw.\nJi Firepaw, a follower of the more direct Houjin philosophy, is adamant that inaction is the greatest injustice. Ji holds that it is honorable to defend home and family no matter the price. Outgoing, passionate, and not one for deep thought, he is always the first into the fray. Ji finds himself attracted to the scrappy practicality that defines the Horde, and although it costs him dearly, Ji has decided to carry the banner of the Horde upon leaving the Wandering Isle."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nFly the skies of Azeroth! World of Warcraft features an advanced flying transportation network. Players can unlock flying routes, then buy tickets to ride flying mounts over long distances to reduce walking time. Players can travel on four types of air mounts and in Goblin Zeppelins (more on that later)."}
{"id": "661806", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=661806", "title": "Game Guide/Races", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Races,\" a collection of official articles from the World of Warcraft Community Site. These articles overviewed the playable races available in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to \"\". The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe articles also laid out the &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s and other basic gameplay information about each race. However, that information is omitted in this copy.\nArticle content.\nWorld of Warcraft offers ten playable races: Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, Night Elves, Draenei, Orcs, Tauren, Trolls, Undead and Blood Elves. Each of these races has unique racial traits and certain playable classes available to them. These racial traits and class options help them to accomplish their goals in the world.\nThe game's races are further divided into two warring factions: the Alliance and the Horde. Characters can only talk, group, and create guilds with players from their own faction. Certain zones and cities in the world are also friendly to one faction while hostile to the other. Additionally, certain quests can only be completed by members of one faction and not the other.\nAlliance.\nDraenei.\nOne month ago, a terrible explosion tore open the skies above northern Kalimdor. At that moment, the great ship Exodar plummeted from the heavens, and crashed upon the world of Azeroth. Having fled the ravaged world of Outland, the noble draenei used the dimension traveling Exodar to reach safe haven. Inspired by tales of the heroic alliance that stood against the might of the Burning Legion, the draenei have come to enlist aid in retaking their shattered homeland. Dedicated to preserving life and upholding the tenets of the Holy Light, the draenei hope to gather a new coalition of warriors to battle the Burning Legion and put a halt to its horrific Burning Crusade. Armed only with courage and their unshakeable faith in the Light, the draenei look forward to finding the alliance and ushering them towards the destiny that awaits beyond the skies of Azeroth.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nDwarves.\nThe stoic dwarves of Ironforge are an ancient race of robust humanoids who live beneath the snow-capped mountains of Khaz Modan. The Dwarves have always been fast allies with the Humans, and they revel in the prospects of battle and storytelling alike. In past ages, the Dwarves rarely left the safety of their mountain fortresses. However, whenever the call to battle sounded, they rose up to defend their friends and allies with unmatched courage and valor. Due to a recent discovery that uncovered fragments of their ancient origins, the Dwarves have undergone a remarkable transformation. The discovery convinced the Dwarves that the mighty Titans created them from stone when the world was young. They feel that their destiny is now to search the world over for more signs and proof of their enchanted heritage and to rediscover the Titans' hidden legacies. To this end, the Dwarves have sent out their Prospectors to all ends of the world in the hopes of discovering new insight into their shrouded past. These journeys led to Dwarven excavation sites all over the known world, some of which serve as outposts and some of which serve as potential hunting grounds for enemies of the Dwarven race.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nGnomes.\nThe eccentric, often-brilliant Gnomes are one of the most peculiar races of the world. With their obsession for developing radical new technologies and constructing marvels of mind-bending engineering, it's a wonder that any Gnomes have survived to proliferate.\nThriving within the wondrous techno-city of Gnomeregan, the Gnomes shared the resources of the forested Dun Morogh Peaks with their Dwarven cousins. Though the dwarves of Ironforge also have a propensity for technology and engineering - it is the gnomes who provide the critical, visionary designs for most of the Dwarves' weapons and steam vehicles.\nThe Gnomes served the Alliance well during the Second War, but strangely, they refused to send any personnel to aid their allies during the Burning Legion's recent invasion. Though their designs helped turn the tide against the Legion, the Dwarves and Humans were shocked by the Gnomes' decision to withhold their courageous troops and pilots.\nWhen the war ended, the Alliance discovered the reason for the Gnomes' sudden withdrawal. Apparently, an ancient, barbaric menace had risen from the bowels of the earth and invaded Gnomeregan. Knowing that their allies' priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the Gnomes decided to make their stand alone. Though they fought valiantly to save their beloved city, Gnomeregan was irrevocably lost.\nNearly half of the Gnomish race was wiped out during the fall of Gnomeregan. The ragged Gnomes that survived fled to the safety of the Dwarves' stronghold of Ironforge. Committed once again to the Alliance's cause, the Gnomes spend their time devising strategies and weapons that will help them retake their ravaged city and build a brighter future for their people.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nHumans.\nThe Humans of Stormwind are a resilient breed, having survived an invasion by the savage Orcs during the First War. During the Second War, the armies of Stormwind rallied with the Alliance to reclaim their homeland of Azeroth. After the success of the Second War, Stormwind was rebuilt and Human civilization began to flourish once again throughout the southlands. With the recent invasion of the Burning Legion - which left the northern kingdom of Lordaeron in ruins - Stormwind now stands as the last bastion of human civilization. Following the heroic examples of the legendary Sir Lothar and King Llane, the defenders of Stormwind are considered to be among the fiercest warriors in the land. They stand resolute in their charge to maintain the honor and might of humanity in an ever-darkening world.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nNight Elves.\nThe reclusive Night Elves were the first race to awaken in the World of Warcraft. These shadowy, immortal beings were the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before Warcraft I. The Night Elves' reckless use of magic drew the Burning Legion into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their wondrous homeland was shattered and drowned by the sea. Until recently, the Night Elves closed themselves off from the rest of the world and remained hidden atop their holy mountain of Hyjal for many thousands of years. The Legion's invasion brought the Night Elves out of their long period of slumber. They now have renewed interest in shaping the world, and for the first time are allying themselves with other races to insure the continued survival of Azeroth. As a race, Night Elves are typically honorable and just, but they are very distrusting of the 'lesser races' of the world. They are nocturnal by nature and their shadowy powers often elicit the same distrust that they have for their mortal neighbors.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nHorde.\nBlood Elves.\nFor nearly seven thousand years, the high elves cultivated a shining magical kingdom deep within the forests of northern Lordaeron. But five years ago, the undead Scourge invaded Quel'Thalas and drove the elves to the brink of extinction. Led by the evil death knight Arthas, the Scourge destroyed the mystical Sunwell, thereby severing the elves from the source of their arcane power. Though the scars of that conflict are evident, the remaining elves have banded together and retaken much of their homeland. Calling themselves \"blood elves\", these grim survivors are committed to regaining the vast powers they once commanded. Inspired by the leadership of their beloved prince, Kael'thas Sunstrider, the blood elves now seek out new sources of arcane magic and the means of defending their land against the undying horrors of the Scourge.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nOrcs.\nThe savage, green-skinned Orcs are one of the most prolific races of Azeroth. They are commonly believed to be brutal and mindless, possessing no humanity or empathy for other races. Born on the hellish world of Draenor, the Orcs were brought into the kingdom of Stormwind through the dimensional gateway known as the Dark Portal and forced to wage war on the Humans. Although few are aware of their history, the Orcs once cultivated a noble, Shamanistic society on the world of Draenor. Tragically, the proud Orc clans were corrupted by the Burning Legion and used as pawns in the Legion's invasion of Azeroth. The Orcs managed to rebel, however, and they were ultimately able to help turn the tide against their demon masters. Led by the young Warchief, Thrall, the Orcs have reclaimed their strength and honor. Now, the Orcs stand ready to fight not for the sake of conquest, but for their right to survive in their adopted world.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nTauren.\nThe Tauren are huge, bestial creatures who live in the grassy, open barrens of central Kalimdor. They live to serve nature and maintain the balance between the wild things of the land and the restless spirit of the elements. Despite their enormous size and brute strength, the remarkably peaceful Tauren cultivate a quiet, tribal society. However, when roused by conflict, Tauren are implacable enemies who will use every ounce of their strength to smash their enemies under hoof. Under the leadership of their ancient chief, Cairne Bloodhoof, the Tauren allied themselves with the Orcs during the invasion of the Burning Legion. The two races have remained steadfast allies ever since. Like the Orcs, the Tauren struggle to retain their sense of tradition and noble identity.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nTrolls.\nThe vicious Jungle Trolls, who populate the numerous islands of the South Seas, are renowned for their cruelty and dark mysticism. Barbarous and superstitious, the wily Trolls carry a seething hatred for all other races.\nOne tribe, however, was forced to overcome its prejudices when it encountered the Orc Warchief, Thrall, and his mighty Horde. The Trolls of the Darkspear tribe, long since exiled from their ancestral lands in Stranglethorn Vale, were nearly destroyed by a band of aquatic Murlocs, but Thrall and the Horde managed to save them. In return the grateful Trolls swore an oath of eternal allegiance to the Horde.\nLed by the cunning Shadow Hunter, Vol'jin, the Darkspear Trolls now make their home in Durotar along with their Orcish allies. Their village, named after their fallen tribal elder, Sen'jin, lies along the eastern coast of the harsh, rocky land. The Darkspear tribe also occupies tracts within the nearby jungles of the Echo Isles.\nAs part of the Horde, the Trolls have extended their loyalty to the mighty Tauren, but they have little trust for the manipulative Forsaken, whom they believe will visit only misery and strife upon their allies.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nUndead.\nHaving broken free from the tyrannical rule of the Lich King, a renegade group of undead seek to retain their own free will while destroying all those who oppose them. Known as the Forsaken, this group is dedicated to serving their leader, the banshee queen Sylvanas Windrunner. These dark warriors have established a secret stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron's former capital city. Situated deep beneath the cursed Tirisfal Glades, the labyrinthine Undercity is a sprawling bastion of evil. Within its shadowy confines, Sylvanas' royal apothecaries scramble to develop a devastating new plague - one which will not only eradicate their hated Scourge rivals, but the rest of humanity as well. To further their dark aims, the Forsaken have entered into an alliance of convenience with the primitive, brutish races of the Horde. Holding no real loyalty for their newfound comrades, the Forsaken have duped them into fighting against their common enemy - the Lich King. Only time will tell how these disciples of doom will fare in their mission of vengeance.\n[\"Racial Traits and Other Information\"]\nReferences.\nThis page and the articles it contained can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20100207231428/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/races/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

'Raids' are assaults by larger groups of players on powerful monsters or dungeons and in World of Warcraft can include everything from a group of lower level characters tackling a quest well above their level to the epic end-game, high-level attacks against god-like foes. We previously spoke with designer Jeffrey Kaplan, who has been heading up the world and raid design, to hear his thoughts on where raids are heading in World of Warcraft and how they'll be implemented.

It is there in the dark recesses of the mountain's peak that Nefarian has begun to unfold the final stages of his plan to destroy Ragnaros once and for all and lead his army to undisputed supremacy over all the races of Azeroth.\nClick &lt;a href=\"Underdev/Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about Blackwing Lair.\nMolten Core.\nThe Molten Core lies at the very bottom of Blackrock Depths. It is the heart of Blackrock Mountain and the exact spot where, long ago in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the dwarven civil war, Emperor Thaurissan summoned the elemental Firelord, Ragnaros, into the world. Though the fire lord is incapable of straying far from the blazing Core, it is believed that his elemental minions command the Dark Iron dwarves, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious elementals to pass through. Chief among Ragnaros' agents is Majordomo Executus - for this cunning elemental is the only one capable of calling the Firelord from his slumber.\nNaxxramas.\nFloating above the Plaguelands, the necropolis known as Naxxramas serves as the seat of one of the Lich King's most powerful officers, the dreaded lich Kel'Thuzad. Horrors of the past and new terrors yet to be unleashed are gathering inside the necropolis as the Lich King's servants prepare their assault. Soon the Scourge will march again...\nLearn more about the events that darkened the fate of Kel'Thuzad, and ultimately of all Azeroth, in &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Damnation\"&gt;Road to Damnation&lt;/a&gt;.\nWatch the Naxxramas trailer &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20the%20Necropolis%20trailer\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnyxia's Lair.\nOnyxia is the daughter of the mighty dragon Deathwing, and sister of the scheming Nefarion Lord of Blackrock Spire. It is said that Onyxia delights in corrupting the mortal races by meddling in their political affairs. To this end it is believed that she takes on various humanoid forms and uses her charm and power to influence delicate matters between the different races. Some believe that Onyxia has even assumed an alias once used by her father - the title of the royal House Prestor. When not meddling in mortal concerns, Onyxia resides in a fiery cave below the Dragonmurk, a dismal swamp located within Dustwallow Marsh. There she is guarded by her kin, the remaining members of the insidious Black Dragon Flight. \nRuins of Ahn'Qiraj.\nDuring the final hours of the War of the Shifting Sands, the combined forces of the night elves and the four dragonflights drove the battle to the very heart of the qiraji empire, to the fortress city of Ahn'Qiraj. Yet at the city gates, the armies of Kalimdor encountered a concentration of silithid war drones more massive than any they had encountered before. Ultimately the silithid and their qiraji masters were not defeated, but merely imprisoned inside a magical barrier, and the war left the cursed city in ruins. A thousand years have passed since that day, but the qiraji forces have not been idle. A new and terrible army has been spawned from the hives, and the ruins of Ahn'Qiraj are teeming once again with swarming masses of silithid and qiraji. This threat must be eliminated, or else all of Azeroth may fall before the terrifying might of the new qiraji army.\nCheck out some of the enemies you will encounter in the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj:\nTemple of Ahn'Qiraj.\nAt the heart of Ahn'Qiraj lies an ancient temple complex. Built in the time before recorded history, it is both a monument to unspeakable gods and a massive breeding ground for the qiraji army. Since the War of the Shifting Sands ended a thousand years ago, the Twin Emperors of the qiraji empire have been trapped inside their temple, barely contained behind the magical barrier erected by the bronze dragon Anachronos and the night elves. Now that the Scepter of the Shifting Sands has been reassembled and the seal has been broken, the way into the inner sanctum of Ahn'Qiraj is open. Beyond the crawling madness of the hives, beneath the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, legions of qiraji prepare for invasion. They must be stopped at all costs before they can unleash their voracious insectoid armies on Kalimdor once again, and a second War of the Shifting Sands breaks loose!\nZul'Gurub.\nOver a thousand years ago the powerful Gurubashi Empire was torn apart by a massive civil war. An influential group of troll priests, known as the Atal'ai, called forth the avatar of an ancient and terrible blood god named Hakkar the Soulflayer. Though the priests were defeated and ultimately exiled, the great troll empire collapsed upon itself. The exiled priests fled far to the north, into the Swamp of Sorrows, where they erected a great temple to Hakkar in order to prepare for his arrival into the physical world.\nClick &lt;a href=\"Underdev/Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Zul'Gurub.\nRaid Encounters.\nDragons of Nightmare.\nThere is a disturbance at the Great Trees. A new threat menaces these secluded areas found in Ashenvale, Duskwood, Feralas, and Hinterlands. Four great guardians of the Green Dragonflight have arrived from the Dream, but these once-proud protectors now seek only destruction and death. Take arms with your fellows and march to these hidden groves -- only you can defend Azeroth from the corruption they bring.\nClick &lt;a href=\"Game%20Guide/Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the Dragons of Nightmare.\nSomething is amiss in the Emerald Dream. Immense dragons with the shimmering emerald scales of the Green Dragonflight have been sighted guarding the portals at the Great Trees... but these once-noble creatures crawl with a new, strange menace, not the peace for which Ysera is known. Bring many allies should you dare to confront them; their powers are formidable and they will not hesitate to crush any who draw near. \nAzuregos.\nBefore the Great Sundering, the night elf city of Eldarath flourished in the land that is now known as Azshara. It is believed that many ancient and powerful Highborne artifacts may be found among the ruins of the once-mighty stronghold. For countless generations, the Blue Dragon Flight has safeguarded powerful artifacts and magical lore, ensuring that they do not fall into mortal hands. The presence of Azuregos, the blue dragon, seems to suggest that items of extreme significance, perhaps the fabled Vials of Eternity themselves, may be found in the wilderness of Azshara. Whatever Azuregos seeks, one thing is certain: he will fight to the death to defend Azshara's magical treasures.\nLord Kazzak.\nFollowing the defeat of the Burning Legion at the end of the Third War, the remaining enemy forces, led by the colossal demon Lord Kazzak, pulled back to the Blasted Lands. They continue to dwell there to this day in an area called the Tainted Scar, awaiting the reopening of the Dark Portal. It is rumored that once the Portal is reopened, Kazzak will travel with his remaining forces to Outland. Once the orc homeworld of Draenor, Outland was ripped apart by the simultaneous activation of several portals created by the orc shaman Ner'zhul, and now exists as a shattered world occupied by legions of demonic agents under command of the night elf betrayer, Illidan. \nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nTauren.\nHorde \nThe peaceful tauren\u2014known in their own tongue as the shu\u2019halo\u2014have long dwelled in Kalimdor, striving to preserve the balance of nature at the behest of their goddess, the Earth Mother. Until recently, the tauren lived as nomads scattered throughout the Barrens, hunting the great kodo beasts native to the arid region.\nAlthough split into different tribes, the tauren were united by a common enemy: the marauding centaur. These primitive horse-men terrorized central Kalimdor, leaving only death and suffering in their wake. Although the tauren tribes struggled valiantly for survival against their foes, the relentless centaur attacks continued. Over time, the centaur wiped out the area\u2019s wild game, threatening starvation for the beleaguered tauren. During the Third War, the mighty chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof had a chance encounter with the orcish Horde that would alter the destiny of the tauren forever. After befriending Warchief Thrall, Cairne and his Bloodhoof tribe were able to fend off the centaur as they journeyed to the fertile lands of Mulgore. Owing a blood-debt to the orcs for their assistance, the tauren joined Thrall on Mount Hyjal to defend Kalimdor from an invasion by the demonic Burning Legion.\nFollowing the Legion\u2019s defeat, the tauren who helped defend Hyjal returned to their new home in Mulgore. Ruling from the majestic capital of Thunder Bluff, Cairne welcomed tauren of every tribe to this secure refuge. Many tauren who traveled to the capital were content with Cairne\u2019s vision of a peaceful and harmonious future, but at least one tribe felt otherwise. The stern Grimtotem tribe looked upon Kalimdor\u2019s other races as inferior and believed that its matriarch, Magatha, was the only one fit to rule the tauren. Although Magatha constantly disagreed with Cairne over the direction of their nation, the elder crone nonetheless coexisted alongside him in Thunder Bluff without major incident. The Grimtotem tribe did not, however, join the Horde along with Cairne and the tauren under his rule.\nFor years the tauren flourished throughout Mulgore, but tragedy befell the noble race following the campaign against the Lich King in Northrend. Believing that the reckless new warchief, Garrosh Hellscream, would lead the Horde to ruin, Cairne challenged the young upstart to a duel. The tauren high chieftain fought with a ferocity that belied his age, but an act of betrayal had sealed his fate before the battle had even begun. Unbeknownst to either of the duel\u2019s combatants, Magatha had poisoned Garrosh\u2019s blade. After Cairne was wounded by the tainted weapon during combat, he was immobilized by the poison, and Garrosh was able to slay him.\nFollowing the high chieftain\u2019s death, Magatha\u2019s Grimtotem agents stormed Thunder Bluff and seized the tauren capital as their own. They had also hoped to murder Cairne\u2019s son, Baine, but the young tauren managed to elude his would-be assassins. After formulating a strategy to exact retribution upon Magatha, Baine launched a counterattack and wrested Thunder Bluff from the hands of the treacherous matriarch. Ultimately, rather than spill further blood, Baine banished Magatha and all other Grimtotem who still supported her from tauren lands.\nDespite the deadly encounter between Cairne and Garrosh, the tauren have not abandoned their place in the Horde. While many chaotic events have transpired in recent months, Baine has bravely taken up the mantle of tauren leadership and is now focused on ruling just as his wise and benevolent father would have.\nStart Location: Mulgore.\nAfter settling in the grasslands of Mulgore, the mighty tauren established the stunning capital of Thunder Bluff. For years afterward the tauren lived amid central Kalimdor\u2019s serene plains, tending to the well-being of their beloved new home. Yet the recent Cataclysm has had disastrous effects on Mulgore. Driven from their dens south of Thunder Bluff, the barbaric quilboar have swarmed across Red Cloud Mesa, encroaching on Camp Narache. Apart from taking numerous tauren captive, the quilboar have caused giant thorned roots to burst from the ground, choking all life from the once-verdant plains. In light of this, the tauren have vowed to drive away the savage creatures and heal the wounds inflicted upon the land before the damage becomes irreparable.\nHome City: Thunder Bluff.\nEstablished by the wise chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof and his stalwart tribe, Thunder Bluff overlooks the verdant land of Mulgore from atop a series of windswept mesas. Prior to the construction of the capital, the tauren had lived as nomads for countless generations, often under attack by marauding bands of centaur. With Thunder Bluff\u2019s founding, however, the proud and good-spirited race was finally granted a permanent home.\nFollowing Cairne\u2019s death in a duel with Warchief Garrosh Hellscream, Thunder Bluff was briefly seized in a coup by Magatha Grimtotem and elements of her tribe. In retaliation, Cairne\u2019s son, Baine, launched a brilliant counterattack using a fleet of zeppelins. After he strategically divided Magatha\u2019s forces, Baine recaptured Thunder Bluff and assumed his role as the high chieftain of the tauren. Having recovered from the recent unrest, the capital is once again a bastion of peace and security for Kalimdor\u2019s tauren.\nRacial Mount: Kodo.\nTauren legends abound regarding the great horned kodos of Kalimdor\u2019s Barrens. Some myths tell of rare kodos that are bound to the spirits of the sky and storm, thus allowing the colossal beasts to harness the powers of lightning itself. While kodos are generally considered gentle by nature, they are fierce opponents when threatened and have occasionally been known to devour their enemies whole.\nLeader: High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof.\nHigh Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof is the son of the late tauren leader, Cairne Bloodhoof. In addition to embodying his father\u2019s kindness and valor, Baine has developed into a warrior without equal. Following Cairne\u2019s death in a duel with Warchief Garrosh Hellscream, Baine fled his home in Bloodhoof Village when the tauren matriarch Magatha Grimtotem\u2019s agents attacked the village and seized Thunder Bluff. Although still pained by the loss of his father, Baine staged a counterattack on Magatha and her forces, ultimately retaking the tauren capital.\nIn the end, Cairne\u2019s honorable son spared Magatha\u2019s life, banishing the matriarch and her traitorous allies to the harsh Stonetalon Mountains. Since then Baine has assumed the role of high chieftain of Mulgore\u2019s courageous tauren. While bitterness might still linger over Cairne\u2019s demise, Baine has pledged his loyalty to the Horde and its warchief for the good of the tauren race."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nTroll.\nHorde \nThe savage trolls of Azeroth are infamous for their cruelty, dark mysticism, and seething hatred for all other races. Yet one exception among the trolls is the Darkspear tribe and its cunning leader, Vol\u2019jin. Plagued by a history of subservience and exile, this proud tribe was on the brink of extinction when Warchief Thrall and his mighty Horde forces were driven to the trolls\u2019 remote island home in the South Seas during a violent storm.\nLed at that time by Vol\u2019jin\u2019s wise father, Sen\u2019jin, the Darkspears abandoned their prejudices and worked together with Thrall\u2019s orcs to defeat a group of humans encroaching on the jungle isle. With unparalleled bravery, the trolls fought side by side with the Horde to secure victory, but tragedy befell the Darkspears soon afterward. Intent on appeasing a mysterious sea witch, a frenzied band of murlocs captured the isle\u2019s defenders. Although a number of the imprisoned orcs and trolls managed to escape, the noble Sen\u2019jin was slain by his captors.\nIn Sen\u2019jin\u2019s honor, Thrall welcomed the Darkspears into the Horde and offered them sanctuary in a new kingdom that he planned to create across the Great Sea. The trolls accepted Thrall\u2019s offer, and Vol\u2019jin eventually led his tribe to the vibrant jungles of the Echo Isles located just off the rugged coastline of Durotar.\nNot long after they settled on their new home, the Darkspears suffered a terrible betrayal from within. Driven to insanity by the dark powers under his control, the witch doctor Zalazane began enslaving his fellow tribespeople and amassing an army of mindless trolls. For a time, Vol\u2019jin and other uncorrupted Darkspears fled to Durotar\u2019s coast and established Sen\u2019jin Village. From this crude settlement, the trolls struck at Zalazane\u2019s forces, hoping to win back their home at any cost. The Darkspears\u2019 efforts, however, failed to drive Zalazane from the Echo Isles.\nFollowing the victory against the Lich King in the frozen continent of Northrend, Vol\u2019jin renewed his bid to defeat Zalazane and launched a brilliant assault on the isles. With the help of the tribe\u2019s ancestral loa, the courageous Darkspears killed the maddened witch doctor and seized their embattled home.\nOf late, political changes within the Horde have sparked fears among the Darkspear tribe regarding its future. Vol\u2019jin\u2019s close ally Thrall recently named Garrosh Hellscream temporary Horde warchief. Thus far, the brash young orc has put the Darkspear leader and his tribe on edge, causing many trolls to leave the Horde capital, Orgrimmar. Although spirits are high among the Darkspears after Zalazane\u2019s fall, tension lingers concerning what place the trolls will have in Garrosh\u2019s Horde.\nStart Location: Echo Isles.\nThe Echo Isles are a small cluster of tropical landmasses located near the arid coast of Durotar. In addition to being the home of the Darkspear trolls, the archipelago teems with raptors, tigers, and other dangerous predators. Yet the hostile wildlife is the least of the tribe\u2019s worries. Although the Darkspears have liberated the Echo Isles from Zalazane, a mysterious sea witch has recently appeared and begun using her dark sorcery to destroy the trolls\u2019 way of life. Additionally, naga have overtaken territory just north of Darkspear Isle, the seat of power for the tribe and its leader, Vol\u2019jin. Having been exiles throughout their history, the Darkspears are prepared to make any sacrifice in order to protect their home. Even now, a new generation of fearless trolls is training on Darkspear Isle, ready to give its lives for the future of the tribe.\nHome City: Darkspear Isle.\nEver since defeating the traitorous witch doctor Zalazane, Vol\u2019jin and his tribe have worked tirelessly to fortify their home on Darkspear Isle. Covered in a network of huts and bridges, this jungle island has become a symbol of the tribe\u2019s glory, albeit at a time when the trolls\u2019 destiny remains uncertain due to political tension between Vol\u2019jin and Warchief Garrosh Hellscream. Regardless, the Darkspear tribe has vowed to stand firm and face whatever challenges lie ahead.\nRacial Mount: Raptor.\nThe ferocity of Kalimdor\u2019s raptors has enthralled the Darkspear trolls ever since their arrival on the Echo Isles years ago. The tribe considers a raptor to be the purest embodiment of the hunter\u2019s essence, and as such, a tamed reptilian is prized as a mount. Skilled Darkspear riders have even been known to channel their raptors\u2019 savagery to suit their will. Possession of these predators is also one of the most auspicious signs of status among trolls; many have died trying to subdue these swift and deadly raptors, and to control one indicates great station.\nLeader: Vol'jin.\nVol\u2019jin has sworn to do everything in his power to lead the Darkspear tribe just as his late father, Sen\u2019jin, would have. For years Vol\u2019jin resided in Orgrimmar, offering strategic advice to Thrall and assisting with critical operations such as retaking the Undercity after the Forsaken bastion had been usurped by Grand Apothecary Putress and the dreadlord Varimathras. Recently, however, Vol\u2019jin has come into conflict with the Horde\u2019s new warchief, Garrosh Hellscream. Alienated by the orc\u2019s extremism and lust for war, the troll leader helped overthrow him, and has since taken up the mantle of Warchief of the Horde."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nUndead.\nHorde \nDeath offered no escape for the scores of humans killed during the Lich King\u2019s campaign to scour the living from Lordaeron. Instead, the kingdom\u2019s fallen were risen into undeath as Scourge minions and forced to wage an unholy war against everything\u2026 and everyone\u2026 that they once held dear.\nWhen the Lich King\u2019s grasp on his vast armies faltered after the Third War, a contingent of undead broke free of their master\u2019s iron will. Although this freedom seemed to be a blessing at first, these former humans were soon tormented by memories of the unspeakable horrors that they had committed as mindless Scourge agents. Those who did not descend into madness were faced with a chilling realization: the entirety of Azeroth sought their destruction.\nIn their darkest hour, the renegade undead were rallied together by the former ranger-general of Quel\u2019Thalas, Sylvanas Windrunner. Defeated during an attack on her kingdom and transformed into a powerful Scourge banshee, Sylvanas had also regained her freedom from the Lich King. Under their new queen\u2019s guidance, the independent undead \u2013 known as Forsaken \u2013 established the Undercity beneath the ruins of Lordaeron\u2019s capital. While some Forsaken feared Sylvanas, others valued the security she provided. Many of the free-willed undead, however, found a purpose to their cursed existence through the banshee queen\u2019s burning desire to destroy the Lich King.\nDespite not being affiliated with the Scourge, the Forsaken came under threat from humans who were dedicated to eradicating all Forsaken. As a means to further her own goals and protect her budding nation, Sylvanas sent emissaries to various factions in search of allies. The kind-hearted tauren of Thunder Bluff proved to be the most promising contact. Specifically, Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem saw the potential for redemption in Sylvanas\u2019 people, even though he was fully aware of the Forsaken\u2019s sinister nature. Thus, the tauren convinced Warchief Thrall, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde. In the end, the Forsaken\u2019s chances of victory against the Lich King were bolstered, while the Horde gained an invaluable foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nUltimately, the Forsaken assisted the Horde with a massive offensive against the Lich King\u2019s power base in Northrend and exacted vengeance upon their hated enemy. The victory, however, was not without its hurdles. During the invasion, Grand Apothecary Putress unleashed a new plague that killed friend and foe alike, while his traitorous counterpart, the dreadlord Varimathras, seized the Undercity in a coup that nearly killed Sylvanas. The usurpers were slain for their vile deeds and the Forsaken capital was restored, but the debacle created suspicion among the Horde regarding Sylvanas\u2019 loyalties.\nNow, along with being mistrusted by her own allies, Sylvanas recognizes that many of Azeroth\u2019s other inhabitants still see her people as a threat, even after the Lich King\u2019s defeat. As their numbers dwindle by the day, the Forsaken have begun fortifying their holdings around the Undercity, working to prove their loyalty to the Horde\u2019s cause even as they ready themselves for any future attacks.\nStart Location: Tirisfal Glades.\nOnce the heart of Lordaeron, Tirisfal Glades was a land of beautiful rolling hills and golden pastures. When the human kingdom fell to the undead Scourge, this verdant region was transformed into a plagued wasteland, barely able to sustain the dwindling remnants of life that still existed.\nFor years this blighted area has been home to Queen Sylvanas and her Forsaken, as well as the remaining vestiges of the Scarlet Crusade. Their zealots, bent on wiping out any and all undead from Azeroth regardless of affiliation, have long been a thorn in the Forsaken\u2019s side. Recently, the Argent Dawn has offered assistance to Sylvanas\u2019 people against the Crusader\u2019s constant harassment in eastern Tirisfal Glades. In addition, the Forsaken have begun a fresh march on their enemy\u2019s stronghold \u2013 the Scarlet Monastery \u2013 in an effort to finally secure their homeland from external threats.\nHome City: The Undercity.\nDuring the Third War, the once-glorious capital of Lordaeron, Capital City, was decimated by a Scourge army under the command of Prince Arthas Menethil. When the undead continued their campaign against the living throughout the continent, only a small contingent of Arthas\u2019 forces were left behind to carve out a new \u201cUndercity\u201d beneath the ruined capital. Yet these plans were abandoned when Arthas departed for Northrend in order to aid his master, the Lich King.\nYears later, Queen Sylvanas and her renegade undead, known as the Forsaken, claimed the Undercity as their own and completed the winding network of catacombs and crypts that the Scourge had begun constructing. Apart from being momentarily seized by the traitorous Forsaken Grand Apothecary Putress and the dreadlord Varimathras, the Undercity has remained in firm control of Sylvanas ever since. Today, rivers of poisonous sludge flow through all avenues of the vast Undercity. The toxic fumes and fetid odors permeating every corner of the stronghold have made it a place almost unbearable for the living members of the Horde. Yet for Sylvanas and her cursed followers, the Undercity has become a much-needed refuge in a world where her kind is still feared and hunted.\nRacial Mount: Skeletal Horse.\nWhen the Lich King\u2019s plague of undeath swept through Lordaeron, it decimated more than just the kingdom\u2019s human population. Many of the noble horses living in the region also succumbed to the affliction, and much like their human counterparts, they were not granted peace in death. Through their mastery of alchemy and necromancy, the Royal Apothecary Society has raised these fallen steeds into undeath in order to bolster the Forsaken\u2019s effectiveness in battle and also provide a means for everyday transportation. Although strong and resilient, these mighty steeds have earned a reputation among their handlers as being incredibly stubborn. Regardless, having no need for sleep or sustenance has made these skeletal horses the perfect counterparts for their relentless masters.\nLeader: Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner.\nIn life, Sylvanas Windrunner was the valiant ranger-general of Quel\u2019Thalas, a high elf whose leadership acumen and martial prowess were without equal. During the Third War, she bravely defended her kingdom from a Scourge invasion led by the death knight Arthas. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas fell in battle. Rather than honor the ranger-general with a quick death, Arthas ripped out her soul and transformed it into a banshee: a cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich King empowered by hate.\nWhen the Lich King\u2019s control over his minions weakened, Sylvanas broke away from her tyrannical master\u2019s control and reclaimed her body. Vowing to avenge her death, Sylvanas gathered other renegade undead and set out to wage war against the Scourge. Thus it was that the Forsaken and their banshee queen came to be. Under Sylvanas\u2019 command, the Forsaken joined the Horde and later helped bring about the Lich King\u2019s fall in the frozen wastes of Northrend.\nYet many challenges still lay ahead for Sylvanas. After an uprising within her ranks that killed other members of the Horde, the banshee queen is now mistrusted by many of her allies. Most recently, Sylvanas began fortifying her territory within the Tirisfal Glades in order to establish a proper kingdom for her followers. While Sylvanas maintains that her loyalty to the Horde is undiminished, some of the faction\u2019s members are uncertain about her true intentions."}

These articles overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\" prior to . The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nWorgen.\nAlliance \nBehind the formidable Greymane Wall, a terrible curse has spread throughout the isolated human nation of Gilneas, transforming many of its stalwart citizens into nightmarish beasts known as worgen. The origins of this curse have been fiercely debated, but only recently has the startling truth come to light.\nLong ago, amid a brutal war between the night elves and the demonic satyrs in Kalimdor, a group of druids practiced a powerful yet unwieldy form that embodied the fury of the wolf Ancient, Goldrinn. Taught by Ralaar Fangfire, these Druids of the Pack sought to temper the uncontrollable rage inherent in their chosen form. To do so, they willingly submitted to the energies of the Scythe of Elune, a mystical artifact created from Goldrinn\u2019s fang and the staff of Elune.\nRather than abate the druids\u2019 fury, however, the weapon transformed Ralaar and his followers into worgen: bestial humanoids enslaved by their own primal instincts. Blinded by all-consuming rage, Ralaar\u2019s druids tore through friend and foe alike during battle with the satyrs. Night elves wounded by the unruly beasts contracted a virulent curse that turned them into worgen as well. Desperate to stanch the affliction\u2019s spread, Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage mournfully banished the worgen to a pocket dimension of the Emerald Dream, where they would be in peaceful slumber for all eternity.\nThe worgen threat was contained for millennia, until Archmage Arugal managed to pull the wolf-beasts from the Dream. Summoned by order of King Genn Greymane, the worgen were used to battle Scourge forces encroaching on the kingdom of Gilneas. Yet the feral creatures soon spread their curse throughout the human population of Silverpine Forest, infecting Gilnean soldiers stationed beyond the Greymane Wall. Before long the affliction had advanced through the legendary barrier and was gradually eating away at Gilneas\u2019s humanity. As reports of strange attacks and disappearances rose, fear took root in the hearts of Genn\u2019s people.\nNot long ago the curse\u2019s spread was stifled, but the victory proved short-lived. Now, at a time when Gilneas is still recovering from a civil war, the curse has returned with renewed fervor. To compound the worgen threat, the Forsaken are battering at the nation\u2019s gates in a bid to conquer Gilneas. Unbeknownst to many of the kingdom\u2019s citizens, a war between beast and man is also raging within the worgen themselves. Whether or not balance can be restored to these cursed Gilneans before the entirety of Genn\u2019s kingdom loses its humanity is uncertain.\nHome City &amp; Start Location: Gilneas City.\nFor many years, the nation of Gilneas existed in isolation behind the colossal Greymane Wall. Free from outside influence, the kingdom relied on the indomitable spirit and tenacity of its citizens to make its own destiny in the world. Of late, however, a series of events has shaken Gilneas to its core. While the nation struggles to recover from a past civil war, a devastating worgen curse has spread throughout Gilneas, turning some of its inhabitants into ferocious beasts.\nRecently these savage worgen have launched a surprise assault against the kingdom\u2019s fortified capital, Gilneas City. The uninfected citizenry have taken up arms in defense of their home and are now battling the worgen throughout the city\u2019s winding cobblestone streets and narrow alleyways. Yet with no signs of relenting, the worgen threat has raised fears that perhaps the days of Gilneas surviving on its own have come to an end.\nRacial Mount: Running Wild.\nDue to their ties with the wilds, worgen are able to call upon their bestial fervor to travel great distances. With the aid of all four limbs, a worgen can sprint at speeds rivaling the swiftest horses, nightsabers, and mechanostriders. As though it satisfies some primal urge deep within, worgen relish this mode of travel over those used by Azeroth\u2019s other races, who rely on mounts to transport them.\nLeader:King Genn Greymane.\nTime and again, King Genn Greymane has been forced to make difficult decisions to sustain Gilneas\u2019s well-being and autonomy. Following the Second War, he ordered the construction of the seemingly impenetrable Greymane Wall to protect his people from outside threats, effectively closing off the nation from the world and its petty conflicts. For years the wall did as intended, but when the worgen curse spread into Gilneas, the enormous barrier began to resemble the gateway to a prison rather than a sanctuary. Now, with Forsaken in nearby Silverpine Forest and the worgen curse poised to destroy everything that Genn and his forebears had labored to build, Gilneas\u2019s proud king must do everything in his power to save his kingdom. Due to his anger over the dire situation, however, Genn\u2019s most arduous trial ahead might be subduing his own fury before it consumes him entirely."}

Rumor has it that the way into the Deadmines lies through the quiet, unassuming village of Moonbrook.\nWailing Caverns.\nRecently, a night elf druid named Naralex discovered a network of underground caverns within the heart of the Barrens. Dubbed the 'Wailing Caverns', these natural caves were filled with steam fissures which produced long, mournful wails as they vented. Naralex believed he could use the caverns' underground springs to restore lushness and fertility to the Barrens - but to do so would require siphoning the energies of the fabled Emerald Dream. Once connected to the Dream however, the druid's vision somehow became a nightmare. Soon the Wailing Caverns began to change - the waters turned foul and the once-docile creatures inside metamorphosed into vicious, deadly predators. It is said that Naralex himself still resides somewhere inside the heart of the labyrinth, trapped beyond the edges of the Emerald Dream. Even his former acolytes have been corrupted by their master's waking nightmare - transformed into the wicked Druids of the Fang.\nShadowfang Keep.\nDuring the Third War, the wizards of the Kirin Tor battled against the undead armies of the Scourge. When the wizards of Dalaran died in battle, they would rise soon after - adding their former might to the growing Scourge. Frustrated by their lack of progress (and against the advice of his peers) the Archmage, Arugal elected to summon extra-dimensional entities to bolster Dalaran's diminishing ranks. Arugal's summoning brought the ravenous worgen into the world of Azeroth. The feral wolf-men slaughtered not only the Scourge, but quickly turned on the wizards themselves. The worgen laid siege to the keep of the noble, Baron Silverlaine. Situated above the tiny hamlet of Pyrewood, the keep quickly fell into shadow and ruin. Driven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the newly dubbed 'Shadowfang Keep'. It's said he still resides there, protected by his massive pet, Fenrus - and haunted by the vengeful ghost of Baron Silverlaine.\nBlackfathom Deeps.\nSituated along the Zoram Strand of Ashenvale, Blackfathom Deeps was once a glorious temple dedicated to the night elves' moon-goddess, Elune. However, the great Sundering shattered the temple - sinking it beneath the waves of the Veiled Sea. There it remained untouched - until, drawn by its ancient power - the naga and satyr emerged to plumb its secrets. Legends hold that the ancient beast, Aku'mai, has taken up residence within the temple's ruins. Aku'mai, a favored pet of the primordial Old Gods, has preyed upon the area ever since. Drawn to Aku'mai's presence, the cult known as the Twilight's Hammer has also come to bask in the Old Gods' evil presence.\nGnomeregan.\nLocated in Dun Morogh, the technological wonder known as Gnomeregan has been the gnomes' capital city for generations. Recently, a hostile race of mutant troggs infested several regions of Dun Morogh - including the great gnome city. In a desperate attempt to destroy the invading troggs, High Tinker Mekkatorque ordered the emergency venting of the city's radioactive waste tanks. Several gnomes sought shelter from the airborne pollutants as they waited for the troggs to die or flee. Unfortunately, though the troggs became irradiated from the toxic assault - their siege continued, unabated. Those gnomes who were not killed by noxious seepage were forced to flee, seeking refuge in the nearby dwarven city of Ironforge. There, High Tinker Mekkatorque set out to enlist brave souls to help his people reclaim their beloved city. It is rumored that Mekkatorque's once-trusted advisor, Mekgineer Thermaplugg, betrayed his people by allowing the invasion to happen. Now, his sanity shattered, Thermaplug remains in Gnomeregan - furthering his dark schemes and acting as the city's new techno-overlord.\nRazorfen Kraul.\nTen thousand years ago - during the War of the Ancients, the mighty demigod, Agamaggan, came forth to battle the Burning Legion. Though the colossal boar fell in combat, his actions helped save Azeroth from ruin. Yet over time, in the areas where his blood fell, massive thorn-ridden vines sprouted from the earth. The quillboar - believed to be the mortal offspring of the mighty god, came to occupy these regions and hold them sacred. The heart of these thorn-colonies was known as the Razorfen. The great mass of Razorfen Kraul was conquered by the old crone, Charlga Razorflank. Under her rule, the shamanistic quillboar stage attacks on rival tribes as well as Horde villages. Some speculate that Charlga has even been negotiating with agents of the Scourge - aligning her unsuspecting tribe with the ranks of the Undead for some insidious purpose.\nThe Scarlet Monastery.\nThe Monastery was once a proud bastion of Lordaeron's priesthood - a center for learning and enlightenment. With the rise of the undead Scourge during the Third War, the peaceful Monastery was converted into a stronghold of the fanatical Scarlet Crusade. The Crusaders are intolerant of all non-human races, regardless of alliance or affiliation. They believe that any and all outsiders are potential carriers of the undead plague - and must be destroyed. Reports indicate that adventurers who enter the monastery are forced to contend with Scarlet Commander Mograine - who commands a large garrison of fanatically devoted warriors. However, the monastery's true master is High Inquisitor Whitemane - a fearsome priestess who possesses the ability to resurrect fallen warriors to do battle in her name. \nRazorfen Downs.\nCrafted from the same mighty vines as Razorfen Kraul, Razorfen Downs is the traditional capital city of the quillboar race. The sprawling, thorn-ridden labyrinth houses a veritable army of loyal quillboar as well as their high priests - the Death's Head tribe. Recently, however, a looming shadow has fallen over the crude den. Agents of the undead Scourge - led by the lich, Amnennar the Coldbringer - have taken control over the quillboar race and turned the maze of thorns into a bastion of undead might. Now the quillboar fight a desperate battle to reclaim their beloved city before Amnennar spreads his control across the Barrens.\nUldaman.\nUldaman is an ancient Titan vault that has laid buried deep within the earth since the world's creation. Dwarven excavations have recently penetrated this forgotten city, releasing the Titans' first failed creations: the troggs. Legends say that the Titans created troggs from stone. When they deemed the experiment a failure, the Titans locked the troggs away and tried again - resulting in the creation of the dwarven race. The secrets of the dwarves' creation are recorded on the fabled Discs of Norgannon - massive Titan artifacts that lie at the very bottom of the ancient city. Recently, the Dark Iron dwarves have launched a series of incursions into Uldaman, hoping to claim the discs for their fiery master, Ragnaros. However, protecting the buried city are several guardians - giant constructs of living stone that crush any hapless intruders they find. The Discs themselves are guarded by a massive, sentient Stonekeeper called Archaedas. Some rumors even suggest that the dwarves' stone-skinned ancestors, the earthen, still dwell deep within the city's hidden recesses. \nMaraudon.\nProtected by the fierce Maraudine centaur, Maraudon is one of the most sacred sites within Desolace. The great temple/cavern is the burial place of Zaetar, one of two immortal sons born to the demigod, Cenarius. Legend holds that Zaetar and the earth elemental princess, Theradras, sired the misbegotten centaur race. It is said that upon their emergence, the barbaric centaur turned on their father and killed him. Some believe that Theradras, in her grief, trapped Zaetar's spirit within the winding cavern - used its energies for some malign purpose. The subterranean tunnels are populated by the vicious, long-dead ghosts of the Centaur Khans, as well as Theradras' own raging, elemental minions.\nThe Sunken Temple.\nOver a thousand years ago, the powerful Gurubashi Empire was torn apart by a massive civil war. An influential group of troll priests, known as the Atal'ai, attempted to bring back an ancient blood god named Hakkar the Soulflayer. Though the priests were defeated and ultimately exiled, the great troll empire buckled in upon itself. The exiled priests fled far to the north, into the Swamp of Sorrows. There they erected a great temple to Hakkar - where they could prepare for his arrival into the physical world. The great dragon Aspect, Ysera, learned of the Atal'ai's plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's drowned ruins are guarded by the green dragons who prevent anyone from getting in or out. However, it is believed that some of the fanatical Atal'ai may have survived Ysera's wrath - and recommitted themselves to the dark service of Hakkar.\nBlackrock Depths.\nOnce the capital city of the Dark Iron dwarves, this volcanic labyrinth now serves as the seat of power for Ragnaros the Firelord. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain. Obsessed with defeating Nefarian and his draconic minions, Ragnaros will go to any extreme to achieve final victory. \nBlackrock Spire.\nThe mighty fortress carved within the fiery bowels of Blackrock Mountain was designed by the master dwarf-mason, Franclorn Forgewright. Intended to be the symbol of Dark Iron power, the fortress was held by the sinister dwarves for centuries. However, Nefarian - the cunning son of the dragon, Deathwing - had other plans for the great keep. He and his draconic minions took control of the upper Spire and made war on the dwarves' holdings in the mountain's volcanic depths. Realizing that the dwarves were led by the mighty fire elemental, Ragnaros - Nefarian vowed to crush his enemies and claim the whole of Blackrock mountain for himself. \nDire Maul.\nBuilt twelve thousand years ago by a covert sect of night elf sorcerers, the ancient city of Eldre'Thalas was used to protect Queen Azshara's most prized arcane secrets. Though it was ravaged by the Great Sundering of the world, much of the wondrous city still stands as the imposing Dire Maul. The ruins' three distinct districts have been overrun by all manner of creatures - especially the spectral highborne, foul satyr and brutish ogres. Only the most daring party of adventurers can enter this broken city and face the ancient evils locked within its ancient vaults.\nStratholme.\nOnce the jewel of northern Lordaeron, the city of Stratholme is where Prince Arthas turned against his mentor, Uther Lightbringer, and slaughtered hundreds of his own subjects who were believed to have contracted the dreaded plague of undeath. Arthas' downward spiral and ultimate surrender to the Lich King soon followed. The broken city is now inhabited by the undead Scourge - led by the powerful lich, Kel'thuzad. A contingent of Scarlet Crusaders, led by Grand Crusader Dathrohan, also holds a portion of the ravaged city. The two sides are locked in constant, violent combat. Those adventurers brave (or foolish) enough to enter Stratholme will be forced to contend with both factions before long. It is said that the city is guarded by three massive watchtowers, as well as powerful necromancers, banshees and abominations. There have also been reports of a malefic Death Knight riding atop an unholy steed - dispensing indiscriminate wrath on all those who venture within the realm of the Scourge. \nScholomance.\nThe Scholomance is housed within a series of crypts that lie beneath the ruined keep of Caer Darrow. Once owned by the noble Barov family, Caer Darrow fell to ruin following the Second War. As the wizard Kel'thuzad enlisted followers for his Cult of the Damned he would often promise immortality in exchange for serving his Lich King. The Barov family fell to Kel'thuzad's charismatic influence and donated the keep and its crypts to the Scourge. The cultists then killed the Barovs and turned the ancient crypts into a school for necromancy known as the Scholomance. Though Kel'thuzad no longer resides in the crypts, devoted cultists and instructors still remain. The powerful lich, Ras Frostwhisper, rules over the site and guards it in the Scourge's name - while the mortal necromancer, Darkmaster Gandling, serves as the school's insidious headmaster.\nOther Minor Instanced Areas.\nRagefire Chasm.\nRagefire Chasm consists of a network of volcanic caverns that lie below the orcs' new capital city of Orgrimmar. Recently, rumors have spread that a cult loyal to the demonic Shadow Council has taken up residence within the Chasm's fiery depths. This cult, known as the Burning Blade, threatens the very sovereignty of Durotar. Many believe that the orc Warchief, Thrall, is aware of the Blade's existence and has chosen not to destroy it in the hopes that its members might lead him straight to the Shadow Council. Either way, the dark powers emanating from Ragefire Chasm could undo all that the orcs have fought to attain. \nThe Stockades.\nThe Stockade are a high-security prison complex, hidden beneath the canal district of Stormwind city. Presided over by Warden Thelwater, the Stockades are home to petty crooks, political insurgents, murderers and a score of the most dangerous criminals in the land. Recently, a prisoner-led revolt has resulted in a state of pandemonium within the Stockades - where the guards have been driven out and the convicts roam free. Warden Thelwater has managed to escape the holding area and is currently enlisting brave thrill-seekers to venture into the prison and kill the uprising's mastermind - the cunning felon, Bazil Thredd. \nZul'Farrak.\nThis sun-blasted city is home to the Sandfury trolls, known for their particular ruthlessness and dark mysticism. Troll legends tell of a powerful sword called Sul'thraze the Lasher, a weapon capable of instilling fear and weakness in even the most formidable of foes. Long ago, the weapon was split in half. However, rumors have circulated that the two halves may be found somewhere within Zul'Farrak's walls. Reports have also suggested that a band of mercenaries fleeing Gadgetzan wandered into the city and became trapped. Their fate remains unknown. But perhaps most disturbing of all are the hushed whispers of an ancient creature sleeping within a sacred pool at the city's heart - a mighty demigod who will wreak untold destruction upon any adventurer foolish enough to awaken him. \nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20090807211734/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/worlddungeons.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

The original article is no longer available, but it can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nArticle content.\nOne of the most compelling features of massively multiplayer games is the near-infinite variety of things to do in them -- content to suit many different playing styles. '&lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt;s' are assaults by larger groups of &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s on powerful monsters or &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s and in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; can include everything from a group of lower level characters tackling a quest well above their level to the epic end-game, high-level attacks against &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;-like foes.\nFor Wrath of the Lich King Dungeons, go &lt;a href=\"Game%20Guide/Wrath%20World%20Dungeons\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaxxramas.\nYears ago, the &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; led an army of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s into the ancient &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt; now known as &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces overran the citadel, and under the will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; its corridors were transformed into a potent war machine. Dark &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; tore the fortress from its subterranean home and lifted it into the sky. Hidden behind a thick layer of clouds, Naxxramas grew in strength. At the Lich King's bidding, the burgeoning wrath within the necropolis was unleashed upon the world. Brave heroes breached the citadel and eventually overcame Naxxramas' vile commander, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, but the victory was short-lived.\nAbove the war-ravaged wastes of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, Naxxramas has returned with renewed fury. Kel'Thuzad, once again seated in the frigid heart of the necropolis, has laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fortress of &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. As factions from around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt; converge at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;the gate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Scourge\"&gt;war against the Scourge&lt;/a&gt; enters its most pivotal hour. It is within Naxxramas that the tide of battle could turn against the Lich King... or irrevocably in his favor.\nLearn more about the events that darkened the fate of Kel'Thuzad, and ultimately of all Azeroth, in &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Damnation\"&gt;Road to Damnation&lt;/a&gt;\nWatch the Naxxramas trailer &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7-xlK8KBEpI\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaxxramas.\nOnce hidden beneath the surface of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Naxxramas now serves as a mobile Scourge fortress in the skies over Azeroth, a weapon of doom embodying the hate, destruction, and betrayal suffered by the living at the hands of the Lich King.\nYears ago, the crypt lord Anub'arak led an army of undead warriors into the ancient nerubian ziggurat now known as Naxxramas. The Scourge forces overran the citadel, and under the will of the Lich King its corridors were transformed into a potent war machine.\nWhile the fortress grew in strength, the Lich King scoured the world for a suitable being to command his new weapon. In Kel'Thuzad, an &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King saw the potential for corruption. Dark thoughts flooded Kel'Thuzad's mind, and, lured by offerings of knowledge and power, he ventured to the frozen wastes of Northrend.\nIn exchange for immortality and the incredible power he lusted for, Kel'Thuzad abandoned his &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity and swore allegiance to the Lich King. The archmage was granted command over Naxxramas, and before his eyes, dark magic tore the Scourge fortress from its subterranean home and lifted it into the sky.\nHidden behind a thick layer of clouds, Naxxramas carried out its master's grim designs, and its halls echoed with the sounds of war. Amidst the siege engines and war supplies lining the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;-infested corridors of the necropolis, hulking &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s toiled, and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s trained. From the frigid heart of the fortress, Kel'Thuzad, reborn as a terrifying lich, readied himself for the coming apocalypse that would issue forth from the Scourge citadel.\nAt the Lich King's bidding, the burgeoning wrath within Naxxramas was unleashed upon the world from the skies over the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Although many brave heroes stormed the necropolis to quell the onslaught, few emerged untainted by the evil permeating its halls.\nBut in time, with wisdom, courage, and strength, adventurers vanquished the horrors within Naxxramas. The victory was immense, albeit short-lived. The heroes who destroyed Kel'Thuzad and his allies soon learned that true evil is not so easily defeated.\nAbove the war-ravaged wastes of the Dragonblight, Naxxramas has returned.\nKel'Thuzad, whose cursed remains fell into the hands of Scourge agents after the necropolis' first defeat, once again commands the citadel. From his icy throne room, the vile lich coordinates a siege on the Alliance fortress of Wintergarde Keep in response to a shocking attack at the gate to Icecrown.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces have also entered the fray, and as the combined might of factions from around the world converges on the Dragonblight, the war against the Scourge enters its most pivotal hour. It is within Naxxramas that the tide of battle could turn against the Lich King... or irrevocably in his favor.\nThe Eye of Eternity.\nFrom within the safety of his personal domain, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; coordinates a &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; to reestablish his dominance over the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies coursing through Azeroth. In his eyes, the foolish actions of the Kirin Tor and other mortal &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; have plunged the world into chaos, and the abuse of their powers will no longer be tolerated. Threatened by the Spell-Weaver's brutal tactics, the Kirin Tor has allied itself with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the two groups closely observe Malygos, searching for a way to thwart his campaign and strike out at the Aspect of Magic, but thus far the elusive Spell-Weaver has proven difficult to engage.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient meeting ground of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, Alexstrasza and the &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;s of other flights have discussed Malygos' recklessness and reluctantly concluded that he is beyond the point of salvation. With the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s' assistance, Azeroth's heroes may be able to accomplish what has formerly been unthinkable: challenging the Spell-Weaver from inside the Eye of Eternity. Sustaining the safety of Azeroth depends on Malygos' defeat, but his end will also herald a new age: a world of unguarded magic, absent of the Dragon Aspect powerful enough to watch over it.\nThe Nexus.\nThe blue &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos, was charged ages ago by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s as the guardian of magic. More than ten millennia ago, he watched in horror as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; all but wiped out the blue flight. Maddened by grief, Malygos withdrew to &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt; and paid little heed to the rest of the world. Only in recent times did Malygos fully return to his senses. Upon reviving, he quickly assessed the state of magical affairs in Azeroth and reached the grim conclusion that magic was running amok throughout the world. He blamed this dangerous development on the mortal &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s and their reckless pursuit of magical power.\nDetermined to forestall a catastrophe, Malygos decreed that the world's unbridled magic must be reined in by any means necessary. And so the great Aspect turned to the &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, a map of the world's &lt;a href=\"ley%20lines\"&gt;ley lines&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to locate and tap into these sources of raw power, diverting the magical powers that course beneath the earth to his home base in Northrend, the Nexus. Once harnessed, the energies are focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos's redirection of the ley lines has carried disastrous consequences, however, splintering the world's crust and opening unstable rifts: tears in the very fabric of the magical dimension.\nMalygos' siphoning of the world's magic has not gone unnoticed by the mortal races. The weakening members of the Kirin Tor, the elite magi of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, have sworn to fight Malygos to the bitter end. In fact, the magi have used their waning powers to transfer the entire city of Dalaran to float above Northrend. From this vantage point, the magi prepare for the next step in their battle against the Lich King, and for the inevitable confrontation with Malygos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s increasingly militaristic methods have been condemned by the red dragonflight. Charged with the preservation of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight has vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they have formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups have begun actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign.\nThe sides have been chosen; the battle lines have been drawn. The only question that remains now is...\nWho will win?\nThe Nexus Bio.\nCheck out this &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King%20Expansion%20Features/The%20Nexus\"&gt;inside report&lt;/a&gt; on The Nexus.\nThe Obsidian Sanctum.\nMore than ten thousand years ago, the black Dragon Aspect, Neltharion, began a quest to reign supreme over his fellow &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and thereby dominate Azeroth. Before Deathwing -- as Neltharion came to be known -- could achieve his goal, the other Aspects drove him into hiding, but the rest of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; continued his foul work. Hated and hunted for its evil deeds, the black flight dwindled, and at first Deathwing schemed to bolster its ranks. In time, however, his agents began experimenting with other dragonflights to create a new and mightier breed of dragon. The resulting experiments gave rise to a powerful and terrifying new breed: the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. These malefic dragons were believed to be destroyed after an attack on &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, but a new clutch of twilight eggs was recently discovered within the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight's domain in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Now Azeroth's heroes must destroy the brood once and for all and prevent the dark future that has been set into motion.\nThe Obsidian Sanctum.\n&lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; stands over the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Titans\"&gt;fractured path&lt;/a&gt; that cuts north through the icy &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. In a region engulfed by chaos, the temple has become a beacon of hope. Within this venerable structure, the Chamber of the Aspects holds entrances to five sacred domains, each representing a single dragonflight. According to &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;legend&lt;/a&gt;, the Chamber of the Aspects is where the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s imbued the five Dragon Aspects with the power to nurture the budding world. To this day, four of the ancient dragonflights carry out their charge to watch over Azeroth. The chamber remains a trusted refuge, but an act of betrayal haunts the sanctuary, an act that forever altered the destiny of the Dragon Aspects.\nMore than ten thousand years ago, the leader of the black dragonflight, Neltharion, summoned the other Aspects and their flights to the chamber and convinced them all to bestow a portion of their essences upon a magical artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed he would use the Dragon Soul to end the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but unbeknownst to his comrades, he did not infuse the artifact with his own essence. While battling the Legion, Neltharion revealed his true intentions and turned the Dragon Soul on his fellow dragons, who learned too late that Neltharion was no longer their ally. In that moment of treachery, Neltharion shattered the strength of the dragonflights, earning him the new name of Deathwing.\nDeathwing's goal was to dominate the other Dragon Aspects and, through them, the rest of Azeroth. Yet just as victory drew near, the Dragon Soul -- now called the Demon Soul -- was destroyed, releasing the lost energy of the other Aspects. Restored to full power, the enraged dragons drove Deathwing into hiding. Even so, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s continued his foul work. Hated and hunted for its evil deeds, the black flight dwindled, and at first Deathwing schemed to bolster its ranks. In time, however, his agents began experimenting with other dragonflights to create a new and mightier breed of dragon.\nThe most troubling advances were made by &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's former consort. In the depths of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, she managed to create the first few members of an incredibly powerful breed: the twilight dragons. In the course of her work, however, the resulting disturbances in and around Grim Batol attracted too much attention from the rest of Azeroth. The ensuing attack on Sinestra's lair led to her demise and the end of her foul machinations.\nDuring these events, Deathwing remained in hiding. His continued absence led many to assume that Sinestra had been acting alone at Grim Batol, but a recently discovered clutch of twilight eggs inside the Chamber of the Aspects has raised fears that Deathwing himself played a role in the creation of the malefic dragons. A powerful guardian, &lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion&lt;/a&gt;, watches over the eggs within the black dragonflight's volcanic chamber, the Obsidian Sanctum. If the rumors of Deathwing's involvement are true, the dark future that he set into motion seems on the verge of plunging Azeroth into a new age...\nAn age of twilight.\nUlduar.\nSince discovering &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers have journeyed to the titan city to learn more about its mysterious past. Further exploration has revealed that the magnificent complex is above all a prison, intended to permanently confine the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; of death, &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. This ancient horror has corrupted its guards, and now it is breaking through the last of its restraints. Faced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals has made preparations for a sweeping assault on the city. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and towering defenses at the city's entrance will take tremendous strength, but even that great victory may not be enough to overcome the madness that dwells below.\nUlduar.\nSince discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have journeyed to the magnificent titan city in hopes of unearthing its relics and learning the secrets of the past. Yet they are not fully aware of the purpose behind Ulduar's imposing edifice. It is not merely a repository of artifacts and titan research, but also a prison.\nLong ago, the titans encountered a race of horrifying aberrations known as the Old Gods. Their destructive powers threatened to unravel Azeroth, eliminating all life and order. Alerted by this danger to their central tenets, the titans went to war against the Old Gods. Ultimately the titans used their prowess in architecture and construction to imprison their foes deep underground.\nThe Old God of death, Yogg-Saron, was shackled in the depths of Ulduar and placed under the watch of mighty guardians \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;. They pledged to keep the monstrosity contained there for all eternity. The watchers of Ulduar endured their vigil with fortitude, but the Old God's insidious whispering could not be ignored forever.\nWith time, the prison's head guardian, Loken, succumbed to the will of Yogg-Saron. Betraying his allies, he seized control of the city and began directing its forces toward deadly new ends. Armies of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the titan safeguards in the Storm Peaks, leaving all of Northrend exposed to the growing danger. Several regions have already felt the corrupting presence of Loken's &lt;a href=\"Iron%20army\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt;, complicating the war against the Lich King.\nFaced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals has established a staging ground outside of Ulduar. They are preparing to launch a sweeping assault on the city, and they have called on Azeroth's mightiest heroes for aid. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and the towering defenses at Ulduar's entrance would take tremendous strength, but even that may not be enough to conquer the madness that dwells below.\nHaving turned the minds of its former captors, Yogg-Saron is preparing to exert its full power. With vast iron armies to command, the Old God is nearly ready to break its last bonds. It draws ever closer to annihilating the titans' creations and sinking the world into primitive chaos.\nThe preservation of Azeroth depends on Yogg-Saron's defeat, but the fall of Ulduar has other grave repercussions. A silent observer has arrived within the city to survey all of the damage that has occurred on the planet since the titans' departure. His cold logic will determine whether the world will be spared or destroyed.\nOnly Azeroth's heroes can alter the final judgment, for despite their many conflicts and transgressions, their resolve to confront evil in all of its manifestations has earned them the right to determine their ultimate fate.\nVault of Archavon.\nOverlooking the frozen plains of the Great Dragonblight and the inhospitable wastes of &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; lies a region known to the denizens of Northrend as &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. Seated atop a high plateau, Wintergrasp has remained undisturbed for ages, its icy winds howling unheard amongst the ancient titan fortifications that dot the landscape. However, an abundance of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; materials and its strategically important titan fortifications are making Wintergrasp the focus of a vicious tug-of-war between the Horde and the Alliance. And then there are the persistent rumors of an ancient titan vault beneath Wintergrasp's &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Fortress\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;. One can only marvel at the thought of what treasures may be waiting there...\nYour faction must have control of Wintergrasp to enter the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;. \nVault of Archavon.\nAlthough long deserted by its titan founders, Wintergrasp has again risen to prominence as a focal point in the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde. Covered in snow and ice, Wintergrasp is a treacherous battleground in which both sides struggle for control over the region's valuable resources, including rare elemental compounds and ancient relics. Alliance and Horde forces have ransacked Wintergrasp's crumbling structures in the hope that the items they procure will give them a much-needed edge in their battle against the Lich King... and each other.\nYet not all of Wintergrasp's ruins are so easily pillaged. At the region's northern border, Wintergrasp Fortress remains mostly intact, so its treasures have not been disturbed. Originally the titans built the fortress to house their many experiments as they cultivated the budding world of Azeroth. The titans' most promising creations were relocated to the nearby jungles of &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where they have flourished ever since. Before the titans left Azeroth, they completely sealed Wintergrasp Fortress to safeguard it from intruders.\nAzeroth's heroes noticed Wintergrasp Fortress initially because of its strategic importance. The fortress' advantageous location provided a relatively secure base for combatants to strategize and gather their forces. Inevitably those who set up camp in the mighty fortress' shadow began to wonder what secrets the stronghold contained. Since then, brave heroes have smashed through the doors and journeyed inside to investigate. According to those who survived, the titans did not leave their fortress unguarded.\nA giant custodian known as &lt;a href=\"Archavon%20the%20Stone%20Watcher\"&gt;Archavon the Stone Watcher&lt;/a&gt; patrols the inner repository and attacks anyone bold enough to stand against him. Like other titan creations, Archavon conveys his purpose through his construction: he is a craggy behemoth with a spiked fist for impaling his opponents. Although Archavon has impassively guarded the vault for millennia, the slightest provocation will cause him to crush his enemies with a deadly assault that produces choking clouds of dust.\nIntrepid champions who have journeyed even farther into the vault have discovered a second guardian. Presiding over an adjacent wing, &lt;a href=\"Emalon%20the%20Storm%20Watcher\"&gt;Emalon the Storm Watcher&lt;/a&gt; strikes furiously at any trespassers in his domain. This tempestuous giant also commands a group of &lt;a href=\"Air%20revenant\"&gt;storm revenants&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are restless after the long span of silence since their watch began.\nDespite these dangers, adventurers continue to pursue glory in the vault, for rumor has it that the titans left behind more than just guardians. Untold riches await the victors: treasures that are worthy of the titans.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nThe time to strike at the heart of the Scourge is drawing close. Clouds blanket the skies of Azeroth and heroes gather beneath battle-worn banners in preparation for the coming storm. They say that even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. It is this hope that drives the men and women of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;: hope that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; will see them through these trying times, hope that good will triumph over evil, hope that a hero blessed by the Light will come forth to put an end to the Lich King's dark reign.\nSo the Argent Crusade has sent out the call, a call to arms for all heroes far and wide, to meet at the very doorstep of the Lich King's domain and to prove their might in a &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;tournament&lt;/a&gt; the likes of which Azeroth has never seen. Of course, a tournament such as this needs a fitting stage. A place where potential candidates are tested to the limits of exhaustion. A place where heroes... become champions. A place called the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nProve Your Might.\nThe Crusaders' Coliseum will see you and your friends facing off against a series of increasingly challenging &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es, terrible monsters the Argent Crusade brought in from all over Northrend. Although the challenge is great, you will find that the prizes the Argent Crusade has to offer will make it all well worth your while.\nThe setup for the Crusaders' Coliseum is surprisingly straightforward. If you are familiar with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt; quest line, you already have a vague idea of how the Crusaders' Coliseum plays out in principle. After you and your friends enter the coliseum, you will face the first of several bosses; once you've defeated a boss, you will move on to the next one. You must master the encounters one by one, until you finally face the raid's final challenge. Sound simple? That's because there is a twist.\nIn the \"Heroic\" version of the Crusaders' Coliseum, you and your raid only have a limited number of attempts for each raid lockout period, and each time your raid wipes, one of your attempts will be used up. To embark on the epic &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, you must first prove your worth by clearing either the 10 or 25 player version of the Crusaders' Coliseum's normal mode. After you have dealt the killing blow to the coliseum's final heroic mode boss will you be able to collect the Crusaders' Tribute, and the fewer attempts you needed to complete the Trial of the Grand Crusader, the better your reward will be.\nOnyxia's Lair.\n&lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; is the daughter of the mighty dragon Deathwing, and sister of the scheming &lt;a href=\"Nefarion\"&gt;Nefarion&lt;/a&gt; Lord of Blackrock Spire. It is said that Onyxia delights in corrupting the mortal races by meddling in their political affairs. To this end it is believed that she takes on various humanoid forms and uses her charm and power to influence delicate matters between the different races. Some believe that Onyxia has even assumed an alias once used by her father - the title of the royal &lt;a href=\"Prestor\"&gt;House Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. When not meddling in mortal concerns, Onyxia resides in a fiery cave below the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt;, a dismal swamp located within &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. There she is guarded by her kin, the remaining members of the insidious Black Dragon Flight.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nWith the legendary heroes Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; of the Argent Crusade and Highlord &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; joining forces to lead the charge through the fortified gates of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Horde and Alliance will be called to end the reign of the Lich King once and for all. It may be the greatest challenge our most courageous adventurers have yet seen.\n[\"Image links to the &lt;a href=\"Underdev/Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel Underdev&lt;/a&gt; article\"]\nRuby Sanctum.\nWyrmrest Temple has been breached. The &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, hallowed domain of the red dragonflight in Northrend, is under siege.\nNow, the mighty dragons must rely on the mortal races for salvation. The fate of the red flight, caretakers of all life on Azeroth, hangs in the balance. Stalwart champions, Horde and Alliance alike, will rush to the defense of the sanctum. Will you be among them?\n[\"Image links to the article\"]\nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20101107211810/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/wrathraidarea.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

Yet in recent days something has roused the fortress' slumbering residents, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. Feared to be allied with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the savage &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; now terrorizes nearby settlements. With ferocious &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s at their command and unparalleled prowess in battle, the vrykul pose a direct threat to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; campaigns in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the only way to break the will of Utgarde's denizens is to defeat their revered leaders. Heroes have been dispatched to accomplish this harrowing task, but it remains to be seen whether they will return victorious or become mere war trophies to line the ancient halls of the vrykul fortress.\nUtgarde Keep.\nAmong the cliffs of the &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the Howling Fjord stands Utgarde Keep, an impervious fortress occupied by the savage and enigmatic vrykul. Long thought to be abandoned, Utgarde has only recently returned to occupation after millennia of disuse. Now the &lt;a href=\"half-giant\"&gt;half-giant&lt;/a&gt; vrykul pour endlessly from within the keep's battle-scarred walls to assault the nearby settlements.\nFanatically loyal to the still-slumbering &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul seem to live for the thrill of battle. Inside Utgarde, the vicious &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; builds massive weapons of war in ever-burning forges. Although rumors persist that the followers of Ymiron may have allied with the Scourge, the denizens of the Howling Fjord have all seen the Dragonflayers' most common allies: proto-dragons. These bestial creatures seem to have little in common with their better-known brethren in the five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Nevertheless, the vrykul have trained the fearsome proto-dragons to serve as mounts. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar the Plunderer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rider\"&gt;dragon riders&lt;/a&gt; revel in slaughtering their enemies from above without warning.\nWith mysterious, foul &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and proto-dragons at their command, the vrykul of Utgarde Keep pose an imminent threat to both the Alliance and the Horde. Only the bravest would dare to strike against Ymiron's faithful and delve into the heart of the vrykul's primeval home.\nUtgarde Keep Bio.\nCheck out this &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King%20Expansion%20Features/Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;inside report&lt;/a&gt; on the Utgarde Keep.\nAzjol-Nerub.\n&lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; was an &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; of great strength when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Northrend. Despite ferocious resistance, however, Scourge forces managed to overtake the subterranean kingdom and slaughter its inhabitants, the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. Scarred by years of war and abandonment, this vast domain is now occupied on two fronts. In the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kingdom\"&gt;Upper Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; nerubians patrol the ruins of their homeland, guarding clutches of eggs that will one day bring forth a new generation of Scourge warriors. Meanwhile, in the depths of the Old Kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27kahet\"&gt;Ahn'kahet&lt;/a&gt;, another enemy stirs: the &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt;. Little is known of these horrifying creatures, but rumor has it that they answer to an evil power lurking beneath Northrend. Destroying the undead nerubians and their tainted eggs will deal a great blow to the Lich King, but eliminating the mysterious faceless ones is also crucial to reclaiming the fallen empire.\nAzjol-Nerub.\nThe surface of Northrend is not the only battleground in the war against the Lich King. Another front lies deep within the subterranean empire of Azjol-Nerub, a vast network of passageways and caverns stretching beneath the icy landmass. The kingdom's highly intelligent founders, the nerubians, established their underground lair in the north of &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; splintered the massive continent. In the ages that followed, the &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;-like nerubians kept to themselves in the darkness of their homeland, largely uninterested in the affairs of surface dwellers. By the time the Lich King arrived in Northrend, Azjol-Nerub had developed into a vast empire of great strength.\nDetermined to bend the inhabitants of Northrend to his will, the Lich King rained destruction upon the continent, dispatching his undead army, the Scourge, to crush any who stood against him. The nerubians fought back, igniting a savage conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;. Azjol-Nerub's last known king, &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, led the resistance against the Lich King's forces. The brutality and fearlessness of the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20warrior\"&gt;his warriors&lt;/a&gt; made it difficult for the Scourge to overtake Azjol-Nerub, but eventually the endless numbers of undead prevailed.\nSmall groups of survivors managed to escape, fleeing deep underground, but most nerubians were not as fortunate. Those slain while defending Azjol-Nerub were raised into undeath and forced to serve the Lich King. Even Anub'arak could not escape this grim fate, and so he went on to claim the nerubian stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; for his new master.\nYears of war and abandonment have left the kingdom broken and scarred. The ruins of Azjol-Nerub cast dark shadows that conceal deep cracks and fissures, making it perilous for explorers to traverse the landscape. Undead nerubians patrol the area, guarding clutches of eggs that will one day bring forth a new generation of Scourge warriors to bolster the ranks of the Lich King's armies.\nDefeating Anub'arak and his followers will deal a great blow to the Scourge. The destruction of the tainted eggs scattered throughout the kingdom is also crucial, as only then will the Scourge's evil presence truly be purged from &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. Once that happens, the remnants of the nerubian race can set about restoring their empire and exacting revenge on the one responsible for this dark chapter in their history.\nThe Nexus.\nIn order to reestablish his dominance over magic, the blue &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, has launched a ruthless campaign to sever the link between mortals and the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies coursing through &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; is redirecting the &lt;a href=\"ley%20lines\"&gt;ley lines&lt;/a&gt; of the world to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos' towering lair. In response to the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s' offensive, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the elite &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, have allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who are charged with the preservation of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. Their combined forces are subverting the blue Aspect's offensive, but time is running out. The only question that remains now is... can Malygos be stopped before his crusade reaches its cataclysmic finale?\nThe Nexus.\nThe blue Dragon Aspect, Malygos, was charged ages ago by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s as the guardian of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. More than ten millennia ago, he watched in horror as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; all but wiped out the blue flight. Maddened by grief, Malygos withdrew to his lair and paid little heed to the rest of the world. Only in recent times did Malygos fully return to his senses. Upon reviving, he quickly assessed the state of magical affairs in Azeroth and reached the grim conclusion that magic was running amok throughout the world. He blamed this dangerous development on the mortal races and their reckless pursuit of magical power.\nDetermined to forestall a catastrophe, Malygos decreed that the world's unbridled magic must be reined in by any means necessary. And so the great Aspect turned to the Arcanomicon, a map of the world's ley lines, and used it to locate and tap into these sources of raw power, diverting the magical powers that course beneath the earth to his home base in Northrend, the Nexus. Once harnessed, the energies are focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos's redirection of the ley lines has carried disastrous consequences, however, splintering the world's crust and opening unstable rifts: tears in the very fabric of the magical dimension.\nMalygos' siphoning of the world's magic has not gone unnoticed by the mortal races. The weakening members of the Kirin Tor, the elite magi of Dalaran, have sworn to fight Malygos to the bitter end. In fact, the magi have used their waning powers to transfer the entire city of Dalaran to float above Northrend. From this vantage point, the magi prepare for the next step in their battle against the Lich King, and for the inevitable confrontation with Malygos.\nThe blue dragonflight's increasingly militaristic methods have been condemned by the red dragonflight. Charged with the preservation of life, the red dragonflight has vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they have formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups have begun actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign.\nThe sides have been chosen; the battle lines have been drawn. The only question that remains now is...\nWho will win?\nThe Nexus Bio.\nCheck out this &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King%20Expansion%20Features/The%20Nexus\"&gt;inside report&lt;/a&gt; on The Nexus.\nDrak'Tharon Keep.\n&lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; once served the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; as a formidable outpost at the edge of &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;their kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, but a recent Scourge invasion has delivered the fortress into the Lich King's hands. The keep's fallen defenders are now the Lich King's undead minions, and they are advancing into the heart of Drakkari territory. Even the most formidable ice troll &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s have failed to retake the conquered fortress. Neutralizing Drak'Tharon as a threat to Zul'Drak's future will be a task requiring immense bravery, and unless it is done soon, the entire empire, along with the power of its &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;wild gods&lt;/a&gt;, may fall to the Scourge.\nDrak'Tharon Keep.\nNorth of the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;' verdant forests stands Drak'Tharon Keep, an ancient stronghold of the Drakkari empire. The fortress once served the ice trolls as an impenetrable outpost at the edge of their kingdom, Zul'Drak, but a recent assault has delivered the keep into the hands of a new master: the Lich King.\nIn a quest to seize the power of the trolls' wild gods, Scourge forces are advancing into the heart of Drakkari territory. Overrun and converted into an undead garrison, Drak'Tharon is the most troubling defeat yet suffered by the ice trolls. The Drakkari corpses that litter the keep serve as a chilling omen of the fate that may await the entire empire. Many of the fortress' slain defenders are now minions of the Lich King, patrolling the stronghold's outer perimeter and ambushing any living kinsmen who stray too close.\nBands of ice trolls enraged by Drak'Tharon's fall have attempted to retake the fortress, but thus far their bold attacks have failed. Few would-be liberators ever manage to breach the keep's outer defenses, and those that do must confront a perilous array of enemies. &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s feast on the slain; &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s prepare for their next offensive on Zul'Drak; and undead Drakkari defend the keep, no longer for the glory of their empire, but for a much darker end. Deafening roars echo from the outer courtyards of the stronghold, the cries of an immense beast--or so the rumors say.\nYet these terrors pale in comparison to &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20Tharon%27ja\"&gt;the prophet Tharon'ja&lt;/a&gt;, who is known for ripping the flesh from the bones of some of the most formidable ice troll warriors. From the upper tiers of the fortress, Tharon'ja watches as waves of &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20troll\"&gt;undead trolls&lt;/a&gt; pour from the keep's corridors to bolster the Scourge ranks in their assault on Zul'Drak. Cleansing Drak'Tharon of its evil will require immense courage, and unless it is done swiftly, the whole Drakkari empire, along with the ancient deities within, will fall to the Scourge.\nCaverns of Time.\nPrior to his unthinkable merger with the Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; waged war against the Scourge, bent on eradicating the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; that had spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After Arthas watched &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s succumb to darkness and saw his fallen subjects transformed into hideous undead creatures, fear and hate engulfed his mind. Upon discovering signs of the plague within &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, he knew it was only a matter of time before the residents of the city were reborn as Scourge agents. For Arthas, there was only one course of action: &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;purge the city&lt;/a&gt;. Yet within the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, deceptive magic permeates Stratholme. The &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragon\"&gt;infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and their agents have targeted Arthas and his quest to cull the city, seeking to alter history. Fearing the temporal disruption might jeopardize Azeroth's very existence, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has called upon mortals to assist Arthas and ensure that the purge is carried out successfully. Regardless of how vile the event might seem, the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;keepers of time&lt;/a&gt; maintain that what was, must always be. \nCaverns of Time.\nWithin the labyrinthine corridors of the Caverns of Time, mortal perceptions of good and evil have little influence. Whatever the consequences of Azeroth's past events, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his bronze dragonflight maintain that what was, must always be.\nHowever, the infinite dragons do not share the same principles of balance and preservation. Hoping to sabotage the past, present, and future, these reckless dragons and their agents have launched assaults on Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s. One of their most insidious attacks targets Arthas and a grisly act that led the former prince of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; on his path to betray &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nPrior to merging with the Lich King, the prince waged war against the Scourge, intent on eradicating the plague of undeath that was ravaging Lordaeron. Desperately fighting the plague's spread, Arthas watched villages succumb to darkness and saw his fallen subjects transformed into hideous undead creatures.\nFear and anger engulfed the prince's mind. Upon discovering signs of the plague within Stratholme, Arthas knew it was only a matter of time before the residents of the city were reborn as Scourge agents. He decided that there was only one course of action: purge the city. Many allies turned their backs on the prince, distancing themselves from the drastic undertaking, but others remained loyal to Arthas and aided him as he unleashed his hatred of the Scourge upon the people of Stratholme.\nYet within the Caverns of Time, deceptive magic now permeates the city, subtly disguising evidence of the plague that once influenced Arthas' fateful decision. Even the powerful &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, lurking within the walls of Stratholme, might be unaware of the infinite dragons' cunning efforts to avert the prince's attention.\nThe bronze dragonflight now asks any mortals who fathom the disastrous impact of the temporal disruption to assist Arthas and ensure that the culling is carried out with success. If the infinite dragons' initial efforts to deceive the prince are thwarted, the keepers of time fear that more overt, violent measures might be taken.\nHidden amidst the undead minions ravaging the city, powerful warriors of the infinite dragons await Arthas, bent on ending the prince's maddened quest. They will stop at nothing to alter the course of history, even if it means striking Arthas down.\nIf the sinister infinite dragons complete their mission, and the prince of Lordaeron strays from his terrible destiny, then the timeways -- the very fabric of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;the universe&lt;/a&gt; -- may unravel at the seams.\nGun'Drak.\nDesperate to save their kingdom from collapse, the trolls of Zul'Drak have turned on their ancient gods. The wild deities are now considered a source of untapped power, their potent blood providing the means to repel the Lich King's minions, who have overtaken parts of the troll nation. Heroes have recently journeyed to the beleaguered region to strike at the savage Drakkari and their maddened &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEven so, the greatest threat to the region is rumored to lie undisturbed within the capital of the ice trolls' empire, &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;. In the depths of the city, the most sacred shrines are said to be steeped in the mojo of slain gods. Surrounded by this dark energy, twisted Drakkari high prophets grow in power, infusing their followers with incredible strength. If left undisturbed, the trolls of Gundrak may soon unleash their burgeoning might, plunging the entire region into chaos. \nGun'Drak.\nDesperate to save their kingdom from collapse, the trolls of Zul'Drak have begun sacrificing their ancient gods. Once revered, the deities are now considered a source of untapped power, their potent blood providing the means to repel the Lich King's minions, who have overtaken parts of the troll nation. The gods' weakened state, brought about by the corrupting presence of Scourge forces in the region, has allowed the Drakkari to imprison their deities within the sacred altars of Zul'Drak. In these cold stone cells, the gods languish in chains, helplessly awaiting their fate at the hands of maddened Drakkari prophets.\n&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; outposts in the west of the empire have become wary of the Drakkari's growing hostility and recklessness. Although the Argent Crusaders are locked in a ferocious struggle to drive the Scourge from Zul'Drak, the savage ice trolls view any intruders on their land as a threat, regardless of their intentions. Thus, it may be only a matter of time before Drakkari warriors, empowered with the mojo of their fallen deities, overrun the Argent Crusade's encampments.\nConcerned with the events unfolding in Zul'Drak, representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; have ventured to the kingdom. Their goal is to observe and chronicle what they believe to be the fall of an empire. These wise trolls hope to use what they learn to educate future generations so that they will not repeat the Drakkari's mistakes. While the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; themselves have avoided direct intervention in the region, they have offered guidance to recently arrived heroes. The trolls seek to aid anyone brave enough to strike at the tormentors of Zul'Drak's wild gods, a mission that would also eliminate the danger the Drakkari pose to the beleaguered ranks of the Argent Crusade.\nDespite the efforts of valiant &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, thus far the greatest risk to the region lies undisturbed within Gun'Drak, the capital of the ice trolls' empire. Outsiders know little about the ancient Drakkari city, but it is reputedly filled with the spoils of the kingdom's long and violent history. As the gods are slain on the grounds of Zul'Drak, their &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; is said to flow into the halls of the citadel, infusing Gun'Drak's residents with unbridled strength.\nIn the depths of the capital, among the most sacred shrines, twisted high prophets relentlessly siphon the energy of their fallen deities. Their insatiable lust for power threatens more than just the future of the Drakkari kingdom. If the rituals taking place inside Gun'Drak are left unchallenged, the burgeoning might of the trolls will soon flood across the entire region, and any chance of victory for the heroes battling the Scourge will be swept away in a torrent of chaos.\nViolet Hold.\nAmong the ornate spires and enchanted streets of Dalaran, a dark presence stirs within the mighty walls of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Long used to restrain threats to the city, the tower holds row upon row of deadly inmates, and it has been diligently watched over by the Kirin Tor. However, a sudden assault has tested the integrity of the hold, putting at risk the safety of everyone outside the &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;'s walls. Using the dungeon as a means to breach the city, Malygos and his blue dragonflight have begun to chip away at the Violet Hold's defenses, hungry to reclaim arcane dominance over Azeroth. Only the brave souls of those protecting the prison stand between the continued existence of Dalaran and the city's utter annihilation. \nViolet Hold.\nAmong the ornate spires and enchanted streets of Dalaran, the great Violet Hold stands as a testament to the glory of the city's rulers, the Kirin Tor.\nYet within its mighty walls, a dark truth awaits.\nFilled with row upon row of deadly inmates, the hold has long been used to restrain threats to Dalaran. This prison has been diligently watched over by the Kirin Tor, and even the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; found himself confined there after forging a desperate alliance with the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Although he managed to escape captivity with the help of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, the prison has otherwise enjoyed stability for many years . . . until now.\nIn a sudden, violent assault, Malygos has unleashed his blue dragonflight upon Dalaran, hungry to reclaim arcane dominance over Azeroth. Utilizing a massive crack in the Violet Hold's roof, agents of the Dragon Aspect have begun pouring through portals within the prison, testing its integrity and risking the safety of everyone outside its walls.\nOverwhelmed by the audacious attack, the Kirin Tor has called upon heroes of the Horde and Alliance for assistance, seeking to put a swift end to the invasion. As brave adventurers rush to aid Dalaran, rumors circulate about the escalating ferocity of the battle.\nViolet Hold defenders seeking a brief respite from the ongoing offensive warn that the dungeon's vile inmates have begun escaping from their cells due to Malygos' reckless actions. And that, the guards caution, is only the beginning.\nSo critical is his quest to destroy Dalaran, Malygos has sent &lt;a href=\"Cyanigosa\"&gt;Cyanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, one of his most powerful &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, to ensure victory and guarantee that the city is destroyed, along with any who dare defend it.\nAs the onslaught continues to chip away at the Violet Hold's defenses, only the brave souls protecting the prison stand between the continued existence of Dalaran and the city's utter annihilation.\nUlduar.\nUpon departing Azeroth, the titans entrusted loyal protectors with safeguarding &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, an enigmatic city nestled in the mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. Designated supreme among his brethren was the guardian known as &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, but with the power of the titan complex in his hands, he turned to darkness and plunged the region into chaos. The reasons for Loken's treachery and the fate of the other guardians remain a mystery, but there have been whispers of a great evil at work behind the fall of the titan city. For any heroes brave enough to seek out the truth, it lies within the corridors of the ancient compound. Thus far, however, few have braved the perils of Ulduar and returned to tell of their discoveries.\nHalls of Stone.\nFor ages, the mortal races of Azeroth have sought to uncover the origins of their existence. Tirelessly scouring the far reaches of the world, many have spent their entire lives chasing the ghosts of the past.\nNestled among the frigid cliffs of the Storm Peaks, a recently discovered titan city known as Ulduar might finally expose the secrets of Azeroth's puzzling history.\nLegendary explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; spent countless hours piecing together clues about the mysterious city while combing through artifacts scattered across the region. He deduced that a titan library might lie within one wing of the complex: the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt;. If so, the archive could prove to be his greatest discovery to date.\nHowever, in his attempts to access the library, Brann encountered foul creatures roaming the Halls of Stone. Infused with evil and shaped from iron, crazed dwarves had seized control of the city and spread throughout the Storm Peaks. To Brann's disgust, they had even turned their weapons on Ulduar, tunneling through its walls and carving out monstrous &lt;a href=\"crystal%20giant\"&gt;crystal giant&lt;/a&gt;s from the very heart of the mountains surrounding the city.\nThe source of these destructive iron dwarves is said to be the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an incredible titan device capable of creating life itself. Rumored to have fallen into the hands of the maddened vrykul &lt;a href=\"Sjonnir%20the%20Ironshaper\"&gt;Sjonnir the Ironshaper&lt;/a&gt;, the forge has unleashed unthinkable evil upon Ulduar and the Storm Peaks.\nIf wrested from its vile operator, the titan machine could be used to purge the dark presence that has taken hold of the city, but a powerful evil watches over the Halls of Stone, ensuring that Sjonnir and the forge continue their work undisturbed.\nThe forge is heavily guarded by impenetrable constructs and savage monsters awakened by the iron dwarves' ceaseless tunneling, and so securing control of it will be a formidable task. Yet if the chaotic iron legions overrunning the city are not stopped soon, priceless information within the Halls of Stone may be destroyed and lost... forever.\nHalls of Lightning.\nUpon departing Azeroth, the titans entrusted loyal protectors to safeguard the city of Ulduar. From atop the snowy mountains of the Storm Peaks, &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;these guardians&lt;/a&gt; watched over the enigmatic halls of the complex as history unfolded outside its walls. Designated supreme among these guardians was &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; Loken, but with the power of the titan city in his hands, he turned to darkness.\nRepudiating his oaths and unraveling the delicate plans of his masters, the treacherous protector turned ally against ally, breaking pacts long held by the ancient races of the Storm Peaks. His deceitful schemes swept through Ulduar and afflicted the city's other protectors. Amassing a powerful &lt;a href=\"Iron%20army\"&gt;force&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen watcher ravaged the surrounding area, striking down any who opposed his dark will.\nFrom his throne within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, Loken continues his unabated assault, brooding over a celestial image of the world.\nUlduar's loyal builders, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, are struggling against the corrupted watcher, and they warn that Loken has acquired the allegiance of ferocious allies to bolster the ranks of his iron minions. While &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; bristling with &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runic energy&lt;/a&gt; prowl the corridors of the Halls of Lightning, fierce &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s swarm around blistering forges, tirelessly churning out new followers.\nOnly putting an end to Loken's reign will ensure the safety of Azeroth. Although the arrival of Horde and Alliance forces has chipped away at the evil gripping the region, the true key to victory may lie with the beings long deceived by Loken's trickery, scattered among embittered enclaves throughout the Storm Peaks.\nLoken's brother, &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, wanders grief-stricken outside Ulduar. If he can be convinced of his brother's betrayal, he may turn the tide of battle in favor of the earthen and other heroes fighting to reclaim the city.\nYet as powerful as Loken is, there have been whispers of an even greater evil at work behind the fall of Ulduar. Perhaps only with Loken's last breath will the truth be revealed.\nUlduar.\nSince discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have journeyed to the magnificent titan city in hopes of unearthing its relics and learning the secrets of the past. Yet they are not fully aware of the purpose behind Ulduar's imposing edifice. It is not merely a repository of artifacts and titan research, but also a prison.\nLong ago, the titans encountered a race of horrifying aberrations known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Their destructive powers threatened to unravel Azeroth, eliminating all life and order. Alerted by this danger to their central tenets, the titans went to war against the Old Gods. Ultimately the titans used their prowess in architecture and construction to imprison their foes deep underground.\nThe Old God of death, &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, was shackled in the depths of Ulduar and placed under the watch of mighty guardians \u2013 Loken, &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;. They pledged to keep the monstrosity contained there for all eternity. The watchers of Ulduar endured their vigil with fortitude, but the Old God's insidious whispering could not be ignored forever.\nWith time, the prison's head guardian, Loken, succumbed to the will of Yogg-Saron. Betraying his allies, he seized control of the city and began directing its forces toward deadly new ends. Armies of iron dwarves destroyed the titan safeguards in the Storm Peaks, leaving all of Northrend exposed to the growing danger. Several regions have already felt the corrupting presence of Loken's servants, complicating the war against the Lich King.\nFaced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals has established a staging ground outside of Ulduar. They are preparing to launch a sweeping assault on the city, and they have called on Azeroth's mightiest heroes for aid. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and the towering defenses at Ulduar's entrance would take tremendous strength, but even that may not be enough to conquer the madness that dwells below.\nHaving turned the minds of its former captors, Yogg-Saron is preparing to exert its full power. With vast iron armies to command, the Old God is nearly ready to break its last bonds. It draws ever closer to annihilating the titans' creations and sinking the world into primitive chaos.\nThe preservation of Azeroth depends on Yogg-Saron's defeat, but the fall of Ulduar has other grave repercussions. A silent observer has arrived within the city to survey all of the damage that has occurred on the planet since the titans' departure. His cold logic will determine whether the world will be spared or destroyed.\nOnly Azeroth's heroes can alter the final judgment, for despite their many conflicts and transgressions, their resolve to confront evil in all of its manifestations has earned them the right to determine their ultimate fate.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nThe time to strike at the heart of the Scourge is drawing close. Clouds blanket the skies of Azeroth and heroes gather beneath battle-worn &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s in preparation for the coming storm. They say that even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. It is this hope that drives the men and women of the Argent Crusade: hope that the Light will see them through these trying times, hope that good will triumph over evil, hope that a hero blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; will come forth to put an end to the Lich King's dark reign.\nSo the Argent Crusade has sent out the call, a call to arms for all heroes far and wide, to meet at the very doorstep of the Lich King's domain and to prove their might in a tournament the likes of which Azeroth has never seen. Of course, a tournament such as this needs a fitting stage. A place where potential candidates are tested to the limits of exhaustion. A place where heroes... become &lt;a href=\"Champion%20%28rank%29\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. A place called the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. \nProve Your Might.\nThe Crusaders' Coliseum will see you and your friends facing off against a series of increasingly challenging bosses, terrible monsters the Argent Crusade brought in from all over Northrend. Although the challenge is great, you will find that the prizes the Argent Crusade has to offer will make it all well worth your while.\nThe setup for the Crusaders' Coliseum is surprisingly straightforward. If you are familiar with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt; quest line, you already have a vague idea of how the Crusaders' Coliseum plays out in principle. After you and your friends enter the coliseum, you will face the first of several &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es; once you've defeated a boss, you will move on to the next one. You must master the encounters one by one, until you finally face the raid's final challenge. Sound simple? That's because there is a twist.\nIn the \"Heroic\" version of the Crusaders' Coliseum, you and your raid only have a limited number of attempts for each raid lockout period, and each time your raid wipes, one of your attempts will be used up. To embark on the epic &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, you must first prove your worth by clearing either the 10 or 25 player version of the Crusaders' Coliseum's normal mode. After you have dealt the killing blow to the coliseum's final heroic mode boss will you be able to collect the Crusaders' Tribute, and the fewer attempts you needed to complete the Trial of the Grand Crusader, the better your reward will be.\nThe Frozen Halls.\nLooming over the stark wastes of Northrend, the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; awaits those who would see the Lich King and his Scourge brought low and the threat they pose wiped from the face of Azeroth. The heroes who venture within will face some of the greatest challenges and horrors yet seen. But before you burst in the front door of the Citadel itself, an alternate means of entry awaits you, with an epic journey into the new five-player dungeon, Icecrown Citadel: The &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcecrown Citadel will feature a massive five-player dungeon sprawling across three wings of the citadel's foundation. While the Lich King's attention is focused on the Argent Crusade and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; ripping through the front gates, players will be tested as they assist &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) in infiltrating the citadel through an alternate entrance.\nAn epic quest line will present adventurers with the task of weakening Icecrown Citadel's forces, requiring that players defeat the challenges in each dungeon wing before venturing into the next one. Normal and Heroic versions of the dungeon will be accessible to players, although each wing will be considered a separate instance; therefore, on Heroic difficulty, each wing will have its own separate lockout timer. All-new rewards -- including item level 219 (normal) and level 232 (Heroic) loot -- will be offered to those who destroy some of the Lich King's most formidable allies.\nThe Forge of Souls.\nServing as the first wing in this expansive dungeon, the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; will quickly put players to the test of carving through the Scourge stronghold into deeper, more treacherous locations. Jaina will command Alliance forces, and Sylvanas will direct Horde forces. The goal is to ruin the twisted engines known as &lt;a href=\"soul%20grinder\"&gt;soul grinder&lt;/a&gt;s found in this portion of the citadel, and then players can advance -- that is, if the Horde and Alliance forces can overcome the foes who confront them.\n&lt;a href=\"Bronjahm%2C%20the%20Godfather%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Bronjahm, the Godfather of Souls&lt;/a&gt;: An instrument of reckoning, Bronjahm watches over the engines in the Forge of Souls. He must be killed if the soul grinders are to be destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Devourer%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Devourer of Souls&lt;/a&gt;: As the chief operator of the engines found in this wing, the Devourer stands guard over the souls stolen by the Lich King.\nPit of Saron.\nAccessible only to those who have laid waste to the Forge of Souls' unholy operations, the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt; will bring Horde and Alliance forces deeper into the Lich King's domain. Players who venture here will immediately be confronted by the lord of this lair, &lt;a href=\"Scourgelord%20Tyrannus\"&gt;Scourgelord Tyrannus&lt;/a&gt;. But defeating him will not be as easy as it seems. Before they can present a threat to Tyrannus, the adventurers, instructed by their leaders, will need to free enslaved allies who have been trapped by the Scourge. Until that happens, Tyrannus will leave all adversaries to his minions, workers of the citadel's mines. Perhaps the challenges here will lend clues as to the whereabouts of the Lich King's private chambers outside of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Garfrost\"&gt;Forgemaster Garfrost&lt;/a&gt;: A master of Scourge weaponry, the forgemaster hauls stocks of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; and other precious materials to the cold forges where the mechanisms of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; are born. With a host of rime weapons and exotic alloys at his disposal, it could get cold in here.\n&lt;a href=\"Krick\"&gt;Krick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ick\"&gt;Ick&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s serve as mindless muscle in the Pit of Saron's mines, stockpiling metals for Forgemaster Garfrost, and Krick -- a devious &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt; -- supervises the operations from atop Ick, Krick's ghastly means of transportation.\nScourgelord Tyrannus: Tyrannus is a terrible force who will no doubt demonstrate his powers to those brave enough to enter the Pit of Saron. The scourgelord must die if players hope to make their way into the third and final wing of this dungeon.\nHalls of Reflection.\nWith Jaina and Sylvanas leading the way, adventurers who make it as far as these frigid halls will quickly recognize the weapon that lies ahead: &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, the corruptive, legendary device of the Lich King himself. The Lich King's private chambers are within reach, although they may be the death of anyone who ventures there.\n&lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captains&lt;/a&gt; for Arthas Menethil in life, Scourge &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28rank%29\"&gt;commanders&lt;/a&gt; for the Lich King in death, Falric and Marwyn will be summoned to the Halls of Reflection for one purpose: destroying all intruders.\nThe Lich King: Sylvanas, thirsty for vengeance against the corrupted prince who sentenced her to an existence as an undead monstrosity, and Jaina, eager to find a flicker of Arthas's soul locked somewhere within the Lich King, have brought their hand-picked allies to this final confrontation. Arthas's true power may only now be discovered. Is there any hope in this mission, or does only death await?\nReferences.\nThis article can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20101107211830/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/wrath-worlddungeons.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

The original articles are no longer available, but they can still be viewed through online archives (see below).\nArticle.\nTo help offset the strain and tension of constant warfare, the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance occasionally organize full-blown festivities for their people, centered around holidays and special events. What better way to celebrate the year's victories and other achievements than in the company of a few thousand of your closest allies? \nNew Years.\nAnother year is ending in the rich world of Azeroth. Countless battles have been fought, and numerous accolades achieved. It is time to laud victories and give remembrance to those lost. In celebration of the old year's passing and anticipation of the new, skilled brewers and talented pyrotechnicians have brought their finest creations to the bustling cities; join the party underway and ring in the new year with your fellow adventurers!\nFeatures.\nType: Holiday Event&lt;br&gt;\nDate: December 31st - January 1st&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: around Azeroth\nFireworks.\nThe innovative and artistic engineers of Undermine have been slaving away since their display of pyrotechnics in July. Their latest and greatest -- not to mention highly dangerous to operate -- creations will be on display in the cities of the world every hour after sunset. Keep your eyes to the skies, and be sure to stick around for the finale!\nPotent Potables.\nWhat good is a party without sampling some of the brewers' delicious work? Kegs of the finest brews are available in the cities of Azeroth, bringing good cheer as we bid farewell to the old year. Cups are available for all party-goers; simply pick one up and fill up at the keg to warm your belly and lift your heart!\nRevelers, All.\nMany soldiers formerly abroad have come home to engage in the festivities. Share in the merriment and dance with the revelers, or, if you're so inclined, blow a kiss to one that catches your eye. It's all in fun, after all; they appreciate the attention!\nLunar Festival.\nEvery year the druids of Moonglade hold a celebration of their city's great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts, and of course... shooting fireworks!\nFeatures.\nType: Holiday Event&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: All Major Cities, Booty Bay, Moonglade\nOmen.\nThe beast of Omen was once a hero of this world. A wolf of great strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the War of the Ancients until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across Azeroth and carried death and terror in his wake. Finally defeated in Moonglade, Omen now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. But each new year, during the festival, he stirs...\nElders.\nDuring the Lunar Festival, adventurers will have the opportunity to honor many of their elders, and by doing so, they will also honor their culture and their people. For this, the Coins of Ancestry serve as a tangible means to recognize those who have chosen the venerable path of respect. Those who are recognized thus will have their diligence rewarded with a selection of unique items.\nFireworks.\nThe innovative and artistic engineers of Undermine have been slaving away since their display of pyrotechnics in July. Their latest and greatest -- not to mention highly dangerous to operate -- creations will be on display in the cities of the world every hour after sunset.

Share in the merriment and dance with the revelers, or, if you're so inclined, blow a kiss to one that catches your eye. It's all in fun, after all; they appreciate the attention!\nFestival Outfits.\nTo help celebrate the festivities, a selection of unique clothing become available to adventurers. Such outfits have been worn in times past during the Lunar Festival and each is hand-crafted with only the finest soft fabrics and other quality components.\nHistory.\nThe Lunar Festival is a time of celebration. The peoples of Azeroth celebrate their triumph of many thousands of years ago, when an alliance of good races (Night Elves, Tauren, and Earthen - a proto-dwarven race) defeated a terrible evil. It is also a time of remembrance for the valor and wisdom of that ancient age.\nThe demi-god Omen was a being of great strength and knowledge. Blessed by Elune, Omen wandered primordial Kalimdor, guiding hunters and gatherers and offering luck and advice to all he met. When the Burning Legion launched their attack, Omen allied with Azeroth's defenders. He fought bravely but after many battles his wounds from demonic forces plunged Omen into a deep, dreaming sleep... where fel-inspired nightmares slowly consumed him. When he finally awoke, centuries later, he had fallen to madness.\nThe transformed Omen rampaged. No longer a creature of wisdom - but still possessing the strength of Elune's blessing - he tore through the land, killing and devouring. Terror rode before him, and death trailed in his wake.\nOmen's spree of horror ended when a coterie of ancient heroes gathered in the village of Nighthaven and faced the beast. They called down the moon's wrath and Omen, blinded and stunned by the power of the moon goddess, fled into the deep waters of Lake Elune'ara. That day marked the end of his rampage, and symbolized a new beginning for the people of Azeroth and the followers of Elune.\nToday, the Lunar Festival is held by the druids of Nighthaven. Both the Horde and Alliance are welcomed to celebrate and shoot fireworks - a symbol of Elune's power. Ancient heroes of the past also appear throughout the land, offering gifts to those who find and honor them.\nIt is a time of happiness and fortune and celebration, but it has a deeper motive as well...\nOmen, defeated so many centuries ago, yet remains in Lake Elune'ara. Although driven insane by the Burning Legion, the demi-god still possesses Elune's blessing and is, hence, immortal. During the Lunar Festival, he stirs... and heroes of the land are called to defeat him once again. \nLove is in the Air.\nSomething is in the air in the major cities of Azeroth. Some call it love, and some just call it friendship and admiration. Whichever it is, many guards and townsfolks now spend their days giving and receiving tokens and gifts to other amorous citizens.\nThe more skeptical, however, are suspicious of the strange \"love sickness\" clouding the hearts of so many. Will this widespread occurrence be simply taken as a recent outbreak of amore? Or will our brave adventurers find a sinister plot behind the source of this plague of passion? Only time will tell... \nFeatures.\nType: Unexplained Phenomenon&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Undercity\nVendors.\nLovely Merchant NPCs in each race's capital cities offer to exchange love-themed items, including those listed below, for Love Tokens. You can continue to gain Love Tokens by completing daily quests. \nDaily Quests.\nEach of these quests awards Love Tokens which can be used to purchase items from Lovely Merchants.\nBouquet of Ebon Roses.\nYou can obtain a Bouquet of Ebon Roses that is part of the criteria for the achievement \"My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\" from the following bosses:\nSeasonal Boss.\nA special boss is located inside Shadowfang Keep, deep within Silverpine Forest. For the daily quest \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Served,\u201d you\u2019ll need to serve the Court Subpoena to Apothecary Hummel in Shadowfang Keep. This is similar to the special bosses that are available for Brewfest and Hallow\u2019s End. You can complete this quest each day, and one time per party member. After being served, Apothecary Hummel drops special items, including a rare flying mount. \nScreenshots.\nPlayer-Submitted Screenshot Gallery.\nCheck out 34 of our favorite screenshots submitted by players below: \nNoblegarden.\nIts origins steeped in druidic festivals from times long past, the current incarnation of Noblegarden is a contrast between ancient traditions and modern interpretations. While some races of Azeroth try to stay true to the original spirit of the holiday, others prefer a more lighthearted approach -- in essence, looking everywhere for festively decorated eggs and collecting the goodies found therein. One tenet all can agree on is that the feast of Noblegarden is meant to bring communities together to share the joy of life and friendship.\nChildren's Week.\nCelebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, Children's Week is a time for the heroes of both factions to give something back to the innocents of war: the orphans!\nFeatures.\nType: Children's Holiday&lt;br&gt;\nDate: May 2 - 8&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Shattrath\nSightseeing.\nAll orphans wish they had someone to show them the wonders of the world. Throughout the year, they spend their time wandering around their home cities of Stormwind or Orgrimmar, dreaming of the day they'll be old enough (and big enough) to venture out into the world alone and see the sights their parents would have shown them. During Children's Week, though, brave adventurers for the Horde and the Alliance can make these kids' dreams come true! To help these kids see the world, all you have to do is visit the orphanage for your faction. Talk to either Orphan Matron Nightingale in Stormwind (Alliance) or Orphan Matron Battlewail in Orgrimmar (Horde). After that, you and your young friend can adventure together across Azeroth! Below are some of the places and people the orphans want to visit:\nPet Rewards.\nAfter you complete your adventures across the lands of Azeroth, bring your young friend back to the orphanage. He will then be so thrilled and grateful that he will offer you one of his favorite pets to remember him by! \nChildren's Week in Shattrath.\nVictims of war in Outland, the orphans of Shattrath's Lower City also need company and adventure. Talk to Orphan Matron Mercy to offer an orphan the adventure of a lifetime as you take them travelling across Outland and learn a little about your ward along the way.\nThe outcome of the ongoing battle against the Burning Legion may one day lie in the hands of these children, so a little encouragement, or a push in the right direction, could make all the difference. Prepare yourself for answering all those tricky questions that children ask, as you show them the sights of:\nAnd while doing a good deed is a reward in itself, there's something special waiting for you back in Shattrath to help you remember your orphan friend throughout the year ahead. \nMidsummer Fire Festival.\nType: Holiday Event&lt;br&gt;\nDate: June 21 - July 4&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Azeroth and Outland\nAh, so you weren't chosen for Flamekeeper this year? Don't fret, my friend! The Midsummer Fire Festival isn't merely about that traditional honor; it's a time of merriment, a chance to celebrate the hottest season of the year by lighting great fires across the land and sharing in what the elemental spirits can offer. Come to our camps and join in the revelry!\nTending the Flames.\nAcross Azeroth, brilliant bonfires have been lit to signify the hottest months of the year. The chosen Flamekeepers are eager to ensure they continue burning long into the days and nights of the celebration - and they seek the aid of able explorers in doing so. Traverse the land and delve into dangerous dungeons at their behest. You may return hot, sweaty, and a little sooty...but these spiritual guides understand well the need to reward adventurers beyond the promise of \"enlightenment.\"\nJoining the Festivities.\nEvery city has a prominently located Fire Festival camp where you can pick up quests to participate in the Festival fun. Shattrath City has a camp as well, but it does not offer all of the quests. The Midsummer Fire Festival has plenty to offer to both high level and lower level characters. By doing the quests and visiting the flames around the world, characters will earn gold, experience, and perhaps participate in some World PvP and exploration. In addition, groups of maximum level characters can summon a new boss with epic rewards for the duration of the event. Characters of all levels can turn in Burning Blossoms for unique Fire Festival rewards. \nFeatures.\nBurning Blossoms.\nBurning Blossoms are the currency used for the Fire Festival and are used to purchase seasonal reward items from Midsummer Suppliers and Merchants. You can collect Burning Blossoms by completing quests, including the daily quests that are part of the festival. Using them near a Fire Festival Bonfire also grants a temporary but useful buff to your character, or reignites an extinguished bonfire - but consumes the blossom in the process. \nAhune, the Frost Lord.\nCharacters of level 78 or higher can utilize the Looking for Dungeon tool to do battle with Ahune, the Frost Lord. Ahune is a unique seasonal boss, similar to Hallow's End's Headless Horseman, who can only be confronted during the Fire Festival. If you can find and defeat Ahune, you'll be able to loot his special rewards, including a selection of epic items and a brand new Frigid Frostling pet.\nDancing Around the Ribbon Pole.\nAt every festival camp, one of these traditional decorations stands tall beside the bonfire. Take up one of the multi-colored ribbons and dance around the pole with your friends and fellow celebrants! The activity may appear a bit frivolous for your average ferocious fighter, but even the most seasoned veteran can appreciate the resulting 10% bonus to experience from killing monsters.\nTorch Tossing.\nSo you want to be a fire juggler? If you think you have what it takes - the dexterity, the reflexes, the courage - this is your chance to prove it! Take the provided torches and look for the braziers with markers flashing above them. While standing near the bonfire, throw a torch at each brazier as soon a mark appears above it. You must hit the marked brazier before the mark fades if you want credit for the toss. It's a good idea to place the practice torch on your action bar for easy access. After you have completed this quest, you unlock a follow-up quest to catch torches (below), and subsequently, a daily version.\nTorch Catching.\nAfter successfully completing Torch Tossing, you're ready to show that you can not only throw torches, but catch them as well. Take the provided unlit torches and stand near the bonfire. Throw a torch in the air by right-clicking it, then follow its flight path (look for the shadow it casts on the ground) and catch it when it lands. To ensure that you catch the torch, stop running the instant before it lands. After you catch enough torches, you will unlock a daily version of this quest and Torch Tossing (above) which each grant five Burning Blossoms a day. Additionally, you will be able to toss torches to and catch torches from other players.\nUnusual Activity.\nWhile celebration has its place, there are graver matters to attend to as well. When the festival began, reports began filtering in from Ashenvale about a sharp increase in Twilight Cult activity. Go to the camp just south of the Blackfathom Deeps entrance, in the ruins, and see if the cultists there will part with this information. This quest line continues on, eventually unlocking a daily quest for ten Burning Blossoms where the objective is to kill a particular enemy NPC.\nHonor or Desecrate the Flame.\nFestival fires burn across the land, in Alliance and Horde settlements alike. If you make time to honor those of your faction, while desecrating those of the opposing faction, you will earn rewards for your efforts. You receive five Burning Blossoms for each same-faction fire you honor and ten for each opposing-faction fire you desecrate, and there are about 30 of each. Each individual fire can only be interacted with once per year. If you find them all, you can collect over 300 Burning Blossoms - which comes in handy if you wish to buy the big prizes. Additionally, if you manage to sneak into an enemy capital city to descecrate their flame, you will be rewarded with gold, a choice of consumable items, and 25 Burning Blossoms. You must be level 50 or above to capture the flame of an enemy capital. If you capture the flame of all four enemy capitals you will receive a special reward - the wearable Crown of the Fire Festival! The enemy players and guards likely won't take too kindly to your efforts, however. To add extra incentive to keeping your flame alive, all friendly players in the vicinity of a lit flame for your faction receive a special buff that grants bonus fire damage with every attack - and if your flame gets snuffed out, so does the buff.\nFire in the Sky.\nThe lengthy Midsummer Fire Festival traditionally ends with the sky itself being set alight. The goblins of Undermine have lent their considerable skill (and copious amounts of gunpowder) to the task, resulting in a tremendous fireworks show! Take up a festival mug and raise a toast to the season as the multicolored explosions dance across the sky above you! \nPeon Day.\nOn September 30th, goblin vendors arrived in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. These vendors sold fireworks at discounted prices. The reason? So that everyone might celebrate the Day that was saved by the hard work of the mighty peon and the great peasant!\nLegend has it that long ago, the leaders of the two races: orc and human, each called upon a lowly worker and assigned him a great task. This task had to be finished by the end of the day, lest the world suffer grave consequence. Working diligently, both completed their task four minutes before the day ended. Thus, on the anniversary of that day, we celebrate in honor of them and of all the peons and the peasants everywhere.\nHarvest Festival.\nCelebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, the Harvest Festival is a time to commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help their allies. The Alliance honors the memory of all the fallen, but most especially Uther Lightbringer. The Horde also remembers those who have fallen, with special emphasis on the memory of Grom Hellscream.\nFeatures.\nType: Memorial Holiday&lt;br&gt;\nDate: September 16 - September 22&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Ironforge, Orgrimmar\nHonoring a Hero.\nThroughout history, many have given their lives to aid their allies. Every year, members of the Horde and the Alliance set aside time to honor the memories of the fallen and to pay tribute to those whose memories are held most dear: Uther Lightbringer, for the Alliance, and Grom Hellscream, for the Horde. Heroes take time from their adventures to visit the graves of these two great leaders and to leave a tribute to them at the memorial. To show their respect, members of the Alliance light a candle at the Tomb of Uther Lightbringer in the Western Plaguelands. Members of the Horde show their respect to Grom Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.\nAlso, adventurers can see the spirits of the fallen outside of Orgrimmar and Ironforge and can take a moment to heft a mug of Harvest Nectar to their memory. Other harvest foods are laid out on the tables as well, for those who have made the perilous journey to their hero's tomb to pay him tribute. Adventurers can satisfy their hunger on Harvest Fish, Harvest Fruits, or Harvest Boar, as well as quaffing some Harvest Nectar.\nRewards.\nAfter you complete your journey to your hero's tomb and have left a tribute to his memory, return to Javnir Nashak outside of Orgrimmar or to Wagner Hammerstrike outside of Ironforge in order to receive your reward:\nFestival Foods.\nAs part of remembering the fallen heroes, feasts will be held outside of Ironforge and Orgrimmar. Adventurers are invited to partake of the feasts and let the food strengthen them so that they may face whatever comes their way. The foods available at the Harvest Festival are:\nScreenshots.\nEnjoy this player-submitted screenshot gallery of the Harvest Festival. \nPirates' Day.\nType: Single-day holiday event&lt;br&gt;\nDate: September 19&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Booty Bay, Stranglethorn Vale\nYarrrr matey, it be Pirates' Day! Commoners wearing pirate garb have appeared in all the world's cities with the news that the Dread Captain DeMeza and her crew have landed in Booty Bay and declared it Pirates' Day! If you are brave enough to share a drink with her, you may have what it takes to become an honorary crew member for the day.\nFirst, talk to any pirate commoner to receive a costume to help you get into the spirit of Pirates' Day. Once appropriately attired, head down to Booty Bay to join in the fun. There, look for Dread Captain Demeza and her crew, who have taken over the roof of the Booty Bay bank and auction house. By talking to Captain DeMeza, players become an honorary crew member and transform into a pirate of their race and gender for 12 hours. This costume buff may be clicked off but persists through combat, mounting, death, and so on. Other highlights of the holiday include:\nBrewfest.\nCelebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, the Brewfest is a time to enjoy the fruits of the harvest: pretzels, cheese, and brew! The competing breweries Thunderbrew, Barleybrew, and the Ogres, all come together outside of all the major cities in a bid to outdo each other with their special ales, meads, and beers. Brave adventurers are invited to sit back, take a pull, and sample the finest wares these brewers have to offer! \nFeatures.\nType: Brewfest&lt;br&gt;\nDate: September 20 - October 5&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: The main Brewfest festivals are located near Orgrimmar and Ironforge. Beer gardens will also be set up outside of Silvermoon City, Darnassus, Undercity, Stormwind, Thunder Bluff, the Exodar, and Shattrath.\nEnjoying the Brew.\nComplimentary mugs filled with fresh, foamy beer sit atop tables outside of all the major cities. If you drink one down while standing near one of the brewers' stands outside of Ironforge or Orgrimmar, one of their assistants will toss you a new mug. You can also fill up your empties at any of the kegs sitting near the brewers' stands. At Brewfest, you'll never have to worry about how you'll quench your thirst!\nThings To Do.\nBrewfest is about more than just sampling fine ales from all over Azeroth and Outland. Read on to find out what mighty deeds you can do while quenching your thirst:\nScreenshots.\nEnjoy this player-submitted screenshot gallery of Brewfest revelry. Adventuring is thirsty work! \nHallow's End.\nObserved by both the Horde and the Alliance, Hallow's End is the celebration of the break between the Forsaken and the Scourge. Many tricks and treats await adventurers seeking holiday fun, including defeating the Headless Horseman, visiting inns and cities for fun items such as masks and costumes, and eating way too much candy in one sitting. Read below for more things to do during spooky season on Azeroth! \nFeatures.\nType: Seasonal Holiday&lt;br&gt;\nDate: October 18 - October 31st&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Cities and inns throughout Azeroth and Outland\nTrick or Treat.\nEvery year during Hallow's End, adventurers celebrate the time when the Forsaken broke away from the Scourge. Heroes for the Horde and Alliance can speak with any innkeeper and get a Treat Bag with a fun surprise inside! Open it as soon as you get it or else it will fade away. Be wary, though. The innkeepers are just as likely to trick you, changing your perspective on life.\nIn addition to the innkeepers with their tricks and their Treat Bags, adventurers can purchase sweets from vendors in Orgrimmar and Ironforge. If candy isn't quite your thing, no problem! Every inn has a tub prepared for a game of Bobbing for Apples. Also, Jesper, an orphan in Stormwind, and Spoops, an orphan in Orgrimmar, are both sick and can't join in the Hallow's End festivities themselves. Brave adventurers can make these two children feel better by speaking with certain innkeepers and bringing the treats they give you back to the orphans as a gift.\nThe Wickerman Festival, which takes place outside the Undercity every evening, promises fun for the Horde and the Alliance! For those interested more in tricks than treats, Darkcaller Yanka wants members of the Horde to throw stink bombs at the Alliance town of Southshore. Sergeant Hartman in Southshore encourages members of the Alliance to do their best to stop the Horde lest they be stuck cleaning up the stink! To get back at the Horde, he'll also ask you to crash the Wickerman Festival outside of the Undercity. Everyone is advised to sharpen their blades, tighten their girths, and prepare for battle!\nCandy Buckets.\nWhat would Hallow's End be without excessive amounts of sweet, sweet candy? Candy Buckets (prominently marked with an exclamation mark) are located in inns throughout Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, and Outland. Reach in and help yourself to a handful of assorted candy, which you then open by right-clicking it in your inventory. In addition, each candy bucket grants an experience point reward, or for maximum level characters, gold compensation. Note that you can only hold one Handful of Candy at a time, so make sure you open it before looting another candy bucket. Find all the candy buckets in each continent for achievements, and another achievement is earned by looting every last candy bucket in the land! If you're wondering which candy buckets remain on your list, open up your Achievements panel and look for the relevant achievements under the \"Hallow's End\" category, which itself is listed under \"World Events.\"\nThe candies themselves confer temporary beneficial effects upon eating them. One of the candies, G.N.E.R.D.S., are associated with one of the new Hallow's End achievements - while under the effects of the G.N.E.R.D.S. buff, get 50 honorable kills on enemy players in player-vs-player combat. If your supply of G.N.E.R.D.S. is exhausted, you can obtain them from other players or from the auction house, as they are not soulbound.\nThe Headless Horseman.\nAdventurers who find themselves in Goldshire, Azure Watch, Kharanos, Brill, Razor Hill, or Silvermoon City may stumble upon the Headless Horseman as he flies over the town, inciting terror in the populace and setting their homes and buildings ablaze! Those who are brave of heart should talk to the Costumed Orphan Matron nearby to learn how they can help douse the flames and bring down the headless horror. Successfully fending off the Horseman's attacks by extinguishing the fires is a daily quest. This quest is best attempted when other players are in the vicinity, as the intensity of the flames is too much for one player to reasonably handle.\nAnother daily quest leads players into the Scarlet Monastery in search of the dreaded Horseman. Heroes who wish to vanquish this scary shade once and for all can find his shrine located in the Scarlet Monastery graveyard. Once there, adventurers can summon and defeat him, ending his terrifying travails for good - and earning some fun and useful rewards in the process, including epic armor, seasonal broomstick mounts, a special pet, and even the Headless Horseman's mount!\nRewards.\nBelow are the rewards you can get by helping the sick orphans, Jesper and Spoops, as well as the Treat Bag given out by innkeepers.\nHere is a small sample of some of the treats inside of the Treat Bags that you can get:\nHallow's End Foods.\nVendors in Ironforge and Orgrimmar are selling special treats as part of the celebration of Hallow's End. Below are the seasonal treats you can purchase from these vendors:\nScreenshots.\nWe have collected 65 of the best Hallow's End screenshots for you to enjoy in a special screenshot gallery.\nDay of the Dead.\nFor the Day of the Dead festivities, the people of Azeroth and Outland gather in the graveyards of every major city to cook, eat, drink, don costumes, and more in celebration of those they've lost. Because the spirit world draws closest to the world of the living during this eerie holiday, we decorate the graves of our dearly departed with flowers and candles and offerings to welcome them back, even if only for a short while. \nFeatures.\nType: Memorial Holiday&lt;br&gt;\nDate: November 1-2&lt;br&gt;\nLocations: graveyards of all major cities (Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, The Exodar, Orgrimmar, The Undercity, Silvermoon City, Thunder Bluff, Shattrath City, and Dalaran City)\nDance with Catrina.\nWhat better way to celebrate the memories of those we've lost than through the ritualistic power of dance -- and all the better during the Day of the Dead holiday, when we're most among their ghostly presence? Dance and revel, and the inhabitants of the spirit world will dance and revel with you, and they will receive your gifts of food and drink and take with them on their eternal journeys the knowledge that they are loved. And, if you approach Catrina in the midst of this merriment, select her, and type /dance in honor of the fallen, you will be granted an achievement and a 12-hour buff, Honor the Dead, which will change your appearance to that of Catrina or Chapman, the graveyard vendor who also appears during this holiday.\nThe Grateful Dead.\nPurchase some Orange Marigold or a Bouquet of Orange Marigolds from Chapman and use them to see the otherwise invisible spirit in the graveyard.\nIt's good to visit with friends and family again, though I may have overdone it... I've already eaten everything they made for me, says the Cheerful Human Spirit. Might I trouble you for some of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful. Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.\nAcquire some Bread of the Dead and give it to the Cheerful Spirit.\nYour reward is a Macabre Marionette, a sombrero-wearing, maraca-wielding skeleton companion pet. This pet can only be used during the Day of the Dead event; it cannot be learned and kept like other companion pets.\nPilgrim's Bounty.\nWe invite you to celebrate Pilgrim's Bounty with us. It's a time for reflecting on your journeys and good fortune, sharing plentiful food, and stories with friends.\nYou can partake in wonderful Pilgrim's Bounty feasts near major towns by sitting at a Bountiful Table and enjoying the foods you find there.\nIf you're interested in learning the Pilgrim's Bounty's recipes, speak with an NPC outside any major city. Stuffing and potatoes are easy enough to put in front of a fire, but if you want to cook a turkey, you'll need to catch one first. Unsling your trusty Turkey Shooter and prepare for the hunt. \nFeatures.\nType: Seasonal Holiday&lt;br&gt;\nDate: November 22 - 28&lt;br&gt;\nLocations: \nBountiful Tables.\nBountiful Tables are the centerpiece of the Pilgrim's Bounty celebration. They are tables loaded with food and surrounded by interactive chairs that allow you to eat and share food with other players via the action bar.\nA Bountiful Table is laid out with five different Pilgrim's Bounty foods, one in front of each chair. Each chair has an unlimited supply of one food, and they are conveniently labeled: The Sweet Potato Chair, The Turkey Chair, The Stuffing Chair, The Cranberry Chair, and The Pie Chair. While in a chair, you may eat as much of that food as you like, as well as pass servings of that food to other players sitting in the chairs. Share the bountiful feasts with your friends!\nIf you eat five helpings of any single food, you'll gain benefits unique to that food. In addition, if you eat five helpings of every food, you'll gain the Spirit of Sharing which lasts one hour and increases reputation gained by 10%. This is accomplished much faster if you work together with your fellow feasters at passing food to one another.\nDaily Cooking Quests.\nPilgrim's Bounty also plays host to a series of daily cooking quests designed to help chefs master their craft with seasonal recipes plucked from a Bountiful Cookbook. These quests require players to travel between the major cities of Azeroth and to fill the stomachs of armies with seasonal food. The reward for these quests is a Turkey Caller, a prize that ensures that the accomplished pilgrim will never go hungry again. \nFeast of Winter Veil.\nHo ho hello, um, little child. I'm Greatfather Winter, and I - courtesy of the fine folks of Smokywood Pastures... \"Fresh from our farm to your plate, it's Smokywood Pastures wholesome goodness\" - would like to wish you a fantastic Feast of Winter Veil.\nIf you've been good this year, maybe you'll receive treats from Smokywood Pastures as your treat for the Feast of Winter Veil. Huzzah.\nAlso, be sure to stock up on treats to give those who've been nice this year. Smokywood Pastures has a great selection to choose from. Look for them at a major city near you. \nFeatures.\nType: Holiday Event&lt;br&gt;\nDate: December - January&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Most Major Cities\nGreatfather Winter.\nGreatfather Winter is visiting the great cities of Ironforge and Orgrimmar - courtesy of the fine folks of Smokywood Pastures and he's spreading cheer in celebration for the Feast of Winter Veil. But, all the cheer-spreading is making Greatfather Winter hungry, and he's looking for adventurers to get him his daily fix of milk and cookies. \nWinter Veil Bosses.\nThe denizens of the dungeons of Northrend are also getting into the holiday spirit, and some dungeon bosses even wear festive Winter Hats just like Greatfather Winter's. Defeat a Winter Veil boss, and the boss's hat is yours!\nWinter Veil bosses of Northrend:\nRevelers.\nDuring the Feast of Winter Veil, the innkeepers bring out holiday decorations to provide a festive atmosphere for their patrons. Who knows what might happen if you /kiss a reveler standing near a sprig of mistletoe...\nGift-Giving.\nIn the quiet, early hours of the 25th of December, the industrious goblins of Smokywood Pastures are already awake. As a much-deserved reward for the noble adventurers throughout Azeroth, these generous harbingers of the holidays deposit gifts underneath the decorated trees in Orgrimmar and Ironforge. Keep a keen eye out for these presents, as they're there for the taking!\nStarts: December 25&lt;br&gt;\nEnds: January 2\nMetzen the Reindeer.\nDisaster has struck! Metzen the Reindeer has been kidnapped! Metzen is one of Greatfather Winter's eight reindeer - and property of Smokywood Pastures. The Jinglepocket Goblins have received two ransom letters from groups claiming to have Metzen. Concerned adventurers should visit Ironforge or Orgrimmar for more information.\nSmokeywood Pastures' Missing Shipment.\nSmokeywood Pastures needs a few brave adventurers to investigate the disappearance of a shipment of holiday goods. Rumors are the shipment are in the possession of the Abominable Greench, found somewhere in the snowy regions of the Alterac Mountains.\nJinglepocket Goblins' Fare Shops.\nThe Jinglepocket Goblins have set up their seasonal fare shops in major cities. Adventurers can purchase many holiday favorites - including Greatfather's Winter ale, candy canes, gingerbread cookie recipes, and mistletoes.\nSnowballs.\nWhether you pick them up from your local vendor or ask a friendly engineer to craft them for you, no feast of Winter Veil is complete without some frozen projectile-weapons. Get your mitts on some snowballs and say, \"Merry Feast of Winter Veil\" the old-fashioned way!\nSnowmen.\nAccompanying Greatfather Winter in his journeys across Azeroth are his loyal troops of snowmen. They can be found wandering around Ironforge and Orgrimmar, bringing with them the chill breath of winter into even the warmest climates. \nHistory.\nThe later seasons of Azeroth are marked as a time of change in many cultures. The Dwarves and the Tauren especially look to a legend of the coming Winter Veil - the blanketing of the land in snow, thus heralding a time of renewal - as a time for celebration.\nThe term \"Winter Veil\" is said to stem from a supernatural being referred in many cultures to as Greatfather Winter. As he would walk the land late in the seasons, winter itself would be his billowing cloak. In his wake was the blanketing of the land in snow, and thus it is said that Greatfather Winter would cast his wintry veil over the land. Though parts of Azeroth may lie in snow, it gives the land time for rebirth and renewal.\nThe idea of feasting during this time of year is one that traces its origins to the legend itself. As Greatfather Winter walked Azeroth, it is said he would provide a bounty for those who welcomed his presence. As such, the idea of feasting during the winter veil would bring together communities as they shared whatever they had. Typically, a single day of merriment and feasting welcomed the change, all in anticipation of the land's renewal.\nOther cultures have begun to recognize the Feast of Winter Veil as a time of great celebration, though not in the same traditions as the legend bases it in. Customs, often unrelated to anything other than a chance for celebration and gift exchange, have made their way into modern observation of the season. Even the image of Greatfather Winter is sometimes used, but more as a harbringer of commercial exploit rather than as a supernatural titan. "}

Players can create an in-game petition (usually called a \"&lt;a href=\"ticket\"&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt;\") to alert the GMs of certain problems they are experiencing. GMs are reactive in their response to problems, and as a result won't take action until a ticket has been filed and they have been informed about the issue. The issue must be one they can assist with and they must be able to verify that action is required, which is done entirely via internal logs.\nThe term GM or Game Master has been occasionally and incorrectly used by fans to refer to any Blizzard employee working on World of Warcraft. To avoid confusion, developers, and others with specific jobs are referred to by those titles. All official Blizzard posters, GMs or not, are referred to as \"blues\" or \"blue posters\" on the official forums.\nGame Masters are NOT to be used for help with normal game play, hints on quests, asking them for money, asking them for gear, etc.\nAbout the job.\nIn October 2010, MachinimaRealm (on Youtube) released an interview with a former Game Master in World of Warcraft. She answered submitted questions from players about Game Masters. One question was about whether it was an office job or not. She answered that it was in fact a full-time office job. She then also mentioned that Game Masters could only play as a GM on special computers configured for it, so it is not possible to simply login as a Game Master using a password from home.\nWhen asked about the work environment she answered that she believed Game Masters had to be among the most enthusiastic World of Warcraft-players she had ever met. They were not allowed to play the game while working but would often do so during lunch breaks. Another Game Master who answered questions submitted on Reddit was of another opinion, stating that becoming a Game Master was a good way to get rid of one's WoW-addiction. He did emphasize however that it was a really good work environment since they shared many of the same interests.\nGM interaction.\nThere are a few ways a GM can contact a player:\nFunctions.\nMisconceptions about Game Masters.\nThere are a few things that Game Masters can't do but they are often mistakenly believed to be capable of. Some of these things include:\nArmor.\nGMs generally wear &lt;a href=\"Gamemaster%27s%20Slippers\"&gt;Gamemaster's Slippers&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Gamemaster%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Gamemaster's Robe&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Gamemaster%20Hood\"&gt;Gamemaster Hood&lt;/a&gt;, though one has been seen wearing aesthetic gear.\nNotable Game Master responses.\n\"It should be noted that asking Game Masters these questions is not their purpose, and while they may have responded in a friendly manner, it's not recommended to clog up ticket queues with spam tickets.\"\nLead and Senior Game Master.\nTitles one can see in the official forums in signatures of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20forum%20poster\"&gt;Blizzard forum poster&lt;/a&gt;s. So far, they tend to post in the Realm Status forum. It is known that Senior Game Masters are the \"shift leaders\". They make sure that none of the GMs do anything they are not supposed to do, and also hand in the weekly reports written by each of the Game Masters.\nSome of the moderators of the &lt;a href=\"CS%20Forum%20Representative\"&gt;Customer Support&lt;/a&gt; forum have Game Master backgrounds."}

They work best when combined with a coherent role-playing narrative.\nTwinking.\n&lt;a href=\"Twink\"&gt;Twinking&lt;/a&gt; is the most common alternative play style. To twink is to stop a character's advancement below the top level, and to outfit the character as well as possible. It is supported in several ways. The game allows you to disable experience gains at any time, and twinks in battlegrounds are set up against other twinks rather than normal players.\nThe Hated.\nHated characters attempt to become \"hated\" with all possible factions, even their own. They attack all yellow NPCs. It is helpful to click the \"at war\" checkbox in the reputation tab with all factions that will allow it.\nPacifism.\nPacifist characters do not kill anything. No action that increases the \"Total kills\" statistic (in the statistics tab) is allowed. This play style has become easier (even possible?) with Cataclysm, since mining and herb-gathering grant experience."}

Until the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, Gamon was level 12 and one of the only Horde-attackable &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s in Orgrimmar. He was part of an early &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; quest but was primarily renowned for being repeatedly killed for no reason. This familiarity eventually made him an effective symbol of the increasing brutality and racism of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; forces during \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", culminating with his raid appearance. As a former low-level named NPC who was elevated to a more powerful and prominent position (likely in recognition of his status among the player community), he is similar to the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGamon was present as a level 12 &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; NPC in Orgrimmar when \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" launched. He played a role for young &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s by holding &lt;a href=\"Tazan%27s%20Key\"&gt;Tazan's Key&lt;/a&gt;, which was required to be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed for &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattered%20Hand%20%282%29\"&gt;The Shattered Hand (2)&lt;/a&gt;. The quest described Gamon as a drunkard and the assistant of &lt;a href=\"Tazan\"&gt;Tazan&lt;/a&gt;, a troll who traded with the pirates near &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and who possessed information wanted by the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause players cannot pickpocket friendly targets, Gamon had to be attackable. This, in combination with his non-threatening combat abilities, convenient placement in Orgrimmar's inn, and lack of consequences for his death, led to him being frequently and casually killed. Much to the frustration of rogues on the quest, this could make it quite difficult to find him alive to pick his pockets; they would have to count on his five-minute &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; timer and hope he did not get &lt;a href=\"one-shot\"&gt;one-shot&lt;/a&gt; immediately by a high-level player.\nAs the community grew, Gamon attracted more and more attention for his role as a target for assassination and other attacks. His location in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;main valley&lt;/a&gt; of Orgrimmar encouraged players to kill and interfere with him in more and more creative ways, such as dragging him in front of the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; for more onlookers, or using &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; to make him approach other players. A tradition began of responding with &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt;s to his corpse, ranging from /mourn to /laugh to /spit. Jokes, for instance about &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; weapons being &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;ed from him, became common. &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt;s of level 1 players were formed to fight him as if he were a raid boss.\nSome of this treatment by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players is comparable to that of &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players; both serve as a sort of mascot for low-level, casual, social gameplay. Hogger, however, was not in a city, which meant that Gamon's murders were comparatively casual, spur-of-the-moment decisions, and had a wider audience - even if killed inside the inn, the sound of a tauren death groan could be heard from outside. Gamon was also neutral rather than &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt;, marking him as a sort of \"innocent\". These differences contributed to the atmosphere of Orgrimmar as being a rough place compared to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Gamon is ultimately much more well-known for this role as \"victim of Orgrimmar\" than for the quest he was involved in.\nDeath knights and the Forsaken revolt.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; introduction chain, when new Horde death knights entered Orgrimmar for the first time, Gamon promised to protect the citizens of the city from the encroaching \"threat\". While all other NPCs appeared simply , Gamon was actively and chased after any death knight that came too close, loudly yelling that he would save Orgrimmar. As a level 12 he was of little concern, but he did use a unique ability, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D58561\"&gt;Pride Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, which did no damage but dismounted players and punted them about 5 yards.\nPriests using &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; on Gamon could use Pride Breaker, which was effective on friendly players and NPCs. Common targets included key NPCs such as bankers and auctioneers who could be moved by the punt effect, as well as players using large mounts such as mammoths in front of mailboxes and other key locations. The ability was made unavailable via mind control in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20War\"&gt;quest chain&lt;/a&gt; in which a faction of Forsaken betrayed the Horde, players were sent back to a &lt;a href=\"phase\"&gt;phase&lt;/a&gt;d version of Orgrimmar under martial law to talk to Thrall. Gamon could be seen among other loyal Horde citizens gathered in front of the &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel up.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;pre-patch&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" gave Gamon a substantial overhaul, going from a simple level 12 mob to a level 85 &lt;a href=\"elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;. He hit extremely hard and was a significant challenge to defeat, especially as players were still level-capped at 80 at that time. Until this point it was customary for some players to routinely kill Gamon simply because they could, with a single click of the mouse; many of those were caught off-guard by the change, idly attacking Gamon only to find themselves &lt;a href=\"one-shot\"&gt;one-shot&lt;/a&gt; by the mighty 85 elite he had become overnight. Death knights completing the introductory quest chain that led them into Orgrimmar also faced the wrath of Gamon, who was able to charge and one-shot the far lower-level death knight. Gamon's appearance largely remained the same, but where he was previously empty-handed, he now sported an impressive and unique two-handed axe.\nFollowing the changes, players formed raid groups to kill Gamon, commonly kiting him out of the inn to fight him in full view of dozens of players. Players also resumed the joking claims that epic and legendary items were &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s from Gamon. In reality, he continued to drop typical level 12 loot.\nThe change prompted the creation of a number of forum threads, with many players thrilled and amused to see Gamon apparently wreaking revenge on those who had killed him so repeatedly for so long. The many forum posts included a comment from Blizzard moderators:\nAfter the announcement of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s ascendance to the throne of the Warchief earlier that year, the phrase \"Gamon for Warchief!\" had begun to appear on various fan sites, including as a poll on MMO Champion. With the changes in patch 4.0.3a, the slogan gained even more popularity, with many humorously predicting an assault by Gamon upon Garrosh.\nAs the expansion progressed, players reached level 85 and acquired ever more powerful gear, making Gamon a far less challenging opponent, able to be defeated by a small group or even single players. Without the immediate ease of killing him in one hit, and with the novelty of his level boost gone, his fame waned as he was engaged far less frequently compared to his early days.\nArrest and rescue.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3.0\"&gt;Patch 5.3.0&lt;/a&gt; brought changes to Orgrimmar. The status of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; increased, life in the city became more martial as &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; tightened his grip on the city, and an attitude of orc superiority was prevalent. Gamon, as a recognizable non-orc Orgrimmar NPC, was an ideal representative of those changes. He could be witnessed surrounded between the auction house and &lt;a href=\"the%20Broken%20Tusk\"&gt;the Broken Tusk&lt;/a&gt; inn in the Valley of Strength by several &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Overseer%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Kor'kron Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s, who demanded that he put his axe down and go with them quietly.\nGamon was taken to &lt;a href=\"the%20Drag\"&gt;the Drag&lt;/a&gt; and forced to kneel beside a tree, under the watchful eye of a Kor'kron Overseer and the rifle sights of three Kor'kron Grunts.\nIt is there that players find him tied up during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; raid in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.0\"&gt;patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;. He feels hatred for falling to orcs in battle and, after being freed, participates in the fight against &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. He is also the subject of &lt;a href=\"Gamon%20Will%20Save%20Us%21\"&gt;Gamon Will Save Us!&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond Orgrimmar.\nAfter Hellscream's downfall, Gamon moved to the second floor of the Broken Tusk inn with his \"lady friend\" &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20Meena\"&gt;Grunt Meena&lt;/a&gt; and received the title \"Hero of Orgrimmar\". It seems that he was not content to stay there long, because he is one of many NPCs to visit the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; if players choose to build them in their &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s. There he states that he came through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in order to \"cleave orc skulls\", but needs a new weapon for that purpose, sending players on the quests &lt;a href=\"Cleaving%20Time\"&gt;Cleaving Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"An%20Axe%20to%20Grind\"&gt;An Axe to Grind&lt;/a&gt; to get him one.\nCleaving Time rewards &lt;a href=\"Gamon%27s%20Braid\"&gt;Gamon's Braid&lt;/a&gt; to remember him by, allowing players to temporarily assume his form and use some of his voice quotes.\nLegion.\nGamon was present at &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral ceremony outside the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a new set of armor.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGamon is one of two NPCs that appear randomly in the Tainted Area within the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Vision of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; scenario of the &lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Visions\"&gt;Horrific Visions&lt;/a&gt;. He is located on the second floor of the Broken Tusk Inn. Defeating him will provide a 10% health buff - &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D313749/heroes-bulwark\"&gt;Heroes' Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nHe appears at the &lt;a href=\"Zen%27shiri%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Zen'shiri Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; from time to time, where he requests a new axe.\nQuotes.\nOrgrimmar and Garrison.\nI, Gamon, will save us!"}

Should the demon not satisfy Blarus's test of loyalty, he and his acolytes would banish the creature back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;."}

Gifted with dark talents and surrounded by a loyal cadre of Zandalar mystics, he has broken through the outer walls and will not rest until the vaults belong to him.\"\nSpells and Abilities.\nPlayers crossing over to the Spirit World must return to the real world within 30 sec or die.\nHealing a player in the Spirit World energizes their soul with Spiritual Innervation. The effect of Spiritual Innervation varies depending on the class and specialization of the healed player, and the effect grows as the player continues to receive heals.\nGara'jal will periodically use the following attacks instead of his normal melee attacks:- Sweeping Kick- Hammer Fist- Right Cross- Left HookThese attacks inflict Shadow damage to the target and bypass any absorption effects.\nStrategy.\nGara'jal has a rather tight 6 minute hard enrage timer. Once the timer has run out, Gara'jal casts Final Destination, instantly wiping your raid.\n10-man.\nOn 10-man mode, this is a two healer fight.\nAssign two DPS and one healer who will get into the spirit realm each turn. Players get in the spirit realm by being nearby a totem and killing it. If any of those get the Voodoo Dolls debuff, other players should be assigned to replace them. It's recommended that a player who has been in the spirit realm stays one turn outside to DPS the boss as their DPS increases dramatically with the Spiritual Innervation buff. Players who get in the spirit realm needs to be healed to full health at least once or they can't get out. When the debuff from the spirit realm nears expiration, all players in the spirit realm should hit their extra action button to leave the realm. Failing to do so instantly kills the player. Getting out of the spirit realm can take 1-2 seconds, so don't wait too long. 3-5 seconds before the debuff expires is ideal.\nHealers should focus on healing the 3 people in the spirit realm (themselves included) as much as possible during the 30 seconds in there, even if they are at full HP. All healing that healers receive grants them a substantial mana regen buff for a moderate duration once they leave, and all healing that DPS receive grants them a substantial DPS increasing buff. The potency of these buffs scales with how much healing that person received in the spirit realm.\nIt's important that players in the spirit realm kill as many spirits as possible while there - if too many are alive they will cause too much damage to the raid, usually resulting in a wipe.\nHealers outside of the spirit realm should focus on intense raid healing to counter the damage from the spirits, and should focus specifically on the tank and the 2 other targets of Voodoo Doll, as they will be taking substantial damage. Absorption effects (ex. Power Word: Shield) cast on the tank will prevent damage to both the tank and the Voodoo Doll targets, and thus are effectively triple effective when used on the tank.\nOnce Gara'jal casts Voodoo Doll, he fixates on the tank he cast it on, so the offtank can taunt the boss at will to maintain a threat lead over the other DPS, as well as to generate moderate amounts of Vengeance for increased DPS. When a tank is banished to the spirit realm, the other tank will immediately gain aggro and within a second or two the Voodoo Doll debuff. The tank that was banished needs to kill the large add that spawns in the spirit realm to escape (failure to kill it in time results in instant death). DPS that are in the spirit realm can help kill this. Upon exiting the spirit realm, the tank should immediately taunt the boss to regain a threat lead over the DPS (the boss will remain on the other tank until the next banish, however, due to the fixate effect).\nSuccess on this fight revolves around quickly and correctly assigning players to spirit totems, while avoiding the random Voodoo Doll debuff and Frail Soul debuff (heroic) and maximizing use of the Spiritual Innervation buff. The easiest way to accomplish this is for the raid leader to run the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com/addons/wow/garajalannounce\"&gt;Gara'jalAnnounce addon&lt;/a&gt;, which computes and announces the optimal assignment as each totem spawns.\nOnce Gara'Jal reachs 20% remaining hp, he will enrage, increasing his damage by 20%. More important, he stops summoning spirit totems (note, any totems already summoned but not yet killed will remain usable), which means players will not be able to go to the spirit world for the remainder of the encounter and your raid will have to kill Gara'jal before the damage from Voodoo Dolls and the increasing numbers of Shadowy minions overwhelms your raid. This phase is ideal for &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The Frostwolf chieftain pressed his ideals of family and tradition on his three sons - &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. Fenris, however, defied his father's wishes and hunted with the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;. Fenris was victorious and continued to hunt with the Thunderlords as well as with the Frostwolves. During a Kosh'harg festival, Garad declared in front of everyone that his son's pursuit of fame was hollow and without honor. Fenris then challenged Garad to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; and was defeated but not killed. Humiliated, Fenris left his native Frostwolf clan and joined the Thunderlords, eventually becoming the clan's new cheiftain. When Fenris vanished, Garad chose Durotan as the heir of the Frostwolf clan instead of the hot-headed Ga'nar.\n11 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s rampaged across Frostfire alongside their half-breed slaves, the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20clan\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, seizing large tracts of resoure-rich land from the orcs. Garad called upon the neighboring Thunderlord and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; clans to unite aganist the ogres, but the Thunderlords - led by Garad's estranged son Fenris - rejected the offer. Thunderlord orcs raided Bladespire settlements alone in the dead of night, slaughtering young and old alike. The Whiteclaw clan, however, did unite with the Frostwolves. Garad was declared leader of the Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army, and he named Ga'nar and Durotan as his lieutenants. With a formidable force under his command, Garad struck at the Bladespire and managed to capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarad was surprised to learn that Leoroxx and the other mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves. Garad and Leoroxx came to an agreement to help each other destroy the Bladespire clan forever. Leoroxx returned to &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; and incited open rebellion among the mok'nathal. They rose up against their oppressors and set fire to the stronghold as the Frostwolves and Whiteclaws crashed into Bladespire's outer defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for a full bloody day before the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out. In the heart of the fortress, Leoroxx strangled &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt; with the chains he had worn for so much of his life. The orcs had won, but at the cost of hundreds of Frostwolves and Whiteclaws, including Ga'nar, who had sacrificed himself to let many young mok'nathal escape the besieged fortress. His death broke Garad's heart, and though Durotan remained to carry on the family line, the Frostwolf chieftain would never recover from losing his second son. After the battle, Garad offered the mok'nathal land in Frostfire to make a new home, but Leoroxx declined and instead chose to settle his people in a remote corner of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that the orcs would never truly accept half-breeds.\nThe red pox.\nAround a year later, Garad and many other orcs contracted the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; at a Kosh'harg festival in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; feared that the disease would spread to new victims and urged Garad and the other plague bearers to remain in Nagrand and construct a new village to quarantine the afflicted. Though the thought of not returning home filled Garad with great sorrow, the last thing he wished was to spread the pox to his family and clan members. He agreed to do as Ner'zhul bid and took charge over his fellow plague victims. Durotan volunteered to stay behind with his father, but as he was the sole remaining heir to the clan he was convinced by Garad to return home and look after the Frostwolves for the time being. In a matter of weeks, the red pox consumed Garad. Though he had led his fellow victims for only a short time, he had earned their eternal respect, and the village was named &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.\nAlternate timelines.\nAn alternate is featured on the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;movie continuity&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its role is to be dispersed across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to police the territories of the Horde and maintain order in the chaos created by the Cataclysm. Its &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captains&lt;/a&gt; compared the Garad'kra to a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; and its web: if enemies approach or any damage is done to the web, the spider is able to respond with swift, precise force.\nNew members are initiated into the Garad'kra through a ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, in which they swear the &lt;a href=\"%3ABlood%20Oath%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;:Blood Oath of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; under a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s supervision. The order is divided into small militia units which are also individually called \"Garad'kra\", commanded by leaders who in turn answer to &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20Br%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt;, the apparent overall leader of the organization. A team leader can give one of their subordinates the rank of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20guard%20%28rank%29\"&gt;stone guard&lt;/a&gt;, making their commands carry the same weight as the team leader's own.\nHistory.\nThe Garad'kra was founded following a decree by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. With the lands of the Horde troubled by starvation and chaos, Garrosh believed that the Garad'kra was needed to sustain control. He demanded every Horde leader to send their best to serve in the militia. Members of the different Horde races traveled from far and wide to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to join the organization. Some, like &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt;, demanded to be conscripted, seeing it as a great honor.\nShortly after the Garad'kra was founded, &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20Br%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt; assembled its members in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to give them their first orders: ending the threat posed by &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; army. One of the Garad'kra teams, led by &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt;, left Orgrimmar to do so. They traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and found and confronted Aratas and his &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt;, but the team proved to be disorganized and only won the battle thanks to the help of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; drifter &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt;. Malgar's unlikely friend &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;, a centaur outcast, revealed that Aratas had created an army of centaur in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and planned to invade &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar two days later. Shagara and Ironhoof decided that returning to Orgrimmar wouldn't give Garrosh enough time to prepare, and that their only option was to buy the Horde time by striking at Desolace on their own.\nShagara sent word back to Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng, after which the team\u2014accompanied by Malgar and Dorthar\u2014set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to Desolace. During the voyage, the Garad'kra helped Dorthar learn how to fight, knitting the team closer together and training them to work as a unit. On arrival in Desolace, Shagara and Ironhoof formed a plan to kill Aratas, even if it meant their own deaths\u2014the only possible way their small group could slow the centaur invasion. While Malgar and Dorthar freed the centaur's orc slaves, the Garad'kra confronted Aratas at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;. They started to lose against the perfect ones until Malgar joined them and turned the tide. Aratas realized that Malgar was the group's \"heart\"\u2014the one that allowed them to fight effectively\u2014and tried to kill him, but one of the Garad'kra, &lt;a href=\"Rada%27jin\"&gt;Rada'jin&lt;/a&gt;, caught the spear meant for the orc. The unfazed Aratas brought the captive Shagara into Maraudon to sacrifice her to his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt;. Rada'jin's death caused the Garad'kra to immediately fall back into disagreements until Malgar declared that he was going after Shagara, which convinced the others to follow him. Inside Maraudon, Aratas summoned his father and the Garad'kra stayed to fight it, while Malgar caught up with Shagara and helped her kill Aratas. The two rejoined the others and used Aratas' spear\u2014the elemental's only weakness\u2014to destroy the creature.\nThe centaur took days to recover from Aratas' death, giving the Horde time to move their armies into position and break up the centaur forces. The team returned to Orgrimmar with Malgar and Dorthar, both of whom subsequently joined the Garad'kra themselves.\nSpeculation.\nThe Garad'kra may be named after the former &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;."}

Don't make fun of this hulking behemoth's tiny wings; that'll just make him angry.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nGaralon's Legs.\nPlayers attack Garalon's legs separately from his body.\nStrategy.\nHave a tank or range or healer pull Garalon, and slowly kite him around the room by moving out of pheromone trail pools. The tanks should stay within \"Furious Swipe\" range, but not directly on top of the Pheromone-debuffed tank, and soak the swipes to prevent Garalon from gaining \"Fury\".\nThe raid should run into position AFTER the pheromones are out on your first kiter. Otherwise, you run the risk of someone else grabbing the debuff and confusing the entire process, most likely wiping that pull. As soon as the dps and heals are stacked on Garalon's leg, hero/lust and blow up as many legs as you can in order to slow the boss' movement and get a head start on the hard enrage timer. The dps requirement for this boss can be quite demanding, given the amount of movement and switching that takes place. \nHave your dps focus fire on the legs through lust, and don't stack your raid group on the front leg that leads the boss' turn (if you're kiting the boss clockwise, you don't want to stack on the boss' front-right leg, as the boss will be continually turn into that point, and you run the risk of having your raid group soak the frontal cone aoe damage that is meant for the tanks, and you also run the risk of accidentally giving the pheromones to someone in the stack, which will mean a wipe).\nThe pheromone pungency debuff has a 2 minute duration, so you'll need at least 4 kiters in normal mode. If you switch at 20 stacks of the pheromone debuff, the timing should be just about right for the 4 kiters to drop their stacks. \nKeep in mind that Garalon will crush the entire raid with AOE on every pheromone swap, so you'll need to have the raid topped off at every pheromone exchange. It's important that the pheromone kiter does not take the boss' frontal cleave, meant for the tanks, as it will most likely lead to certain death. Also note that you will be briefly knocked down/stunned on each crush, so the phoramone kiter will try to avoid being stunned while standing in a pheromone puddle, as they deal quite a bit of damage.\nDPS should attack Garalon's legs. Standing within the light-blue circles around the legs confers a damage buff.\nAll players should avoid standing on top of the tanks and in the purple circle beneath Garalon.

They each share a common theme as minions with poor attack during your turn but increased attack during your opponent's. Notably, they're depicted as &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s constructed from tar rather than &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;-like creatures.\nIn the RPG.\nA tar beast is a &lt;a href=\"mud%20elemental\"&gt;mud elemental&lt;/a&gt;, made of water and earth. It is a creature draped with green moss and oozes in order to move across the ground. Its hide appears slick, taut, and rubbery, and the creature forms and retracts small pseudopods as it moves. Any face it might possess is hidden under the moss.\nIn the steamy bowl of the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, the enigmatic tar beasts rise from bubbling black pits to destroy those who cross them. Also found in warm swamps, tar beasts are primal elementals born of the land. Few travelers ever see a tar beast unless they somehow anger the monster \u2014 in which case they feel the unbridled wrath of the elemental. As tar beasts are quiet, reclusive, and unspeaking, no one quite knows what will anger one.\nSome scholars theorize that primal forces of nature inhabit and animate tar beasts. The fact that such creatures almost always form in extremely ancient, primitive locations bears this theory out, though it certainly proves little. Others claim that the spirits of deceased &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s, trapped and drowned in the tar pits, animate these elementals. The tar creatures seem to understand &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimag\"&gt;Kalimag&lt;/a&gt; (which seems to indicate that they may not be dinosaur spirits), but they don't speak.\nTar beasts begin combat by hurling blobs at their nearest foes. When an enemy closes in, the tar beast engages that enemy only until it becomes stuck in the tar creature's adhesive skin. The tar beast then shifts its focus to the next-closest enemy."}

His Uppercut also deals over 100 damage. If you are unlucky and your tank doesn't have much life (a druid tank can have as little as 350 HP at level 15 when he can enter the dungeon via the dungeon finder), Taragaman can crit the tank and then use Uppercut, literally two-shotting him. \nThe tank should tank Taragaman in the middle of the platform, so that he won't be knocked into the lava with Uppercut. Make sure that all patrolling Searing Blade Cultists are dead before engaging the boss. Besides his high melee damage output he also casts Fire Nova from time to time, but it doesn't deal that much damage. However, if your healer has problems with the healing, you should try to avoid his Fire Nova by running away from the boss."}

When the commander of the squadron &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, known as Stormsong, told him to wait while he investigated to make sure that Baine was unaware of his &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;father's&lt;/a&gt; death Tarakor did so. However when the wait proved to last too long he ordered his warriors to start attacking Bloodhoof Village. He was not surprised to discover that the citizens of the village were prepared, having assumed that Stormsong had been captured.\nAfter killing many of the village defenders and noticing that Baine was nowhere to be seen, he realized that Stormsong had betrayed the Grimtotem Clan.

His hatred would ironically draw the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; to him, eventually &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;being freed&lt;/a&gt; by the very &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s he believed were the corrupt ones.

His wary nature serves as foil to the ever-trusting &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nYears earlier, Taran Zhu succeeded his father as Lord of the Shado-Pan.\nOnce, young &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia&lt;/a&gt; left her home and family in &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt; as a Guided Cub and joined the Shado-Pan. Taran changed her name from Sageflower to Sagewhisper.\nAround the first couple of months within the Horde and Alliance's arrival to Pandaria, the young pandaren &lt;a href=\"Ten\"&gt;Ten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Chan\"&gt;Heavy Chan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pei-Ling\"&gt;Pei-Ling&lt;/a&gt; completed the Trial of the Red Blossoms and Taran was said to accept them into the Shado-Pan.\nMists of Pandaria.\nTaran Zhu is first seen at the beginning of the Jade Forest questline, where he warns both the Alliance and the Horde against the dangers of the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s killed &lt;a href=\"Ga%27trul\"&gt;Ga'trul&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Doren\"&gt;Doren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rell%20Nightwind\"&gt;Rell Nightwind&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; were surprised by the sha and Taran explained more of it as a negative emotion to all, such as doubt and hatred. He reminded them not to bring the war to the shores of Pandaria and left.\nWhen adventurers arrived at &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Honeydew%20Village\"&gt;Honeydew Village&lt;/a&gt;, Taran had no choice but to watch the Alliance and Horde welcomed with open arms by &lt;a href=\"Sunke%20Khang\"&gt;Sunke Khang&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Honeydew\"&gt;Mayor Honeydew&lt;/a&gt;, and leaves it to them to decide what to do.\nDuring the Kun-Lai Summit storyline, Taran is seen at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, warning &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; not to allow the \"wanderers from beyond the mists\" to enter the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale&lt;/a&gt;. After Xuen finally decided to allow them to enter, Taran warned him that he was making a terrible mistake and left. \nThe Shado-Pan became concerned with the lack of reinforcements to the battlezones they were involved in and eventually uncovered the fact that Taran had become possessed by the . He was eventually cleansed of the sha influence and led the search for the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Zhu eventually succeeded in vanquishing the Sha of Hatred with the help of other Shado-Pan warriors and adventurers but still felt ashamed that he let his emotions get the best of him back in Kun Lai, allowing the Sha to escape.\nShadows of the Horde.\nWhile wary of the Horde-Alliance conflict, Taran did permit &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; to bring both &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; so they could heal. However, Taran told Chen that he would allow him to bring no more soldiers of the Horde or Alliance to the temple and unbalance things. At the same time in order to achieve he placed Vol'jin in Khort's care, which Vol'jin and Khort expect was done so that Lord Zhu could see their interactions and judge for himself the relationship between the Horde and Alliance, without the bias of the other side. Meanwhile, Taran allowed Vol'jin to undergo monk training and offered advice while Vol'jin and Khort struggled with their identities.\nAfter Vol'jin received a vision of the Zandalari attacking &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;, Taran ordered a small force of his Shado-Pan monks to aid them in protecting the village. He later would instruct a small force of Shado-Pan along with Vol'jin, Khort, and Chen to enter the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the Zandalari from resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;, a general of the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. However, Vol'jin and the others would fail and Warlord Kao would be resurrected and the survivors taken prisoner on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. However, Vol'jin and his allies would later escape their prison and make their way towards the Shado-Pan Monastery.\nAnticipating an assault by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, Zhu gathered all the forces he could spare to defend the Shado-Pan Monastery: a mere twenty-nine monks, with the addition of Lord Zhu himself and his three non-Shado-Pan guests, Vol'jin, Chen, and Tyrathan. With numerous traps and skilled fighting, &lt;a href=\"the%20Thirty-three\"&gt;the Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt; held off the attackers in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, but not without suffering heavy casualties. After Vol'jin had deeply unnerved the surviving Zandalari forces, Zhu bid them to leave and allowed them to take their wounded.\nThe Thunder King.\nTaran Zhu is seen in the cave just outside of &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lao-Chin%20the%20Iron%20Belly\"&gt;Lao-Chin the Iron Belly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Hawkmaster Nurong&lt;/a&gt;. He gives adventurers a group quest of dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;s champions. He also keeps a close watch on &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming time when they assault the gates of Throne of Thunder.\nTo stop one of Lei Shen's most powerful mogu minions, &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;, from bringing the gatekeeper &lt;a href=\"Nalak%2C%20the%20Storm%20Lord\"&gt;Nalak, the Storm Lord&lt;/a&gt; back into the world, Lord Zhu and the Shado-Pan have launched a raid on the outer courtyard to stop Shan Bu. After fighting through Shan Bu's mogu and Zandalari army, Zhu taunted Shan Bu into dueling him. Growing weary, Shan Bu grabbed Zhu by the throat and attempted to kill him by strangling him. However, before he could do so, Bu was struck down by an adventurer. After Bu's death, despite being gravely wounded, Zhu intervened to stop Lor'themar and Jaina from attacking each other, demanding that they act now to end the cycle of violence between their factions. The two leaders were eventually convinced by Zhu to lower their weapons and walk away, leaving without bloodshed and returning to their bases. Yalia then took Zhu to safety.\nEscalation.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Warchief Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; orders, a Horde excavation force laid waste to sacred ground in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, in an attempt to unearth yet more dangerous artifacts of use to Garrosh's cause. In retaliation, Zhu confronted &lt;a href=\"Dezco\"&gt;Dezco&lt;/a&gt; at the Shrine of Two Moons, and ordered him to leave the vale, threatening to use lethal force should the Horde not comply. Dezco was able to stall Zhu's wrath, informing him that the man responsible for this travesty no longer spoke for the rest of the Horde and that indeed, many are now rising up against him. Dezco promised to bring Hellscream to justice, asking only time to make it happen.\nNo stranger to dealing with tyrants, Zhu warily allowed Dezco the chance to make things right, giving the Dawnchaser chieftain until the end of the season to make good on his promise.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAfter Garrosh Hellscream discovers and brings the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; to the surface of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, Zhu confronts him in an attempt to stop him from using the Heart to corrupt the Vale. However, not even Taran Zhu could defeat Garrosh and was wounded on Garrosh's axe, &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh let him see the Vale become a Sha-infested wasteland.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; and a group of adventurers come across Zhu, seriously injured, in the chamber of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; beneath the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. He blames the Horde and Alliance alike for the destruction of Pandaria and leaves the chamber along with Cho while the adventurers fight the Sha of Pride.\nAfter Hellscream is defeated, Zhu heads off a building argument between &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; about summarily executing him. He points out that Garrosh's crimes have affected many people, \"most of all\" the Pandaren, and therefore arrests him for trial in Pandaria.\nTaran also participates in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt; with his companions - &lt;a href=\"Bolo%20%28pet%29\"&gt;Bolo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li\"&gt;Li&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yen\"&gt;Yen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; Zhu was the judge, fa'shua, of Garrosh Hellscream's trial by the tradition of ancient Pandaren law.

Afterward, the Legion invaded the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;, and Taran led a patrol to defend it, but was injured. Soon after, a Mistweaver monk seeking &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun, Staff of the Mists&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the Terrace and healed Taran.

She instructed him to put the necklace in the trunk of a nearby old tree struck by lightning should he need her aid again. He held onto it and even managed to hide it when he was captured by Alliance soldiers. Later, as Thrall found the free orcs and set out to &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberate&lt;/a&gt; rest of the orcs from &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s, he placed the necklace in the tree as instructed. Taretha had been checking the trunk until she suddenly found her missing necklace. When they reunited the day before the attack on Durnholde, she left the necklace with Thrall again, with words to give it to his child. Ultimately, with Taretha's death and the fall of Durnholde, Thrall ordered &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Foxton\"&gt;Foxton&lt;/a&gt;s and deliver them the necklace.\nYears later, Thrall sent a group of orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Gol%27dir\"&gt;Gol'dir&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the necklace from Durnholde. Gol'dir was captured in &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he saw &lt;a href=\"Elysa\"&gt;Elysa&lt;/a&gt; wearing the necklace. Elysa was tracked down, and she gave it to a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who delivered it to &lt;a href=\"Krusk\"&gt;Krusk&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is currently one of Thrall's few treasured possessions and keepsake, carried with him wherever he goes.

When Thrall embarked on a journey to find &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; across alternate timeways, he emerged in an Azeroth where was alive. Trying to convince her of his good intentions, he allowed her to search his backpack that contained the necklace. Although surprised to see an identical necklace to the one she was wearing, she believed Thrall's story and briefly aided him.\nSource.\nThis item was provided by &lt;a href=\"Elysa\"&gt;Elysa&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"Taretha%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Taretha's Gift&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was instrumental in aiding Thrall break free from his captivity to find his destiny beyond the walls of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;. She was one of the few humans who taught Thrall the meaning of honor and decency.\nHad Taretha been born in a major city, her life would have been different. As it was, Tari was the daughter of Blackmoore's personal secretary, &lt;a href=\"Tammis%20Foxton\"&gt;Tammis Foxton&lt;/a&gt;, and despite her intelligence was not allowed to become the woman she might have been.\nDespite her minor role, a mere footnote in the annals of history, Taretha Foxton's actions forever changed the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nLife in Durnholde Keep.\nTaretha, a child of five years, ensured Thrall's survival as an infant by being the only person in Durnholde to realize he was a baby \u2014 he simply couldn't eat the meat the guards gave him because he didn't have teeth. When she innocently posed this information, Thrall's diet was hastily changed to milk and he thrived in the Foxton household, nursed by Taretha's own mother. When Thrall was eventually weaned, he was taken away and Tari wept bitter tears for the green-skinned child she regarded as her little brother.\nYears later, Tari, still in her preteens, was given the task to bring books on military strategy to Thrall, at the suggestion of Blackmoore's military advisor, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sergeant&lt;/a&gt;, to train the young orc in tactics and war. Tari used the books, by slipping notes inside the pages, to keep up a correspondence with Thrall, still managing to hide her unusually sharp intelligence. \nAt some point, about ten years ago, Blackmoore made Taretha his mistress, a position she secretly despised (there are references to strange bruises on her wrists). At some point, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; visited Durhholde Keep in order to watch Thrall in a fight. Arthas remained in the keep during the next night. Aedelas sent Taretha to Arthas to please him however, Arthas and Taretha were just chatting. Arthas compared Taretha to Jaina by appearance.\nAfter Thrall was savagely beaten for losing in the arena, Tari helped him in his desire to escape Durnholde. Tari set fire to the encampment after setting all the animals free as a distraction, then helped her friend escape by leaving him a large cloak with which to sneak out the front gate while the guards were busy. When Thrall spotted her injuries due to her unwilling relationship with Blackmoore, he begged her to go with him, but Tari refused for the sake of her family. Tari gave Thrall a necklace with the emblem of a crescent moon as a means of contacting her should he ever need help.\nEventually, Thrall did need help. Tari was asked by her friend, now the Warchief of a new &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, to help them negotiate with Blackmoore. Tari insisted that it was pointless and when the Orc asked her to come with them, to protect her from his army attacking, she again declined to leave. Unfortunately, Blackmoore had her followed, and when she returned, he questioned and imprisoned her, her tragic fate coming to fruition with the Lieutenant General becoming drunk enough to order her execution.\nThe following day, Thrall arrived with his army and demanded Blackmoore to stand down, and free his people. After a slurred conversation, a very drunk Blackmoore hurled Taretha's head at Thrall from the battlements. The sight of the dead woman was so shocking that Thrall cried emotional tears for the first time in his life. The loss of the woman who for years had been his only friend and family enraged the shaman Warchief, and he ordered his army to attack Durnholde, eventually killing Blackmoore in a duel. After evacuating the keep of humans and sending Blackmoore's second in command Langston to the Alliance with a warning, he asked the Spirit of the Earth to destroy &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it in ruins.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears later, after Thrall became the new Warchief, he sent a number of orc volunteers to Durnholde Keep on a mission to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; activity in the area. He also sent them to recover &lt;a href=\"Taretha%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Taretha's Necklace&lt;/a&gt;, now worn by &lt;a href=\"Elysa\"&gt;Elysa&lt;/a&gt;, a mistress of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Syndicate. The mission was initially a failure with the leader &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Dir\"&gt;Gol'Dir&lt;/a&gt; and his companions &lt;a href=\"Drull\"&gt;Drull&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tog%27Thar\"&gt;Tog'Thar&lt;/a&gt; were captured by the Syndicate. &lt;a href=\"Krusk\"&gt;Krusk&lt;/a&gt; escaped, however, and enlists the aid of Horde adventurers to rescue his comrades and recover the necklace, slaying Lord Aliden in the process.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nTaretha was instrumental in allowing Thrall to escape from Durnholde. However, when adventurers entered &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, they found out that the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has captured Taretha and was holding her prisoner in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, west of Durnholde. Without Taretha's intervention, Thrall would not be able to escape Durnholde. Adventurers traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, helped Thrall in his escape from Durnholde, and then saved Taretha from the massive infinite dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Hunter\"&gt;Epoch Hunter&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nWhen Thrall visited the Caverns of Time, &lt;a href=\"Chronalis\"&gt;Chronalis&lt;/a&gt; informed him that adventurers had helped to preserve his own history through the &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; event, as his own memories had been erased of the interference. Thrall felt humbled and grateful to know that he had been helped in such a way, and requested that the mortal agents of the Bronze flight be asked to be gentle with Taretha if they met her. She was later mentioned by Thrall during the fight with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nBy helping Thrall escape, Taretha ensured the future of the Horde by giving them a new Warchief. Taretha was willing to trust other orcs she met in Thrall's company, showing &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; orcs that peace (or at least cooperation) between the two races was possible.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; somehow reminded Thrall of Taretha, and this may have helped Thrall overcome his distaste for humans and trust the Alliance. In any case, it was Tari who first showed Thrall that friendship between humans and orcs was possible, and this lesson enabled the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to ally with each other, defeating &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and later joining the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to vanquish &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaretha Foxton was indirectly responsible for freeing the orcs from their curse and saving &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the Defiler. To date, Taretha Foxton is the only human who has had a \"&lt;a href=\"lok%27vadnod\"&gt;lok'vadnod&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Song of a Hero\") composed in her honor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Taretha acted in Thrall's nightmare where he again wasn't able to save her.\nWhen Thrall underwent the vision-quest in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the Shattering, one of his visions was about Taretha.\nAlternate timeline.\nA version of &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; existed in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and which was entered by Thrall during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\nSpeculation.\nAccording to Thrall, Taretha never lived beyond her midtwenties. Her alternate universe &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; said that her &lt;a href=\"Clannia%20Foxton%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; died when she was eight. If Thrall's statement is taken to be true, alternate universe Clannia would have to die in Year 1, and Taretha would have been born in Year -7, and she would die at the age of 25 in Year 18. Or Year 2, Year -6 and at the age of 24 in Year 18.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Taretha grew up wildly different, never learning how to read or write, and being physically abused by until he tired of her. Because of Thrall's death, Blackmoore sobered up and conquered Lordaeron with an army of his own. Orcs became slaves to the people of Lordaeron, and all of these changes hardened Taretha's personality considerably.\nSeveral years after the Battle of Blackrock Spire, Taretha found the &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from the main timeline, who had arrived after chasing &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. She planned to sell him into slave labor and live off the reward money, but Thrall convinced Taretha of his identity with the locket that she gave him when he left &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, as she was wearing the same one from her timeline, and the fact that she remembered the infant having blue eyes. She asked him about life in Thrall's timeline, and Thrall told her everything, only including her death at &lt;a href=\"Blackmoore\"&gt;Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s hands when she specifically asked. Taretha was surprised by this, but ultimately told Thrall that it didn't matter; even if she had died the fact that she had made a difference was enough. This made Thrall realize that his Taretha had also known this before she died. \nThe two visited Dalaran, with Taretha pretending to be Thrall's master, asking for an audience with . They gave his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Devi\"&gt;Devi&lt;/a&gt;, an acorn for the entry. Thrall realized that he had to live in the moment, and was able to find the lost Aspect of Time.\nSpeculation.\nWhen Taretha found Thrall, she was in her early thirties. Thrall knew that her main universe &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;self&lt;/a&gt; didn't live beyond her 25 years (died in Year 18). This would mean that Thrall entered the alternate Azeroth after the events of the Third War and its aftermath (which apparently didn't happen here)."}

{"id": "20816", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20816", "title": "Target", "text": "In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", a target can mean a few things, primarily the &lt;a href=\"unit\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt; that is the current focus of a player's attacks and abilities (or buffs and healing). Other meanings include any unit(s) affected by an ability (even indirectly), a location hit by an &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; ability, or a strategic objective.\nTargeting is the act of choosing a target in any of these contexts. &lt;a href=\"Select\"&gt;Select&lt;/a&gt;ing is one form of targeting: choosing one's current target in the user interface, as opposed to the target of an ability or effect. That article has more information on target selection within the interface. In the context of &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s and , \"target\" is almost always used. \"Targeting\" may also be used to describe actually CASTING a spell on a given target(s), e.g. \"target those 3 mobs with Flamestrike\".\nCurrent target of a unit.\nThe current target, or just \"target\", of a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, reflects what that unit is focused on at the moment, and actions it takes will affect the target by default.\nPlayers can &lt;a href=\"select\"&gt;select&lt;/a&gt; an NPC or player as their current target in their game interface. Players may target mobs, friendly units, other players, and even themselves. See the &lt;a href=\"select\"&gt;select&lt;/a&gt; page for more details. An ability used by the player will be directed at the player's current target if it's valid for that ability, unless a different target is specified using macros or addons. Auto-attacks are always directed against a player's current target; players should be careful not to accidentally change targets to a &lt;a href=\"yellow\"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt; mob while their auto-attack is turned on.\nAn &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have a user interface so the idea of \"selection\" does not apply, but its AI programming still determines its current target. Usually a mob's target is the unit with the most &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; on it, but not always. If the mob is attacking, its target is said to have &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; on the mob. NPCs may target players, themselves or other NPCs that are friendly to them (usually when casting healing or protective spells), or in certain cases even unfriendly NPCs. If a mob has a target, that almost always indicates it's in combat, although some scripted events may break this rule of thumb.\nPlayers and NPCs may be without a current target at any given time. If a player is attacked and has no target selected, their attacker will be selected automatically. If a player uses certain offensive abilities with no target, one will be selected as if they had pressed \"tab\" (see the &lt;a href=\"select\"&gt;select&lt;/a&gt; page). If the \"auto self-cast\" option is enabled, a healing or buff spell cast with no target or an invalid target will automatically target the caster. In most other cases, an ability used with no target will be \"loaded\" onto the cursor for casting on whatever is clicked on.\nPlayers' targets are reported to the game server even if no spell is being cast. The current target of other players (including enemies) and NPCs is available using the \"show target of target\" interface option, certain raid frame options, and addons. It may also be referenced in &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s. For this reason, players wishing to appear unresponsive to others should not change targets.\nThere is no in-game cost or delay to switching targets. Players may switch targets rapidly until they find the one they intended. NPCs may switch targets suddenly depending on the &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; situation and scripting of their abilities.\nTarget(s) of a spell or effect.\nMost spells require a primary target, or simply \"target\". Depending on the design of the spell, most or all of its effects will apply to the primary target, and the primary target may determine where and how secondary effects occur. There is only one primary target for a given spell cast.\nBy default the primary target of a spell is the caster's current target. However a unit may be the target of a spell without ever having been selected. Players may target an ability without selection by \"loading it onto the cursor\" before clicking the target, or via &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s. Casters may also begin casting a spell on one target, then select another unit before the cast is complete; the first target will remain the spell's target. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s using special abilities will often not report the spell's target as \"their\" target at all, or will do so for only an instant (in effect switching to the spell's target to begin the cast and then immediately switching back).\nMost ongoing effects retain their primary targets from when they were originally cast, regardless of what the caster does after.\nSome abilities only affect the player or are automatically centered on the player - in this case the player could be considered the implied primary target, although it is also accurate to say such a spell has no target.\nA number of spells have secondary targets which are affected despite never being chosen specifically by the caster. The secondary effect may be the same as on the primary target, e.g. &lt;a href=\"group%20buff\"&gt;group buff&lt;/a&gt;s and \"contagious\" boss &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s, but often the effect is reduced or has very different mechanics.\nWith &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells, a point on the ground (or the full area on the ground) is the primary target, and units in the area are secondary targets, although they may simply be called \"the targets\". \"&lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Bomb&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; affect a primary target over time and then hit nearby secondary targets in the \"explosion\". \"&lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain&lt;/a&gt;\" spells start with the primary target and leap to nearby targets one or &lt;a href=\"Cascade\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; at a time - depending on the spell each new target may receive approximately the same, greater, or less of an effect than the last. \"&lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;s\" hit a limited number of targets in melee range at once, and may do the same or reduced damage to the secondary targets.\nOther types of target.\nCertain \"units or objects\" may be called targets if their purpose, theoretically or in-game, is to be hit by attacks. A &lt;a href=\"target%20dummy\"&gt;target dummy&lt;/a&gt; that players can attack is one example. Others are fixed objects that players usually can't interact with, like circular archery targets or punching bags, which are there for flavor rather than gameplay. &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes will use these in minor scripted sequences.\nIn a \"strategic context\", the objective or focus of an operation or campaign might be called a target. Sometimes this is a settlement or region, often held by the opponent, or it might be an enemy individual or group that should be killed, captured, driven away, disbanded, or otherwise interfered with. This meaning is often used in-universe, such as in quest text. Players are less likely to use it when discussing strategies except as one of the above gameplay terms, to avoid confusion.\nValid targets.\nMany neutral or friendly units, and other unattackable units usually identified by their dark gold-colored level label, cannot have offensive abilities used on them. This includes enemy players that are not flagged for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. Attempting to attack produces the error message \"Invalid target\", and &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20effect\"&gt;Area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells generally will not have any effect on them. Summoning a combat pet to fight for a player has sometimes worked around targeting restrictions. If the NPC is part of a certain &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, checking the \"&lt;a href=\"At%20War\"&gt;At War&lt;/a&gt;\" option for that faction in the &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; pane will usually allow players to attack them.\nOn the other hand, players may successfully target most helpful spells such as heals and buffs on certain friendly NPCs, and all friendly players. Some helpful spells are restricted to targets in the player's group."}

Using these symbols is valuable in parties and even more so in raids.\nIt is also possible to use &lt;a href=\"hotkey\"&gt;keybinds&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s to quickly assign raid icons. This can be especially useful for changing targets on the fly, or placing emergency &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; marks while in combat.\nParticular uses include:\nCarrying this further, a Raid Leader could even appoint each of those tanks / Crowd Controllers as Raid Assistant, and let them mark their own targets. Assuming your tanks are on the ball, this can save time where the Raid Leader does not need to be assigning targets, and ensures each person actually has that target targeted. Each tank / crowd controller should always use the same Icon (both within the raid, and even across multiple raids, e.g., \"ElfMan always tanks the blue square\") for this to work. This is for more advanced use, and some Raid Leaders do not like appointing Assistants.\nExample targeting convention.\nAlthough there is nothing like a standard convention for icon meanings, the following table may provide a starting point for groups or guilds wishing to create a convention. Obviously, this would have to be altered on a per-case basis depending on group composition (for instance, parties with multiple mages/druids). Still, it can provide a useful foundation for groups or guilds getting used to the raid icon system. Note that icons carry different meanings when placed friendly versus hostile targets.\n\"The guide below is for most specific cases. In general, all marks besides Skull and X denote CC targets on hostile mobs, or various stack points on friendly players. Skull and X will almost always denote kill targets on hostile mobs, or denote danger when placed on friendly players.\"\nAPI and key bindings.\nThese icons can be set programmatically in a macro with the function.\nExample, codice_1 will mark the target with a Skull, 8 standing for the Icon number.\nAlternatively, they can be bound to keys for quick application. For example, Skull could be bound to Ctrl-K (Kill, sKull) so that the raid leader or assist can apply the icon quickly to a new target during a fight.\nFor even faster marking, combining the macro codice_2 (# of course being replaced with the corresponding icon's number) with key bindings will allow you to apply icons without actually targetting anything.\n returns the icon index of the specified target.\nMacros.\nThis macro will cycle Skull, X, Nil, then Moon on cursored targets.\ncodice_3\nThis macro will cycle through all the raid icons (including no raid icon) in reverse order on cursored targets. Replace \"mouseover\" with \"target\" if you want this to apply to selected targets.\ncodice_4\nThis macro also cycles through all the raid icons in reverse order on cursored targets but it also announces the next icon in the default chat frame. Useful if you need to skip through charms while marking targets. Press your macro button without a target under the mouse to skip through charms.\ncodice_5\n/script if (charm==nil) or (charm &lt;= 0) then charm=9; end; charm=charm-1; SetRaidTarget(\"target\", charm)\nOrigin of \"lucky charms\".\nThe nickname originates from their appearance similar to the marshmallows from the Cereal \"\". The commercials feature kids chasing Lucky the Leprechaun, who would inevitably remind them that his cereal contained \"Hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers and blue moons, pots of gold and rainbows, and the red balloon!\" These shapes were nearly impossible to identify without the jingle, as the tiny little marshmallow bits bear only the vaguest resemblance to the Lucky Charms they represented."}
