Every time the rogue hits with the weapon, there is a chance (modified by the speed of the weapon) of the victim being poisoned for 15 seconds. The poison will &lt;a href=\"Reduced%20healing\"&gt;reduce all healing effects&lt;/a&gt; on the victim by 25%. The effect cannot stack.\nProc Chances Under the PPM Model.\nAs of patch 3.1., the proc chance of Wound Poison (along with &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Poison\"&gt;Instant Poison&lt;/a&gt; was changed to a &lt;a href=\"PPM\"&gt;PPM&lt;/a&gt; model, normalized for 1.4 speed weapons. This results in the following proc chances per weapon speed per attack:\nInstant Poison v. Wound Poison.\nIt is generally accepted\"[says who?]\" that PVE Mutilate specced rogues should use Instant Poison on their MH, since they will have 3/3 &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Poisons\"&gt;Vile Poisons&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor PVE Combat rogues, hoewever, depending on gear and talents, Wound Poison may provide more poison damage than Instant Poison on the MH.\nAt low AP levels, Wound Poison's higher PPM rate will make the first option (WP + 3/3VP) produce more poison damage than the latter (IP etc). However, higher gear levels will provide enough AP for Instant Poison to scale up and overcome its low proc rate.\nThe AP point at which WP + 3/3VP loses out to IP + 4/5IP + 1/3VP can be theorycrafted:\nPoison Damage per minute = Proc Damage * PPM (this is based on white weapon swings, but will scale evenly for yellow swings as well)\nAt level 80, given the two options above:\nThese two options will yield equal DPM at about 8,000 AP. Beyond that, the IP option yields more main-hand poison DPM (other things being equal).\nIt should be noted that this does not take into account the effect of &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Poisons\"&gt;Improved Poisons&lt;/a&gt; on off-hand application of &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Poison\"&gt;Deadly Poison&lt;/a&gt;. Each Deadly Poison hit on a target fully stacked with Deadly Poison refreshes DP and applies the other weapon's poison. For this reason, the harder hitting Instant Poison should almost always be paired with Deadly Poison for long, steady state fights.\nSource.\nWound Poison is purchased from poison vendors. It is also available as a drop from selected mobs. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, it was previously crafted from a variable amount of &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Essence of Agony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathweed\"&gt;Deathweed&lt;/a&gt; depending on rank."}

{"id": "127699", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127699", "title": "WowJutsu", "text": "WowJutsu is a site to track guild progression. It uses the &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt;'s automatically updated profiles to tally how far a guild has progressed for all content post-&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. This is accomplished by tracking the highest-level item worn by members of a particular guild when they log out, which means, for instance, a guild first kill in which the loot is disenchanted requires one member of the guild (probably the disenchanter) to equip an item and log out at least once in order for the progression to be tallied. It is important to note that WowJutsu's tallies for loot acquired before its initial release may be inaccurate, as there is no way to tell which guild a player was in \"when they acquired the item\" if it was acquired prior to the site coming online.\nSince its release, WowJutsu has quickly replaced older, more tedious methods of tracking guild progression such as sticky forum topics, submitting screenshots to Bosskillers, and maintaining progression pages on Wowpedia. It has the added bonus of tracking the kills in real time without requiring verification such as a screenshot or video, and it will update accurately for content (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;) that \"major\" raiding guilds consider not worth their time on forum threads. The site also allows guilds to broadcast their world position on their site via HTML code to retrieve their ranking from the site.\nThe downside is that, in addition to tracking only post-BC content and potential confusion for kills that occurred before the site's launch (e.g. received the loot in Guild A but later joined Guild B), some guilds may not be aware of the site's existence. Therefore if all of the loot from the guild's first kill is disenchanted without being equipped at least once, the guild may not receive proper credit. There is currently no way to remedy such oversights other than obtaining another kill and equipping and logging out with at least one item obtained from the boss. Another potential weakness is that the site currently categorizes servers based only on being hosted in the US vs EU, so one cannot browse/compare Oceania-only or compare PvE vs PvP servers without manually choosing the appropriate realms.\nA wowjutsu powered tool exists to address the above hindsight with categorization, for &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowdev.org/status/%3Fcontinent%3Deu\"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowdev.org/status/%3Fcontinent%3Dus\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; servers.\nThe website redirects to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//raider.io/\"&gt;Raider.IO&lt;/a&gt;."}

At the start we were not really sure what shall we do with the website and we started with some &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowjuju.com\"&gt;WoW News&lt;/a&gt; then began working on several custom made guides (yes, I know we still didn't finish them...). Since we were a young website, it was a hard work because our staff was small (only two people... heh) and we didn't get too much help from \"outside\". Just after a month or two we decided to bring something new to the WoW community and this is how &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowjuju.com/repcalc\"&gt;Reputation Calculator&lt;/a&gt; work started. Even if we are still working on it and constantly updating informations and adding more features ... many people already started using it. In about 10 months over 200k of players use it to boost their reputations.\nIn the meantime more and more people visited us and with their help we managed to change and optimize the website for every visitor to be happy with it. At the moment Wowjuju is accessible from most of the web browsers and mobile devices, but of course we are happy to receive any feedback regarding this matter.\nIn April 2008 Wowjuju was included in &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/links/fansites.html\"&gt;Blizzard's Official Fan Site (EU)&lt;/a&gt; program. This inclusion was one of the several reasons to be against any wow item markets, gold trading and powerleveling services. World of Warcraft's Terms of Use and EULA apply on Wowjuju also. Thanks to WoWHead we are able to use their database to display our item links and they also help us to make our Reputation Calculator more appealing.\nIn time we hope to be able to add more important events to this short history of this website... Remember, everything here is dedicated to our members and you are the one's who decide what shall we do next. All your thoughts are appreciated and we're happy to have you here.\nREPUTATION CALCULATOR UPDATE:\nLooks like we reach another checkpoint. On February 3, 2009 we launched the vesion 2 of our &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowjuju.com/repcalc\"&gt;Reputation Calculator&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy everyone.\nCurrent Wowjuju Features:\nYou can find a lot of interesting stuff in there and users ideas and suggestions are greatly appreciated."}

Wraiths appear to be of either &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; origin most of the time. Some &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; manifest as wraiths before they die. Wraiths appear as translucent shapes with a roughly humanoid shape, although notably missing legs, and chains symbolically binding them to this life. They are typically either bluish or purple, and when they are killed, all that is left is a small orb.\nStrangely, despite being visually distinct in \"WoW\", creatures that use variants of the &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt; model are often called wraiths, like the &lt;a href=\"arcane%20wraith\"&gt;arcane wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"voidwraith\"&gt;voidwraith&lt;/a&gt;s, and the \"&lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane voidwraith&lt;/a&gt;\" model. Also, two of the variants of &lt;a href=\"cold%20wraith\"&gt;cold wraith&lt;/a&gt; have looked like shades, even with some looking like true wraiths.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lost%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lost of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; find their undead neighbors to be poor company, so they typically wander &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; alone.\nWarcraft III.\n&lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s appear as neutral &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; creeps alongside the weaker &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; creeps. The &lt;a href=\"Tome%20Wraith\"&gt;Tome Wraith&lt;/a&gt; was a unique creature fought in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20Demo\"&gt;Warcraft III Demo&lt;/a&gt;\". Wraiths were also mentioned a few times as being a part of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wraiths of a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20tower\"&gt;spirit tower&lt;/a&gt; attack with supernatural efficiency, and quickly add enemy forces to the ranks of the dead.\n&lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;s are called \"vile, wraith-like creatures\", and \"an invisible wraith\". It is unknown if they are a type of wraith or just similar to them.\nIn the RPG.\nWraiths retain their individuality and intelligence. Wraiths are angry and violent spirits, long for a return to mortal life and vent their jealous rage on living creatures. While possessed by a constant, desperate fury, wraiths nonetheless possess the intellect and self-control to deal rationally, if grudgingly, with mortal beings on occasion. These creatures are self-motivated and cunning and have all the memories of their past lives before undeath. Those memories no longer move the wraith nor provide any sense of morality other than a strict adherence to the wraith's own code of honor and law. Wraiths are lawful creatures, willing to make deals and hold to them. They respect the same tendency in both living and unliving creatures and will respond to honorable opponents with honorable actions. It is not unusual for a wraith to accept a creature's surrender; however, those surrenders will always be unconditional. Further, those foolish enough to surrender to a wraith are simply placing themselves into a position where they will almost certainly be turned into wraiths themselves.\nWraiths fight well in units under the command of a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, but if not so commanded, they prefer to fight alone. They are intelligent and cunning and will use the extent of their abilities to capture and destroy their opponents. Wraiths begin a combat by using their spell-like abilities. They attempt to dominate or possess anyone who appears able to turn undead; next they target an enemy force's apparent leaders. Should the domination and possession fail, a wraith instead curses these targets. Only after it has expended all its spell-like abilities does a wraith enter melee combat. In some cases, they will keep extraordinary enemies alive, preferring to turn them into &lt;a href=\"wight\"&gt;wight&lt;/a&gt;s and spread the plague to other \"capable\" individuals. Wraiths speak the languages they did in life. "}

The player will then have to weaken the Aether Ray so it can be wrangled.\nObjectives.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyguard%20Khatie\"&gt;Skyguard Khatie&lt;/a&gt; has asked you to wrangle 5 Aether Rays. After you have done so, return them to her at the &lt;a href=\"Skyguard%20Outpost\"&gt;Skyguard Outpost&lt;/a&gt; atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.\nDescription.\nSo, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays! From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope! And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;, which the ogres appreciate.\nRemember, the aether rays fly around &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Spine\"&gt;Crystal Spine&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast.\nThink you can wrangle me up some more?\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nYou're doing great work for us, &lt;name&gt;. I want you to know that we really appreciate everything that you're doing to keep us stocked up in fresh mounts!\nCompletion.\nYou continue to amaze me! Tell you what... why don't you come back tomorrow and we'll let the rope cool off for now?\n&lt;Khatie laughs.&gt;\nThank you so much, &lt;name&gt;!\nNotes.\nThe quest dialog has progression of flirtatious remarks as your Skyguard rep increases. At Honored she suggests that we meet up after work. At Revered she inquires why the aforementioned rendezvous did not take place.\nAether rays are passive beast-type creatures found atop the western and northern plateaus of Blade's Edge Mountains: &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bash%27ir%20Landing\"&gt;Bash'ir Landing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Spine\"&gt;Crystal Spine&lt;/a&gt;. They can be floating slightly above the ground or flying high in the air (these will need to be brought down with a ranged attack). When their health is lowered to 40% of their maximum, they will emote with a message, \"The Aether Ray appears ready to be wrangled.\" This is the cue for the player to use the provided Wrangling Rope to wrangle the creature. Do this five times to complete the quest. At any point in time while working on this quest, you can return to Skyguard Khatie and speak with her and she will automatically collect any wrangled nether rays you currently have. This is extremely useful to do as wrangled nether ways can easily impede your vision if you're a melee class and need to maneuver in close quarters.\nLike most non-elite mobs of their level, Aether Rays have 5,000-6,000 health; as such, it would be easy for a player above level 80 to accidentally kill them. To reduce this risk, high-level adventurers may wish to remove some of their gear or use low-powered abilities like Auto Attack and Auto Shoot."}

She left it up to the adventurer whether or not to kill the treacherous harpy matron. She later helped in the defeat of the black dragon attempting to corrupt and replace &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sethria\"&gt;Sethria&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Druids of the Talon (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20Invasion\"&gt;Firelands Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, she is found inside the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Flow\"&gt;Molten Flow&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThisalee can be found in the Druid of the Talon camp in &lt;a href=\"Skysea%20Ridge\"&gt;Skysea Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; as part of Garrison-related quests. She instructed the adventurers to retrieve Iron Horde's shipments and kill &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20O%27rok\"&gt;Lieutenant O'rok&lt;/a&gt; from a nearby camp. After recovering Bladefury's orders, she moved to &lt;a href=\"Cragplume%20Cauldron\"&gt;Cragplume Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. She and the hero entered the cave, defeated its guardian and found the artifact the Iron Horde were after - the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Gorgorek\"&gt;Heart of Gorgorek&lt;/a&gt;. Together they escaped the cave and the artifact was placed in the Garrison.\nAfter Azuka stole the heart, she moved to Gorgorek's Fall to face off the Warlord only to witness &lt;a href=\"Gorgorek\"&gt;Gorgorek&lt;/a&gt;'s revival.\nShe can also be seen watching fights between &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;garrison commanders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThisalee was captured by &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; and was forced to battle in their underground fighting ring. She was rescued by the champions from the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;.\nThisalee is one among several other druids who come to &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; of the Dreamgrove's attempt to communicate with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in Mount Hyjal.\nLegionfall.\nAt the Dreamgrove, Thisalee received word that the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Shrine of Aviana&lt;/a&gt; on Hyjal was under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Unwilling to stand idly by like the Druids of the Talon at the Dreamgrove who were planning strategy and defense, Thisalee made her way to Hyjal and asked the Archdruid to accompany her. However, once the demons were fought off it became apparent that the attack on the Druids of the Talon was only a distraction. Thisalee called out to &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, beseeching her for an answer, and Aviana responded that her eyes and ears across Azeroth told her that &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; had come under attack by the Legion at the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThisalee and the Archdruid traveled to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, where they saved Goldrinn, who was asleep in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; invading the barrow. When Goldrinn awakened he did not understand at first what had happened to him, but after learning that the Legion tried to corrupt him he decided that he would not be the only &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; to be targeted. Thisalee and the Archdruid resolved to solve it, but when the Archdruid returned to the Dreamgrove, Thisalee had vanished - she had gone to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to find the demon commander responsible. The two of them discovered the commander to be an eredar named &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Katith%27rax\"&gt;Commander Katith'rax&lt;/a&gt;, who swore to slaughter all of the Ancients when they engaged him. Ultimately, Katith'rax was killed and his plot against the Ancients stopped. In the aftermath Thisalee pledged herself to the Archdruid, stating that while she loves Aviana she is a little too passive to follow around all the time, but the Archdruid is different.\nThe Legion attacks the Shrine of Aviana a second time to steal the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Idol of Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, during which it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Shadegrove\"&gt;Skylord Shadegrove&lt;/a&gt; is actually a &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Infazzar%20the%20Shade\"&gt;Infazzar the Shade&lt;/a&gt;. The theft of the idol robs druids of their &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;, and with the fall of the shrine, the Druids of the Talon regroup to the Dreamgrove and build a new shrine on its northern border. Thisalee and the Archdruid travel to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, where they witness Infazzar using the idol to corrupt &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; with fel. They chase him onto his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; with owls sent by Aviana, retrieve the idol, and the Cenarion Circle's champions cleanse it at the Dreamgrove's new shrine.\nShe also traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Cove\"&gt;Jagged Cove&lt;/a&gt; on the Broken Shore to rescue &lt;a href=\"Saltwater%20Crane\"&gt;saltwater cranes&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThisalee participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.

To eliminate this growing threat, &lt;a href=\"Raene%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Raene Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent young &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill as many of them, but most importantly to bring her the skull of their chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Dal%20Bloodclaw\"&gt;Dal Bloodclaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thistlefur and Foulweald furbolgs pilfered &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; shipment of rope. They are viewed as an annoyance by the Horde since their &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blocks the way to &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;, giving the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; an extra expansion path. &lt;a href=\"Karang%20Amakkar\"&gt;Karang Amakkar&lt;/a&gt; sent Horde adventurers to quell their numbers in their village and planned to send more troops there afterward.\nThey were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; until it was cleansed by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, thus freeing them from its corruption during the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis freedom did not last long. According to the night elves and trolls, a group of Thistlefur furbolgs killed a group of Darkspear trolls traveling to &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27Gar\"&gt;Zoram'Gar&lt;/a&gt; and stole their troll charms. Conversely, &lt;a href=\"Vear%20Darksnout\"&gt;Vear Darksnout&lt;/a&gt; claims that the trolls gave the charms as a token of friendship. As troll charms are dangerous for non-trolls this corrupted the furbolgs again. Eventually, the night elves and their worgen allies removed the troll charms, hoping that the Thistlefur would learn not to steal objects of power that don't belong to them.\nConflicting stories.\nWhile the troll &lt;a href=\"Mitsuwa\"&gt;Mitsuwa&lt;/a&gt; and the worgen &lt;a href=\"Hephaestus%20Pilgrim\"&gt;Hephaestus Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt; both say the Thistlefur stole the troll charms from the Darkspear, the former even sends begging adventurers to recover the troll charms. However, the furbolg Vear Darksnout says that the trolls tricked the tribe into accepting the charms under the pretense of them being a gift. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Comic\"&gt;The Comic&lt;/a&gt;\", the corruption is explained to be caused by the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith these conflicting stories, the truth about how the Thistlefur became uncorrupted is currently unknown as Vear Darksnout could be mistaken and Mitsuwa and Hephaestus Pilgrim could be acting under faulty intelligence."}

It forms massive, gnarled arms covered in wicked thorns. A typical thistleshrub stands 12 feet high and 8 feet wide. They weigh 800 pounds. Thistleshrubs are exceptionally hardy ambulatory plants that meander about the desert seeking sources of water close to the surface. Mindless, they seek out other living creatures in order to drain liquids and minerals from their bodies.\nThistleshrubs often hide among normal plants, so that they appear to be nothing more than a few twisted brambles or vines. They absorb all moisture from the ground, holding it within their bodies in special dew glands. Because they take all nearby sources of moisture for themselves, thereby killing other plants, most consider them ecological menaces to be destroyed on sight. Even druids tend to have little compunction about putting down these destructive creatures. \nThistleshrubs immobilize any moving foe with roots, then move in and pound their prey to death. A thistleshrub always attacks the foe with the most fluid\u2014i.e, usually the largest one. They ignore constructs and creatures with no water content unless such creatures attack them first."}

The fight consists of two alternating phases with Thok's abilities changing throughout the battle from consuming different mobs. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When the Isle of Giants was discovered off the coast of Pandaria, teeming with primal devilsaurs, Garrosh sent men to capture some of the most fearsome specimens, hoping to subjugate them and use them as beasts of war. Countless orcish beastmasters have fallen to Thok's jaws as they struggle to trap and cage him, yet the creature's thirst for blood remains unslaked.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"If the prior chamber contained Garrosh\u2019s inanimate plunder, this is his menagerie of living beasts and native creatures of Pandaria. As we considered what might be found in the cages lining the room, we covered all the bases, ranging from bats to &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; to a yeti plucked from the peaks of Kun-Lai. Oh, and also this unassuming snail that Garrosh came across somewhere. . . .\"\nDuring the fixate phase, Thok will target one of the three farthest non-tank players within 150 yards in 10-man. (Random of 6 in 25-man)\nOverview.\nThok alternates between two modes. When initially engaged, he performs Deafening Screech with increasing frequency, dealing heavy raidwide damage. When he detects a clump of seriously injured players, Thok enters a Blood Frenzy, during which he pursues random targets, instantly devouring any players that cross his path. During Blood Frenzy, he moves faster and faster; defeating a Kor'kron Jailer and freeing a prisoner for Thok to devour will empower him but end his Blood Frenzy.\nStrategy.\nThe encounter has two phases, and alternates between each phase based on the actions performed by the raid. There is no known hard enrage timer, but if the raid transitions into Phase 2 a fourth time, there will be no way to return to Phase 1, which acts as a &lt;a href=\"soft%20enrage\"&gt;soft enrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase 1.\nPop all DPS cooldowns at the pull (including &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;), as there is no specific reason to use it at any other point in the fight.\n\"Dragon rules\" apply to raid positioning in Phase 1: only have the active tank in front of the boss, and the remainder of the raid stacked on one side of him. Tanks will need to regularly taunt off each other due to the debuff applied by Fearsome Roar.\nHealers will need to heal the increasing raid-wide damage caused by Deafening Screech, as well as the random unavoidable damage from Shock Blast. Covering each Deafening Screech with a raid cooldown is recommended as soon as the interval between each Deafening Screech cast drops below 7 seconds.\nIf a raid member drops below 50% health, he will gain the Bloodied debuff. As soon as a minimum number of players with Bloodied are within 10 yards of each other (5 players in 10-man groups, scaling to 15 players in 25-man groups), Thok will transition to Phase 2. If the raid is stacking up, then Thok should enter Phase 2 when the raid damage starts to get too high for the healers to handle, although it is in the raid's best interests to delay the Phase 2 transition for as long as possible.\nPhase 1 Variations.\nThe abilities cast by the boss in Phase 1 are variable, depending on which friendly NPC was freed by the raid in the immediately-preceeding Phase 2.\nIf the raid frees Akolik, then Fearsome Roar is replaced with Acid Breath and Shock Blast is replaced with Corrosive Blood. Apart from the fact that Corrosive Blood is a DoT (thus requiring more healer attention), the Phase 1 strategy remains identical.\nIf the raid frees Waterspeaker Gorai, then Fearsome Roar is replaced with Freezing Breath and Shock Blast is replaced with Icy Blood. Healers will need to keep players with Icy Blood topped up as much as possible, as their health could drop dangerously low when Deafening Screech goes off. Additionally, DPS will need to prioritise freeing players caught in ice tombs. (The ice tombs have no AoE or chain effect, so stacking up still remains viable).\nIf the raid frees Warmaster Montak, then Fearsome Roar is replaced with Scorching Breath and Shock Blast is replaced with Burning Blood. This is the most difficult variation to handle, as the void zones left behind by each player targeted with Burning Blood makes stacking impossible, which has an negative effect on both healing and transitioning to Phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nThok will fixate on random raid members and walk towards them, instantly devouring anyone within a short cone in front of him (making it generally infeasible to melee to attempt to DPS Thok). Raid markers should be set up on opposite sides of the room, and players fixated on should ping-pong him between the two raid markers. Thok gains a movement speed increase every time he changes targets, so if Phase 2 lasts for too long, it will be impossible for fixated players to outrun him. In an emergency situation, abilities that drop aggro completely (such as &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;) can be used to cause Thok to fixate on someone else.\nMeanwhile, a Kor'kron Jailer will spawn. The tanks should pick him up as soon as he spawns, and melee should DPS him down (while range remains on Thok). Once killed, a designated player should loot him and free one of the friendly NPCs as soon as Thok's movement speed begins to concern the raid. Thok will then devour the NPC, granting him the NPCs abilities (see the Phase 1 Variations section above for more on this), and Thok will return to Phase 1. The recommended NPC order is: Akolik, then Gorai, then Montak.\nIf the fight lasts long enough to enter a fourth Phase 2, there will be no way to return to Phase 1, and the raid will have to kill Thok before it becomes impossible to continue outrunning him.\nAchievement: Giant Dinosaur vs. Mega Snail.\nIf the raid is going for &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Dinosaur%20vs.%20Mega%20Snail\"&gt;Giant Dinosaur vs. Mega Snail&lt;/a&gt;, then once the Kor'kron Jailer has been looted, the designated looter should use the key on the cage housing the Monstrous Gastropod instead of one of the \"normal\" cages (the Monstrous Gastropod cage is the cage on the left when the raid walks down the floor to Thok). Another Kor'kron Jailer with less HP than the first will then spawn; this Jailer should be killed in the usual way, then his key looted and the designated \"normal\" cage opened to transition back into Phase 1.\nThis should be repeated for three Phase 1 to Phase 2 transitions, but the raid needs to make sure that Thok is at no more than 5% health before the third transition into Phase 2. As soon as the Monstrous Gastropod cage is unlocked for a third time, it will open, and the Monstrous Gastropod will emerge.\nThe Monstrous Gastropod itself has the same abilities as the Gastropod trash preceeding &lt;a href=\"Ji-Kun\"&gt;Ji-Kun&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; -- it is slow moving, fixates on players at random, and will instantly devour any players that come in contact with it. As soon as the raid kills Thok, the Monstrous Gastropod will head straight for Thok's corpse, devour it, and then once again fixate on players, so the raid will need to quickly kill the Monstrous Gastropod as soon as achievement credit is earned.\nIf the raid outgears the encounter, the achievement can be attempted with two transitions instead of three, which requires three Jailer kills in the first transition.\nQuotes.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is the ancient home of the iron &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and its architecture is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; dwarven city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;; even down to a statue much like the one of &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the entrance hallway.\nThor Modan was once the capital of the iron dwarves, though it was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;s, with much of the main interior of the city in ruins. Iron dwarves work with severe determination to repair the constant damage that is being done by an army of nature giants who constantly barrage the area with huge boulders and entire trees which have been ripped from the ground. Adventurers who come upon Thor Modan first will see a fierce battle between the earthen and the iron dwarves. The iron dwarves are defending the territory and sending powerful stone golems out to engage the marauding earthen, though to little success.\nHistory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhen the adventurer arrives, they will find the city under siege by earthen and stone giants. The iron dwarves control most of the outskirts of Thor Modan; which appear to be in relatively good condition, though delving into the city will reveal it is extremely destroyed. A number of &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; members appear to have gotten caught in the crossfire, many of them slain. As the discerning adventurer delves deeper into Thor Modan, the trappings and belongings can be seen strewn across the landscape. Journal pages and in a few cases - corpses of unfortunate explorers can be seen laid out across the landscape.\nAlliance adventurers who quest in this region will assist the Explorers' League in retrieving excavation information from fallen League members who ventured in and never came out. In addition assistance can be given to the earth giant - &lt;a href=\"Kurun\"&gt;Kurun&lt;/a&gt; - a towering figure of rocks and trees standing on the highest point that looks out over Thor Modan. Kurun and his army of giants are in desperate need of assistance to thwart the iron dwarves and their nefarious movements. His battle goes on in the &lt;a href=\"Boulder%20Hills\"&gt;Boulder Hills&lt;/a&gt; area which sits on the rise behind Thor Modan. As well as attacking the Iron from the roof of the structure he is overseeing a ferocious battle between his army and the iron dwarves army of &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Giant\"&gt;Runed Giant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe purpose of the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; excavations, is spurred by their search for more information on the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and the origin's of their race.\nExploring Azeroth.\nThe brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; passed by Thor Modan during their travels around Northrend. Despite the iron dwarves having joined with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; in an uncorrupted manner; the earthen here serve the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;s, with whom the iron dwarves are still at war. The city is still being bombarded by the stone giants to prevent its rebuilding; thus necessitating the iron dwarves to move to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Argol\"&gt;Dun Argol&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThor Modan is a small &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; midway up the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and halfway between the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; home of &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;. The small force of dwarves that has settled here dislike the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who constantly attack them, and hate the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Any hero from a typical &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; race receives a warm welcome. Dwarves are greeted like long-lost family.\nThe dwarves here are researchers and &lt;a href=\"archaeologist\"&gt;archaeologist&lt;/a&gt;s rather than &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. They offer whatever aid they can, but do not fight unless their homes are threatened. They feed the heroes and give them basic supplies, but have little else to share beyond local knowledge and experience in fighting &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Living in Thor Modan, they seek clues and artifacts from their own past. They do know shortcuts to Gundrak, however, and can guide the heroes there unseen.\nThe dwarves have run-ins with furbolgs on a regular basis, since furbolgs feel the dwarf kinsmen are trespassers and grave-robbers. The dwarves were thrilled to see &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and are eager for news of home. It seems they don't get that many travelers up there, particularly other dwarves. They are not there for socializing, though, and remain focused on their excavations. They have not yet discovered anything of note, but they are still hopeful.\nDescription.\nThis little town looks like it was thrown together, which it was. Mismatched &lt;a href=\"tent\"&gt;tent&lt;/a&gt;s stand between rough wooden shacks and the occasional stone hut, and streets veer wherever someone has settled in their path. The expedition leaders slowly correct the settlement's haphazard construction, replacing the temporary buildings with permanent ones and straightening the paths, but they have still got a ways to go. That is not surprising, since they are more interested in digging for old dwarven relics rather than in setting up &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt;. Furbolgs attack frequently, so the camp has walls up and a guard in place. That at least gives it some shape.\nHistory.\nThe furbolgs claim they were the first people in the Grizzly Hills. So do the Drakkari, though they are concentrated to the north in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. But actually they are both wrong. Dwarves were here first. At least that's what &lt;a href=\"Hardigan%20Ironjaw\"&gt;Hardigan Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt;, of the Thor Modan expedition, tells. He says the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s placed dwarves here, after they had created them. It was an experiment to see if they could survive on their own. They not only survived but flourished, spreading southward and into what would later become &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the other continents.\nHardigan thinks he can find evidence of their ancestors in the hills, and uncover truths about their race's early culture. The &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; thought it likely enough to send him here, at any rate. Brann Bronzebeard believes dwarves did start in the north, since the Titans were there, but he's not sure they ever settled up there. Regardless, all this was well before any surviving history. So no one really knows what went on here back then.\nA dwarven &lt;a href=\"prospector\"&gt;prospector&lt;/a&gt; finally uncovered what the Thor Modan expedition was seeking \u2014 an ancient relic clearly made by dwarves. The relic is an enormous and heavy statue of iron. The problem is, he found the statue in a cave between &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes will have to find and retrieve the relic without getting caught by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; or the furbolgs, all the while avoiding the wild beasts in the area."}

He was a mighty &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; and master strategist who forged an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and went on to play a critical role in the war with his greatsword &lt;a href=\"%3AStrom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt; and his generals &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;. After achieving victory in the war, he reigned peacefully as king of Arathor for years. Near the end of his life, his search for the origins of humanity led him to &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;the tomb&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Keeper Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, where he gave his life to prevent the ancient monstrosity &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; from reawakening.\nBiography.\nFounding of Arathor.\n2,800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the human tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; constantly warred with one another, even as the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; launched incursions into human territories. Warlord Thoradin and his &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who dwelled on the northeastern borders of human lands, realized the folly of their ways and knew that humanity would stand little chance against the Amani in a true war if they remained divided. Thoradin thus declared himself king and embarked on a campaign to unite the Arathi's rival tribes under a single banner. The Arathi's long history of skirmishes with the trolls had honed Thoradin into a master tactician, and in the span of just six years, he brought the other tribes to heel. He won some to his side through the marriages of his sons and daughters, others with the promises of wealth and land. Other times, he pitted his rivals against one another or, in rare cases, was forced to outright conquer some of the more violent tribes. To the surprise of those he defeated, Thoradin did not reign as a tyrant but instead offered his former enemies peace and equality in what he claimed would be a glorious new human kingdom. The tribal leaders would not fade into obscurity but instead become honored generals in his army. In this way, Thoradin and the Arathi won the loyalty of their adversaries.\nFor weeks, Thoradin and his warriors struggled to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; people of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The upstart king was confident he could conquer the tribe if given enough time, but he knew the cost would be very high and decided to change his tactics to prevent needless bloodshed. He shed his armor, painted his chest with Arathi tribal symbols, and marched up the mountain with only his greatsword in hand to challenge the Alteraci leader, &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus&lt;/a&gt;, to a duel. Ignaeus was bigger and stronger than Thoradin, but the Arathi leader had intentionally chosen the duel on a day when the mountains were enveloped in thick fog. Thoradin used the weather to his advantage to avoid Ignaeus' swings and disarm his foe. Rather than killing his opponent, Thoradin then plunged his blade into the earth and extended the hand of peace, thereby winning the Alteraci to his side.\nThe only tribe powerful enough to end Thoradin's dream of unity was the &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;noble and spiritual people&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, who were led by the warrior &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the Alteraci, they would not submit to shows of force. To win their loyalty, Thoradin had to appeal to their religious beliefs. The king and his guards made a pilgrimage to Tirisfal's shrines and sacred groves, performing rituals at each site. The king even wore a pendant of the silver hand, a symbol held sacred by the region's humans. At the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin met with Lordain and promised that if the tribe joined him, he would spread their mystic ways among the Arathi. To seal his promise, Thoradin ran his palm along his sword's edge and mixed his blood with the earth of Tirisfal while telling Lordain \"Between our people, let this be the only blood we spill\". Thus Lordain and his people bent the knee to Thoradin.\nThoradin convinced all of the human tribal leaders he recruited to lend him their personal blades, after which Arathi blacksmiths took shards of metal from each weapon and added them to the king's greatsword. This secured the eternal loyalty of the tribes, for many early human warlords believed that the spirits of their ancestors lived on in their weapons, and no one would ever dare rise up against Thoradin and risk striking the sword that contained their own forefathers. When the work was done, Thoradin renamed his sword &lt;a href=\"%3AStrom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;:Strom'kar, the Warbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter uniting the human tribes, Thoradin named his new nation &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and set out to found a new capital. According to one legend, he received his answer when his father appeared to him in a dream, wearing the pelt of a black wolf, and told him of an arid region southeast of Tirisfal Glades where his people would prosper. Thoradin sought out the land later called the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and, as the story goes, saw a black wolf roaming the terrain. On that spot, the king used Strom'kar to carve out the boundaries of a city in the dirt and ordered his masons to begin constructing what became &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the first human kingdom. Thoradin also ordered his people to build a &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;great wall&lt;/a&gt; near the new city to shield humanity from Amani incursions.\nThe Troll Wars.\nJust as Thoradin had expected, Amani trolls soon began encroaching on Arathor's borders. The king sent two of his most prominent generals\u2014Ignaeus and Lordain\u2014to gather intelligence on their foe and prevent the trolls from straying too deep into the empire. Thoradin did not sit idle on his throne and often accompanied the Arathi military during border skirmishes with the trolls. One account tells of an Amani ambush that separated the king from his warriors. Though he was outnumbered ten to one, Thoradin did not flee or cower. He sharpened Strom'kar's edge on the skulls of his enemies and painted its steel with their blood. When his guards reached him, they found the king standing over ten broken Amani corpses.\nRumors soon reached Strom of a fierce conflict between the Amani and the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; far to the north. Although unsettled, Thoradin and his generals agreed that they would not risk their own kind by sending aid to the reclusive elves and instead kept most of their forces in Strom. The king's opinion changed when high elf ambassadors sent by &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the city and told the humans that the troll armies were vast and would move to attack Arathor once they had destroyed Quel'Thalas. Thoradin and his advisors debated well into the night before concluding that the humans did not have enough forces for an open fight with the trolls and that they would need magic in order to defeat the Amani, even though the king deeply distrusted sorcery in all its forms. After some further negotiations, Thoradin and Anasterian reached an agreement. Elven magi traveled to Strom and began teaching &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; the ways of magic. Meanwhile, Thoradin sent his generals to establish the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the Alterac Mountains to serve as a staging point for the offensive against the trolls. Once the elves had finished tutoring the human magi, Thoradin personally led over twenty thousand human soldiers from Alterac Fortress toward Quel'Thalas. The human magi stayed behind, hidden within the fortress.\nThoradin led the Arathi host to smash into the Amani's southern flank in southern Quel'Thalas, causing the Amani ruler &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt; to turn his attention to the humans. The king then ordered his forces to begin slowly retreating to Alterac with the trolls in pursuit. A fierce, days-long battle ensued in the Alterac foothills, with the humans tenaciously defending Alterac Fortress while the high elves arrived from the north to attack the trolls on a second front. Thoradin personally waded through the Amani warbands with the rest of his soldiers, hacking down troll after troll with Strom'kar. Once the humans and elves were confident they had worn down the Amani ranks, they unleashed their secret weapon. The One Hundred emerged and, along with elven sorcerers, pooled their power and unleashed magical fire from the skies to incinerate the Amani armies. Jintha was among the first to be consumed by the flames, and the fleeing trolls were easily hunted down by the human and elven armies. The &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; thus ended with Arathor and Quel'Thalas triumphant, and the grateful elves made a pledge of undying loyalty and friendship to Arathor and to Thoradin's bloodline.\nLater life.\nAfter the Troll Wars, Thoradin traveled on a diplomatic mission to Quel'Thalas to secure humanity's friendship with the high elves. He created a military pact with the elves so that each side would help the other if the Amani ever again became a threat, and also created new territorial borders and trade agreements to foster Arathor's prosperity for generations to come. Before Thoradin left Quel'Thalas, the elves' greatest blacksmiths and enchanters gave him a gift by imbuing Strom'kar with extraordinary power, making it weigh almost nothing in the king's hands and ensuring that it would never lose its edge.\nUnder Thoradin's reign, Arathor grew and prospered. However, the king feared that his kingdom would splinter apart if it overextended itself and maintained that Strom was the center of the empire. As his years wore on, an elderly Thoradin peacefully abdicated his throne. He broke tradition by keeping Strom'kar as his own, which was seen by some as an act of greed but was actually done for practical reasons: Strom'kar had become a symbol of kingship, but Thoradin wanted Arathor's citizens to see the members of his bloodline as the legitimate rulers, not simply whoever held the sword. Free from the burden of leadership, Thoradin became obsessed with the origins of humankind and the tales of a &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;race of giants&lt;/a&gt; who had once lived side-by-side with early humans. Accompanied by his closest retainers, he spent much of this time studying ruins in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and learned to use Strom'kar's enchantments to locate hidden places of power. During one journey in Tirisfal, he and his followers discovered the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;long-lost tomb&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, the noble &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; who had long ago sacrificed himself to defeat &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi servant of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nA tense confrontation ensued between Thoradin's retinue and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the secretive order sworn to protect the tomb. Eventually, the former king and his followers forced their way past the guardians and entered the gravesite. Unaware of the darkness resting beneath the earth, Thoradin told his magi to break the tomb's magical wards. Inside, they discovered Tyr's body but also Zakajz, who had inadvertently been resurrected when the sorcerers broke the seals. The massive horror summoned minions from below the earth and tore through Thoradin's followers, but the king did not flee or cower. He knew the C'Thrax had to be stopped before it fully awakened, and his comrades' deaths gave him enough time to bury Strom'kar in Zakajz's brain even as the Corruptor's claws crushed the life from him. The sword's elven enchantments forced the C'Thrax into a deep slumber and kept it from regenerating. However, Thoradin's wounds were mortal and he died shortly after. For centuries thereafter, the former king's &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; lingered near the tomb, unable to find peace.\nLegacy.\nIn the generations after Thoradin's reign, Arathor gradually fractured as various cities and outposts grew into &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;increasingly autonomous city-states&lt;/a&gt;. Many of Strom's noble families eventually left the city to settle the more fertile lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the north. Not long after, Thoradin's last living descendants\u2014led by a member of the king's line named &lt;a href=\"Faldir\"&gt;Faldir&lt;/a&gt;\u2014also departed Arathor and sailed south to establish the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Over generations, rivalries emerged between the human city-states as they grew increasingly insular and concerned only with their own well-being. The empire of Arathor had effectively disintegrated, and Thoradin's dream of a unified humanity faded at last.\nThe last descendant of Thoradin's bloodline was &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, who ended up briefly uniting humanity as his ancestor had done by convincing the kingdoms to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. As the Alliance's supreme commander, Lothar wielded more power and influence than any human had since the days of Thoradin. He reminded the high elves of Quel'Thalas of the oath they had sworn his ancestor in order to secure their help against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the war.\nOne of the sigils used to protect &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; is named the &lt;a href=\"%3Asigil%20of%20Thoradin\"&gt;:sigil of Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third Burning Legion invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists seeking to awaken Zakajz tortured Thoradin's ghost for information about what happened to him and his followers in the tomb. A &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; seeking Strom'kar freed the former king, who then accompanied the warrior while they delved into the tomb. The adventurer retrieved Strom'kar and dealt a permanent killing blow to Zakajz, allowing Thoradin's ghost to finally leave the tomb and be at peace, though not before granting his sword to the hero."}

Due to being weak, he asked the adventurer to enter and search &lt;a href=\"Wyrmskull%20Village\"&gt;Wyrmskull Village&lt;/a&gt; in the spirit world in his stead. There, they saw a vision of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; from the past and reported this to Thoralius, which confused the shaman as the information he had indicated that the vrykul appeared only recently. Thoralius asked the adventurer to search &lt;a href=\"Nifflevar\"&gt;Nifflevar&lt;/a&gt; in the spirit world for clues. The adventurer saw more visions of vrykul and &lt;a href=\"Ymiron\"&gt;Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;, which helped Thoralius reveal a mystery related to the vrykul and the origin of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;kind.\nIt is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Captain Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; was at Valgarde for a time (perhaps before moving north to establish the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade%20Encampment\"&gt;Westfall Brigade Encampment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;) and befriended Thoralius.

Years later he withdrew from the Alliance due to disagreements with his friend &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;.

Amidst those nations, there were no two rivals like &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and Stromgarde. The proximity of the two and the apparent ambiguity of their mountain borders had led to several wars and skirmishes. On more than one occasion, Thoras Trollbane led the armies of Stromgarde into battle against the honorable &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac. \nThe Second War.\nHe was one of the human leaders who met at the councils to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Thoras was quick to agree to form the Alliance as he was a good friend of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and had a close relationship with &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; didn't want to form a combined army but Thoras and his friend &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; accused him of cowardice so Greymane relented to form the Alliance. Once the Alliance was formed, each king argued in favor of them gaining command of the new unified army. Thoras claimed the role should be his, considering he had the most actual fighting experience. The role was eventually given to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nFollowing the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde sent half of its standing army to the main Alliance forces, for Trollbane felt that battle was to be had with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stop their threat. Stromgarde had little chance to show its offensive capabilities, as half of their army (the one that didn't go with &lt;a href=\"Lothar\"&gt;Lothar&lt;/a&gt;) was defending the North lands from the Horde's invasion through the dwarven realm of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;: which the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"Blacktooth%20Grin\"&gt;Blacktooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; had already expanded into.\nStromgarde came under heavy assault and losses. They lost their island citadel of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; but continued to battle through. They tried to ambush &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and kill him but they failed. The Horde managed to destroy a good deal of Trollbane's kingdom, and continued its march towards the elven kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Siege of Lordaeron, Trollbane personally led his troops to cut the Horde reinforcements through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, rendezvousing with &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; who confirmed Perenolde's betrayal and sent his troops to join Trollbane's in defending the mountain passes, and preventing the entire Horde from overwhelming Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. As the Alliance forces made their push to the south, Thoras sent a Stromgarde force under his nephew, , to retake Khaz Modan.\nAfter the War.\nTwo years after the war ended, Thoras alongside other kings was present in &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the signs of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopening. Back in Capital City, Thoras and Terenas were visited by the goblin &lt;a href=\"Krix%20Wiklish\"&gt;Krix Wiklish&lt;/a&gt; who wanted to seal a deal with them. After the goblin left the two kings with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; were discussing the matter of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. Thoras was also then present in the Capital City's religion service.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; after its deal with the Horde became known, Thoras Trollbane petitioned King Terenas to annex the eastern portion of Alterac's territory to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in recognition of the latter's sacrifices and valor during the Second War. Years later, he attended the ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; became a paladin.\nThe Alliance splinters.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, much of the Horde was wiped out and most surviving orcs were placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. Trollbane, however, fervently disagreed with this policy, believing that the orcs were simply too dangerous to be kept alive, and he openly called for every orc in the camps to be executed. He argued with Terenas about this which was bitter for both as it was an argument between very close friends. In addition, the higher taxes, along with the high expense of maintaining and operating the numerous orc internment camps, led many leaders to believe that their kingdoms would be better off seceding from the Alliance. After the high elves left the Alliance, so did Gilneas and Stromgarde. When &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; refused to mass execute the orcs, a few years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Trollbane sadly withdrew his support from the Alliance.\nAfter Terenas was killed by his own son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, someone added a second part on the plaque adorning Terenas' empty tomb in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;Lordaeron's palace&lt;/a&gt;. The believes it to have been done on the order of King Thoras. Similarly, someone recovered &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;Terenas' crown&lt;/a&gt; and buried it in an unidentified grave on an island in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; believe that it was refugees from Lordaeron, but given the involvement of Thoras with Terenas' tomb, he could also be involved.\nAt some point after the death of his friend Terenas, Thoras was murdered by his son, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen&lt;/a&gt;. However, before he died Thoras was aware Galen was the one responsible, and Galen was aware that Thoras knew it was him. His body was laid to rest in his family &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; along with the mighty family sword &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, and he was succeeded as Stromgarde's ruler by the prince. A single, secret plaque with a memorial verse was placed inside the coffin at eye level with Thoras' body:\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; believed that several of the epitaph lines hinted at the Stormwind Harbor Lighthouse burial site of &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;Terenas' crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; sought out Thoras Trollbane's crypt and raised him as a member of their new &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that he failed as a father for being murdered by his son, and as a ruler for his kingdom falling to ruin, Thoras left Stromgarde and joined the Ebon Blade to preserve peace on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis first mission with the Ebon Blade was to join their assault on the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, where he lingered just outside the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20Gardens\"&gt;Chapel Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; for preying upon innocent people. He later aided the Ebon Blade in attempting to retrieve the body of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. After Darion sacrificed himself to allow them to escape, Thoras remarked that in an entire lifetime of warfare he had never seen such sacrifice.\nLegionfall.\nThoras later participated with his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;fellow Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, with the Deathlord and &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt; mounted on &lt;a href=\"Daumyr\"&gt;Daumyr&lt;/a&gt;, to battle the demons on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar had Thoras and his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;fellow horsemen&lt;/a&gt; acquire fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and following its completion witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights being raised. Darion personally sent the new death knights to travel to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; if they were of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, or to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; if they were of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and make a choice from the &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Call%20Board\"&gt;Hero's Call Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe Ride Forth.\nBelieving that Bolvar had fallen to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Darion attempted to kill him. However, Bolvar forcibly controlled the former's body and made him return to , while taunting him about requiring his fellow horsemen. Though wary of it being a trap, the horsemen agreed to kill the Lich King, and decide who would wield the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; after Bolvar was slain, with Thoras believing the new owner would be the last one standing. However, en route to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Four Horsemen, using their connection to the Lich King, discovered him locked in combat with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that this was all part of Bolvar's gambit to have the horsemen arrive and kill the winner of the conflict.\nThoras and the others were stunned when Sylvanas won and destroyed the helm instead of claiming ownership of it. With the Scourge &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;no longer under control&lt;/a&gt;, Darion ordered &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Bolvar, while he and Thoras Trollbane fought to keep Acherus under their control.\nShadowlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Thoras and the other horsemen accompanied Bolvar and the heroes of Azeroth during the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;s through the fortress' various levels.\nPersonality.\nThoras Trollbane was a natural-born &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has known. His people's lands were in the heart of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;-populated areas, and so being ready for battle was simply a way of life. Due to this, he is easily the largest and physically the strongest &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; king in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Thoras was a man of few words only speaking those needed - but when he spoke, only ever spoke truth, often saying the words others were afraid to speak. Although Thoras opted for the execution of the orcs when they were held in internment camps, he was willing to admit he'd been wrong, which might have been one of the traits that had made him so beloved by his people when he ruled.\nHowever, his gruff exterior hid a very sharp mind. This often gives him an advantage when dealing with arrogant men. Trollbane was an old friend of King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, likely known each other ever since they were young and was his closest ally. Though their relationship soured after the war, they still respected each other greatly. Trollbane was also a rival and an enemy of King &lt;a href=\"Perenolde\"&gt;Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, leading the armies of Stromgarde into battle against the honorable &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac on more than one occasion. He wielded a mighty axe into battle during the siege of Lordaeron but he was also known to wield the dreaded sword &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe axe he wielded may have been the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20%28axe%29\"&gt;Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "156347", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=156347", "title": "Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury", "text": "Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury is the name of a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; that drops from &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who is the last boss of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; 25-man raid instance. This bow was the highest dps (level 70) weapon in game, excluding wands. Equipping the bow awards the &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thori%27dal%2C%20the%20Stars%27%20Fury%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury (achievement)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe legendary bow resonates with the power of the Sunwell. The origins and history of the weapon remain a mystery, even to the blood elves. The bow magically conjures an arrow ready to be loosed.\nA bow with the same model is wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. It has not been confirmed whether it is Thori'dal. In \"Legion\", Thori'dal is hung on a wall of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, next to the &lt;a href=\"Bristleblitz%20Striker\"&gt;Bristleblitz Striker&lt;/a&gt;. According to \"\", the bow was reclaimed by the blood elves after Kil'jaeden was defeated at the Sunwell.\nNotes.\nBefore the requirement to carry ammunition was removed altogether in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", Thori'dal generated magical arrows when the bow string was drawn, thus eliminating the need for physical arrows to be carried or produced. Attempting to add ammunition to the paper doll slot Thori'dal did not add extra DPS, and instead produced an error message, \"Ammo slot full.\" The high DPS of this bow was most likely the result of this lack of need for arrows since there would be no +damage added from such. The contemporary top arrow (in \"\") was &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Arrow\"&gt;Timeless Arrow&lt;/a&gt; with a +53.0 bonus, giving Thori'dal a comparative DPS of 109.8 - presumably. However, due to the nature of &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Shot\"&gt;Steady Shot&lt;/a&gt;, this weapon vastly increased hunter DPS, in spite of having comparable DPS to &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Bow%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Golden Bow of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Arrow\"&gt;Timeless Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOriginally, Thori'dal had a +15% attack speed effect not stacking with ammo quivers or pouches, allowing the hunter to carry a fourth normal bag. This was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt; when ammo bags no longer granted &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Thori'dal was obviously added for &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, it is not limited to them and can be equipped by any class that can use bows, namely &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite its release at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, it is still the highest level, permanent legendary weapon available to hunters.\nSo far the bow has no confirmed lore behind it. It is the only permanent, legendary weapon available to players to have no story or lore to rationalize or explain its existence. \nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", Thori'dal appears as that can be equipped by &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s Battlecry effect.\nSpeculation.\nThere has been some debate in the roleplaying community (and generally with those interested in &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;) regarding the history behind Thori'dal. Even in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, it remains an enigma within the lore, with little to no information behind it. \nSunstrider's Longbow?\nA particularly popular theory is the notion that, with the &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; books rendered non-&lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;, Thori'dal is, in fact, the canon rendition of &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%27s%20Longbow\"&gt;Sunstrider's Longbow&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary bow which the RPG books stated was wielded by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, and later, Ranger General &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that the legendary bow was lost when Sylvanas fell during the Scourge invasion, and was rediscovered and passed on to Halduron\u2014Sylvanas's successor\u2014after the victory at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, just as it was once passed down to Ranger General Sylvanas."}

{"id": "452056", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=452056", "title": "Thorignir", "text": "The Thorignir are a group of &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s residing on the mountain of &lt;a href=\"Thorim%27s%20Peak\"&gt;Thorim's Peak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. They are the oldest and wisest dragons in Stormheim, and to fly with them is to sail amongst the gods themselves. Unlike the storm dragons loyal to &lt;a href=\"Nithogg\"&gt;Nithogg&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nastrondir\"&gt;the north&lt;/a&gt;, the Thorignir swear fealty to the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;titan keepers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;. They have also traditionally maintained a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;, allowing these &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; to ride the Thorignir into battle as mounts. Recently, however, an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has set the vrykul against their former allies.\nHistory.\nThe Thorignir have existed as one of several &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s colonies in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, though theirs was unique in its allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;titanic keepers&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this commitment, the Thorignir are responsible for overseeing the Test of Will, a trial to determine the worthiness of those seeking the fabled &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, one of the five &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the faction's matriarch was its broodmother &lt;a href=\"Thrymjaris\"&gt;Thrymjaris&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Vethir\"&gt;Vethir&lt;/a&gt; has also been described as a leader of the Thorignir. When the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s did arrive in Stormheim, they convinced numerous vrykul to join their side with promises of power. The &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;, allies of the Thorignir for many ages, would break their ancient pact with the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and pledge themselves to &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so they became the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt;, and effectively declared war on the Thorignir. &lt;a href=\"Storm%20drake\"&gt;Storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s soon found themselves being enslaved by the Drekirjar based from &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt;, acts which outraged their kin.\nThe God-King's main goal was to seize the Aegis of Aggramar, in the pursuit of which he eventually turned his attention on the Thorignir. Skovald had no intention of taking the traditional steps involved in the test of will, and instead launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Thorim%27s%20Peak\"&gt;Thorim's Peak&lt;/a&gt; to take the dragons' power by force. His forces drove the Thorignir back to the mountain's peak, and occupied their &lt;a href=\"Stormwing%20Rookery\"&gt;rookery&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Felskorn and their demon allies began to corrupt the storm dragon young, while the other Thorignir were helpless to prevent it.\nMany of the Thorignir were subsequently captured by the invaders, including Thrymjaris, almost heralding complete disaster for the colony of storm dragons. It was only due to aid from &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;outsiders&lt;/a&gt; working to defeat the Legion that the Thorignir were able to turn the tide. With the help of their new allies, &lt;a href=\"Vethir\"&gt;Vethir&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining free storm dragons took the offensive and freed most of their captured kin. Having inflicted great losses on the Felskorn at the mountain's summit and liberating their broodmother, the Thorignir proceeded to take vengeance upon &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nThe dragons unleashed their full power on the village, causing hundreds of casualties among the Drekirjar and crippling their ability to threaten the peak. Though they would continue to enslave storm drakes, they ceased being a serious threat to the Thorignir. Vethir would continue to launch occasional attacks on Hrydshal in retribution for the vrykuls' actions, with great effect. Now freed from the danger of the Felskorn, the Thorignir devoted themselves to preventing Skovald achieving his goals at the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. Storm drakes would play an important role in defeating the Felskorn assault on the Gates, which ended with the God-King's death in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. This decisively concluded the Legion threat within Stormheim temporarily.\nEventually, however, the demons would return and once again &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Stormheim\"&gt;assault the region&lt;/a&gt; in great numbers. The Thorignir would answer the call to defend their home once more, with Vethir and his fellow storm dragons leading the attack on the Legion army at &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. The Thorignir and Stormheim's other defenders would emerge victorious yet again, crushing the demonic assault before the Gates of Valor for a second time and securing their home from invasion.\nSpeculation.\nIt seems that &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; managed to steal some of their powers, as &lt;a href=\"Stormbreaker%20Reykir\"&gt;Stormbreaker Reykir&lt;/a&gt; says and while casting a thunder spell called \"&lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;'s Bolt\"."}

Kept captive within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; with the other keepers, he was freed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat.\nThorim wields the hammer &lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that Thorim's power has been used only once, and that it turned a whole continent into dust.\nBiography.\nAncient past.\nThorim was one of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to lead the titan-forged armies against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Thorim was imbued with power by &lt;a href=\"Golganneth\"&gt;Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Together with &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;, he battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir%20the%20Windlord\"&gt;Al'Akir the Windlord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThorim served the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s as guardian of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Terrace of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;, and protecting the pacts between the races of frost, among them, the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; became frinds with him. In ages past, Keeper &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; devised the &lt;a href=\"Thunderspark\"&gt;Thunderspark&lt;/a&gt; that powers the &lt;a href=\"Titanstrike\"&gt;Titanstrike&lt;/a&gt; for his comrade Thorim.\nHowever, after being corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; killed his brother's wife &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, and tricked Thorim into believing that &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;King Arngrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s were responsible. In a fit of rage, Thorim threw his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;, at Arngrim, who was in the middle of a battle against a clan of &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;frost dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion of Krolmir striking the ground killed all those nearby and froze the entire tableau for all time, which is known today as &lt;a href=\"Thunderfall\"&gt;Thunderfall&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim then brooded for a long time over the death of his wife, settling into a long stupor for thousands of years, while the Sons of Hodir were deeply stunned at such an unexpected betrayal.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nCenturies later, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim discovered the truth with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s serving the Sons of Hodir. Roused from his stupor, he vowed to take the fight against Loken. He enlisted the adventurers to help him to make up for his past sins and to regain the trust of the Sons of Hodir. Members of the Sons of Hodir also encouraged adventurers to aid them in order to heal the rift between Thorim and the rest of the frost giants. He eventually made peace with them, and they in turn have helped him reach out to other frost giants to make amends.\nWhen Thorim recovered his &lt;a href=\"Krolmir%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Storms\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reforged%20Armor%20of%20the%20Stormlord\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, he brought war to his treacherous brother. However, it turned out to have been an elaborate ruse perpetrated by Loken to lure him out of Temple of Storms, where proximity to his &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;dark master&lt;/a&gt; granted him the power to overcome Thorim's attack. Thorim and his &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, were captured and taken to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, so he could be driven mad by Yogg-Saron.\nUlduar.\nLoken had Thorim taken to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; along with his proto-drake, Veranus (transformed into the plated monstrosity &lt;a href=\"Razorscale\"&gt;Razorscale&lt;/a&gt;), where he was corrupted and brought under the sway of Yogg-Saron. Defeating him in Ulduar breaks Yogg-Saron's spell, and Thorim agrees to aid the adventurers who freed him during the final battle against Yogg-Saron. Thorim first appears as a &lt;a href=\"Thorim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating him, he breaks from of Yogg-Saron's corruption and aids you in the &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;battle against the Old God&lt;/a&gt;. When active, Thorim provides the following buffs:\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"%3ATitanstrike\"&gt;:Titanstrike&lt;/a&gt;, a gun &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; had created for his companion Thorim long ago, was at some point stolen from Ulduar and brought to &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. During the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the gun was stolen again by a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; woman named &lt;a href=\"Prustaga\"&gt;Prustaga&lt;/a&gt;, who intended to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Thunderspark\"&gt;Thunderspark&lt;/a&gt; within and gain the power of the Titans. Prustaga and vrykul who served her attacked Thorim at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of freeing her people from the Keepers' judgment. Thorim, along with Mimiron, &lt;a href=\"Grif%20Wildheart\"&gt;Grif Wildheart&lt;/a&gt; (whom Thorim mistook as &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;), and a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; Thorim recognized as one of the heroes who freed him from Yogg-Saron, battled Prustaga as she was empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Thunderspark\"&gt;Thunderspark&lt;/a&gt; within Titanstrike.\n&lt;a href=\"Hati\"&gt;Hati&lt;/a&gt;, one of Thorim's pet &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; (the other being &lt;a href=\"Skoll\"&gt;Skoll&lt;/a&gt;, whom Thorim had lost track of), attacked Prustaga as the Thunderspark's power overwhelmed her and absorbed the electrical energy within. To prevent Hati's death, the hunter &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;bonded their soul&lt;/a&gt; with the beast. Thorim then asked the hunter to wield Titanstrike with Hati at their side.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; sounded the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt;, which the keepers of Ulduar were oathbound to answer. However, Thorim reported that they could not as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had invaded Ulduar. &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; sent his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; to aid the forces of Ulduar. Though &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the Legion, Thorim pledged the forces of Ulduar to aid the Valarjar and later aided them in saving Hodir from the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he and his temple came under attack once more. While the attackers were seemingly defeated, Thorim was left incapacitated. Soon, Grif and the hunter adventurer returned came to him and found the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Hati\"&gt;Essence of Hati&lt;/a&gt; by the corpses of the attackers. The two hunters defeated the essence and absorbed it into &lt;a href=\"Thunderspark\"&gt;Thunderspark&lt;/a&gt;, which freed Thorim. Upon hearing of the plan to restore Hati, he immediately teleported to . As soon as he arrived, he used the power of &lt;a href=\"Krolmir%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Hati%20%28Silithus%29\"&gt;Essence of Hati&lt;/a&gt; to release Grif from the wolf's grip.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; and met Thorim there. They mentioned in their report that the Keeper was feeling a little better these days, and then asked him about his pet wolf &lt;a href=\"Skoll\"&gt;Skoll&lt;/a&gt; and where was &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt;, the latter no longer being present in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Thorim sheepishly replied that he was sure Skoll would wander home soon, and that he didn't know what had happened to Jotun. During their conversations, he mistook &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Grif%20Wildheart\"&gt;Grif Wildheart&lt;/a&gt;, and didn't think much about &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion to try flying around the peaks, waving a bit of &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; meat and calling Skoll's name.\nQuotes.\nDialogue.\nMortals, I am indebted to you for freeing me from the terrible corruption that besets this place. Though I have not yet recovered fully, I can help you battle Yogg-Saron.\nI can grant you and your friends the Fury of the Storm, increasing your damage and maximum health. Should you be faced with evil so malevolent that it cannot be destroyed, I can channel all my power into a final Titanic Storm that will destroy even Immortals.\nMyth.\nHis name, title, and location are references to the Norse god . Thorim's hammer (&lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;) is based on Thor's hammer () and Thor's wife is also named . During the encounter in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Jormungar%20Behemoth\"&gt;Jormungar Behemoth&lt;/a&gt; stands in the arena, probably as a reference to Thor's killer at Ragnarok: (whom Thor would slay as well). From the similarity between his name and the metal &lt;a href=\"Thorium\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt; there may be some mysterious connection between the two, much in the same way &lt;a href=\"Saronite\"&gt;Saronite&lt;/a&gt; is considered to have a mystical connection with the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. However since Thorium is a real metal it may be more doubtful that the designers had any intent to link the two."}

The encounter has two phases, in the first, the raid has to split in a gauntlet and an arena team. The arena team must fight waves of adds while the gauntlet team makes its way through some trash and a few mini-bosses to Thorim. Upon reaching the boss, he and the gauntlet group join the arena team, starting the second phase which lasts until Thorim is subdued.\nBoth, fire and nature resistance are useful. When attempting hard mode, a little frost resistance gear is recommended.\nBackground.\nBosstiary.\n\"For many years Thorim believed that the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20giant\"&gt;ice giants&lt;/a&gt; had murdered his beloved wife, &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, not realizing that his brother, &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, was truly responsible. When Thorim learned the truth, Loken ensnared him and brought him to Ulduar.\"\nAdventure Guide.\n\"For years, Thorim believed that ice giants had murdered his beloved wife Sif. Thorim turned his wrath upon his allies and fell into despair. When he learned that his brother Loken was responsible for the crime, Loken captured Thorim and brought him to Ulduar, where the Old God clouded the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;'s mind.\"\nOverview.\nThorim calls in Dark Rune forces to engage players that are in the Arena until allies are able to reach Thorim by traveling through the Hallway. Once players reach Thorim he will leap into the arena and use powerful Lightning attacks to defeat his foes.\nAbilities.\nStage One: Prove Your Worth.\nThorim calls in Dark Rune forces to engage players that are in the Arena until allies are able to reach Thorim by traveling through the Hallway.\nHard Mode.\nIf players traverse the Hallway quick enough and reach Thorim within 90 seconds Sif will join the battle in Stage Two.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nThe fight is started by killing the trash mobs in the Arena (healer first). Thorim casts Sheath of Lightning on himself, making him almost invulnerable. After the mobs are down, the lever next to the gate on the left becomes active. The raid should now split in two, one part goes down the hallway to reach Thorim, and the other part stays in the arena to fight waves of adds.\nThe Gauntlet.\nThe gauntlet team needs one tank and one healer. In 10 player mode, 1-3 damage dealers suffice, in 25 player mode an extra healer and about 7 damage dealers should be sent. Ranged DPS is better suited for the gauntlet, mages in particular. The gauntlet team must move quickly, because after 5 minutes Thorim wipes the raid.\nThere are 3 groups of 3 Warbringers. They can be &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;led, (&lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; in particular). Two mobs should be CC'd while the others are killed. At the end of the hallway is a large golem. In regular intervals it raises one arm and does damage to anyone on that side of the hallway, much like &lt;a href=\"Skadi\"&gt;Skadi&lt;/a&gt;. A short time after it is engaged it gains a buff which decreases damage taken by 50%, so if using cooldowns it's best to use them early.\nAfter defeating the golem, the door behind it opens and mobs start spawning on top of the stairs. Defeat or CC the two sets of two mobs already standing there and quickly run up. When the giant aggros, he buffs any adds still alive, but the adds stop spawning. The healers must have &lt;a href=\"LOS\"&gt;LOS&lt;/a&gt; to the tank but stand outside the giant's stomp. When the giant is positioned at the top of the stairs, the healer can stand about halfway down.\nAfter the giant is defeated the gauntlet team runs towards Thorim and jumps down into the arena. Someone must use any ability on Thorim to make him join. While running the large circles on the ground must be avoided, they are traps which briefly stun players standing on them.\nArena.\nThe raid members positioned closest to Thorim gain initial aggro from all spawned adds.\nA simple setup for the arena team is to stack up dead center in the room. This avoids getting hit by the charged orbs, and also greatly increases the effects of both, &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; healing and AoE damage. The disadvantage of this method is that it makes the raid more susceptible to Stormhammer - it's possible to just take Stormhammer, but the group can also try to quickly spread out when it hits.\nThe most dangerous mobs are the Dark Rune Champions which do a whirlwind atteck. They need to be kept away from the main raid, and/or disarmed. The Evokers casts heals-over-time that heal for massive amounts and also cast magic damage shield that can be stolen by mages. Both are dispellable and need to be dispelled/stolen quickly. Wound poison helps to reduce the amount healed.\nPhase 2.\nOnce Thorim is activated, he jumps down into the Arena. The mob waves stop spawning. During the whole of Phase 2, Thorim gains an extra Lightning Charged buff every 10 seconds. This buff stack progressively increases damage and attack speed, it's in effect a passive enrage timer. From about 7 stacks on, healers and tanks need to use some CDs to survive, after about 15 buffs Thorims melee hits can one-shot even the best geared tank.\nAfter Thorim is in the arena, he needs to be picked up by the MT immediately. The raid should spread out to avoid extra damage from Thorims' chain lightning. Every time Thorim uses Unbalancing strike (which is every 15\u201320 seconds), tanks need to taunt him off each other. When Thorim uses Lightning Charge, small lightning balls come from a column. After a short time, that column deals large amounts of AoE damage in a 60 degrees angle, this damage may be enough to one-shot players after the third Lightning Charge.\nHard mode: Lose your Illusion.\nIf the gauntlet team reaches Thorim within 2:45 min (6:15 on Heroic) of killing the adds in the entrance, the illusion of Thorim's wife Sif joins the fight. Additionally, Thorim gets +43% health and +67% damage compared to Normal Mode (it is not only +30%/+40%, since the debuff Touch of Dominion being applied for Normal Mode reduces his stats by -30%/-40% from the Hard Mode values).\nWhile the increased damage is not a large deal, the additional HP make the fight longer, which means a substantially higher stack of Lightning Charged.\nIn hard mode, Thorim's Chain lightning is very dangerous to melee, so it is advisable to form 2-3 melee camps more than 8 yards from each other around the boss, as with Kel'Thuzad at 60.\nSif herself is unattackable. She has four abilities which when chained together can kill raid members very quickly.\nWhen Thorim is defeated 'Sif' reveals itself for what it is: an influence tentacle of Yogg-Saron.\nTips.\nDemoralizing Shout cuts the damage the tank receives from unbalancing strike by 40%.\nPriests can &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; a Dark Rune Warbringer. Besides dealing high damage, they also give all nearby allies a permanent buff called \"Aura of Celerity\", increasing melee, ranged and spell haste by 20%, practically a permanent &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; (also requirement for the achievement / ). In addition, the mind-controlled Warbringers hit harder than most level 80 players.\nRelated achievements.\nHard mode.\nThe following achievements are for the encounter's hard mode:\nQuotes.\nMortals, I am indebted to you for freeing me from the terrible corruption that besets this place. Though I have not yet recovered fully, I can help you battle Yogg-Saron.\nI can grant you and your friends the Fury of the Storm, increasing your damage and maximum health. Should you be face with evil so malevolent that it cannot be destroyed, I can channel all my power into a final Titanic Storm that will destroy even Immortals.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Thorim\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Thorim&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

On the cliffs overlooking the region called the &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, in the far north of the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood have established a base of operations, &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Point\"&gt;Thorium Point&lt;/a&gt;. From here, they keep a close eye on the Dark Iron dwarves' activities in the Searing Gorge and beyond. Adventurers seeking out Thorium Point will find that the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood hold great rewards for those who aid them in their never ending struggle against their former brethren.\nThe Thorium Brotherhood comprises many exceptionally talented craftsmen, and the blacksmiths of the Brotherhood are rumored to be among the finest Azeroth has ever seen. They possess the knowledge required to make the arms and armaments of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Lord\"&gt;Fire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, but lack the manpower to obtain the materials required for the crafting. It is rumored that one member of the Thorium Brotherhood has been empowered to trade the dwarves' fabled recipes and plans with those who can prove their loyalty to the Brotherhood. Of course, proving one's loyalty at some point may include venturing to the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of Ragnaros, the Fire Lord himself, to supply the dwarves with the rare raw materials found there. A daunting task, no doubt, but gaining access to the Thorium Brotherhood's secrets should prove to be a reward well worth the effort.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nSummary.\nThe Thorium Brotherhood are an elite group of craftsmen who can reveal a number of &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; recipes if you gain enough faction &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with them. They are former &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who have left &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; to explore (exploit) the world. All players start off at Neutral (0) reputation with them.\nThere are recipes for &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, as well as each specialization of &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the recipes requires some components from the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. A minor &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; recipe, , which is useful for raids that frequently visit the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, is available as well.\nReputation.\nAs of Cataclysm, gaining reputation with the Thorium Brotherhood has become much easier.\nReputation guide.\nFully.\nGather up any of the required crafting mats for &lt;a href=\"Lokhtos%20Darkbargainer\"&gt;Lokhtos Darkbargainer&lt;/a&gt;'s repeatable quests at the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.

In terms of pure reputation gain, doing the quest is not worth it as you would be using a rare raid drop item, and it could possibly take weeks of runs for a character to get another. If however you plan to learn the recipe or sell it on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;, the rep just may be a nice bonus you can take into account for your reputation gains.\nImportant NPCs.\nLokhtos Darkbargainer.\n&lt;a href=\"Lokhtos%20Darkbargainer\"&gt;Lokhtos Darkbargainer&lt;/a&gt; is found in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; bar. Turning in different items to him rewards reputation with the Brotherhood.\nAt each new reputation level, Lokhtos offers a new set of recipes. These recipes require some combination of the same items that give reputation rewards.\nOf the gifts, Dark Iron Ore can be mined in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; (After patch 1.7 Dark Iron Ore used to occasionally appear in the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. However, as of the launch of Cataclysm, Dark Iron Ore no longer spawns outside of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.) The Blood of the Mountain is a rare gem from the same veins. Fiery Cores and Lava Cores drop in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. Core Leather can be skinned from &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt; in the Molten Core and. These require &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt; of 310 or 315 respectively. Prior to the Burning Crusade expansion, skinning of over 300 required &lt;a href=\"Pip%27s%20Skinner\"&gt;Pip's Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, a dagger which drops in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast\"&gt;The Beast&lt;/a&gt; (prior to Cataclysm, another option was the , a sword which dropped in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; from High Priest Thekal, the Tiger Aspect. It is no longer available to players, now that Zul'Gurub has been converted to a level 85 heroic dungeon). Having the +5 skinning enchant on gloves helps reduce failed chances on core hounds or is required for skinning &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt; if you do not have both skinning knives or the Burning Crusade expansion.\nIt was recommended that you do the Thorium Point quests first to get to Honored and then the Imperial Plate Armor quests to get partway to Revered before starting the turnins to Lokhtos.\nMalyfous Darkhammer.\n&lt;a href=\"Malyfous%20Darkhammer\"&gt;Malyfous Darkhammer&lt;/a&gt; is another member of the Brotherhood, found in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe gives the quest &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Plate%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Fiery Plate Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't known whether more quests with him are unlocked with higher reputation level, but neither of these quests give Thorium Brotherhood faction &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;.\nDamek Bloombeard.\n&lt;a href=\"Damek%20Bloombeard\"&gt;Damek Bloombeard&lt;/a&gt; is a member who can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; where he and his partner &lt;a href=\"Ricket\"&gt;Ricket&lt;/a&gt; are supporting the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Ragnaros. He becomes available to players upon completing the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Druids of the Talon (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;The Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; offered by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. To access Bloombeard's wares you'll also have to complete &lt;a href=\"Additional%20Armaments\"&gt;Additional Armaments&lt;/a&gt; offered by Bloombeard himself. All three quests require 425x &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Mark of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt; combined, which will take a few weeks to acquire. Bloombeard's wares include armor and blueprints for Blacksmithing and Engineering.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nThe Thorium Brotherhood predates the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, it was merely one of the numerous craft guilds operating in Ironforge. Though skilled craftsmen, the members of the Brotherhood were always worried that another guild possessed secrets that they didn\u2019t. The Brotherhood would often acquire a competitor\u2019s goods, and try to reverse-engineer them. It was thus that they discovered the secrets of enchantment \u2014 absorbing the magic from an item as you destroy it, and channeling that magic into a new item.\nDuring the War of the Three Hammers, the Thorium Brotherhood naturally sided with the Dark Iron clan. When Ragnaros enslaved the Dark Irons, the Firelord sent what remained of the Thorium Brotherhood to work his forges along with many of their kin.\nWhile most Dark Iron dwarves were resigned to enslavement (after all, they were still doing what they were doing before, and now they had a powerful patron), not so the Thorium Brotherhood. To the members of this guild, their great talents were being wasted mass-producing weapons for the Firelord\u2019s armies. Thus, Oilfist (former apprentice to Overseer &lt;a href=\"Lokhtos%20Darkbargainer\"&gt;Lokhtos Darkbargainer&lt;/a&gt;) devised a plan of escape. With their knowledge of enchanting and their access to the forges, the dwarves crafted, under the noses of their taskmasters, weapons, armor and tools that allowed them to escape Blackrock Depths.\nEvery free Dark Iron dwarf got as far away from Blackrock Spire as they could. The Thorium Brotherhood would have as well, except that the formulas they possessed all required components found only under or around Blackrock Mountain. Thus, they were compelled to set up shop across the Searing Gorge from their former home. Using the formulas they have created or acquired, they make enchanted weapons and armor for anyone who can meet their exorbitant prices.\nRelationships.\nThe dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood are skilled craftsmen with access to unique enchantments, and people from all affiliations come to buy their wares. The Brotherhood has no qualms about dealing with anyone who can meet their prices, going even so far as to arm both sides of the same conflict. However, just because the Thorium Brotherhood trades with anyone doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re friendly. If the Brotherhood decides that you\u2019re competition, there\u2019s no trick to which they won\u2019t stoop to maintain their market share.\nOrganization.\nThe leader of the Thorium Brotherhood is called the overseer. Other members of the guild are ranked as apprentices, journeymen, and master smiths as befits their skill. Members within each rank are nominally equal and all members are expected to contribute both in the workshops and in defense of Thorium Point.\nMilitary.\nAs a craft guild the Thorium Brotherhood has no need for a permanent military arm. On the other hand the Searing Gorge is a dangerous region and the Brotherhood is well aware of the threat presented by wild beasts, elementals and even their fellow Dark Iron dwarves. All members of the guild are required to spend at least some time on the walls as lookouts. The skill-based ranking system of the guild extends even into defense of Thorium Point. Master smiths serve as watch commanders, while journeymen and apprentices do the actual patrolling of the walls.\nNearly all members of the Thorium Brotherhood start as experts, rogues or warriors. In order to rise above the level of apprentice, a guild member must have at least one level in the martial enchanter prestige class (see Chapter 2: Class Options). Dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood maximize their ranks in one or more Craft skills, usually armor- or weaponsmithing. Though their focus is on making arms, members of the Thorium Brotherhood are no slouches when it comes to using them, either. Naturally, they have many quality weapons and armors on hand.\nIf the Thorium Brotherhood has need of additional troops \u2014 especially for missions outside their holdings \u2014 their solution is the same as for any other problem: They contract out. Like suppliers, most of these mercenaries work for fi nished goods rather than cash; indeed, many of them have previous experience as suppliers for the Brotherhood. Generally these missions are defensive in nature \u2014 culling a herd of salamanders in the Searing Gorge or routing bandits who interfere with trade. On occasion, though, these dwarves reveal their vindictive streaks and hire mercenaries to strike against their \u201ccompetitors\u201d through sabotage and even slaughter. At the moment this enmity is focused on the Dark Iron dwarves still in Blackrock Depths; but as their operations expand the Thorium Brotherhood is likely to find new competitors to torment, and this might bring their mercenaries in conflict with the heroes. The Brotherhood\u2019s use of mercenaries allows them to distance themselves from such underhanded tactics, and victims may have a hard time linking the Brotherhood to these attacks.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Hansel%20Heavyhands\"&gt;Hansel Heavyhands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burrian%20Coalpart\"&gt;Burrian Coalpart&lt;/a&gt; are seen helping the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on . It may indicate that some of the members or perhaps the whole Brotherhood joined the new dwarven government of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their appearance allows them to easily hide and engage in their favorite pastime \u2013 playing tricks on others for inscrutable reasons. Many forest sprites' pranks \u2013 disguising themselves as stools to trip people, or throwing fruit and nuts at wanderers \u2013 seem harmless. Mountain spirits' means of interaction tend to have a higher incidence of violence and death, involving rockslides and falls off cliffs.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, forest sprites were under the care of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and helped the demigod whisker &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; away from &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt;'s night elves.\nSprites are prevalent on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Rumor has it that more deadly, unique varieties of sprites have emerged in &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;-tainted areas. If sprites' behavior is simply a reflection of the environments that surround them, any such creatures must be monumentally dangerous.\nPlant-like sprites are really just living plants and will resprout later if killed. The needles of the needle sprites that dwell in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; can be used in a special acupuncture technique to purge poison.\nSprites shroud themselves in illusion to avoid detection. It is a little-known secret that the dust sprites use for their various tricks have restorative properties.\nWhile fascinated by flowers, the &lt;a href=\"Dandelion%20Frolicker\"&gt;dandelion frolicker&lt;/a&gt; has also been known to dance with blades of grass and the occasional weed."}

The most notable master of &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; would be &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Spymaster Shaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nSpymasters (or spymistresses) are a rare group of &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, masters of disguise. Like the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"infiltrator\"&gt;infiltrator&lt;/a&gt;s, in which the skills and knowledge were originally gained from by torture, a spymaster's main purpose is to charm and manipulate their way into the enemy's trust. However, the Horde's spymasters serve a much more insidious purpose; they are both parts spy and assassin. As a spymaster learns their craft, they learn several useful abilities. They gain insight into the sentient mind, learning how people act and instinctively reacting via a crude, learned form of telepathy. This ability extends into battle; a spymaster learns to feel the ebbs of their opponents' thoughts and to react before they do. A spymaster can extend their telepathy to their stealth, clouding the minds of those around them and rendering themself momentarily invisible. A spymaster also learns that the body is just as malleable as the mind: The ultimate goal of the spymaster is to become so good at disguises that they can physically alter their body into anyone she wishes.\nA spymaster's instincts and intelligence are so honed that she can judge the angle and thrust of an incoming blow sufficiently to deflect or otherwise avoid the attack. The spymaster filters information constantly and remembers everything. Through regular contacts, gossip, crystal ball chats, and other situations, he has a deep knowledge of everyday things. The spymaster fits in with whatever group she chooses to associate with, and can successfully emulate any affiliation, whether it be Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever.\nSpymasters in the world.\nThe Horde is the only faction with the knowledge of how to become a spymaster. Most spymasters are &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;: races already familiar with how humans think and act. Most other races of the Horde are not quite as disciplined or diplomatic enough to learn the arts of disguise and telepathy. Occasionally, an orc or troll proves smart and charismatic enough to become a spymaster.\nA spymaster's style tends toward the flamboyant, and they are often vain. A spymaster is never content with their normal self, and constantly adjusts to fit their idea of the perfect creature. Spymasters rarely work with other characters, preferring to be by themselves, in part due to their knowledge of what everyone else is thinking. They also tend to be overconfident in their abilities, walking with a certain swagger, and leap at any challenging job just to prove they can do it.\nThe Horde uses spymasters for most undercover jobs, where chicanery is more important than force. Unlike Alliance infiltrators, however, a spymaster is more often an assassin as well. A common use of a spymaster is to have the agent slip in unnoticed and replace a servant or bodyguard, assuming the murdered victim's role until they can get close enough to kill their targets. Occasionally, a spymaster assumes the role of an assassinated noble, using the victim's wealth and influence to wreak havoc. It isn't unheard of to discover a prized counselor has all along been an agent of the Horde in disguise. Uncovering the spymaster often is even more damaging than leaving the false agent in power, as it shatters the confidence of citizens and creates suspicion among best friends. Who else may be an agent in disguise?\nMost spymasters hail from the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; class, though many come from the &lt;a href=\"expert\"&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; class. Any person who shows intelligence and cunning attracts the interest of a spymaster. Spymasters frown on crude, muscle-bound types, and thus rarely get along with &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Most spymasters are indifferent to divine casters, as many are strict atheists. They constantly see into the hearts of others, and doubt that any divine creator would honor such petty creatures. Spymasters enjoy the power and abilities of arcanists, since their powers originated with arcane magic."}

The first part required is the &lt;a href=\"Smashed%20Portal%20Generator\"&gt;Smashed Portal Generator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Netherwalker\"&gt;Immortal Netherwalker&lt;/a&gt;s. This is a drop rate of 10% for non-quest elite versions, and about 3% from &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt; regular versions. This can be a grind, and the other parts will not drop if you don't have it in your inventory.\nOnce you have the portal generator, the &lt;a href=\"Conductive%20Sheath\"&gt;Conductive Sheath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arc%20Circuit\"&gt;Arc Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Cell%20%28Vishax%29\"&gt;Power Cell (Vishax)&lt;/a&gt; will quickly drop from &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20War-Mind\"&gt;Eredar War-Mind&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Felsworn%20Myrmidon\"&gt;Felsworn Myrmidon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCombining them creates &lt;a href=\"Vishax%27s%20Portal%20Generator\"&gt;Vishax's Portal Generator&lt;/a&gt; which starts &lt;a href=\"Commander%20on%20Deck%21\"&gt;Commander on Deck!&lt;/a&gt;. This will direct you to the south end of the Terminus boarding ramp, where the inactive Vishax's Portal is located.\nNote that when you go through, this \"will\" automatically start his encounter, so don't go through without a plan (i.e. a group, &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20Warframe%20Activator\"&gt;Lightforged Warframe Activator&lt;/a&gt;, ect.). If you've gone through by mistake, before you get hit by any attacks quickly use the gantry portal to leave."}

Of the four random summonable bosses for the Dungeon 2 upgrade questline, she is arguably the easiest to take down.\nIsalien was once a member of the mercenary-company &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt;. After she and her fellow mercenaries failed at assassinating &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, she abandoned the company and traveled in pilgrimage to Dire Maul. There, she sought both to learn more about her elven heritage and to find a usage for her piece of Lord Valthalak's amulet, which she had received as share of the loot after the failed assassination. Within Dire Maul she was however ambushed by the forces of Alzzin the Wildshaper, and was killed. Now her ghost is haunting the hall of which Alzzin the Wildshaper resides in. Players may summon her by using a &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Brazier of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Invocation\"&gt;Brazier of Invocation&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was a good friend of &lt;a href=\"Falrin%20Treeshaper\"&gt;Falrin Treeshaper&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nIsalien will summon a fairly strong pet (&lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;) about 10 seconds into the fight. When she does, everyone but the MT should concentrate on it until dead.\nHer skills include:\nHer primary damage is spell damage. She can be disarmed, and should be when possible. But the key to defeating this encounter is to interrupt her heal spells, but it is possible to drain her mana through the various abilities different classes have, or to simply force her to heal herself. Once you kill the pet and learn to time the heal interrupts, she goes down easily.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s use &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you always have the energy for &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompared to &lt;a href=\"Kormok\"&gt;Kormok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, this boss is a joke. I was quite disappointed after struggling with Kormok.\nImmunities.\nShe is immune to:\nAlternative Tactics.\nDraining Mana does work, but prepare for a long battle if you do, she has about 32k of mana. However, she doesn't hit very hard, so if you take out the add first, you can afford to sit there with a good tank and healer and just wait until her mana is gone. We did her with a Warrior, Resto Druid, Mage and two Warlocks and the two Warlocks drain was enough. Once her mana is gone, she is simple enough to defeat.\nIt is possible to drain her mana simply by forcing her to heal herself. We went there in group of: - Rogue 60 - Priest 60 - Mage 60 - Druid 60 - Warlock 51. We started a fight and we killed her pet right after she spawned him then we went on her. Rogue kept aggro by dealing damage and the mages did too. Fight lasted around 20 mins. Priest used couple of major mana potions and used innervate. Rogue used couple of major healing potions. Anyway it wasn't hard, just long.\nWe brought 2 warlocks to use the mana drain tactics above, but in fact we didn't need to drain her mana away, as the felhunter's interrupt and the warrior's bash were enough to prevent her from healing. Warrior 60 - Druid 60 - Priest 59 - Warlock 60 - Warlock 54, it was a \"green and blue\" group and she went down first try without the need of consumables in a relatively short fight (like 3 minutes i'd say). Key is: don't let her heal and manage healer's mana."}

The maps for the expeditions will be provided by the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, who have developed a new technology to find which islands may contain Azerite. Ships to the islands will depart from faction hubs.\nIsland Expeditions unlock through the &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign\"&gt;War Campaign&lt;/a&gt; account-wide. One can then do Island Expeditions on alts as they level.\nDescription.\n\"Set sail for the previously unmapped &lt;a href=\"isle\"&gt;isle&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

They can be played in four different modes, Normal, Heroic, Mythic, and PvP. The goal is for three players to collect Azerite and mystery treasures faster than an opposing team. Combat may ensue should the teams meet, and the island map adds &lt;a href=\"Fog%20of%20War\"&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; to conseal opponents' actions.\nEach island has four possible starting points, and computer opponents use a tailored AI for this gameplay. NPCs on the island are randomized so the context can change entirely each time one visits an island. One time it might be populated with plundering ghost pirates, and next time with conquering mogu. There could be a thousand possible scenarios with the available islands and the possible mix of \"puzzle\" like a mix of mobs.\nIslands.\nThere are 11 islands in rotation, with 3 available each week.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Uncharted%20Island\"&gt;Uncharted Island&lt;/a&gt; is visited as a tutorial scenario for Island Expeditions.\nIsland features.\nEach time an Island Expedition is queued up, the island has different features. A list of features as seen below:\nIsland denizens.\nThis is an incomplete list of creatures and islands where they can be encountered on:\nExplorers.\nExplorers that can be found on Island Expeditions are listed below:\nAdvanced NPC opponents.\nIn three difficulties Normal, Heroic, Mythic the 3 person player group faces off against a team of 3 Advanced NPC opponents from the opposite faction in a race who can gather more Azerite to reach the required amount of Azerite for victory.\nThe Advanced NPC groups seem to be mirrored between the Alliance and Horde, with a pirate group on each side, gnomes on one side and goblins on the other, Horde pyromancers against Alliance cryomancers, so on.\nAll of them can be seen resting at &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of them can be seen resting in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nObtaining rewards through an Island Expedition is based on the themes provided with the creatures and invasions that occur during an expedition. For example, &lt;a href=\"Squawks\"&gt;Squawks&lt;/a&gt; is a mount reward from a pirate-themed expedition. If the player encounters some pirate-themed rare creatures and kills them, pirate-themed items such as Squawks may show up in the loot window when the expedition has been completed. Another example would be the &lt;a href=\"Plundered%20Blade%20of%20Northern%20Kings\"&gt;Plundered Blade of Northern Kings&lt;/a&gt;, which is only available from encountering and killing &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;-themed creatures in an expedition which provides a chance for this two-handed sword or other &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;-themed items to be awarded at the end of the expedition.\nFocusing on special enemies, such as themed creatures and rare-quality &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, is believed to improve the odds of being rewarded special loot. Regardless, it still comes down to the on if anyone in the group manages to loot items related to the creatures that were killed."}

Similar to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the main objective of the battleground is the defeat of the opposing general, but to achieve this players will have to fight for control of workshops and docks, destroy enemy defenses with siege engines and demolishers, and sky-dive behind enemy lines from massive airships. Players can queue for Isle of Conquest from level 75.\nThe isle is of immense strategic value due to containing &lt;a href=\"Shipyard\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cobalt\"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gold%20mine\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Oil%20platform\"&gt;derrick&lt;/a&gt;, a siege &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; and a fully equipped &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; hangar.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces are locked in an epic struggle for a tiny island rich in resources. Known as the Isle of Conquest, this rocky battleground's proximity to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; makes it a highly prized base in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions have deployed devastating weapons to drive each other from this strategic location. Day and night the ground trembles under lumbering siege vehicles while monstrous airships pummel enemy positions with fiery cannons. The bloody conflict spreads to every corner of the island as new heroes arrive to aid their factions. It remains to be seen whose banner will wave triumphantly over the Isle of Conquest and at what cost victory will be achieved.\"\nDescription.\n\"The Isle of Conquest is a point of strategic importance for the Alliance and Horde campaigns in Northrend, each side determined to secure control of the island. As a large-scale battleground, each side attempts to wrest control of the Siege Factory, Docks, or Hangar in order to secure access to the enemy stronghold and defeat its general (&lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Agmar\"&gt;Overlord Agmar&lt;/a&gt;).\"\nOverview.\nPrimary objectives.\nThis battleground can be won either by defeating the opposing general or through attrition (loss of reinforcements), similar to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecondary objectives.\nThere are 3 capturable locations that provide vehicles capable of inflicting great damage on players and keep gates or allow players to bypass keep walls entirely. Getting in the courtyard of the enemy's keep allows players to use the enemies' own bombs to destroy keep walls, and kill enemy players utilizing the keep cannons against your forces. Capture of an objective is a simple channeled, interruptable effect.\nTertiary objectives.\nThere are 2 additional capturable locations, each of which provide passive and stacking benefits to the side that holds it. Capture of an objective is a simple channeled, interruptable effect.\nActivities.\nAt each location, there are things that can be done to benefit one's side.\nGlaive Throwers.\n&lt;a href=\"Glaive%20Thrower%20%28Isle%20of%20Conquest%29\"&gt;Glaive Throwers&lt;/a&gt; in the Isle of Conquest are largely anti-personnel weapons. They only have a driver's seat. They have two attacks available: a direct (single target) attack that does a fair amount of damage, and a channeled area effect burst. \nWhile their direct attack can be used against individual targets (at range) or against keep gates, it is their area effect attack that provides their signature benefit. Their range combined with their area effect attack make them highly suited to clearing the keep towers of defenders, or for causing havoc among clusters of combatants. Like most siege engines, they are much less maneuverable than individual players and are susceptible to close-in assaults.\nDemolishers.\nSoon after capturing the Workshop, four &lt;a href=\"Demolisher%20%28Isle%20of%20Conquest%29\"&gt;demolishers&lt;/a&gt; spawn. These siege engines operate much like the &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20Demolisher\"&gt;Wintergrasp Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;, in that they have a fireball (fiery boulder) ranged attack, and a 'melee' ram attack. Additionally, they have room for two passengers, who are protected by the Demolisher and may attack but have no vehicle-granted abilities.\nBoth of the Demolisher's attacks do siege damage, with the ram doing about 30% more than the boulder. The hurled boulder, though, has the advantages of range and does damage in a 10-yard radius. It is highly suited to most offensive roles but is most often seen doing siege damage to the enemy keep's gates.\nSiege Engines.\nAfter holding the workshop for 3 minutes, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engine%20%28Isle%20of%20Conquest%29\"&gt;Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt; will be repaired. (If destroyed, a new one will spawn in 3 more minutes.) The Isle of Conquest Siege Engine has the most active positions of any current World of Warcraft siege vehicle:\nThe siege engine can do massive siege damage if it can get into range of the target. However, it can also be overwhelmed if swarmed by defenders, particularly those able to deal damage at range. It may excel at defense, though, with numerous AoE attacks and no pesky tower guns striking it.\nSeaforium Bombs.\n&lt;a href=\"Seaforium%20Bombs\"&gt;Seaforium Bombs&lt;/a&gt; are used exclusively to cause damage to the opposing keep's gates. A player may carry only one at a time. As in &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, these devices must be placed (a short channeled effect), then defended until they detonate (10 seconds later). Enemies may disarm bombs that have been placed, again, by a channeled effect.\nOnce placed, the bomb disappears from inventory and a new one must be acquired. The bomb is also dropped upon death.\nThree achievements involve bombs in this battleground. The Seaforium Bombs and the &lt;a href=\"Huge%20Seaforium%20Bombs\"&gt;Huge Seaforium Bombs&lt;/a&gt; (see below) are considered separately for the respective achievements.\nAirship cannon.\nThere are several Airship cannons mounted on the airship. These cannons do AoE damage both to players and gates. While the strength of the guns is not great, it does damage comparable to the hurled boulder of the demolishers without the vulnerability of that siege engine. While the airship is not always within range of the enemy keep, there are usually enough targets available to keep the operator busy.\nParatroops.\nAll people on the airship are granted the parachute ability. The parachute deploys once you leap off the airship, and lasts until you land... on something. With only modest amounts of practice, one can parachute into the opposing keep's courtyard without waiting for the gates to fall.\nYou are also able to cast and attack players as you are falling down.\nKeep gates.\nEach of the keeps has three gates. The defenders have portals at each gate allowing travel to the other side. The attackers must do siege damage to destroy these gates in order to gain admission to the keep. (Other means exist: The airship, and the catapults.)\nKeep tower guns.\nEach keep has two towers, one on either forward corner of the keep. Each tower has three easily accessible guns.\nEach tower gun has two powers: Rocket Blast, which deals a hefty whack to everything within 8 yards of the target location. And Incendiary Rocket, which has a smaller area, but deals damage over a period of 15 seconds with a 30 second cooldown.\nKeep tower guns are useful against both attacking siege engines and attacking players. They are, though, subject to attack themselves. When destroyed, players can repair them through a fairly short channeled effort. Note that enterprising players may land on the keep towers and attack the guns directly, much to the distress of the gunners.\nHuge Seaforium Bombs.\nMuch like the Seaforium Bombs from the Workshop, ... but larger, and closer to the gates. Like those other bombs, they can be planted, and will do siege damage to the gate unless they are disarmed. You use them against your enemy's gates from the inside, or disarm the ones the enemy tries using against you.\nPolitics.\nThe Isle of Conquest is a point of strategic importance for the Alliance and Horde campaigns in Northrend. Serving as an ideal staging ground for operations in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, each side is determined to secure control of the island. With the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; locked in deadly combat, both factions have issued a call to arms in hopes of tipping the scales in their favor and defeating the opposing general.\nThe ongoing struggle between &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has turned many once peaceful (and some not-so peaceful) places into theaters of constant war. The Isle of Conquest is the latest such place, set to be the location of a battle of epic proportions over the island's precious resources. \nAn &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Agmar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Horde General&lt;/a&gt; are fighting for dominance, overseeing the action from the safety of their keeps. Whichever side manages to eliminate the enemy general first will triumph on the island; failure to protect your leader will bring shame, dishonor, and defeat. There is no peace accord here, and it's an all-out war between the factions. \nThe Isle's specific location is of Northwest of Sholazar Basin and West of Onslaught Harbour, you can see both barely with your view distance maxed out on the respective sides of the island."}

It was the home to many level 60-62 elite &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s referred to as \"chimaerok\". The chimaeras, along with technically the whole isle, were a part of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest%20chain\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt; which opened the gates of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe chimaeras on the isle consisted of thee types, plus their leader.\nThe three lesser chimaeras dropped &lt;a href=\"Chimaerok%20Tenderloin\"&gt;Chimaerok Tenderloin&lt;/a&gt;s which was a quest-objective in &lt;a href=\"The%20Isle%20of%20Dread%21\"&gt;The Isle of Dread!&lt;/a&gt;.

The carcass was eventually turned into a &lt;a href=\"500%20Pound%20Chicken\"&gt;500 Pound Chicken&lt;/a&gt; which was gobbled up by the gnome wizard .\nThe isle was also the home to a group of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; who dwelled in a cave at the northern end. They were led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Shalzaru\"&gt;Lord Shalzaru&lt;/a&gt;, whom players were asked to kill as a quest for the former &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. The cave itself seems to have been completely unique in design and went quite deep. There was a secret underwater passageway that lead into an inner chamber, although it had no apparent special uses besides being the location in which &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Szallah\"&gt;Lady Szallah&lt;/a&gt; resided. The only entrance to the central valley was in the southeastern part of the island, from all other sides the central valley was inaccessible due to unyielding cliffs.\nCataclysm.\nIn \"\", the Isle of Dread was sunk by the tidal waves unleashed by the worldwide &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Since the chimaeras living on the isle haven't been seen anywhere else after it was sunk, they were presumably all killed before they could make their escape. The only remaining Chimaerok is &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Lakma\"&gt;Prince Lakma&lt;/a&gt;, a rare mob found in the mountain range between Silithus and Feralas, who bears the title &lt;The Last Chimaerok&gt;. He is likely the son of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lakmaeran\"&gt;Lord Lakmaeran&lt;/a&gt;. The questline was also removed. The nearby Feathermoon Stronghold was damaged and abandoned as well, and a &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;new Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; was built on the mainland of Feralas. The cave where Shalzaru resided also collapsed.\nThe underwater remains of the north end of the island are in Feralas' &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; range, except for a small mountain range cutting the north edge off from the rest of the island. The occasional &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Crawl%20Snapclaw\"&gt;Coast Crawl Snapclaw&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Crawl%20Deepseer\"&gt;Coast Crawl Deepseer&lt;/a&gt;s can be found here. The whole island except for the northern edge has been stripped clean of everything.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", the Isle of Dread is a custom map designed for maximum 3 players. The tileset is called \"Barrens\".\nIn the RPG.\nOff the coast of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; there are two large islands, one being the Isle of Dread. Directly south of &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;, across a narrow channel, lies this place, home to ancient ruins from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; studied them until recently, when &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest%20tribe\"&gt;Hatecrest tribe&lt;/a&gt; showed up and moved in. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; is sure the Hatecrest is up to no good.

In the aftermath of the battle, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and a raid of volunteers attacked the isle, fighting off both the Scourge and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; in order to destroy the tainted Sunwell. \nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nAfter the merciless campaign of Arthas, the essence of the Sunwell &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;endured&lt;/a&gt;, kept hidden by a mysterious mage known as Borel. Some time after the fall of Quel'Thalas, Dar'Khan returned, along with a human girl Anveena. The blood elves guarded the isle to some capacity, as Dar'Khan's presence was soon discovered. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; immediately led a group of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to the site of the Sunwell and faced Dar'Khan. The traitor raised undead elves and sent them against the living ones, forcing the Farstriders to retreat. Soon, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his group also approached the ruined isle and encountered a &lt;a href=\"felhunter\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; also happened to be there as well as a Borel, later revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; who originally created Anveena when the Sunwell was first destroyed. They all teamed up against Dar'Khan, and when he was about to subdue Anveena's power, she instead used the power to defeat the traitor. The blood elven leadership then vowed to protect Anveena, keeping her safe for several years, along with Kalec.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nKael'thas Sunstrider, former leader of the blood elves, eventually revealed himself as the Legion's formidable new ally. Despite furious opposition from his own people, Kael'thas persisted in his efforts, believing that he would obtain infinite power.\nNearly six years after its destruction, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; has been reactivated by the power-mad Kael'thas and his demonic allies and is being used as a mystic portal to summon his master, the eredar overlord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the Dead Scar, near the still-shattered structures at its edge, eredar warlocks and wrathguard stand vigilant, and even some remnants of the Scourge's forces remain. The blood elven forces still loyal to Kael'thas make their final stand on the isle in defense of their prince, as the time of reckoning for all of the sin'dorei draws near. The prince has also brought his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; allies with him, along with &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; and other creatures willing to fight for him.\nWhen Kael's forces seized the isle, the &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker\"&gt;Spellbreakers&lt;/a&gt;, whose headquarters was located on Quel'Danas, were overwhelmed. However, some survived the attack.\nIn response to the threat presented by Prince Kael'thas' operations on the Sunwell Isle, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 masters of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 rallied the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; priests of the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and the blood elf magisters of the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; into a unified army, and dispatched them to Azeroth to end Kael'thas' nefarious scheme. This army, known as the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; and begins to retake the island from Kael'thas' legions. The Shattered Sun gradually reclaimed much of the isle and branched out to tackle more of its threats, and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in defeating Kael'thas within &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; and storming the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, Kael'thas was slain and Kil'jaeden was defeated and banished back through his would-be portal. This was a huge victory for the blood elf and draenei soldiers, and all who opposed the Legion's Burning Crusade. The Sunwell was restored in the battle's aftermath by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, now not only a fount of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power but holy &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; as well. After some of its darkest days, and with some unlikely aid, the Sunwell's rebirth and the victories on Quel'Danas have inspired all of Quel'Thalas to forge a brighter future.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; quest chain, we are given a brief insight into the current status of the isle. &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Builder\"&gt;Silvermoon Builder&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen repairing various locations on the island, and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; is seen inspecting the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20of%20the%20Sunwell\"&gt;Blood Elven guards&lt;/a&gt; protecting the renewed Sunwell. Quel'Danas seems to have been completely reclaimed, and all &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; mobs including the &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; Blood Elves have been phased out. Blood elf and draenei remnants of the Shattered Sun can still be found on the isle, watching over the builders.\nWith Quel'Delar in tow, heroes are tasked with gaining entry to the Sunwell and submerging the ancient blade within its holy power.\nAccess to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; itself is policed by the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and only those with his personal permission are allowed entry.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Isle was attacked by &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Maag%20the%20Ravenous\"&gt;Maag the Ravenous&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were killed by the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; champions of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; who traveled here in order to get the &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;pure Light&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrial of Style.\nThe blood elves have teamed up with the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; transmogrifiers to put on a grand Azerothian fashion tournament. Players compete against four others to determine who is the best dresser. The event is held in the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20Chamber\"&gt;assembly chamber&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisit to the Sunwell.\nThe Sunwell was visited by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The visit was intended as a gesture of goodwill for the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; leaders and courtesy for Alleria; while the latter was estranged from Silvermoon's political climate, Lor'themar would not deny a daughter of Quel'Thalas' request to see their people's most sacred site. Alleria's presence attracts a group of &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; creatures, who spill into the plateau at &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;'s command and begin spreading their corruption. The heroes, along with the Sunwell's magi, wardens, and spellbreakers, sortied to battle the void beasts and prevent the Sunwell's corruption. A powerful void horror, &lt;a href=\"Aruun%20the%20Darkener\"&gt;Aruun the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;, then emerged in an attempt to contaminate the well directly but was stopped and killed. Finally, a rift portal was opened directly above the Sunwell's waters, but Rommath, Thalyssra, and Alleria combined their magics to close it before catastrophe struck. In the aftermath of the battle, Alleria was exiled by Lor'themar, on the grounds that her very presence poses a threat to Quel'Thalas and the Sunwell. The battle's outcome also endeared the regent to Thalyssra, who pledged &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;her kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs part of a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;ceremony of remembrance&lt;/a&gt; held each year in the kingdom, a blood elf &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, traveled through Eversong to Quel'Danas bearing a lantern imbued with the light of the Sunwell, used to reenact the sacrifices made during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. On the isle, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; gives commentary on what it means to be sin'dorei, and the adventurer witnesses the final battle of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the last king of Quel'Thalas. The ceremony continues with the Sunwell Plateau, before concluding in Silvermoon.\nGeography.\nTravel hubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, the primary staging area for the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, is the primary travel hub to and from the island. This flight node is available to all level 70 players.\nGetting there.\nPlayers cannot reach the Isle by riding or walking, due to an invisible barrier that lies some distance north of Silvermoon City. The most common means of access are via flight path, portal, or various summoning spells.\nThe flight path to the zone from Ironforge, Hatchet Hills, Light's Hope, and Silvermoon City is learned automatically at level 65. After a certain phase of reclaiming the island (as indicated by the number of completed daily quests), a portal will be opened between Quel'Danas and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, allowing easy transport to the island. The portal from Shattrath to Quel'Danas is located in the alcove behind where &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Nasuun\"&gt;Exarch Nasuun&lt;/a&gt; stands and drops off the player in the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Complete the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Know%20Your%20Ley%20Lines\"&gt;Know Your Ley Lines&lt;/a&gt; to collect an item that allows a one-time-use teleport back to Shattrath.\nThe Alliance flight path from Ironforge to the Isle of Quel'Danas is distinctive among flight paths in that once the gryphon flies past the front gates of Ironforge the gryphon and rider are instantly teleported to the edge of the Isle of Quel'Danas zone and then fly the rest of the way normally. This saves the rider from a very long flight.\nNotable characters.\nThe Isle of Quel'Danas is known primarily for its vendors. &lt;a href=\"Smith%20Hauthaa\"&gt;Smith Hauthaa&lt;/a&gt; is both the repair vendor and the vendor on the Isle located behind the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;Sun's Reach Armory&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Shaani\"&gt;Shaani&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; recipes and epic gems vendor located on the first floor of the Inn of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Hauthaa begins selling her wares late in the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; storyline, while Shaani doesn't start until the very end.\nAdditionally, the Exotic Gear Purveyors of the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;Sun's Reach Armory&lt;/a&gt; are notable for selling &lt;a href=\"Season%201\"&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Season%202\"&gt;Season 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%27s%20PvP%20rewards\"&gt;Vindicator's&lt;/a&gt; gear in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Tier%204\"&gt;Tier 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tier%205\"&gt;Tier 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tier%206\"&gt;Tier 6&lt;/a&gt; loot tokens, as well as &lt;a href=\"Veteran%27s%20PvP%20rewards\"&gt;Veteran's&lt;/a&gt; gear in exchange for Badges of Justice. &lt;a href=\"Karynna\"&gt;Karynna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olus\"&gt;Olus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soryn\"&gt;Soryn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kayri\"&gt;Kayri&lt;/a&gt; are all located on the second floor of the Armory, starting in &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive%23Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;phase 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nAll quests on the Isle of Quel'Danas are part of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; storyline. See the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive%23Quests\"&gt;SSO quests section&lt;/a&gt; for a formatted list, &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas%20quests\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas quests&lt;/a&gt; for the table style, or the unformatted list of all quests in the .\nMonsters.\nThere are three groups of monsters on the island \u2014 &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, naga, and finally &lt;a href=\"Kael\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt;'s blood elves. The &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; go by the name of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspine\"&gt;Darkspine&lt;/a&gt;, while the blood elves go under the name of &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkspine naga.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Greengill%20Coast\"&gt;Greengill Coast&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspine\"&gt;Darkspine&lt;/a&gt; naga have enslaved the Greengill murlocs, mind-controlling them to do their bidding.\nDemons.\nThere are a wide variety of demons located around the island, primarily guarding &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Village\"&gt;Dawnstar Village&lt;/a&gt;, with reinforcements being brought in via a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a number of demons at the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, holding the undead at bay. The demons and Kael's blood elves are attacking as a unified force.\nDawnstar Village:\nThe Dead Scar:\nUndead.\nThere are packs of undead which roam the southern coasts and the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, where they battle the demons.\nMechanical.\nMalfunctioning arcane guardians patrol the western coasts of the island.\nKael'thas blood elves.\nKael'thas forces are scattered throughout the island, primarily centered around &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, where they occupy the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several ships which are located a short distance from the shore. The invading forces also contain the &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt;, emaciated elves which have fallen to their magical addictions.\nPhasing.\nDuring part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Return%20of%20Quel%27Delar%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Return of Quel'Delar quest chain&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Journey%20To%20The%20Sunwell\"&gt;Journey To The Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Purification%20of%20Quel%27Delar\"&gt;The Purification of Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;), the entire isle undergoes heavy &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; to convey the recent developments there from the finale of \"The Burning Crusade\".\nVery few areas experience such heavy phasing, even if just for a short time.\nIn the RPG.\nQuel'Danas is also the island refuge of the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawks&lt;/a&gt;. It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;aeries&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"giant%20eagle\"&gt;giant eagle&lt;/a&gt;s originated and are bred for the elite &lt;a href=\"windrider\"&gt;windrider&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Aquel%27Luer%27Thala\"&gt;Aquel'Luer'Thala&lt;/a&gt; is the blood elf in charge of the units stationed on the island."}

Members of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; are facing off to lay claim to the isle before the other faction does. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt; are united in their singular drive to take down &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; at his seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, once and for all.\nThousands of years ago, the Isle of Thunder was known as the Thundering Mountain, home to the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;\"master\"&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Lei Shen defeated his own master and proclaimed himself the ruler of the mogu. He ruled &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; from this seat of power until his death. His mogu successors moved the capital to the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and the mountain was mostly abandoned. During the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; the mountain sank down beneath the waves, with only the peak staying above the sea as an island. Prior to Lei Shen's resurrection, most inhabitants of Pandaria believed the Isle of Thunder to be nothing more than a legend.\nDescription from official site.\nThe Isle of Thunder is a gargantuan zone for player characters of maximum level, and its storm-fraught shores are rife with conflict and opportunity. In patch 5.2, you'll advance the war effort on your server through quests relating to the island assault; as your faction progresses, one-time events will open up, allowing you to unlock and explore more of the island. You'll help your faction leaders claim a beachhead, assault the city walls, and forge a path to the front door of the Thunder King's palace. Once you've established a forward base, you'll be able to pick from different types of quests \u2013 PvP or PvE \u2013 to continue advancing the story.\nLoot is plentiful \u2013 we've added tons of new daily quests to the zone, with reward satchels that include tokens to summon killable bosses, and keys for the Treasure Room, a single-player loot-grabbing scenario. You'll also be able to unlock new reward areas throughout the island, including the Lightning Forge: once used by the ancient mogu to craft weapons of titanic power, now co-opted by your side's blacksmiths.\nGetting there.\nTo get to the Isle of Thunder, take a portal from the faction camps outside the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in west-central &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. The island is in its own instance and it is not possible to fly there. This portal does not show up if you are not at an appropriate stage."}

He stormed the Twilight's Hammer encampment just before the cultists completed their ritual and dealt with them with little difficulty. He then sent a message to the Kirin Tor to expect him in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; shortly with Light's Wrath.\nHowever, according to an untitled missive from the Kirin Tor's archives written by an unnamed author, Israen perished shortly afterwards, having inadvertently triggered an explosion of holy energy while casting a spell to lock the staff in a protective shield for transport to Dalaran. The author goes on to say that they knew that Israen's death would come as a shock, as he was always an attentive and calculating man who knew more about Light's Wrath than anyone else, but that perhaps that had made him careless. After Israen's death, the Kirin Tor took precautions to prevent anyone from repeating his mistake, with seven &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; sealing Light's Wrath in dampening runes before depositing it in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;."}

This is what the Silver Totem of Aquementas is for. The totem must be equipped in your off hand before you can use it. Once the fight begins, immediately use the totem on him. This will drop his aura long enough to get a few hits. His aura will only be down for a few seconds, so you will have to keep using the totem throughout the fight, about every 3 hits.\nBe careful of the Blast Wave, it not only does damage, but it will knock you back. If you keep getting hit with it, eventually you may end up in the pool of lava right outside the cave, which can be tough to get out of, especially when you keep getting hit with Blast Wave. One thing you can do to minimize the effects of the knockback is to fight Blaze Runner in his cave, with your back to rear and facing the entrance. This will keep you from going all over the place."}

It was the climax of Arthas' pursuit of the dreadlord in his quest for vengeance against Mal'Ganis' acts against the people of Lordaeron. It would see Arthas taking up the accursed runeblade, &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; at the expense of his &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;old tutor and friend&lt;/a&gt;'s life and drive his cold, hungry, and exhausted forces to certain death while using the cursed sword's power to vanquish Mal'Ganis' forces and eventually the dreadlord himself.\nWhile Arthas was in his search for the runeblade, the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Captains&lt;/a&gt; bravely defended the Alliance base.\nLoading screen.\n\"The next day, at Arthas' base camp...\"\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nFrostmourne.\n\"The only way to counter Mal'Ganis' power is to find the mysterious runeblade known as Frostmourne and bend its powers to your will.

He forced you to slay your countrymen and lead your troops into certain doom. Now, you must make him pay for every life he's brought to ruin.\"\nSurrounded.\nMuradin angrily confronts Arthas over his betrayal of the mercenaries and his lies to his men. Arthas coldly retorts that Muradin never saw what Mal'Ganis did to his homeland. Suddenly, the undead appear on all sides. Mal'Ganis calls out to Arthas and taunts him that the journey ends here with Arthas' doom. The Alliance troops rush to defend the base, however, both Arthas and Muradin realize that they are outnumbered and completely surrounded. Arthas asks Muradin to help him find the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. The sword's power might give them the edge they need to win this battle. Muradin, although hesitant, agrees. Arthas takes a small force of knights and riflemen with him, leaving the Captains behind to oversee the base's defenses. Arthas and his men enter a nearby &lt;a href=\"Way%20Gate%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;way gate&lt;/a&gt; which transports them to the vault of Frostmourne.\nClaiming Frostmourne.\nArthas and Muradin battle through a number of vicious creatures - both living and undead to reach the Frostmourne. Finally, they arrive at the entrance to Frostmourne's chamber, where they find a powerful undead &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and its minions blocking the way. The Guardian warns Arthas to turn back, but Arthas refuses and engages the Guardian in battle. After a long and difficult fight which leaves only Arthas and Muradin standing, the Guardian is defeated. In its dying moments, the Guardian again warns Arthas to turn back before it's too late. Arthas asks the Guardian if it's still trying to protect the sword. The Guardian gives an ominous reply: It is trying to protect \"him\" from the sword. Arthas ignores this warning and enters Frostmourne's chamber.\nArthas and Muradin approach Frostmourne which is held on a frozen pedestal. Arthas goes to claim the sword, but Muradin notices an inscription on the pedestal: \"Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit.\" Muradin realizes the sword is cursed, but Arthas replies that he would bear any curse to save his people. Muradin tries one last time to reason with Arthas, telling him to forget his quest and go home. Arthas, however, will let nothing stop him from getting his revenge on Mal'Ganis.\nArthas calls out to the spirits of the chamber and promises to pay any price if they will grant him the power to save his people. A sinister whisper answers and suddenly the pedestal explodes releasing Frostmourne. A piece of frozen shrapnel hits Muradin seemingly killing him. Arthas, completely unmoved by his friend's demise, tosses aside his paladin warhammer and picks up the blade.\nArthas's Vengeance.\nNow in possession of Frostmourne, Arthas returns to his base where the Captains is desperately trying to hold off the undead. Arthas rallies his remaining men and leads a counterattack against Mal'Ganis. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the Alliance forces storm Mal'Ganis's base and proceed to raze it building by building. Frostmourne proves to be an incredibly powerful weapon and Arthas single-handedly slays countless undead with it. Finally, Arthas stands victorious over the ruins of Mal'Ganis's base.\nMal'Ganis reveals himself to Arthas. The dreadlord compliments Arthas on claiming Frostmourne at the expense of his comrades' lives - just as the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Dark Lord of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; foretold. Arthas declares that he hears only the voice of Frostmourne. Mal'Ganis replies that Arthas hears the voice of the Dark Lord, who speaks through Frostmourne. The dreadlord then mockingly asks what the Dark Lord tells Arthas now.\nFrostmourne's sinister whispering is heard again. After a moment, Arthas answers that the Dark Lord (Lich King) tells him that the time for his vengeance has come. Mal'Ganis is shocked by this statement but is unable to defend himself in time. Arthas vanquishes the dreadlord with one strike from Frostmourne. Having achieved his vengeance, Arthas abandons his remaining men and wanders off into the frozen wastelands of Northrend where he loses the rest of his sanity to Frostmourne's dark voice.\nAftermath.\nAlthough Arthas achieved his victory over Mal'Ganis, he had sold his soul to the Lich King. Thus the Lich King gained his most powerful servant ever. Arthas became the first of the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon returning home, Arthas murdered his own father and allowed the Scourge to devour the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Arthas's quest to save his people ended with their destruction by his own hand.\nGuide.\nArthas, Muradin, and a small number of troops start the mission separated from the rest of your forces. Until you claim Frostmourne, you must manage Arthas' team and your base separately. It is a good idea to pause before sending Arthas out for Frostmourne to set up your base so that you are prepared to defend against attacks, and to build additional workers and troops. After the first attack passes, take Arthas and his crew north, spamming Holy Light on your troops to prevent anyone from dying and face each and every monster guarding the cave. While the gold earned from these monsters will be useful for maintaining your base, your base is unable to send reinforcements to Arthas, so prioritize accordingly.\nBy the time you claim Frostmourne, your base should be fairly secure. If not, the use of your hero unit may help to turn the tides, but beware that the Scourge forces will attack with greater strength now, and Mal'Ganis himself now accompanies the attack waves. There are two nearby gold mines that can be accessed relatively easily for additional income. One in the center is guarded by nerubians, while the other slightly to the north is haunted by the undead and guarded by a very small number of ghouls. The undead mine is the easier to capture and hold of the two. You can attack it without worrying about reprisal from Mal'Ganis unless you're unfortunate enough to attack when he happens to be sending out his own attack wave. The undead mine is also easier to choke off with towers than the nerubian one. The nerubian mine however, is guarded by nerubians who will drop gold and items when killed, so it's best to clear the mine even if you aren't going to expand there.\nYou can ignore the purple undead base to the south if you wish, and concentrate your attack on Mal'Ganis' green base in the north. After starting your push into his base you can expect the majority of his forces to counterattack you, so be sure you aren't in range of spirit towers when this happens, as it will be a somewhat long battle. Riflemen are useful for dealing with gargoyles and frost wyrms. and mortar teams and/or steam tanks can handle the towers. A well-balances army will serve you best, but priests for healing can help a great deal. Knights and griffin riders will do the most damage, and are easy to keep healed with Holy Light due to their high health pools. You may even consider hiring mercenaries, although the revenant is the only one of the group with any real advantages over your own units (they can be upgraded, while the mercs cannot). Arthas himself is quite formidable at level 10 and with Frostmourne; he can use Divine Shield to make himself invulnerable long enough to destroy or seriously damage undead structures by himself due to the chaos damage he deals with the blade. Ultimately the composition of your army is up to you, as this is the first mission that opens up the entire human techtree.\nThe \"deaths\" of Muradin and Mal'Ganis.\nAlthough Muradin appeared to have been killed when Frostmourne was released, it has been revealed in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" that he was merely rendered unconscious. However, when Muradin awoke he had no recollection of what had happened or even who he was. Soon after, he was taken in by the nearby &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;frost dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nLikewise, Mal'Ganis was seemingly killed by Arthas. However, Wrath of the Lich King also revealed that Mal'Ganis survived Arthas's attack, but was severely weakened and forced into hiding. Mal'Ganis is currently possessing the body of &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt; and is plotting to exact his revenge upon the Lich King."}

Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit\". The ice-rimmed cavern that extends back into the mountains is full of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;. The cavern was given its name by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, its entrance was protected by a group of &lt;a href=\"revenant\"&gt;revenant&lt;/a&gt;s led by one of them known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; came with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to claim the artifact in his quest of destroying the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian ordered them to turn back, and when they refused, a fight took place and all the revenants were destroyed. In its final moments, the Guardian attempted to stop Arthas, explaining that he was not protecting the sword, but everyone from it. However, the prince didn't listen and claimed Frostmourne from its ice prison, which caused its explosion, and a piece of it \"killed\" Muradin. As he couldn't save his mentor with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas discarded his holy warhammer, &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, and then returned to his base, leaving Muradin for dead.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Point\"&gt;half-finished fortification&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; stood watching over the entrance to Frostmourne Cavern.

There they could see a flashback of the last interactions between Arthas and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; as originally seen in \"\", with a surprise ending showing Muradin's survival. Next to Frostmourne's altar also lied Arthas' former hammer as well as Muradin's weapons, frozen in the snow.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; to collect Light's Vengeance in the cavern, in order to create an artifact to rival Frostmourne, believing that only the hammer of Arthas himself would provide a worthy model for the weapon, that would later become &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had predicted such a plan and tried to kill the adventurers by sending hordes of &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s into the cavern, but they managed to escape by ironically using the sacred hammer of Arthas.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the cavern, and Muradin mentioned that the weapons he wielded that day were still frozen in the ice. When his brother &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; tried to break them out, Muradin told him that they should stay here, along with everything he carried from those days, and let this remain a grave undisturbed."}

Now driven with madness, they wage war with the &lt;a href=\"Redfang%20tribe\"&gt;Redfang tribe&lt;/a&gt; to seek control of Grizzlemaw.\nIn the RPG.\nA few stories claim &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; was built on the site of the Frost Paw tribe's lodge and was made large enough to accommodate several &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribes at once. The Frost Paw then invited other friendly tribes to shelter the winter with them. The resulting ties changed the furbolgs from scattered &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to a stronger, more unified race, and the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; from ancestral hunting grounds to a loosely defined nation. Supposedly, the Frost Paws gathered the tribes together in part to fend off the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; threat."}

Before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; took the frostsaber cub &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt; as a companion. 4,000 years ago, Tyrande rescued the frostsaber queen &lt;a href=\"Shy-Rotam\"&gt;Shy-Rotam&lt;/a&gt; from ice giants, granting an eternal alliance between the night elves and the frostsabers. &lt;a href=\"Rivern%20Frostwind\"&gt;Rivern Frostwind&lt;/a&gt; continues to protect her and the frostsabers from the frostmaul giants by sending &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes against them.\nTheir ferocious appetite earned them the nickname \"Dragon Belly\" in the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;night elf language&lt;/a&gt;. Night elves raise frostsaber cubs from infancy, forging lifelong bonds of trust between rider and beast. Taming this savage breed requires patience, strength, and a large supply of fake mice and twine.\nThe lack of spots or stripes marks the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Frostsaber\"&gt;Ancient Frostsaber&lt;/a&gt; as a descendant of the most ancient frostsaber line. Frostsabers are very long lived since Ash'alah is over 10,000 years old and Shy-Rotam 4,000.\nIn the RPG.\nFrostsabers are legendary cats native to Winterspring, and they are highly sought after by the most experienced Sentinels as mounts. The night elves view frostsabers as sacred, and treat them with more respect than almost any other creature. Frostsabers are difficult to train, and thus traditionally only experienced Sentinels were ever capable of convincing one to serve as a mount. In recent years, with the coming of the goblins to Winterspring, &lt;a href=\"Wintersaber%20Trainers\"&gt;Wintersaber Trainers&lt;/a&gt; have begun selling their trained mounts for the first time in history. Traditionalists view this as blasphemous, but many understand that the coin from such sales often goes to a worthy cause (and Frostsaber Trainers are highly selective about just who they are willing to sell to). Frostsaber cats are intelligent and loyal when domesticated, but feral and aggressive when left in their natural environments.\nThe frostsaber cat is a fearless opponent, its thick fur having the resilience to shrug off minor damage. It uses its fangs and claws against those foolish enough to engage it in melee combat."}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Durotan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Chieftain Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, they are a strong, close-knit clan whose bond with &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; only adds to their strength\u2014though their numbers remain smaller than most clans. Though the clan spends much of their time in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, they migrate to with the seasons.\nIn the past, the clan battled against the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; was being formed, invitations were sent to every clan, the Frostwolves included. However &lt;a href=\"Garad%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Chieftain Garad&lt;/a&gt; rejected the offer and, in turn, was killed by &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;the Iron Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;his Thunderlords&lt;/a&gt;. Henceforth treated as enemies of the Iron Horde, members of the Frostwolves would be captured and sent to work as slaves for the Iron Horde war machine as it prepared for its invasion of Azeroth. Later some of these prisoners would be used to power the portal along with the draenei.\nThough the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; scored early success they were ultimately defeated and the defenders of Azeroth were quick to turn the tables by &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;invading Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20intro%20experience\"&gt;beating back&lt;/a&gt; Iron Horde forces, the Horde and Alliance forces split off with the Horde becoming allies of the Frostwolf Orcs. The two would work together in beating back the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Bladespire ogres&lt;/a&gt; and claim &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;Bladespire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; as their own. However while the Horde was focused on the ogres, the Thunderlords took the opportunity to strike &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt;. After defending the town the Frostwolves decided to take the fight to the Thunderlords.\nDuring the Horde counterattack, the Thunderlords would face a series of defeats that would ultimately see the death of its chieftain. However, instead of being able to rejoice in their victory, scouts reported that a massive Iron Horde army was making its way through the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prevent the Iron Horde from pushing through, the Frostwolves and their allies faced them as they came out of the pass. &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;The Battle of Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt; would be costly for the Iron Horde as the united Frostwolves and their allies protected the pass. However, with the Frostwolves outnumbered, sought to speak with the earth in order to collapse the canyon itself. This was ultimately successful and the Iron Horde invasion was destroyed, though the battle was not without its casualties, which included &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt; who sacrificed his life to buy Drek'Thar the time he needed.\nWith the battle finished, the Frostwolves mourned the fallen and decided to take the fight to the Iron Horde. To that end, they ensured no hostile presence remained within &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and sought &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; to aid their war against Iron Horde forces.\nThey later ventured into &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; where and fight the &lt;a href=\"Grom%27kar\"&gt;Grom'kar Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;, led by and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Burning Blade Clan&lt;/a&gt;. After their success in Talador the Frostwolves joined the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Grommashar\"&gt;Siege of Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the death of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrostwolf forces later breached the Tanaan Gate and took to fighting the Iron Horde forces within the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Front\"&gt;Iron Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile the exact order of events is unknown, by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; Durotan was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; and the Frostwolves joined with the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warchief Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Geya'rah, Durotan and Draka's daughter, would eventually rise to the rank of Overlord and serve as the Warchief's second-in-command during the &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20Lightbound%20and%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mag'har and &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; clashed, events on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would see to a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption.\nAs the entire Lightbound army was marching towards the Mag'har, Grommash ordered for the Mag'har to follow Geya'rah and fallback to Azeroth. Thus, when Warchief Hellscream and &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; charged at the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession in order to return to Azeroth with his new allies. After their arrival on Azeroth, Overlord Geya'rah took her place as the leader of the Mag'har and pledged the loyalty of her people to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; that Thrall came to understand his past, present, and future. With the arrival of the Stormpike dwarves, the extremely territorial Frostwolves have sought to drive them out of their ancestral valley, and have received military aid from the various members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in accomplishing this task.\nFrostwolf Village is close to the Horde battleground entrance in the southern end of the valley. The village houses a number of Frostwolf civilians, quest givers, vendors and the military. It has a blacksmith for all blacksmithing needs and there are a few houses and wagons where vendors have set up shop selling food, drinks, reagents and offer equipment repair. The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Frostwolf Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; is located beyond the Frostwolf Keep entrance tower (the right exit). He offers his wares and quests to capture the valley's mines, Coldtooth and Irondeep.\nIt should also be noted that there are some vacant Troll-style houses outside the village's walls, but nearby. No one knows who live there, perhaps it is a home for the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Legionnaire\"&gt;Frostwolf Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Battleguard\"&gt;Battleguards&lt;/a&gt;. Close by to these houses is the &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Stable%20Master\"&gt;Frostwolf Stable Master&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Wolf%20Rider%20Commander\"&gt;Frostwolf Wolf Rider Commander&lt;/a&gt; live and seek out soldiers to collect ram hides and tame wolves to prepare the cavalry.\nThe primary entrance into Frostwolf Village is via an open gate in a wooden fence surrounding the stronghold. This gate and the village guard the core of the Horde military presence, Frostwolf Keep, which is protected by both the Frostwolf West and East towers defended by &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Bowman\"&gt;Frostwolf Bowmen&lt;/a&gt;. The Frostwolf Relief Hut is also located in the keep as well as the Wing Commanders' (Guse, Jeztor and Mulverick\" domain. Inside the large garrison resides the leader of the Frostwolves, Drek'Thar, along with his two wolf pets, and the four warmasters (Iceblood, Tower Point, West &amp; East).\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Thrall visited the village, which was then known as \"Frostwolf Town\". It was home to &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, his son &lt;a href=\"Kal%27Thar\"&gt;Kal'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20%28orc%29\"&gt;Baelgun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zar%27gil\"&gt;Zar'gil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gath%27ras\"&gt;Gath'ras&lt;/a&gt;."}
