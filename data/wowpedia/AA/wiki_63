It is a time of truce and discussion, when clans large and small come together from across the plains to share resources and stories. The event is organized and overseen by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt;, the Maruuk's tradition keepers. Many centaur take the opportunity to reconnect with clanmates and family members. The gathering lasts many days, and it is \"almost impossible\" to coordinate all of the logistics. Providing food for all of the attending centaur is especially challenging. Traditionally, the hunters of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; provide meat for all of the shared meals at the Khural by hunting game on their way to Maruukai.\nThe Khural is a gathering for not only the living Maruuk but also their dead ancestors, who normally live with &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; in the sky. Clan Teerai traditionally summon the ancestors to Maruukai by giving them an offering in the form of a meal. They intentionally overchar and overspice the food to ensure that the scent is strong enough to reach the spirits in the sky. When the ancestors arrive, the Khural begins.\nIn 40 &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;, the Maruuk held a Khural where they planned to discuss the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s return to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons themselves sent an emissary, &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, to the gathering to ask &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to uphold her ancestors' pact with the green flight by aiding them against the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and helping them empower the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Oathstone\"&gt;Emerald Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. Clan Shikaar brought along outsiders of their own in the form of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who sought to make contact with the green flight; &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; noted that, considering all this, it would be \"a Khural to remember\". At the gathering, Khanam Matra Sarest agreed to help the dragons. However, the Khural was disrupted by &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed that they had allied with the Primalists and attacked the other clans in an attempt to take control of Maruukai, marking the start of a war between the clans."}

{"id": "15088", "revid": "14250", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15088", "title": "Kil'jaeden", "text": "Kil'jaeden (sometimes spelled as Kil'Jaeden) (pronounced Kill-jay-den), was a powerful &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; and the second in rank of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. 13,000 years ago, Kil'jaeden, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; were the leaders of the benevolent eredar people of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. When the Dark Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; arrived and offered them the answer to the most important question there was, \"what is the one true underlying &lt;a href=\"Void%20lord\"&gt;flaw&lt;/a&gt; of the universe?\", the eredar, as a knowledge-seeking race, accepted, led by Kil'jaeden and Archimonde. Sargeras blessed them with unimaginable power, turning the eredar into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s who would help Sargeras get rid of that flaw, while Velen and his followers fled, renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Archimonde led the Legion's armies, Kil'jaeden was charged with assimilating as many races as possible into the folds of the Burning Legion. He long sought to exact revenge on Velen and his followers for their perceived betrayal, which eventually led him to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, native inhabitants of the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; which the draenei had settled upon. The orcs formed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;First Horde&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtered the draenei, and invaded the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, marking the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden also created the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as a means to weaken Azeroth's defenses in preparation for a future Legion invasion.\nSince Sargeras was nowhere to be seen following the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden had assumed the role of acting leader of the Burning Legion.\nKil'jaeden is one of the two main antagonists in ' (alongside &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;), the main antagonist in \",\" and the secondary antagonist in '.\nBiography.\nArgus.\nTwenty-five millennia ago, the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; was shaped into a paradise by the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race who called it home. Kil'jaeden, respected for his intelligence, a genius among a race of geniuses, quickly rose to become a leader of Argus alongside his best friend, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, who he loved as a brother. Together they formed the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Duumvirate\"&gt;Second Duumvirate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, Kil'jaeden, Velen and the eredar rulers' inner circle bore witness to a grand demonstration held by the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt;, who led an order of &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt;. First, Thal'kiel summoned orderly rows of the old, familiar &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; constructs he and his followers were known for. Then, he started summoning a storm of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernals&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the constructs as a symbolic display of the \"new era\" he foresaw for his people thanks to the arts of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic summoning he had recently discovered.\nHowever, when he looked upon his colleagues' faces, Thal'kiel didn't see the approval he expected. Kil'jaeden's expression was remote and inscrutable, but Velen harshly condemned Thal'kiel's actions and forbade him from ever conjuring demons again, denouncing his \"new era\" as a failed experiment. Some time later, Thal'kiel resumed his experiments regardless, using cloaking magic to hide a demonic army he and his Wakeners were constructing with the purpose of installing him as dictator of Argus. The night before the planned coup, however, Thal'kiel's ambitious young apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, informed Kil'jaeden and Velen of his master's plans. To prove his loyalty to Argus' rulers, Archimonde himself led the attack on the Wakeners' secret training grounds and decapitated his former master with his own blade. Later, he would rise to rule the eredar alongside Kil'jaeden and Velen.\nCorruption.\nEredar society was shattered when their three leaders were contacted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, who offered the eredar untold knowledge and magic at their disposal in exchange for their loyalty. Kil'jaeden and Archimonde readily accepted, though Velen curiously held back. As the eredar were preparing to receive their new powers, Kil'jaeden learned that Velen and his followers had sided with the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and were in the process of fleeing Argus. Enraged by this \"betrayal\", Kil'jaeden loosed his new powers and minions on the \"Exiled Ones\", or &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; in Eredun, and relentlessly pursued them across the cosmos for thousands of years.\n&lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; delivered Velen's &lt;a href=\"Nuuri\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rakeesh\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; to Kil'jaeden, who then renamed the boy Rakeesh, meaning \"butcher\", and had the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Inquisition\"&gt;Demonic Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; torture him into an agent of the Burning Legion.\nSargeras molded Kil'jaeden's innate cunning and intellect and charged him with seeking out and transforming the races of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; into demons of the Burning Legion. The Deceiver first enslaved the vampiric race called the dreadlords - or &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; - led by &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, after which he also recruited the barbarous pit lords, or &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Orcish Horde on Draenei.\nFor millennia, Kil'jaeden's scouts searched the Nether for the draenei, finding and destroying the worlds they had settled on, but they always managed to escape. Then, one day, Kil'jaeden's favored servant, &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;, stumbled upon a world that showed signs of the draenei's magic. Though they initially assumed it was just another one of the planets the draenei briefly stopped upon, further investigations quickly discovered that the draenei had actually settled there, even going so far as to give it an eredun name: &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning \"Exiles' Refuge\".\nOn the planet there also resided a race of shamanistic beings called &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Intrigued by their potential, Kil'jaeden realized that they were exactly what he was looking for. He sought an agent among the orcish race to follow his will. Though Kil'jaeden found many suitable candidates none held as much potential as &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan was born crippled, weak and deformed, which made him a target for constant mockery and abuse ever since his childhood. He knew that he was meant for more than his clan would ever allow of him, and he hated them for it. He used the hate and bitterness he felt as a way to keep going. One day, the other clan members grew so tired of the runt's refusal to accept his place in the clan that they beat him repeatedly in an attempt to rid themselves of him once and for all. As the chieftain was about to beat him again, the elderly &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the clan stopped him, saying that he had tried and failed to help Gul'dan find his place in the clan. Laying a hand on Gul'dan's shoulder, the elder said, not unkindly, that there was nothing more he could do for him, but that he had always believed there was greatness within him. He then advised the runt to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, for perhaps there he would find his destiny. Though at first dismissal Gul'dan would eventually follow the advice, only to be rejected by the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt; who sensed the darkness and fury within his heart. It was when he was at his lowest, that Kil'jaeden spoke to Gul'dan, promising power and godhood in exchange for Gul'dan helping the Burning Legion turn the orcs as a weapon to destroy the draenei.\nGul'dan quickly agreed, for he only held disdain for his people. Kil'jaeden instructed his new servant in the ways of fel magic. The demon lord knew that these energies would physically change the orc or even draw the draenei's attention, so he took steps to hide Gul'dan new abilities. Kil'jaeden taught the orc how to mask his powers, and he ordered him to use fel magic only when absolutely necessary. Gul'dan took to the volatile power faster than expected, reveling in the destructive might his fingertips.\nKnowing that Gul'dan couldn't serve as the figure they needed to forge the orc clans into an army, Kil'jaeden ordered Gul'dan to ally with someone who could inspire or lead the orc race. After destroying his former clan (in order to ensure that no one knew his past) Gul'dan would join the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. In time Gul'dan's would earn Ner'zhul's trust and became the elder's shamanic apprentice. Under the guise of the orcs' sacred ancestors, Kil'jaeden tricked the shamans of each clan\u2014including their most respected leader, the elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;\u2014into thinking that the draenei were plotting against the orcs. Soon, the clans began to launch successful skirmishes and raids against the draenei, believing it to be their ancestors' will that they be exterminated. However, plans faltered when Ner'zhul traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, was shown the truth about his new patron, and attempted to undo his actions. Kil'jaeden, however, was already aware of Ner'zhul's actions and stripped the elderly shaman of his power, and Gul'dan would teach his fel magics to other the orcs. Eventually, as the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s refused to grant their powers to the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, these demonic powers would overtake the orcs.\nGul'dan also turned to Kil'jaeden for assistance in creating two &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, imploring the Burning Legion for aid since he did not want to ask the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; for help. Kil'jaeden saw the value of having a covert assassin at the Shadow Council's command. The demon lord instructed and provided him the raw materials needed to create them.\nAfter proving the orcs' ability to fight the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood was given to the orcs to drink, and they degraded into a horrible bloodlust. As both a test of his new minions and as a revenge to his wayward brethren, Kil'jaeden ordered Gul'dan to finish the slaughter of the draenei in one climactic battle at &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was a brutal massacre, with much of Shattrath being destroyed. To all appearances, Kil'jaeden's pawns had finally triumphed over the draenei.\nKil'jaeden was relatively pleased with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction of the draenei, as was Sargeras who viewed the Horde as the perfect army to weaken Azeroth. Sargeras ordered Kil'jaeden to cut off all communication with the horde, inspiring desperation for survival, to encourage journeying to another world. Obeying his master's orders and taking it as a sign that Sargeras required him elsewhere, Kil'jaeden retreated from Draenor, abandoning the Horde\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s take-over of the Horde and resulting in its victory during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden would reestablish contact with Gul'dan, convincing the warlock to support Doomhammer. Unknown to Kil'jaeden however, Gul'dan had grown disillusioned with the eredar and plotted to acquire the power within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; for himself. Thus his betrayal of the Horde came as a complete shock to Kil'jaeden. The enraged demon lord prepared to annihilate his servant for single-handedly dooming what should have been a momentous Legion victory when Sargeras himself ordered him to stand down. Sargeras decided that he would allow Gul'dan to come within reach of what he desired, let the foolish orc taste could have been his, and then Sargeras would rip it all away, as Gul'dan had done to the Horde's hopes of victory.\nDespite the fact that Horde had broken away from the Legion's control, Kil'jaeden would often boast of his corruption of the orcs and refer it as his \"masterpiece.\"\nThe Lich King.\nThe defeat of the Horde during the Second War infuriated Kil'jaeden but it did not deter the demon lord. In truth, Kil'jaeden had learned an extremely valuable lesson. The Horde had failed because of internal conflict and disloyalty. The Legion's next strike against Azeroth would not suffer from the same weakness. Kil'jaeden convinced of a dark, disturbing way to raise a new puppet army that would be utterly incapable of diverging from the Legion's will. All he needed was a powerful spirit, skilled in the art of wielding magic to control it.\nCalling in an unpaid vendetta, the Deceiver found Ner'zhul within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and, seeking vengeance against the shaman's defiance, tortured the orc for an impossibly long time, destroying his body piece by piece until finally, nothing remained but the shaman's tortured soul. Kil'jaeden offered the remnant of the soul a choice: remain in eternal pain in the eredar torture dimension, or become the ruler of an army of undeath. Ner'zhul, predictably, chose the latter and was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Recalling Ner'zhul's previous duplicity and Gul'dan's failure, Kil'jaeden took no chances whatsoever. He refused to give the Lich King a body, instead sealing specially forged armor, along with the Lich King's soul, into the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Just in case Ner'zhul wasn't daunted by immobility, he dispatched the Dreadlords to make sure he stayed on task. From his followers, he created the first &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es. The demon lord promised him that if he succeeds, he will give him freedom and a new body.\nThe Lich King was to succeed where the orcs had failed: His undead servants would wipe out any potential resistance, and raise the unfortunate fallen as undead legions and thus the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began. However, the Lich King, aware of the eredar's hatred for the immortal elves, betrayed the Legion by breaking the pact he had forged with Kil'jaeden which bound him to the latter's will. In informing &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; through his pawn &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, he facilitated the death of one of the Legion's greatest tacticians, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, and dealt the first blow against the Legion that led to the ultimate fall of their forces in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nAlthough Kil'jaeden was infuriated at the failure and death of Archimonde, he knew better than to take reckless vengeance.\nHe did not believe that all was lost. He was still confident about the Scourge, the dreadlords, and the Lich King. But when he reached to the Lich King, the entity refused him. Kil'jaeden realized that if the Lich King conquered Azeroth, any future demonic invasions would be nearly impossible. He sensed a new demon who could complete the task of destroying the Lich King.\nHe found &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and told him that, despite his part in the Legion's downfall, the Deceiver was willing to offer him a chance at power. Illidan was informed that if he destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, thus killing the Lich King, that Kil'jaeden would reward him with power beyond his imagination (whether or not Kil'jaeden actually intended to do so is a moot point). He gave Illidan the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Orb of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in his task.\nIllidan first gained the allegiance of the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, who helped him first flee from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and then later seek out the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. With it, they performed an arcane ritual to tear &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the base of the undead Scourge, apart. Thus, the minions of Kil'jaeden came full circle, back to the power of the Dark Titan.\nHowever, due to interference from Illidan's brother, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the Eye was destroyed before Illidan managed to destroy the Frozen Throne. Having failed Kil'jaeden, Illidan instead went on to rescue &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; along with his brother. Aware of Kil'jaeden's capabilities, he fled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to evade capture, during which he gained the loyalty of one more former Highborne race, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. With his new servitors, Illidan eventually moved against the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; by destroying the dimensional gates Ner'zhul had opened decades before. The stratagem was meant to keep Kil'jaeden and his minions away from Outland and would have stopped Magtheridon from calling in reinforcements. Without any further demonic aid to strengthen his standing forces, Magtheridon was quick to fall before Illidan and his followers.\nBut Kil'jaeden was no fool. Because of Draenor's former importance as the homeworld of the orcs and the refuge of the draenei (and Magtheridon himself an agent of the Legion), Kil'jaeden kept at least half an eye on the torn planet. Quickly uncovering what had happened (or perhaps watching all along), the Deceiver once again appeared in front of Illidan and commanded him to return to the icy continent to finish what he had started (citing that his new servitors showed \"\"some\" promise\"; while Kil'jaeden probably didn't buy Illidan's story, he knew that his best bet in destroying the traitor still lay in Illidan), and told him that if he failed again, he would face his \"eternal wrath.\" However, Illidan failed and the Lich King persists, having cheated the Deceiver by merging with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe war in Outland.\nAfter Illidan destroyed the dreadlord homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt; and dealt the greatest blow to the Legion in ten thousand years, the Legion was now clearly aware of the threat that Illidan posed and would learn from spies from within the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; that Illidan planned to launch a similar assault on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that Kil'jaeden attacked the forces of Azeroth, luring them to Outland to put an end to Illidan. Once within the shattered realm, the Horde and Alliance would begin striking against both the Legion and the Illidari. Kil'jaeden manipulated his enemies into fighting each other, and when they were weakened from the battle he planned to destroy them all. Kil'jaeden also sent the &lt;a href=\"Doomwalker\"&gt;Doomwalker&lt;/a&gt; to lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; was killed at the Black Temple, his demonic soul entered the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; where he was found by Kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden heaped endless torment upon Varedis, who resisted for a time, but it was not pain that broke his spirit. The Deceiver played upon his shock from the battle at the Black Temple. Champions had been prepared to face Varedis and known to use the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Fel%20Names\"&gt;Book of Fel Names&lt;/a&gt;, so who had told them of that power? Varedis knew it would not have been the Burning Legion or the Shadow Council, as they would have preferred the book to remain intact. Kil'jaeden convinced Varedis that it could only have been the Illidari, who knew of his power and betrayed him.\nWith the help of other &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden conducted a dangerous, agonizing ritual, infusing a small part of his soul into Varedis's spirit. When the ritual was complete, Varedis was not a demon hunter but a demon, loyal to the Burning Legion and hungry for vengeance. Varedis found that his weapons, now the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, had also been changed. The ritual had imbued them with another slice of Kil'jaeden's astonishing power. &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; willingly joined the demon lord and Kil'jaeden bestowed her the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt;.\nFury of the Sunwell.\nSome time prior to Illidan's defeat at the Black Temple, Kil'jaeden turned to one of the Betrayer's former lieutenants to be his instrument of vengeance: &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of the Blood Elves whom he enticed with promises of salvation for the blood elves. Defeated at &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Kael was revived by &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt; who healed his wounds by planting a fel crystal inside his chest. Kael'thas was then sent to Azeroth, where he infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, took the dark naaru &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; where he planned to use the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; as a gateway for Kil'jaeden to enter the world. Kil'jaeden used the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, which he had retrieved from Ner'zhul after Draenor's destruction, to aid Kael'thas in opening the portal. Adventurers fought their way through Kael's minions and Burning Legion demons to reach the Sunwell, just in time to see Kil'jaeden begin pulling himself through... &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;, the embodiment of the Sunwell's energies, was held in an arcane barrier, her powers being drained to feed the portal, but later in the encounter she sacrificed herself to weaken the Deceiver, who could then successfully be banished back into the Nether, leaving only his large necklace behind on the surface of the Sunwell.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nKil'jaeden's plans to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s into a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that would slaughter the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; he hated so much went awry on an alternate due to the intervention of a time-traveling &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who prevented the drinking of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; by warning the orcs beforehand. With Kil'jaeden's plan falling to pieces, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Legion's invasion of Draenor himself. Under Archimonde, the demons were much more forceful and out in the open than they were in the main timeline.\nThough Kil'jaeden's plans failed, he continued to watch 's actions throughout the events on Draenor.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nAfter the defeat of Archimonde in , was sent to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to open the way for the Burning Legion to invade. Kil'jaeden telepathically communicated and instructed Gul'dan until the warlock had successfully entered the Tomb of Sargeras. Soon after &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; (who had been searching Gul'dan) arrived and a furious battle erupted between the two. When Khadgar began gaining the upper hand Kil'jaeden instructed Gul'dan how to shattered the seals blocking the power of the Tomb of Sargeras from being used. However, Gul'dan soon realized that he could not kill Khadgar and shatter the final seal at the same, Gul'dan sought to convince Kil'jaeden to infuse him with the tomb's power. A plea that Kil'jaeden granted, after Gul'dan learned the fate of his prime timeline counterpart.\nWith his new power Gul'dan was able to defeat Khadgar and Kil'jaeden ordered Gul'dan to allow the power to flow to the portal and spark the invasion of Azeroth. However, Gul'dan refused and instead used his new power to reach through his demonic link and speak face to face with his master, sitting on a throne in some distant world within the Nether. Gul'dan accused him of planning to discard the orc from the beginning. Kil'jaeden denied this, having invested too much into Gul'dan. He explained that the original Gul'dan died because his betrayal is what sealed the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;first Horde&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and by extension, Kil'jaeden and the Legion \u2014 on Azeroth during the Second War. When Gul'dan angrily replied that that was not him, Kil'jaeden told him that betrayal was in his nature. Seeing great potential within the orc, however, buried beneath a short-sighted selfishness, the eredar had dragged Gul'dan to Thal'dranath to lead him to even greater power. The eredar then went on to explain that while Gul'dan had always been destined for power, he would never be his own master; that every creature served a master, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;even the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he gave the warlock a choice: prove himself loyal, return his power to the portal and open the way for the Legion, or betray his masters yet again to exact his petty vengeance on insignificant mortals before the Legion destroyed him. He left with a closing thought: Gul'dan may call him 'the Deceiver', but Kil'jaeden stated that he had never lied to him. \"Not once. Not in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;this world&lt;/a&gt;, and not in &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;yours&lt;/a&gt;.\" \nGul'dan would ultimately realign with the Legion, a choice that Kil'jaeden would commend Gul'dan for, and later reveal that in doing so that Gul'dan had secured the trust of the Legion.\nLegion.\nKil'jaeden briefly appears on board the &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Citadel\"&gt;Shadowgore Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to bless &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari Shadowgore&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. He also orders &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; to return to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; before he dies at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nKil'jaeden appears before the Illidari at the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; and gives them an offer to join the Burning Legion. When &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;their leader&lt;/a&gt; in Illidan's absence declines, Kil'jaeden replies that he will send Caria and Varedis after them. As the Illidari invade &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; to kill Varedis and Caria, Kil'jaeden watches the battle and tells them to fight for his pleasure. He ignores his demon hunters' pleas to be saved as they die, and tells the Illidari that their fate is sealed.\nLegionfall.\nSince striking the bargain that chased the draenei into the stars, Kil'jaeden believed the Legion could not be stopped. Yet, none of his deceptions prevented the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth from reaching this critical moment. Infuriated that Sargeras' promise of victory never came to pass, the demon lord prepared to battle the order leaders himself in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, for a final battle that would shape Azeroth's destiny forever. Kil'jaeden is seen watching Khadgar and Velen meeting with the Order Hall champions in Dalaran and listening as his former friend derides him as a monster. Kil'jaeden then reminisced about what was promised him and proceeded to question Sargeras saying all they have to show for their efforts is failure. Sargeras, in return, asked Kil'jaeden if he had lost sight of the Legion's destiny, and wondered if he had overestimated Kil'jaeden's resolve. An irritated Kil'jaeden claimed that he paid for his destiny with his world and that the time had come to see it done. He then summoned several Legion ships to invade Dalaran, commanding them to burn it to ash.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; began to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden sent Legion invasions across all the Broken Isles.\nIn the Tomb of Sargeras, Kil'jaeden sent the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt; against adventurers. During the battle, Velen confronted Kil'jaeden with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and Illidan and pursued him into the Twisting Nether.\nAboard Kil'jaeden's command ship, Velen confronted his old friend and declared his intent to stop Kil'jaeden's hunt across the stars. Kil'jaeden told Velen that he had lacked vision back then and refused to see the Legion's inevitable victory, while Velen insisted that Kil'jaeden had lost faith in the Light and if the two of them had worked together they could have resisted Sargeras and saved Argus. Kil'jaeden questioned if the Light had saved &lt;a href=\"Rakeesh\"&gt;Velen's son&lt;/a&gt;, or if what shone in Rakeesh's eyes when he died was hatred for the father who had abandoned him. Enraged, Velen declared his intent to fight alongside Azeroth's champions against Kil'jaeden and end his crusade.\nUpon Kil'jaeden's defeat, his ship began to crash toward Argus. Mortally wounded, Kil'jaeden admitted to Velen that he was always envious of the latter's gift, faith, and vision. Kil'jaeden had never believed that Sargeras could be stopped but wondered if perhaps Velen would prove him wrong. As Khadgar prepared to teleport everyone back to Azeroth through a rift Illidan had opened with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, Velen silently placed a hand on Kil'jaeden's forehead as a sign of forgiveness and sympathy, letting go of his hatred for his own sake and for Rakeesh's memory. When the heroes of Azeroth vanished before him, Kil'jaeden closed his eyes as he died in a fel explosion that destroyed him and his command ship.\nOnce again, it is his &lt;a href=\"Spoils%20of%20the%20Legion%27s%20Fall\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt; that is looted by adventurers. As he died in the Nether, his death is final.\nPersonality.\nKil'jaeden was described as the most powerful and decisive of the three eredar leaders, while Velen was described as once the strongest, the wisest, and the most attuned to magic and science.\nPrior to joining the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden was the most brilliant of the three rulers of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. He was witty and cunning, reveling in puzzling out the most confounding mysteries of the cosmos. He was described as being the most decisive of the three and wanted what was best for their people.\nKil'jaeden seems to have no problem keeping his ego from dominating judgment. He is surprisingly forgiving to failed servitors, provided they aren't complete failures. He nursed a burning desire for utter obliteration that Archimonde lacked. Kil'jaeden regards &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, who was once closer to him than a brother, as his arch-nemesis, and has spent millennia in a fury over what he perceives as Velen's betrayal, much to the confusion of his servitors and Archimonde. Whenever Velen had escaped his grasp, Kil'jaeden nursed his insulted pride by destroying the worlds visited by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, but the slaughter of primitive races did not slake his demonic thirst for complete and total revenge.\nHe was described as a schemer who corrupted so many.\nKil'jaeden consistently allows those who serve under him chances to redeem themselves, a policy which acts to cement their loyalty. Kil'jaeden also takes the excuses and explanations of those who serve under him with careful consideration and merit so long as he believes them to be doing all they can. These policies are in direct contrast to Archimonde's approach, which can be summed up as \"succeed or die.\"\nOne of his agendas is to consume life and magic, assimilate every possible race into the Legion's ranks, slay any who dare resist, and ultimately destroy all of creation.\nVelen wonders whether his lost friend has grown to tire of the death he brings, and if, in the blackness of his soul, Kil'jaeden ever doubts the choices he has made.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;The Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.2.0\"&gt;patch 7.2&lt;/a&gt; trailer, after dismissing Velen's hologram with a swipe, Kil'jaeden seemed to be displeased when Velen called him a \"&lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;\" that hunted his &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;. He reminisces that on the day he took the fel fire into his veins, he saw his destiny shown to him by Sargeras: a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;grand crusade&lt;/a&gt; reaching the ends of creation. Despite Sargeras assuring his second-in-command that the Burning Crusade would prevail, a frustrated Kil'jaeden voiced doubts that for every plan the Legion carried out on Azeroth per Sargeras' design, all they showed for it was failure, that Sargeras' promise of victory has not come to pass. Kil'jaeden was then offended by Sargeras telling him that he might have lost sight of their destiny and even voicing an opinion that he might've overestimated Kil'jaeden's resolve. Kil'jaeden then vehemently stated that he paid for his destiny with his &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn his deathbed, Kil'jaeden revealed he had always been envious of Velen's gift, faith, and vision and now wondered if he would be able to stop Sargeras after all, since he believed it to be impossible. This may imply that the Deceiver may have accepted Sargeras' deal out of fear to preserve his people rather than a desire for power like Archimonde. Upon silently being forgiven by Velen for all of his terrible transactions against him, Kil'jaeden seemed to welcome death calmly.\nPowers.\nThe exact powers at the Deceiver's command are unknown. As his ultimatum to Illidan and his appearance to Ner'zhul and the orcs exemplifies, he is a master of illusions. Kil'jaeden has also shown the ability to control his overall size (an ability shared by Archimonde), but that may not be the limit to his shapeshifting abilities. Though these are the only powers observed in recent years, assuming that these cantrips are the limits of his power is a grave mistake. Even prior to the eredar's transformation, Velen acknowledged that Kil'jaeden was his, as well as Archimonde's, superior in matters of the arcane. However, in Kil'jaeden's point of view, Velen was the strongest and wisest of the three of them. Velen was also said to be the most attuned to magic and science.\nHowever, Kil'jaeden's full powers lie not within the boundaries of physical and magical ability, but in the mind. His unrivaled cunning allowed him to corrupt the orcs with very little magical expenditure, a plan executed almost entirely by manipulation.\nCharacter development.\nLike most demons, Kil'jaeden's original position in Warcraft lore was a minor one; in this case, he was the tutor of Gul'dan, one of the major characters in Warcraft II. After the role of Sargeras was built up from a footnote to that of the major lore antagonist, Kil'jaeden's role was also increased, to the extent that he is now one of the most significant behind-the-scenes villains.\nIn the RPG.\nKil'jaeden possesses an extremely long-term mindset and views individual events as nothing more than single links in the thousand-year-long chains of his schemes. Perhaps because of this outlook, Kil'jaeden is extremely tenacious and rarely lets short-term defeats or missteps prevent him from reaching his goals. If one method of completing a scheme is prevented for whatever reason, he simply finds other ways to proceed. However, he also has a long memory when it comes to individuals who, either intentionally or unintentionally, obstruct his plans. Kil'jaeden does not forget those who hinder him in any way and often comes back to brutally punish them later, in his own time. His bidding is typically carried out by minions or intermediaries, and Kil'jaeden rarely meets individuals face to face. When he does, it is usually to force them to his will or to slay them once and for all.\nKil'jaeden the Deceiver has a highly adaptable physical presence and frequently shifts among several forms. He usually tries to assume whatever shape the people around him will trust the most or be the most awestruck by. He attains his goals through a combination of subtle coercion and blatant intimidation.\nAs with Archimonde, Kil'jaeden has his own hierarchy of demons. The Dreadlords, like Tichondrius, serve under him. &lt;a href=\"Risen%20terror\"&gt;Risen terror&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s serve under him also.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is located on the ravaged &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, within a city laid out according to complex geomantic rules. Its curved structures are reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; buildings, only far more intricate and beautiful. &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s draenei town halls were hovels compared with the fantastic structures of this city. There were huge machines for focusing magic, which once provided peace, harmony, and health to an entire world. Now they created a cloud of fear and despair.\nAt the center of the great city stands the mighty palace, made of crystal corridors forming a dark labyrinth and engraved with &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt; that glow with evil significance. It is as if the core of all the spells that had once spread light and harmony across the city and the world had been rewritten to create the opposite. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; managed to project himself astrally to Argus and infiltrate the palace. When he studied the runes within, feelings of rage and despair filled his mind. Even shielded as he was, the spells affected him, filling him with visions of conquest, a lust for domination and destruction, a rage to end all things.

With the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt; dead once more, Kil'jaeden decides to retreat into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the Legion will return again and again until Azeroth is finally broken. The raid, along with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, pursue him onto his flagship in the hope of ending the legion lord once and for all. Illidan takes part in one phase of the battle, while Velen and Khadgar keep demons away from the battle. \nWhile the battle with Kil'jaeden does have a high damage requirement to beat his enrage, the fight is also extremely dependent on how well the raid can follow mechanics. Ability overlaps are common, even on Normal mode, and the raid must be ready to improvise and react to abilities quickly enough to avoid wipes. It is a 3-phase encounter with 2 intermission phases.\nOverview.\nPlayers engage Kil'jaeden on his command ship, engaging both him and the Shadow Reflections of their comrades' souls that he turns to his will. At 80% health, Kil'jaeden takes to the sky, launching a punishing barrage of attacks on players, after which he re-engages the players with greater power. At 40% health, Kil'jaeden wraps the platform in darkness, limiting players' vision to a short range around them, and summons several Shadowsouls. Players must find Illidan in the darkness, who grants the players his sight, and use it to defeat the Shadowsouls and dispel the darkness. Once players have escaped the darkness, Kil'jaeden arrives at Argus and unleashes his ultimate attack - Darkness of a Thousand Souls. Players must use the rifts that he opens to absorb the missiles from Darkness of a Thousand Souls to avoid being killed by them.\nAbilities.\nIntermission: Deceiver's Veil.\nKil'jaeden gathers the shadows around him, applying Deceiver's Veil to all players and creating several Shadowsouls. Killing the Shadowsouls pushes back the darkness, removing Deceiver's Veil from all players.\nStrategy.\nFor this fight, 2 tanks are required at minimum, but having a third tank can help immensely if the raid does not have access to many immunities. While 4 healers may seem tempting, the healing requirement for this fight isn't very high until the very last phase if all mechanics are being followed correctly. Meanwhile, the damage requirement is quite steep to avoid the boss' berserk timer. Following mechanics must always take priority over DPS however, as most of Kil'jeaden's mechanics can cause wipes by themselves if they are not dealt with, but are especially dangerous during the ability overlaps. \nThroughout the fight, Kil'jeaden with periodically hit the tanks with Fel Claws. This temporary buff will cause the boss' melee attacks to cause massive fire damage and make the tank take increased damage. The debuff applied stacks up each time the boss hits you. Ideally, a tank should be able to endure a whole set of Fel Claws before the other tank taunts. This ability is very dangerous and regularly does more than a million damage a shot at the higher stacks, and tanks must use cooldowns regularly to survive it. As the claws cleave anyone in-front of the boss, the tanks should tank him facing away from the raid. Keep the boss roughly in the center of the room so it is easy for melee players to reach any corner of the room quickly.\nPhase 1.\nDuring phase 1, the most impactful ability the boss casts is Armageddon. He will summon several small red circles and one very large one. If a circle is not being occupied (shown by a large flame animation) when the timer expires, a meteor will strike the ship and apply a massive physical hard-hitting DOT to all players. One meteor is typically survivable with a healing cooldown, but two or more meteors will wipe the raid. Raid members must stand in the circles to absorb the meteor impact, which applies only a small dot when absorbed. Meanwhile, the larger circle should ideally be absorbed either by a third tank or a player with an immunity, as otherwise multiple people will have to soak the larger meteor at the same time. Immunities like a mage's &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; or a hunter's &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Turtle\"&gt;Aspect of the Turtle&lt;/a&gt; will make soaking the large meteor simple. \nThe next ability he uses is Rupturing Singularity, where he summons a small purple orb to slowly descend onto the arena. Standing underneath the impact site will kill you. Standing anywhere else will send the raid a distance backwards from the impact site. The first singularity will fail squarely in the middle, so as long as the raid is close to the center, but not on it, they will not be in any danger of falling off. \nIntermission 1.\nThe first intermission phase starts at 80% health. Kil'jeaden will fly up and be protected from 99% of all damage taken, making it pointless to attack him. He will start raining abilities down on the raid in rapid succession. First, an Armageddon, then a Focused Dreadflame, another Armageddon, and a Bursting Dreadflame before coming down. Focused Dreadflame is a simple soak mechanic where one players is targeted by the boss and must have players either stacked with him or between them and the boss to soak the damage. Bursting Dreadflame causes large circles to appear around several players which will explode for some fire damage after a bit of time. Simply move away from the rest of the group to avoid the explosions. Note that since Armageddon will be coming down quickly, one should avoid taking meteors while they still have the debuff from a previous Armageddon as the damaging debuff from soaking one, while inconsequential at first, will ramp up to deadly levels if a players absorbs 2 or 3. In this phase, the order should be: Spread out, collapse in to soak the Focused Dreadflame, then stay spread out for the rest of the abilities until the phase ends.\nPhase 2.\nThis phase ramps up the difficulty by regularly having Kil'jeaden use several abilities at once, including the ones he used during the intermission phase. His one new ability is Malignant Reflections. 3 players will grow to massive size and, after 7 seconds, create an immobile add at their location. These Malignant Reflections will continuously cast a damaging raid-wide spell that increases in damage each time it is cast. Although the adds to gain a damage buff for being closer to each other, the best strategy to deal with them is simply stacking them all on-top of the boss and focusing/cleaving them down as fast as possible. \nOverlaps \nArmageddon + Bursting Dreadflame is not a very consequential overlap, as you will want to be spread out for both abilities anyway. \nRupturing Singularity + Focused Dreadflame is also not very important, because if raid members stack on-top of the targeted player, they will be knocked back as one and take the damage as normal.\nArmageddon + Focused Dreadflame is potentially dangerous if the player targeted needs to soak a meteor. Keep the targeted player in the center of the arena with Kil'jaeden and communicate quickly with your raid to see who is staying in the center with the targeted player and who will be soaking meteors. \nArmageddon + Rupturing Singularity is the most dangerous overlap as it will knock players away from the meteors they need to soak. Surviving this combination means having some players stand closer to the singularity so that when it impacts, they will not be very far off from any meteors that spawn near them. Reaching the rest of the circles after being knocked back relies entirely on your raid's use of movement speed increases to reach them in time. \nHaving good field awareness, keeping calm, and keeping an eye on your DBM timers to react to abilities as, or before, they come is key to surviving this phase. \nIntermission 2.\nStarting at 40%, Kil'jaeden will become invisible and use Deceiver's Veil to place &lt;a href=\"Fog%20of%20War\"&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; across the arena and summon Shadowsoul adds. The fog makes it so players cannot hit enemies and all healing is reduced by 100%. During this phase, players must spread out and try to find Illidan, making pings on the minimap to show everyone else where he is when they do. Stepping on the pool of energy Illidan is channeling will grant players the ability to fully heal and DPS for 20 seconds. However, this buff also places a hard-hitting DOT on the players, so as DPS move through the darkness, make sure your raid frames show that you are still in-range of your healers. Killing all of the Shadowsoul adds with the debuff will remove the darkness and end the phase. The adds will be standing still and channeling a spell which teleports them to a random location in the arena each time. The adds themselves do not have much health and can be stunned to stop their spellcasting and keep them in-place for a longer period of time. DPS should keep an eye on their debuff as when it expires, they must return to Illidan to refresh the debuff to continue killing adds. The same goes for healers to keep everyone alive. The true threat of this phase is that, if players are not successful in killing the Shadowsouls fast enough, the phase will last longer than necessary and bring the raid closer to Kil'jaeden's berserk timer. \nPhase 3.\nOnce the last Shadowsoul dies, the flagship arrives at &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and phase 3 begins. Kil'jaeden will immediately begin channeling Darkness of a Thousand Souls, which will deal very high amounts of damage to everyone in the raid. The raid has no choice but to heal through the damage.\nSimply keep moving away from it. In addition to his enrage, the boss also has somewhat of a soft-enrage in the form of Demonic Obelisks. These obelisks are summoned in random locations and fire beams in a straight cross shape to the north, south, east, and west after a short time. While the beams themselves are large, it is not difficult to dodge them or even to move the boss out of the way if it seems like a beam may hit melee... at first. After 3-4 obelisks spawn, it will become increasingly difficult to dodge all the beams. In addition to damage, they also knock players backwards, so be mindful that players are not too close to the edge. \nFinally, Kil'jaeden will tear a rift in reality at one of the 4 corners of the arena, which will start pulling players towards it around the time the boss begins channeling Darkness of a Thousand Souls once again. One will notice that there is a circular line around the rift that indicates that if a player stands within it, they will be affected by Gravity Squeeze. This is a relatively strong DOT that lasts as long as players stand near the rift. What is important however, is that should a player be close enough to be affected by Gravity Squeeze, they will not take any damage from Darkness of a Thousand Souls as the rift will absorb the attack. Thus, players should enter range of the rift just as the boss finishes casting DoaTS to avoid the massive damage from the spell. \nShould all the mechanics be followed correctly, all DPS should be alive in phase 3 and able to kill the boss before hitting his berserk timer. \nQuotes.\nAftermath.\nI always knew I would see Argus again. Our homecoming appeared time and again in my visions.\nBut I never imagined this.\nThere can be no doubt that the fates of my world and yours are intertwined. Can Argus be saved, or must it be sacrificed to stop Sargeras? My visions are clouded, uncertain.\nIt seems we must forge our own destiny. Light save us all, &lt;name&gt;.\nThe Sargerite Keystone tore through the fabric of reality. Now the homeworld of the Legion looms before us, its armies poised to strike.\nTuralyon is out there somewhere. Alleria too, I hope. If we can find my old friends, perhaps the Army of the Light can help us end this war.\nArgus. Throne of the Burning Legion. Its infernal machines provide Sargeras with an infinite army.\nTime to deprive the Dark Titan of his prize.\nOur course is clear. We must take the fight to Argus and bring the Legion to its knees.\nOne of the Legion's masters has fallen at last, yet this war is far from over.\nWas this the true plan of Sargeras all along? His ultimate endgame? Or perhaps this is another's doing. Someone who has betrayed this world before.\n&lt;Maiev narrows her eyes as she looks toward the sky.&gt;\nI will be watching... and ready.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

On May 20, 2008, the 3rd gate of the Sunwell Plateau was brought down on US Servers unlocking the encounter.\nStrategy.\nThe 5 phases of the Kil'jaeden encounter get progressively more difficult. Throughout phase 2 through 5, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; is flying from high above attacking Kil'jaeden with arcane bolts.\nPhase 1.\nInitially, three &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Deceiver%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Hands of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; are positioned next to the Sunwell, channeling &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;'s powers into the Sunwell. They have a significant aggro range, and are linked; however, due to the nature of their abilities, it is recommended that they be dragged apart immediately after the pull and tanked separately afterwards.\nAbilities:\nEnsure that the Hands are tanked far away from each other, stay out of the 30 yard range of the shadowbolt volleys if possible, mind the stacking debuff they apply, and this phase should be easy to master in a few pulls.\nOnce all three Hands are defeated, phase 2 begins.\nPhase 2.\nKil'jaeden arrives in a blaze of glory (literally). Upon spawning, he will knock back all players that are standing within the Sunwell. The knockback causes no damage. He is constantly doing ranged spell damage on mostly random targets.\nOnce you reduce Kil'jaeden to 85% HP, phase 3 will begin.\nPhase 3.\nBringing Kil'jaeden down to 85% will engage phase 3. At this point he will begin casting Shadow Spikes and summon Sinister Reflections. When the Shadow Spikes have finished, Kalecgos will empower 1 of the 4 Orbs of the Blue Dragonflight (which will from now on be referred to as dragon orbs for simplicity) located around the room. Kil'jaeden gains the following abilities:\nIt's imperative that you bring him down to 55% (engaging phase 4) before the third Darkness of a Thousand Souls of the phase or there will be no dragon available to use Shield of the Blue.\nPhase 4.\nBringing Kil'jaeden down to 55% starts phase 4, summoning new Sinister Reflections and causing him to start casting another round of Shadow Spikes (after which, Kalecgos will empower another dragon orb). This phase is almost identical to phase 3, however he gains a new ability (that's 9 for those counting):\nKeep in mind that he will continue to use all of the abilities he uses in phase 3. Again, it's imperative that you bring him down to 25% (engaging phase 5) before the third Darkness of a Thousand Souls of the phase or there will be no dragon available to use Shield of the Blue.\nPhase 5.\nBringing Kil'jaeden down to 25% will begin phase 5, causing him to summon another set of Sinister Reflections and begin casting Shadow Spikes again, and at the end of them Anveena sacrifices herself applying the following debuff to Kil'jaeden:\nAfter Anveena sacrifices herself, Kil'jaeden will be stunned for approximately 5 seconds, all 4 dragon orbs will be empowered and he will start using Darkness of a Thousand Souls on a very short cooldown (approximately 25 seconds). It's vital that you kill him within 8 Darkness of a Thousand Souls or there will be no dragons left to use Shield of the Blue. It's worth noting that 5 Armageddons will be in flight at any given time and will continue to spawn while Darkness of a Thousand Souls is being cast during this phase, and in addition Shield Orbs will stop spawning.\nUpon his defeat is a very awesome \"dismissal\" scene.\nDragon Orbs.\nApproximately 35 seconds into phase 3 and 4, Kalecgos will empower 1 of the 4 \"Orbs of the Blue Dragonflight\" around the room (or in the case of phase 5, all 4 will be empowered approximately 45 seconds in). Clicking one of these while it is empowered will transform you into a blue dragon with the following abilities for 2 minutes:\nIt's important to note that an orb can only be used once per phase and that the Shield of the Blue ability can only be used twice before the dragon dies.\nAt level 80.\nIdeal Raid Composition: 4 healers, 2 tanks, 19 dps\nAt level 80, the Kil'jaeden encounter is much less likely to wipe a raid due to the increases in health, hp and healing (let alone make it a requirement to use a dragon as dps can kill him before this). The following rules (broken down by phase) should be observed and followed to ensure a quick kill (avoiding Darkness of a Thousand Souls completely) with minimal deaths to the raid:\nPhase 1 (Hands of the Deceiver)\n1) It is possible now to group up the Hands of the Deceiver and aoe them along with any imps that are summoned as you should have the dps, hp and healing to do so.\nPhase 2 (100% Health)\n1) Assign 2-4 dps to immediately kill any Shield Orbs that are summoned. This goes for phases 3 to 5 as well. As the fight progresses, more Shield Orbs will be summoned at once.\nPhase 3 (85% Health)\n1) Tanks need to be ready to pick up Sinister Reflections immediately. This goes for phases 4 to 5 as well.\n2) Dps should be strong enough at this point to bring him into phase 4 (resetting his Darkness of a Thousand Souls ability cooldown (45sec)) before the need to use a blue dragon shield/orb.\nPhase 4 (55% Health)\n1) Immediately move out of his Armageddon ability (hellfire graphic).\nPhase 5 (25% Health)\n1) Kil'jaeden will take 25% increased Holy damage at this point. If you can spare it, have 1-2 of your holy based healers start damaging him before he casts Darkness of a Thousand Souls (which is now on a shorter cooldown)."}

He is the first paragon the player meets in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. He is a proud old soldier who saw value in allowing &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;outsiders&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the Klaxxi's war against .\nHistory.\nDeath From Above.\nUpon his breath Kil'ruk heard the song of the Empress guiding him to destroy attack those before the mantid swarm. While the rest of his flock curled up from exhaustion Kil'ruk continued on until he succumbed to fatigue on the fourth day. One day Kil'ruk witnesses a hawk in action and grew fascinated with it and attempted to emulate it by diving from the sky. Within record time he was able to dive at 25 strides from the sky. Unknown to Kil'ruk is action has grabbed the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; who began to watch him with growing interest.\nSometime after Kil'ruk desired a blade so that he could have talons in order to fight the battlements, though the ambersmith he spoke to was confused on why he wanted to do such a thing when he was a flyer. Kil'ruk's dedication also ensured by the tenth night he was able to dive seventy-five strides. Meanwhile on the fourteenth day of his life Kil'ruk earned the title Wind-Reaver for his successful actions in killing &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20Xuexing\"&gt;Taskmaster Xuexing&lt;/a&gt; and devastating the enemy when a desperate Xuexing tried to use the huatang in his last moments of life to kill the mantid, only to die and explode the energy around him. It was during this time that he successfully dived like a hawk, used his enemies swords like his own talons to the stunned amazement of his enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Nysis\"&gt;Nysis&lt;/a&gt;, and soon after his victory encounter the hawk that had inspired him. Kil'ruk would soon come to the conclusion that hawks tastes delicious.\nWhen sought to speak with the Wind-Reaver, Kil'ruk was confused on why Pok would be disappointed that he would not put aside the empress's commands. After a mogu relic cut the mantid swarm off from the voice of their empress, the Klaxxi made the decision to awaken to aid them and decided that Kil'ruk should be one to do so to ensure he's drawn out of his depression. With the tactics of the Bloodcaller, the Mogu were defeated and the artifact destroyed, though Kil'ruk was enraged that used a spell to bind himself to an urn thus robbing the Wind-Reaver of the opportunity to kill the mogu.\nMists of Pandaria.\nUsing an item received from a Klaxxi oracle, the Wind Reaver is the first Paragon the players awaken and is the one who guides players to the Klaxxi. He bestowed the title of &lt;a href=\"Wakener\"&gt;Wakener&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and took them to &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi%27vess\"&gt;Klaxxi'vess&lt;/a&gt;, where he was to execute them, but they were deemed useful and therefore spared. Eventually, he assisted the Wakener and his Paragon brethren in an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, Kil'ruk sees fit to give the Wakener a warning that the Mantid's loyalty have always been to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; whom they venerate as \"The Old One.\" He describes the hate the Mantid have for Titanic races, seeing them as the \"Children of the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Usurpers&lt;/a&gt;\" and that if the Old Gods should ever return, the Mantid will side with them.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; unearthed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing a common ally in Garrosh's True Horde and feeling the need to protect the last remnant of their god's body, Kil'ruk lead the &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;remaining Paragons&lt;/a&gt; to Orgrimmar to battle the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance's&lt;/a&gt; united front. He and the other paragons met their ends at the hands of the Wakener, who had sided against Garrosh and Y'Shaarj. However, his dying quote suggests that he could possibly return."}

The mysterious fighter begins to unravel his past, but lucky for him and his unlikely elvish allies, he doesn\u2019t need his memories to fight to the death! \nThis issue featured two covers that may be ordered separately. Cover A is by Blizzard Art Director Samwise Didier, and Cover B is by Jim Lee. A third cover, C, is a black and white version of Cover B by Jim Lee as is only found on second print copies.\nPlot.\nCroc-Bait duels the orc blademaster Hyku Steeledge. The orc overreaches, is smacked with Croc-Bait's cudgel, then bisected with the human's sword. Valeera ponders where he learned to fight while Rehgar heals her wounds. He tells her he had arranged the battle for the team to expect the unexpected. Valeera apologizes to Broll for mana tapping him earlier. Croc-Bait is awarded Hyku's twin swords for being the winner of the fight.\nIn the Hall of Legends, Rehgar and his gladiators enter the Crimson Ring's secret armory containing spoils of war. Valeera, Broll, and Croc-Bait get to pick something for themselves to use in the arena match at Dire Maul. Valeera picks twin orc daggers, Broll picks a stag-head staff, and Croc-Bait picks a lion's head belt. When he touches it, he gets a flashback. A bald, bearded man stands on the deck of a boat on the ocean in a storm. He is wearing the lionhead belt, and calls Croc-Bait \"lad\" and refers to an ongoing war.\nThe goblin Captain Grizzgear transports the team to Dire Maul via zeppelin. Underway, he talks of Sparkeye, the leader of the recently bested arena team, and of Rend Blackhand's Blackrock orcs wreaking havoc beyond Grim Batol and skirmishing across the Burning Steppes with Dark Iron dwarves who are moving from their deep caverns out into the world. Valeera mentions that Croc-Bait never smiles.\nDire Maul was built 12,000 years ago as Eldre'Thalas. The ogres stage yearly games in a small pocket near the city's northeastern wall. Rehgar's team is met with mockery and insults. An ogre boy throws a rotten pear on Broll, who enrages and goes into bear form. Only Croc-Bait keeps him from killing the ogreling by appealing to the night elf's conscience.\nLast year's Dire Maul champions are the \"Gordunni Clan of Ancient Draenor\". They are three ogres named Two-Heads, Giago and Brlee. They are all melee fighters, and Giago has ogre boss armor.\nIn individual trials, Broll defeats a centaur, Valeera kills a quilboar, and Croc-Bait offs a Frostmane troll by throwing his blademaster sword through its throat. The crowd is angered and keeps betting against the team while taunting them. The next day, the team faces the ogre trio.\nBrlee engages Croc-Bait, Two-Heads attacks Valeera, and Giago goes for Broll. The ogres attack, and only Broll doesn't manage to avoid the blow, taking the flail to the shoulder, then going bear form and hamstrimming the ogre boss. Croc-Bait lures Brlee closer to them and makes him accidentally kill Giago with a wide axe-swipe. Broll then gets trapped under the corpse.\nValeera tricks Two-Heads' two heads into arguing with each other. As he headslams himself, she slips away and helps Broll up. Meanwhile, Brlee's managed to cut up Croc-Bait's thigh, but a second blow is parried. Valeera runs in to help, but gets hit by Brlee's third swing. Croc-Bait, furious, drives his sword through the ogre's head.\nA purple (dark?) troll in the stands yells in surprise that the human moves like the spirit of Lo'Gosh himself. Broll carries Valeera away to heal her while Croc-Bait attacks Two-Heads who's just realized he's been duped. Croc-Bait leaps up, avoiding the ogre's blow, and cuts one of its heads off. The troll excitedly calls him Lo'Gosh, and the chant gets picked up by the crowd. The newly renamed human kills off the formerly two-headed ogre with a solid stab. The crowd screams Lo'Gosh repeatedly.\nRehgar explains that \"Lo'Gosh\" is &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; for \"Ghost Wolf\". Two days later, he sells Valeera for 2000 gold to Helka Grimtotem, who likes the blood elf's spunk, intelligence, and unpredictability, to use her as leader for an all-female arena team."}

Spiritbinding is a practice that deprives the dead of their eternal peace.\nFor many ages, the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; used flesh as a weapon: warped, bent, and twisted to their malevolent will. But after their failures in creating the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; race, the mogu sought to create another weapon... this time forged with total obedience. Their ancient research delivered to them methods of turning flesh to stone, and back again. Lifeless rock could be animated, providing a willing (or unwilling) &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; could be captured within. These dark rituals created the &lt;a href=\"Terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;Stoneborn&lt;/a&gt;, soldiers of jade and dark magic forged from the living essence of conquered victims. These creations were powerful... terrible to behold, and above all else, one hundred percent loyal to their mogu masters. Death was not final for some mogu, instead being a mere stop over on the path to a new body. Spiritbinders used their foul magic to transfer these spirits from one shell to the next.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Tomb of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; contains an &lt;a href=\"urn\"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt; of some remains of a powerful mogu spirit-binder. The ashes were eaten by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe mogu use &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Trap\"&gt;Spirit Trap&lt;/a&gt;s to capture spirits that they later use for rituals and conjurations. Spirit binding rituals are carried out within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ogudei\"&gt;Ruins of Ogudei&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Zandalari spiritbinders wear ornate scrimshaws. An example being a serpent intricately carved around a large snake fang.\nSpiritbound creatures share the harm dealt to them."}

Umbra simply smiled and said \"The greatest virtue is patience\".\nAfter Doyle and Eddie spent a few days in a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; village atop the back of a , Umbra shouted something to the &lt;a href=\"Megafin\"&gt;murloc leader&lt;/a&gt; and pointed in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Un'Goro, causing the entire village to begin moving in that direction. When they arrived at the foot of the volcano, Umbra took the two explorers aside and told them to climb the \"fire mountain\" to see \"the truth\", leaving Eddie to wonder what she meant.\nAfter a series of adventures, the two explorers reached a crystal cave which served as the home of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Galvadon\"&gt;Galvadon&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a group of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s from a lost expedition. The adventurers were informed that Umbra had told the paladins to expect Doyle and Eddie, and Eddie surmised that Umbra was the one who had sent the giant &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; that rescued them from &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;Fire Plume Ridge&lt;/a&gt; earlier. The paladins and adventurers mounted up on &lt;a href=\"stegodon\"&gt;stegodon&lt;/a&gt;s and began heading for the &lt;a href=\"Waygate%20%28location%29\"&gt;Waygate&lt;/a&gt;, but along the way they ran into trouble with some saurok. The saurok had amassed an army of dinosaurs and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, leading to an epic battle. According to Eddie, the real hero of the battle was Umbra, who started singing in an eerie voice, causing spirits to rise out of the heroes' allies and fight alongside them. Eventually, the saurok surrendered and joined in with the heroes on their journey to the Waygate. Once at the Waygate, &lt;a href=\"Amara%2C%20Warden%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Amara, Warden of Hope&lt;/a&gt; led a great ritual to open the gate, but Umbra kept looking at the sky and seemed anxious to get going. Suddenly a meteor appeared in the sky, but before long the Waygate flashed with blinding light and the meteor was gone. Everyone started going their separate ways, but before they left, Umbra and the tortollans solemnly thanked Doyle and Eddie and promised to help them get back to their expedition. Umbra made good on her promise and her pterrordax friend dropped the two adventurers off near where their adventure in Un'Goro originally began, though Eddie suspects that the beast dropped Doyle a little harder on purpose."}

{"id": "69526", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69526", "title": "Spiritwalker", "text": "Spiritwalkers or spirit walkers are mystical, white-furred &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; casters. They can enter an \"Ethereal Form\", allowing them to avoid physical damage. Believed to be the ill omen of a coming age, white tauren are held in near reverence by their people, often becoming reclusive priests who wander the land in search of kindred spirits. Spiritwalkers maintain the balance between the world of the living and the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;spirit realm&lt;/a&gt;. They can travel into the memories of the dead to glean clues about the past. &lt;a href=\"Fargaze%20Mesa\"&gt;Fargaze Mesa&lt;/a&gt; is a sacred place for them and come there to commune with ancestors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; have spiritwalkers as well, though they appear to be slightly different from those of the Kalimdor tauren as they lack the white fur. When a Highmountain spiritwalker begins communing with spirits, their eyes gloss over with white. The spiritwalkers of the &lt;a href=\"Feltotem%20tribe\"&gt;Feltotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; turned to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; after joining the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; visited some spiritwalkers in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; and asked them about &lt;a href=\"Huelo\"&gt;Huelo&lt;/a&gt;'s burial. They responded that the wolf doesn't need to be buried, as he lives in memories, and that the place of final goodbye is important.\nIn the RPG.\nSpirit walkers have a powerful connection to their ancestral heritage. Capable of channeling ancestral spirits through their body, spirit walkers are revered in &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; societies for the history and wisdom they carry within them. The eyes of a spirit walker are ancient and shine with the light of a thousand souls. Their bodies are vessels, conduits from the realm of the dead to the world of the living. Spirit walkers are often looked upon with awe and fear by their brethren. A spirit walker strong enough to bear the weight of so many souls achieves a mystical transcendence, embodying the collective will and experience of the generations that are reaching out to him.\nThey can use &lt;a href=\"tauren%20halberd\"&gt;tauren halberd&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren%20totem\"&gt;tauren totem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRole in Society.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s hold spirit walkers in near reverence, yet they also fear them. A spirit walker lives only partially in the mortal world. His mind roams freely, and countless personalities enter his memories and his thoughts. When speaking to a spirit walker one can never be entirely certain that only the spirit walker responds, for they speak with the voices of the ancient ancestors. Elderly spirit walkers sometimes lose all memories of their original selves, slipping from one spirit to the next without warning or control. The stress of handling so many souls turns a spirit walker's pelt or hair snow-white over the years. Some tribes consider a tauren born with a white pelt to be destined to become a spirit walker. Such children sometimes refuse their destiny, but almost all give in eventually. Elder tauren have been known to develop spirit walker powers sometimes only days before their deaths.\nMost spirit walkers learn of their unique natures during puberty. The young spirit walker experiences intense lucid dreams over the course of a month, and their waking hours still seem half-dreams as they begin to remember places they've never been to, recognize people they've never seen before or know how to handle situations they've never faced. The young spirit walker is confused and disoriented upon awakening, unable to decide if he is now truly awake or if the other life was his real one, and this life in fact is the dream. &lt;a href=\"Shamans\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt; can guide a spirit walker through the early stages of this transition, but those apart from their communities do not understand what is happening to them. Such spirit walkers may never fully resign themselves to their path after having been traumatized by their awakening. Not all spirit walkers realize their purpose in youth. A few live normal lives into adulthood until one night the lucid dreams begin. \nThe loyalty a spirit walker feels for his community is zealous. The spirits of countless ancestors fill his mind, impressing a powerful need upon their host to guide and safeguard the tribe. Despite this devotion, a spirit walker is often set apart from his others. He knows his friend not only as his friend, but as the child of a slain warrior spirit, as the grandchild of an elderly spirit, as the parent or sibling of a mournful child spirit. This makes any personal relationships complicated and very difficult. A spirit walker is a loner who sits apart from his others but defends them fanatically in times of peril. The rest of the tribe senses this conflict within a spirit walker, and while they treat their spirit walker with great respect and deference, they will resist forming close relationships with him to avoid further complicating his life. Spirit walkers rarely establish families. They live apart from the tribe they devote themselves to forever.\nProviding guidance and spiritual sanctuary to their community in times of the greatest peril and uncertainty is the spirit walker's sacred calling. These transcendent shamans channel the collective life's experiences of all the generations that preceded their own through their mortal frames, calling upon this sacred communal soul to attain profound wisdom and insights. By performing the chant of ages the spirit walker reaches out for the collective knowledge of his or her forebears, guiding the present generation through the hour of midnight and ensuring the people will persist to continue the chain of life. Recently spirit walkers have appeared in never before seen numbers, and many consider them the ill omens of things to come. Great courage and discipline is required for a spirit walker to unlock the true extent of his gifts, but those who persevere come to embody knowledge and willpower that is wholly beyond even the most experienced of shamans.\nRaces.\nThe only culture in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history known to have brought forth the spirit walkers are the formerly nomadic &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes. However, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish people have steadily been returning to the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic practices of their &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; ancestors, and the &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have taken a growing interest in the mystic phenomenon of spirit walking. Whether orc spirit walkers may have existed in Draenor's ancient past or not is lost to history, but when tauren and orcish shamans established contact with one another the tauren discerned that their orcish peers showed the potential for this level of spiritual awakening. To many of the orc shamans, the path of the spirit walker represents the only means left to them by which to recover the lost wisdom of their forebears.\nTies to the Emerald Dream?\nThe spiritwalker's soul shares a deep bond with the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. He can summon forth an animal spirit companion from the Emerald Dream. Killing the spirit companion on the mortal plane sends it back to the Emerald Dream.\nThe spiritwalker can step partially into the Emerald Dream, becoming immaterial for a short time. The spiritwalker still occupies his place on the &lt;a href=\"Plane%23Material%20Plane\"&gt;Material Plane&lt;/a&gt;, but has shifted to his \"Ethereal Form\", and can only affect the physical world with spellcasting while so shifted. Only the highly skilled spiritwalker can ethereally shift others."}

This gives the shaman another way to heal or do damage when its necessary to move in both &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the spell is active, knockbacks that would otherwise interrupt spellcasting by sending you flying (which is considered to be movement) will not interrupt your spells as you can continue to cast normally while in the air. It will also protect you against certain knockdown effects, allowing your character to continue casting while laying on the ground. This is not universally true for all knockback or knockdown effects, but can be very handy at times if you can anticipate the effects and activate Spiritwalker's Grace before you are hit."}

Their webs are used only to create egg cases and to wrap dying victims before feeding. Spitting spiders construct \"blinds\" with webbing, waiting to ambush animals. Several will pop out at once, spray the target, then retreat and wait for the prey to succumb to poison. Spitting spiders may spray poison in a 40-foot line or 20-foot con. This is paralatyc, and causes nausea, with a secondary result of paralysis. Both effects last several minutes, usually enough for the spitting spiders to close on the potential victim. Medium spitting spiders can spray in a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. Spitting spiders spit jets of acid at their prey. The spit carries poison, just as the spider\u2019s bite does.\nThey are a kind of &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Spider\"&gt;forest spider&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are an example of &lt;a href=\"vermin\"&gt;vermin&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is the 2nd &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt; and drops the &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; epic set gloves for all classes. He is one of three powerful black drakes who guard the way to their master, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, both Ebonroc and &lt;a href=\"Flamegor\"&gt;Flamegor&lt;/a&gt; join together in a single encounter. Ebonroc will cast Brand of Shadow and Flamegor will cast Brand of Flame, stacking debuffs which deal increasing damage over time. Both drakes must be killed at about the same time, or else the surviving drake will enrage.\nStrategy.\nThe strategy is quite straightforward. Position Ebonroc so that your tanks are in a corner, to avoid erratic knockback. A good example of placement is at the angle between the staircase he patrols on and the wall. Have your tanks be very focused on shadow of Ebonroc, use the CT_RaidAssist mod to see who gets it. Big Wigs also is incredibly useful for detecting this. \nAs soon a tank is affected by Shadow of Ebonroc, other tanks must immediately taunt Ebonroc off him. Keep Mortal Strike up on him all the time and the heals will be hard to notice. Like Firemaw, he does a wing buffet every now and then. Use an offtank to taunt him away from the MT so that he does not get the buffet (50% threat reduction). Note that Shadow of Ebonroc is a low level spell, and a little amount of shadow resist on your tanks (around 100) will reduce your chance of getting hit by it to 25%. \nA workable way to position is to assign 3 tanks for Ebonroc. Try and locate the side tanks at 3 and 9 o'clock where the MT is 12. The DPS should stay at 6 o'clock. One is to be the MT, one is to be the buffet eater, and one is just there for shadows of Ebonroc. Basically, if the MT gets the debuff, both tanks should try and taunt Ebonroc off (he resists a decent bit of the time, two taunts helps to ensure that he's not healing.) Come 15 seconds from the next wing buffet, the eater should stop taunting, to keep his taunt primed for just before the buffet. Be warned, the buffets can occur off as long as five seconds after the 30 second timer has expired, so the eater may have to tank for a bit. As nasty as the debuff is, it is critical that each tank have both challenging shout and mocking blow prepared in case their first taunt is resisted. \nHe does a Shadow Flame, but no other AoE attacks, everyone can remain in his LoS safely. The only danger is a caster pulling aggro right when he does Shadow Flame, which shouldn't happen if your tanks are taunting correctly. Have priests assigned to shield the main tank after each shadow flame, it is not necessary, but provides you with extra safety.\nDPS him quite fast as the tanks tend to get tired, its a very straining fight for them. Healers are not quite as stressed, since his only serious damage comes from Shadow Flame. If you pull aggro, vanish, feign death, or run to the corner. If your guild has a shadow spec'd priest, you may consider allowing him or her to DPS for this fight.\nGood luck and enjoy your purples!\nLoot.\nItems marked with a * in the table are shared between &lt;a href=\"Firemaw\"&gt;Firemaw&lt;/a&gt;, Ebonroc, and &lt;a href=\"Flamegor\"&gt;Flamegor&lt;/a&gt;. Only two &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; gloves will drop between the three drakes each reset.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He hunts in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, piling up the bodies of monsters, collecting gruesome trophies. He welcomes anyone who wishes to hunt beside him, and feels that if they can cleanse the caverns of monsters, he's one step toward healing the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. He is young, but when he gives orders, the druids listen. He sometimes clashes with &lt;a href=\"Nalpak\"&gt;Nalpak&lt;/a&gt;, who also stays near the caves, but the druids are drawn to Ebru's fierce optimism. Ebru focuses mainly on killing the raptors in the caves, believing that their creation was the first thing to taint the caves after Naralex\u2019s descent into nightmare."}

His egg was purified before he was born and was thus freed from the corruption of his dragonflight in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;former lair&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 years ago, making him the oldest uncorrupted black dragon in existence. Ever since, Ebyssian has watched over Huln's descendants under the disguise of a &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; named Ebonhorn.\nWhen Ebyssian leaves &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, he risks the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; trying to corrupt him, which happened when he attended a feast in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and again when he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Ebyssian is now able to freely travel from Highmountain.\nFollowing the events in &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, Ebyssian was chosen by the main surviving members of his flight to be their new Aspect. Shortly after he along with Merithra got new looks befitting an Aspect!\nBiography.\nBirth.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to banish the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt; and him came across a batch of black dragon eggs in the back of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Igrul argued that they should all be destroyed, but Huln instead used the Hammer to purify one of the eggs, permanently freeing it from the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, it hatched, and the black &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt; emerged. Huln declared that he would call it \"Ebonhorn\" after its tiny black horns.\nWhile Ebyssian apparently chose his own name to go by, in gratitude he has since faithfully served the Highmountain family under the guise of &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;Spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; Ebonhorn, guiding each of Huln's descendants during their reigns as High Chieftain and only revealing his true identity to them upon their secretive ascension ceremony.\nA Mountain Divided.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Ebonhorn called a meeting between the leaders of the tauren tribes \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;Ulan Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torok%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Torok Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as well as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;. There, he revealed that he had seen a message left by the spirits deep within Neltharion's Vault: that the Legion's fall would come at the hands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from outside Highmountain, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; and aided by all the peoples of an undivided Highmountain. This caused outrage among Dargrul and the tauren chieftains, who said that the Hammer belonged to the people of Highmountain alone. Ulan responded that the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; would obey the spirits, and Jale, Lasan, and Torok begrudgingly said that their tribes would do so as well. Dargrul, however, claimed that he had also visited Neltharion's Vault but had seen nothing of outsiders \u2014 only that strength would drive back the Legion. Without warning, he leaped forward and grabbed the hammer, using it to kill Ulan before fleeing. Distraught, Ebonhorn said that he never meant for the tragedy to happen. Ulan's daughter &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt;, now High Chieftain, replied, \"But it did.\"\nLegion.\nEbonhorn is first seen at &lt;a href=\"Riverbend\"&gt;Riverbend&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane tribe&lt;/a&gt;, moments prior to the drogbar attack. Jale Rivermane calls him a \"fool\", but nonetheless asks the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to evacuate the Riverbend villagers and direct them to the spiritwalker. When Dargrul arrives and uses the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to destroy most of Riverbend, Ebonhorn directs the adventurer to kill the drogbar raiders and rescuing some of the tauren caught in magical stone fists, after which they meet up with &lt;a href=\"Warbrave%20Oro\"&gt;Warbrave Oro&lt;/a&gt;. After Oro's failed attempt to kill Dargrul, which results in the death of him and all of his warbraves, Ebonhorn asks the adventurer to escort Jale to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;, after which he travels there as well.\nAccording to Mayla, Ebonhorn insists on showing the champion the ways of the Highmountain tauren to make them better understand what is to come. Through a series of visions, the spiritwalker shows the hero the tale of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary tauren hero who fought in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. After the visions conclude, Ebonhorn travels with Mayla to the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Huln\"&gt;Path of Huln&lt;/a&gt; in order to perform a ritual to aid in her ascension to the title of High Chieftain. Asking the hero to act as Mayla's champion during the vision quest, the spiritwalker escorts the adventurer and the chieftain to Neltharion's Vault. Together, the three witness several visions depicting Huln Highmountain using the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to banish the corrupted Earth Warder Deathwing from Highmountain. Before entering the final vision, Ebonhorn says that the tauren need a leader like Huln, who has the strength and courage to face any obstacle, and that there is one final vision Mayla must see before she is ready to become High Chieftain.\nUpon entering the vision, the story of Ebyssian's birth is told, as Huln uses the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to purify a dragon egg as &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer protect him from the vault's &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Reclaimer\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt;. As the vision ends, Spiritwalker Ebonhorn transforms into his true form and reveals himself as Ebyssian to Mayla. Mayla is shocked at this revelation, but Ebyssian assures her that he is still the same spiritwalker she has known her entire life before at last pronouncing her as High Chieftain.\nAfter the adventurer departs from the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Overlook\"&gt;Obsidian Overlook&lt;/a&gt; outside of the vault, Ebonhorn is not seen for the remainder of the Highmountain storyline, but later travels with &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt; and a small group of adventurers into the drogbar capital of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, where they are to put an end to Dargrul's reign and reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. After overcoming the inhabitants of the drogbar city, the heroes succeed in killing Dargrul and securing the hammer, thus ending the drogbar threat. Ebyssian commends them for their accomplishments before departing, mentioning that he has some \"other family matters\" that require his attention.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter corresponding with Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; accepted an invitation to attend a feast in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Yet when Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; greeted their &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; guests, Spiritwalker Ebonhorn was tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt; attempting to corrupt him, and he and Mayla were forced to retreat back to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; while Baine and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion defended Thunder Bluff from Uul'gyneth's invasion force. Apparently, the wards Ebonhorn had been maintaining in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; weakened just enough to let the Darkness seep through.\nLater on, Baine and the Horde champion traveled to Thunder Totem to offer their aid to mend Ebonhorn, who has been fighting unconsciously to keep a darkness from consuming him. Mayla sent the Horde champion to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Graysky\"&gt;Spiritwalker Graysky&lt;/a&gt;, who has the Horde champion undergo &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker\"&gt;Spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; rituals to walk in the memories of &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oenia%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Oenia Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore the wards that kept the dark corrupting forces at bay. After restoring the wards, Ebonhorn regained consciousness and revealed Uul'gyneth sought to return and conquer Highmountain. Baine, Mayla, the Horde champion, and Ebonhorn left to join &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate Uul'gyneth and restore the final ward. They failed, however, and Uul'gyneth was summoned into the physical realm, leaving the Horde champion little choice but to vanquish Uul'gyneth. Ebonhorn revealed his true, draconic form, but Baine agreed to keep it a secret. As a result of these events, the Highmountain tauren pledged themselves to the Horde.\nAt Baine's request, Ebonhorn participated in a seance alongside the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; to call on the spirit of the late Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. When Baine asked Vol'jin who it was who had told him on his deathbed to make &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; the new warchief, spirits of the dead attacked to silence the question. Ebonhorn then traveled with Baine to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the place where Vol'jin was mortally wounded, to call on Vol'jin's spirit there and hopefully shed light on the mystery.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to return to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;, he asked them to speak with &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt;, who directed them to obtain the magical essences of the dragonflights in order to fortify the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. With the task at end, MOTHER directed champions to &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, where they encountered Ebonhorn. Upon meeting with adventurers, Ebonhorn remarked that he had sensed something deep beneath Highmountain within Neltharion's Lair. After &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt; brought the pair into the lair, Ebonhorn was stunned to discover that the &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Ebony%20Scale%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; was in possession of &lt;a href=\"Ma%27haat%20the%20Indomitable\"&gt;Ma'haat the Indomitable&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stone%20lord\"&gt;stone lord&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. Noting that their kind harbors enmity toward the black dragonflight, Ebonhorn directed champions to heal the fissures with the Heart of Azeroth. Seeking the essence, Ebonhorn and his ally clashed with Ma'haat, who yielded to their power. Declaring them worthy, Ma'haat gave them the essence while warning that the &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Stonemother&lt;/a&gt; would be watching.\nFeeling that he owed it to his fallen kin to prevent the power of his &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;fallen kind&lt;/a&gt; from being used for evil, Ebonhorn journeyed to the Chamber of Heart, where he was welcomed by Magni and identified by MOTHER as a black dragon. After pointing out that Neltharion was once tasked with protecting Azeroth, Ebonhorn revealed that he saw it as his duty to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Ebony%20Scale\"&gt;Petrified Ebony Scale&lt;/a&gt; carried on that legacy. Thus, he gave the essence to his allies so that they could empower the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt; with its power.\nEbyssian was later joined by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the Heart of Azeroth.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed, Ebonhorn nearly succumbed to its whispers and would have been killed by MOTHER without Magni's intervention. Seeking to save Ebonhorn, Magni called on heroes to venture to the Chamber of Heart. Under the advice of Kalecgos, the hero sought out &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; in order save Ebonhorn. Though unable to meet with Wrathion, heroes did acquire a potion of his creation that they used to save Ebonhorn.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nSometime after Wrathion arrived to the Chamber of Heart, Ebyssian inquired as to how the Black Prince had known he had begun to hear &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers. In response, Wrathion admitted that he had one of his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Watcher\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; watching over him due to knowing that Ebyssian would become vulnerable upon leaving &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. In surprise, Ebyssian remarked that he was unaware that Wrathion had such a personal concern for his well-being, causing the younger dragon to remark that they were brothers and the only one that Wrathion had left.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; are uncovered, Ebyssian and Wrathion travel to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and discover the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, ancient creations of Neltharion that had been in stasis for 20,000 years. They help the dracthyr battle the invading &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and the freed &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;. When the Primalists flee &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; tells the dracthyr to warn the nations of the world of the oncoming threat, and Ebyssian takes the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to introduce them to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. As they arrived to Orgrimmar, they were met by hostile guards, however &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; soon arrived and diffused the situation. She then guided Ebyssian and Cindrethresh to the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, where Ebyssian presented the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; invitation to visit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nEbyssian, Ebyssian, Mayla, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; met together soon after, where Ebyssian explained how the isles held great wonder and many perils and that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would not abide conflict on their shores. Following the meeting, he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; near the port, where he put &lt;a href=\"Naleidea%20Rivergleam\"&gt;Naleidea Rivergleam&lt;/a&gt; at ease when &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; arrived. After Khadgar shared that the Aspects sought to restore their former powers to fight against Raszageth, Ebyssian directed them to find a &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;disc&lt;/a&gt; within , only to learn from them that the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; had attacked and sent the disc to be lost through time. After receiving the news, he declared that the infinites were troublesome, and that he would let Alexstrasza know that they would need to find another way for the Aspects to restore their powers. He was then present to witness the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; depart for the isles and informed Naleidea that Wrathion and an &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would be awaiting them at the &lt;a href=\"Wingrest%20Embassy\"&gt;Wingrest Embassy&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, her storms around the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; vanished, opening the way for the dracthyr and their allies to return. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt;, who viewed the isle as the closet thing to a home the dracthyr had was determined to claim it and had the support of Ebyssian, who tried to take on an advisory role for the Scalecommander. However, it was not a smooth partnership, with Emberthal making it clear that she was not pleased with Ebyssian's decision to hide from the rest of the world and frequently criticized Ebyssian as the pair worked together, even as he attempted to diffuse matters. When Emberthal, &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Damos\"&gt;Talon Damos&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers headed off to the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Atheneum\"&gt;Lost Atheneum&lt;/a&gt;, Ebyssian remained behind at &lt;a href=\"Morqut%20Village\"&gt;Morqut Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time, Ebyssian learned that the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; had arrived to the isle and had begun attacking members of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"High%20Creche\"&gt;High Creche&lt;/a&gt;. He thus sought out Emberthal and her dracthyr to aid the expedition, only to discover that Emberthal was the only survivor of a Sundered Flame attack led by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;. As he offered comfort to Emberthal for her loss, she lashed out at him demanding to know how many black dragons he had lost, causing Ebyssian to remark that while he had never buried his own, he did help bury generations of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. A surprised Emberthal then realized that they had both lost many who were close to them. As the duo fought against the Sundered Flame, Ebyssian tasked adventurers with rescuing members of the expedition. In time, the group discovered the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Adamanthia\"&gt;Adamanthia&lt;/a&gt; trapped in stasis, and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; was not only responsible but had used her as a means to imprison and draw the essence of the black dragonflight from the dracthyr during their imprisonment. Though desiring to free her from her torment, Ebyssian advised caution and declared that they should learn more before attempting to destroy her oubliette.\nAfter discovering that Sarkareth was at &lt;a href=\"Dragonskull%20Island\"&gt;Dragonskull Island&lt;/a&gt;, Emberthal and Ebyssian once more had a clash of views, before Emberthal headed off to the island alone. However as Emberthal was prepared to do battle with Sarkareth and his followers, Ebyssian arrived to provide assistance. Despite her desire to bring justice to her fallen allies, Emberthal could not bring herself to slaughter other dracthyr, and so Sarkareth was able to accept. In the face of Sarkareth calling Emberthal a coward, Ebyssian countered it wasn't weakness that stayed her hand, but the strength in her compassion, conviction, and loyalty to her people, which should be an inspiration to them all. He then approached Emberthal and questioned what she would do if she followed Sarkareth, causing her to remark that she would extinguish him as she had been trained to do. In response, he remarked that the enemy was one of her own, as were the dracthyr that followed him, and that like her they were soldiers who had been conditioned to claim victory at any cost. Outraged Emberthal asked how Ebyssian could presume to know them after he hid amongst the mortals while other dragons fought and died to protect the world. Ebyssian then acknowledged that she was right, he had turned away from the world, and he was just content to be \"Ebonhorn\" with &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; as his home. He admitted that while he should have done more, his shame as Neltharion's offspring prevented that, and that he had come to the Forbidden Reach to face that, only to find her. When Emberthal declared he must be disappointed, he rejected the notion by pointing out that she had defied his voice inside of her, that she chose compassion over violence, and declared that their family doesn't have to live in his shadow. He then vowed that they would help one another, as he promised to aid Emberthal in ensuring that Sarkareth would face justice for all he had done.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Incarnates\"&gt;Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; called upon Ebyssian, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. While Sabellian and Wrathion immediately set off to the caverns, Ebyssian detoured and recruited &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; to their mission. Unwillingly to wait for Ebyssian and Emberthal to arrive, Sabellian and Wrathion ventured forth into the caverns, where they did battle with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, lost a skirmish against Fyrakk, and made allies of the &lt;a href=\"Loamm%20Niffen\"&gt;Loamm Niffen&lt;/a&gt;. Thus when Ebyssian and Emberthal arrived, they found a safe haven in &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt;, with Ebyssian considering lucky that the &lt;a href=\"niffen\"&gt;niffen&lt;/a&gt; were being so welcoming and generous and expressed gratitude that they had given them a place to recover and plan their next move. However, he did admit that he would have preferred if they had waited for his and Emberthal's arrival, though notes it is unlikely the outcome would have been changed. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that they were hearing whispers from within the caverns and Sabellian shared that he had discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; were seeking a laboratory known as &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Sabellian and Wrathion focused on dealing with Fyrakk, Ebyssian aided Emberthal in finding &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and dealing with the Sundered Flame. Thus he joined Emberthal in venturing to &lt;a href=\"Nal%20ks%27kol\"&gt;Nal ks'kol&lt;/a&gt;, a titan facility in the southeastern portion of Zaralek. After the pair were able to enter the vault, they discovered Sarkareth and the Sundered Flame had not only entered before them, but that Sarkareth had claimed &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, the artifact &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; used to control the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. Though Sarkareth attempted to use the artifact to enslave all his kin, he was thwarted by adventurers, an the artifact was destroyed by Emberthal. In the aftermath, an outraged Sarkareth claimed that Neltharion called to them from Aberrus, which confused both Emberthal and brought worry from Ebyssian. Though Sarkareth was able to flee, Ebyssian remarked that the dracthyr present were now freed and voiced hope that Emberthal would be able to find peace once the conflict was over.\nEbyssian felt deep pride that Emberthal was once more blossoming into a confident leader and stated his belief that her people would her. He further voiced that the Oathbinder was a reminder of the horrors of Neltharion's legacy and the folly of following him. Upon returning to Loamm and seeing if his brothers had discovered a means to stop Fyrakk, Ebyssian instead found himself being questioned by the pair as to what treasures he and Emberthal had found. Unimpressed with their content, he questioned what was truly important and who was the rightful heir to a legacy of deceit, control, and fear. When Sabellian and Wrathion grew outraged at the destruction of the Oathbinder, Ebyssian called them out on their bickering, declared that Emberthal had done right for her people, and encouraged them to let go of the past, as their flight needed them here and now.\nBelieving that Fyrakk's was within the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, Sabellian recruited Ebyssian and adventures with investigating the area and dealing with him. Upon the trio's arrival, they discovered a host of &lt;a href=\"Djaradin\"&gt;Djaradin&lt;/a&gt; within the area, the dragons also noted how the whispers had more power after their arrival at &lt;a href=\"Igira%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Igira's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Ebyssian was surprised by the presence of the djaradin and wondered if they were searching for their lost elders within the caverns. Not only did the group discover that the djaradin had discovered their elders, albeit only three with the fourth one missing, but also the presence of &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, the very poison that drove Neltharion to madness. With this discovery, Ebyssian declared that they had to stop it, in order to prevent the corruption from spreading.\nAs the group did combat with the Zaqali djaradin, Ebyssian directed adventurers with investigating the Zaqali belongings near the shrines of the elders, in an attempt to understand what they were facing. From this Ebyssian learned that &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; had a deal with the djaradin and sent them to awaken their elders, though Ebyssian wondered if this alliance was born from fighting against a common enemy or if Iridikron was receiving something else from it. As they ventured further, they discovered that Fyrakk had already awakened two of the djaradin elders, and did battle against enemy leaders. However, to their horror, they discovered that Fyrakk was bathing within shadowflame and consuming it. Fyrakk subsequently noticed them and attacked, leaving Sabellian infected, and Ebyssian carrying the group to safety on the dragon's back. Amused Fyrakk let them flee, while declaring that he would master what their flight could not control.\nReeling from what transpired, Ebyssian questioned if Iridikron intentionally corrupted his brother or if Fyrakk merely fell into the temptation and vowed he would not lose Sabellian. For his part, Sabellian encouraged Ebyssian to focus on Fyrakk instead of him, only to be soundly rejected as Ebyssian refused to lose anyone to the shadowflame. Following the shadowflame cleansing ritual, the group prevented the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Igira\"&gt;Zaqali's final elder&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to stop Fyrakk before they left the area, Sabellian had adventurers acquire a &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Dragonslayer%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Zaqali Dragonslayer's Spear&lt;/a&gt;, while Ebyssian questioned if these were the words of the general who protected the flight in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; or a defeated warrior looking for revenge. In response, Sabellian declared that they were one in the same as revenge was how he protected their people in Outland. Agreeing with Sabellian's plan, the group ventured off to find Fyrakk, only to discover that he had grown larger as he absorbed the caldera. Undaunted Sabellian attempted to assassinate Fyrakk only to fail as the Incarnate had been prepared for an attempt by the djaradin. With a blast of shadowflame, Fyrakk blasted them away and awakened Igira. As Ebyssian attempted to bring Sabellian and the adventurer to safety, he was pierced by the elder's spear and collapsed to the ground.\nUnwilling to leave Ebyssian, after he had refused to leave him Sabellian remained by his side and healed him, while the adventurer pulled the spear from his hide. Still wounded, Ebyssian and Sabellian had to travel by ground and instructed adventurers with cleansing shadowflame left in Fyrakk's wake by &lt;a href=\"dragonriding\"&gt;dragonriding&lt;/a&gt; through it and to meet them in Loamm once were done. Upon their arrival to the town, the dragons discovered Loamm bathed in flame. Realizing the Fyrakk deliberately attacked the town, an outraged Ebyssian instructed his allies with saving Loamm and the niffen who called it home. Working side by side, the pair discovered &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Honeypelt\"&gt;Elder Honeypelt&lt;/a&gt;, who was in shock that her assistant &lt;a href=\"Brynnsahce\"&gt;Brynnsahce&lt;/a&gt; was killed in the attack. Unwilling to leave him behind, Ebyssian personally carried Brynnsahce's corpse so that Honeypelt would come to safety. In the aftermath, Sabellian blamed himself which Ebyssian reassured him that it wasn't his fault, that Fyrakk would have caused this suffering regardless of their actions. Thus the pair then reunited with Wrathion and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Seat of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to inform Alexstrasza and the others of what had inspired. Upon learning that shadowflame resided within Zaralek, Alexstrasza initially barred the black dragonflight from returning, unwillingly to risk losing them, before Ebyssian convinced her that they had the strength to resist what lies below.\nSometime later, Ebyssian and his brothers returned to the Zaralek Caverns where they worked with a group of soldiers stationed by &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Rest\"&gt;Obsidian Rest&lt;/a&gt;, who remained loyal to the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. When questioned by adventurers on why Aberrus was so important, Ebyssian revealed that it was Neltharion's secret laboratory, long before any of them were born, and while many have different intentions for it, their main task was ensuring that anything remaining within does not end up in the hands of their enemies. Ebyssian's first task for adventurers was for them to acquire information and resources at the Obsidian Rest, before sending them to work with &lt;a href=\"Field%20Commander%20Ignax\"&gt;Field Commander Ignax&lt;/a&gt;. Ebyssian later arrived and personally fought with adventures against the djaradin within the &lt;a href=\"Battlefield%20Ruins\"&gt;Battlefield Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that a group of djaradin had been killed by a group of unknown &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; force that still carried Neltharion's banner, and learned of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s. Recognizing that the Neltharion loyalists intended to enslave the slitherdrakes, Ebyssian sent his allies to disrupt their operations and free the slitherdrakes.\nWith the slitherdrakes freed, Ebyssian then turned his attention to honoring his promises to Emberthal and came to aid her in the battle against Sarkareth. As they traveled to aid her, Ebyssian admitted to adventurers that he was saddened by the continued fighting between Wrathion and Sabellian, that they were unable to put their ambitions and differences aside for even a moment. After coming to Emberthal's aid in battle, Ebyssian witnessed Sarkareth fleeing into Aberrus causing him to realize that Sarkareth wielding Oathbinder, or even having a shard of it, had ensured that Aberrus would be on his side. Knowing that the time had come to assault Aberrus Ebyssian was able to rally Sabellian and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt; and Wrathion and the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalons&lt;/a&gt; for the assault and united them with Emberthal. Thus the black dragonflight fought against Sarkareth's within the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Garrison\"&gt;Brimstone Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, defeating them, and forcing Sarkareth to retreat within the safety of Aberrus.\nAs Sabellian and Wrathion rushed off to prevent Sarkareth from gaining control of the lab, Ebyssian was surprised that Emberthal decided not to pursue him. In response, Emberthal that he knows that Sarkareth will face but she had grown weary of fighting her own kin and voiced her own surprise that he didn't join them. After a moment of silence, Ebyssian admitted that he felt that the two have to face this without him and that he hopes in their pursuit they would come to see that Neltharion's legacy is death and nothing more. Thus Emberthal invited Ebyssian to join her in finding dracthyr who have yet succumbed to that fate. Despite having no interest in following his brothers into Aberrus, Ebyssian remained concerned for their safety and so encouraged adventurers to stand with them and with killing Sarkareth.\nIn the aftermath of Sarkareth's death, Ebyssian remarked that his hubris left him vulnerable to the dark influences that have assaulted the black dragonflight for millennia, just as Neltharion before him. He then ventured into Aberrus, alongside his allies, to order to help Emberthal seek what answers she could. Recognizing that Emberthal had been grieving Sarkareth for some time, Ebyssian instructed his allies with gathering the shards of Sarkareth's signet, believing that she would appreciate the gesture. In the end, Ebyssian proved correct, as Emberthal made the decision to treat Sarkareth's corpse with respect, with the hope that his memory would be a lesson, for others to not follow the illusion of Neltharion's legacy, and vowed that it was time for the dracthyr to make their own path. Ebyssian then questioned where she hoped it would lead, causing the Scalecommander to admit that she hoped to lead far from the shadows of the past that have haunted them, to make them free to build a legacy of their own, and admitted that it was Ebyssian himself who had inspired herself to believe in such a future.\nIn turn, Sabellian and Wrathion both reflected on Neltharion's legacy as both the Earth-Warder and Deathwing and each made the decision to step down, leaving Ebyssian to be the future Aspect and leader of the black dragonflight. Ebyssian was deeply humbled and vowed that their trust and faith would guide his every step. He thus declared that the black dragonflight's legacy was theirs to create and declared that his act as Aspect was to inform Alexstrasza and the others of what had transpired within Aberrus and of the future of the black dragonflight. After the deed was done, Ebyssian took the place by his fellow Aspects as the new Earth-Warder, with Sabellian and Wrathion by his side as his general and diplomat. In the aftermath, Alexstrasza declared that the threat of Aberrus had been quailed and had made them grow stronger, while declaring that soon Azeroth would welcome a &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;symbol hope&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and that they would protect it. Ebyssian reflected that after the black dragonflight spent thousands of years consuming corruption, paranoia, and chaos they needed unity, now more than ever. He then remarked that without the aid of adventurers, the unity would never have occurred and formally thanked them.\nFractures in Time.\nAfter Ebyssian and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; decided to unbind the ancient siphons that were extracting the black dragonflight essence from dracthyr and &lt;a href=\"Adamanthia\"&gt;Adamanthia&lt;/a&gt; from her imprisonment, Emberthal called upon Dracthyr adventures to aid them. However due to her long time in stasis, she lashed out against the trio only for the fighting to cease when she came to her senses. In the aftermath, Ebyssian reflected on how he sensed none of the corruption that plagued Neltharion and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. He then revealed that it would take time for her to heal and that once she had done so, he would let her make her own path in life.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nIt was I who told the Chieftains and the Underking that we would need to give the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to outsiders so that the Legion could be defeated.

Much like the orcs created &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it's possible that the Darkspear colonized their home on the nearby Echo Isles after the war as well. The Isles were home to &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Sea%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;deathlord&lt;/a&gt; with skeletons.\nHowever, sometime after &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Alliance\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; attacked their new home, forcing them to flee, but not before the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions aided troll &lt;a href=\"batrider\"&gt;batrider&lt;/a&gt;s in destroying &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. After the trolls were successfully evacuated, they established a new base on the mainland of Kalimdor.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the defeat of Admiral Proudmoore, these islands were once again available to the Darkspears. The trolls, however, only had a few moments to settle down on the Isles before one of their own, &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed them. The &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;, somehow learning the secrets of undeath, took his people by surprise using his zombies and other minions. This once again forced &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the other survivors to retreat back to the shores of Durotar. It was on that shore, now known as &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Strand\"&gt;Darkspear Strand&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin founded &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe warlock Zalazane disrupted the normal flow of magic in Durotar. He did this through tainted fetishes, ju-ju heaps, which he had placed among his huts on the main Echo Isle. These heaps corrupted the wildlife and gave power to the warlocks and infernal creatures that lurked in the land's dark corners. &lt;a href=\"Un%27Thuwa\"&gt;Un'Thuwa&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy the ju-ju heaps, eventually resulting in the flow of magic in Durotar returning to normal.\nZalazane continued to send his undead trolls to the mainland, to hex Darkspear trolls and drag more of them under his sway.\nIt is from Sen'jin Village that numerous attempts have been made to oust Zalazane and reclaim the islands, but Zalazane continuously managed to fool &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into believing that they had slain him.\nAfter rallying troll citizens and adventurers of the Horde, along with the help of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear tribe finally killed Zalazane and retook the isles.\nZalazane's Fall.\n&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Dancer\"&gt;Ritual Dancer&lt;/a&gt;s could be briefly found on the isles near the ruins of their homes before Cataclysm but after the retake. Some could also be found dancing around the remains of Zalazane, on the isle that would soon to be known as &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Zalazane's Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription from the official site.\n\"After years in exile, the Darkspear trolls are preparing to invade the Echo Isles and reclaim the land once bestowed to them by Thrall. Led by Vol'jin, a wise and highly regarded Darkspear, the tribe's bravest warriors will set out from Orgrimmar and Sen'jin Village, seeking to bring about Zalazane's fall and begin the process of rebuilding their homes and villages on the Echo Isles. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, new troll adventurers will begin their journey on these tiny islands off the coast of Durotar, where they'll be able to experience this time of trial and transition firsthand.\"\nThough the Darkspears may once again have their land, the tribe's turmoil is far from over. The impending cataclysm will spark rivalry among the Horde leadership, and after years of running from a seemingly endless string of conflicts to preserve the Darkspear nation, Vol'jin is done fleeing. The Darkspears have reclaimed their islands and have no intention of settling elsewhere. Of course, as an untested member of the tribe, you'll have some training to do before tackling the Darkspears' larger matters.\nEvery great hero starts somewhere. As a troll of the Echo Isles, the journey begins with safeguarding your people's well-being. Early in your adventures, you'll be charged with protecting the local Bloodtalon raptors and hatchlings from the sorcery of a nearby sea witch, slaying the beasts that feast upon the Darkspears' primary food sources, and assaulting the naga who've overrun the northern isle. But it won't be long before Vol'jin trusts you with vital\u2014and potentially dangerous\u2014information about the political struggles plaguing the Horde and, ultimately, the fellow members of your tribe.\nIn World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, you'll face these trials and more in the trolls' new and enhanced introductory questing experience (level 1 to 5). Be steadfast and honorable, and your actions will help usher in a new era of Darkspear perseverance in a time of ultimate peril.\nCataclysm.\nSince \"\", Echo Isles was reclaimed and became the starting zone for new trolls. They begin their training and are helped along the way by &lt;a href=\"Zuni\"&gt;Zuni&lt;/a&gt;, but not everything is well. &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Bloodtalon\"&gt;The raptors&lt;/a&gt; are acting strangely, and the trolls will soon find their homeland threatened again, this time by the &lt;a href=\"Spitescale\"&gt;Spitescale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt; the Sea Witch. As players quest throughout the zone they develop a friendship with Zuni and eventually fight side by side with Vol'jin against Zar'jira in order put an end to the invading Naga. After a fierce battle, Zar'jira is slain, but not before she killed Zuni.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Pandaren Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt was made to kill &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time he also sent the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; to these isles and declared martial law, chaining up the trolls to prevent an uprising. These Kor'kron were led by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27tar%20the%20Subjugator\"&gt;Gul'tar the Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; ends up aiding the trolls liberate their home, since he believed the Horde would have been nothing if not for the Darkspears.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA new dock was added connecting the Echo Isles to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch of the Horde's naval power was docked at the Echo Isles. Alliance forces were sent to infiltrate the troll capital and set fire to their ships. As such, the Horde constructed greater defenses around their largest port.\nThe Echo Isles came under attack once again by Zalazane, who broke free of Bwonsamdi and came back as a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; with an army of undead. He was slain using Vol'jin's glaive.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThere are two maps of the Echo Isles in \":\nThe following monsters were present but didn't appear in \"World of Warcraft\":\nIn the RPG.\nThe Echo Isles are found off the southern tip of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; settled in Durotar, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; made these islands available to the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; decided that the trolls did not need the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s as allies and began practicing dark magic. He drove his fellow trolls off of the islands, converted followers, and created the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s who now inhabit the Echo Isles. There is the suspicion that an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; may have influenced Zalazane, since they seem to have a monopoly on zombie-creating crazies. Most of the Darkspear tribe relocated on &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; in Durotar's coast after Zalazane drove them out. The trolls are trying to fight their way back to reclaiming their island home.\nZalazane's experiments on the Echo Isles progressed much further than the Horde ever anticipated, and the trolls there created greater undead, such as &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. Warchief Thrall is planning to call for a full assault on the isles before the situation escalates.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Although he's still as powerful as the tauren high chieftain from the present, within this shattered future Azeroth, this guilt-ridden echo is little more than a discordant vessel of unquenchable malice and anger.\"\nStrategy.\nEcho of Baine is a dps race with emphasis on movement, and has a totem throwing mechanic.\nEcho of Baine begins on the most northwest platform. The tank and melee dps should begin the fight from an adjacent platform, and ranged and heals should begin at the platform opposite Baine. The strategy example shown on the diagram refers to these platforms as 4 and 1, respectively.\nThe tank pulls Baine from platform 3 to 4. As Baine enters the magma, he receives Molten Mace, a short-duration buff to weapon damage. It is advisable for the tank to retreat to the back of the platform, so that Baine wastes part of his buff duration closing the distance to the tank and has less time to melee while buffed. Some slow effects can extend this delay in damage. This process can be repeated following each cast of Pulverize, as Baine will enter the Magma when returning to the tank.\nDuring the fight, the tank and melee position themselves as near as possible to the healer without touching the magma, and all ranged and the healer position themselves as close to the Echo of Baine, to reduce time spent in the magma after the totem pushback effect.\nEcho of Baine will cast Throw Totem, knocking back a player with a totem. This totem can be thrown back to Baine, stunning him and delivering damage equal to 5% of his maximum health. To accomplish this, click the totem after it lands. Then you will be given a tiny green targeting circle. Place the circle at Baine's feet and click the mouse to throw the totem and stun him. Any person can click the totem to throw it (and it's probably easier for the person who didn't get punted into the lava).\nEchoe of Baine will leap to a ranged player and cast Pulverize, which most notably sinks the platform, so that ranged players must move to a new platform. In the illustrated example, players will swim from platform 1 to 2 after the first Pulverize, then to platform 3, then 4, after subsequent Pulverizes. Note the stacking damage when a player swims in magma, which is moderate.\nEcho of Baine should be killed before he pulverizes platform 4, as the magma's stacking damage will quickly overwhelm healing once all platforms are submerged."}

In this future Azeroth, she is only divided, and waiting...\"\nStrategy.\nBefore battling Jaina herself, your party must collect the 16 pieces of her shattered staff around the shrine. Once this is done, Echo of Jaina becomes available to fight. Note: Clear all patrolling groups around Jaina's general vicinity to avoid accidental pulls.\nTanks should be the only one that Jaina faces for her constant Pyroblasts and melee attacks. After a few seconds, Jaina blinks a few feet away then casts three Frostblades in a frontal cone. Everyone should avoid these blades whenever they are cast.\nImmediately after casting Frostblades, Jaina begins bombarding the entire group with 3 consecutive casts of Frostbolt Volley, each of which are interruptable; planning an interrupt rotation in advance can greatly help.\nPeriodically throughout the entire fight, Jaina casts Flarecore, an orb that lands on the ground in a random location. Whoever is closest to the Flarecore should run to it, taking moderate damage when it explodes on contact. Cores that are not detonated in this manner continue to grow until they explode for heavy group damage. Note: Flarecores do small-radius &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage when detonated, so that only the player stomping the core should be near it."}

Forsaken who long for life love the feeling of vitality that the arcane &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; grants.\nForsaken who consider themselves dead and adjust to that fact might also wield arcane magic recklessly, believing themselves immune to magic's side effects.

Otherwise, assist the tank.\nDuring the fight, make sure to have ranged players stand 10 yards apart so that if one of them is targeted with Blighted Arrows or Unholy Shot, only they receive damage. The target of Blight Arrows must move out of the AoE darkness immediately, as this can kill a player who stands in the area for longer than five seconds. Shriek of the Highborne's movement speed debuff is not a problem unless the person hit is also the target of Blighted Arrows.\nThe most important aspect is the Call of the Highborne spell. Once Sylvanas announces the call, she pulls all players to her dark circle. Players should move to intercept and kill the ghoul that appears closest to floating raid marker. In order to obtain &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Ties\"&gt;Severed Ties&lt;/a&gt;, your group must provide considerably high DPS.\nOnce the ghoul has died, part of the Wracking Pain is dispelled.

Enveloped in a perpetual midnight, she has all but lost sight of the comforting light of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nTrash.\nThe dragonshrine in this future is supernaturaly dark. Trash mobs will attack the players. Large beams of moonlight will appear. While the trash mobs are outside the moonlight they are protected by a 90% shield. The tank should aggro the mobs and bring them into the moonbeam to erase the shield. Unshielded trash mobs are easily defeated.\nAfter approximately 45 seconds the moonbeam will disappear. Shortly afterward a new moonbeam will appear. Players should move to the new moonbeam. There are four moombeams, and they always appear in the order of West, South, East and North, pulling the players in a counter-clockwise direction. Between the South and East moonbeams are two staggered trees, which can easily block your sight of the East moonbeam. If you can't find it, spin your camera. Marking a perceptive player with a &lt;a href=\"Target%20Marker\"&gt;Target Marker&lt;/a&gt; can help guide a group with less experienced players from beam to beam, and especially the South moonbeam to the East moonbeam.\nBoss.\nThe North moonbeam will place you nearby and south-east of Tyrande; you may attack her when you are ready to begin the encounter. Dark Moonlight appears as a ring of dark purple around the boss in the center of the dragonshrine. Ranged casters should stay out of the Dark Moonlight during battle.\nEchoe of Tyrande is a fight that relies heavily on running to avoid negative effects. Tyrande casts Moonlance, which travels away from her then splits into 3 parts, delivering damage and a &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; to any who are in their path. When the Eyes of the Goddess activate, they circle around her in a wide radius, leaving behind Piercing Gazes that must be avoided to prevent damage and a &lt;a href=\"Silence%20effect\"&gt;Silence effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt 30% health, Tyrande casts Tears of Elune, which does significant group damage over time. This is the best time to activate trinkets, long-cooldown abilities, and &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, as healing will become more difficult at this point.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

As the frost trolls battled the Scourge invading their beloved homeland, Eck and his minions awaited the moment their freedom was at hand.\"\nStrategies.\nHe is your basic &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; boss. However, he does exactly what the little guys do and switches aggro with the second highest on the aggro chart when he jumps. If your group is having trouble with him it is recommended that you stop DPS when he jumps and allow the tank a few seconds to regain aggro, as long as you can still kill him before the very short beserk timer wipes the group. If the jumps are proving problematic, an effective strategy can be to keep everyone standing on top of the tank so that there's little to no movement required through the fight, and the tank should have fewer issues holding aggro. He also appears to be tauntable, which can help prevent a squishy from getting one or two-shotted while threat is re-established.\nAt 20%, the boss enrages. This is not removable by hunters' Tranquilizing Shot. Tank should use cooldowns such as Shield Wall, Divine Protection, blocking/avoidance trinkets, etc. He does hit for 18K+ on plate during this phase. Heal-over-time healing alone is not enough to keep the life of the tank. Healers should be ready to spam big heals on the tank.\nGeography.\nAfter killing Eck the Ferocious, what most people don't know is that the body of water that he comes from is actually a passage. It is only recommended to use this passage if the tank swims in first, as the &lt;a href=\"Frenzy\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; denizens will quickly react to your presence, and can easily take out non-plate or tank classes.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The exploits of Eddie and Doyle are recounted in \"E. Malone's Expedition Journal\" as well as the \"Wonders of Un'Goro\" web series.\nBiography.\nWeek 1-2.\nEddie first met with Doyle at a tavern in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where the professor was telling everyone about a semi-mythical beast \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Galvadon\"&gt;Galvadon&lt;/a&gt;, the last existing &lt;a href=\"kaleidosaur\"&gt;kaleidosaur&lt;/a&gt; specimen in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 dwelling in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. When Eddie found out that Doyle was looking for an assistant to film the trip, he jumped at the chance.\nAfter a brief stop in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; where Eddie got attacked by and mugged, the expedition reached the rim of Un'Goro and made their way down into the crater. After a \"bird incident\" involving Eddie trying to capture a Jeweled Macaw parrot, the group set up camp and the expedition leader, &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, gave a speech explaining Un'Goro's beauty, wonder and extreme danger. Doyle was chasing a huge butterfly during the lecture, but Eddie took notes of the main points (No wandering, don't touch plants, be nice to natives, elementals bad and dinosaurs scary). Shortly after, Elise wanted to seek shelter due to the sky looking odd, but Professor Doyle instead wished to take a few quick shots to see what they would be able to discover.\nHowever, Doyle and Eddie had just started filming when a massive lightning storm hit. Due to the storm, a mudslide, tree uprooting, cliff drop, and unfortunate trouser soiling, the two were separated from the rest of the expedition. Since the camera survived, Doyle decided to do some more filming and showcased a bush of fire thistle and lillyfeather he had found that morning, naming it the first \"Doyle Discovery\" before being immediately covered in venomous plant darts.\nThe following day, Doyle could move again. He was entirely uncoordinated and hard to understand, but as that's normal Eddie took it for a good sign. Since the professor's G.G.P.S. was going haywire and since Eddie's compass was malfunctioning, the two decided to press on, marvelling at the enormous plants and trees, which Doyle claimed had not been described by science. A few days later, the two managed to escape the plants chasing them and found themselves in a humid marsh where they were captured by &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;\"hideous lizard people\"&lt;/a&gt;. Eddie remembered Professor Starseeker's advice to be friendly to the natives and gave his compass to the creatures as a gift. The beings seemed impressed before tying Eddie and Doyle up and eating their provisions. Shortly after, however, the two were rescued by a tribe of friendly turtle people known as &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s. Doyle was excited to meet an undiscovered tribe, while Eddie was simply happy to meet something that wasn't trying to eat them. At the campfire, Eddie asked the tortollan leader &lt;a href=\"Spiritsinger%20Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; for help finding the rest of the expedition, but she simply smiled and said, \"The greatest virtue is patience\". Eddie suspected that she was going to lead them to a hilltop village he spotted before they made camp.\nWeek 3-4.\nTwo days later, Doyle and Eddie were led to the village by the tortollans as expected, and discovered that it was full of strange, primitive-looking &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Umbra handed the two explorers over to them, and the murlocs began drumming on driftwood totems to summon a lot more murlocs. Eddie thought to himself that he and the professor were safe for now, but he also started to wonder if it was a mistake to trust the tortollans.\nThe next day, while Doyle was rummaging around in the tent, Eddie watched a team of murlocs polish the strange purple floor with some kind of fruity-smelling juice. More murlocs showed up and started dancing around and singing while draping the two exploreres in seaweed and painting their faces. Having picked up a few words of &lt;a href=\"nerglish\"&gt;nerglish&lt;/a&gt; back when he took some MMA classes, Eddie only managed to pick up a few words of what they were saying: \"party\", \"feast\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Megafin\"&gt;Megafin&lt;/a&gt;\", and became convinced that the murlocs were going to feed them to \"whatever a megafin is\". As usual, the professor thought it was a perfect time to start filming, naming the murloc tribe as another \"Doyle Discovery\" before being offered a cup of murloc floor polish that caused him to suffer extreme hallucinations before passing out. He almost missed the arrival of Megafin, the biggest murloc Eddie had ever seen, and it turned out that the explorers were not destined for dinner, but guests of honor at a murloc \"fin-dig\". Megafin ended up being \"really nice\", and he and Eddie agreed to be pen pals so that the latter could practice his nerglish. When Doyle woke up and saw the murloc party, he made a little whimpering sound and went back for seconds of the floor polish, causing Eddie to consider giving it a try as well.\nThe next day, after suffering the after effects of drinking murloc floor polish, Eddie and Doyle discovered that the entire murloc village was constructed on the back of a . Umbra shouted something to Megafin and pointed in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Un'Goro, causing the entire village to begin moving in that direction. Once the explorers, tortollans and murlocs arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Golakka%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Golakka Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the volcano, Umbra took Doyle and Eddie aside and told them to climb the \"fire mountain\" to see \"the truth\". The explorers waved goodbye to their new friends and pitched a base camp at the base of the volcano, leaving them to decide whether to take the smoother but slower path, or the more jagged and faster one.\nDoyle spent the next few days running around and drawing sketches of the small &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that seem to be attracted to the volcano. Eddie wondered if some of the adorable-looking &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s would make good pets. After Doyle's observational sketches and Eddie's underwear burned up just after they had begun filming again, he concluded that they make very bad pets. The next day, the two prepared to start climbing up the volcano. Eddie thought it was a good time to record his last wishes and dedicated all of his worldy possessions to his beloved pet cat, Reginald. The two explorers decided that speed was the most important thing when climbing the volcano and began hiking up the jagged slope. Eddie noted that they made really good progress, especially if you don't count all the time the professor spen with his eyes clenched shut muttering about danger being opportunity instead of climbing, or when the two were almost broiled alive by a huge fire elemental. Eddie and Doyle camped near the caldera, but Starseeker's expedition was nowhere to be seen. Strangely, from their position, the two should have been able to see all of Un'Goro, including the distant crater walls, but instead found that they couldn't see any crater walls. Instead, jungle could be seen carpeting the land as far as the eye could see in every direction. Even the professor wasn't sure what was going on, but Eddie wondered if it was what Umbra had been trying to show them.\nWhile in the caldera camp, the two explorers observed &lt;a href=\"Kalimos%2C%20Primal%20Lord\"&gt;a huge elemental seemingly made up of all the other elements&lt;/a&gt; and several of . Although it was fascinating, it was time to pack up and leave the volcano. The next day, they were trying to sneak past the elementals when Doyle tripped over a glowing crystal, which seemed to anger the elementals and cause them to start chasing the two explorers. As fate would have it, that's also when the volcano started to erupt. Just as the elementals and lava were closing in, a huge &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; swooped down and snatched Doyle and Eddie off the side of the volcano and dropped them off at its nest. As the creature could be back at any moment, it was high time for the two to get out of there as quickly as possible. On the way in, Eddie saw a cave and some ruins, leaving the two to wonder which destination to choose.\nWeek 5.\nThe two explorers' stay in the pterrordax nest was cut short when the professor accidentally stepped on and destroyed one of the pterrordax's eggs. As they didn't have much breath to spare for conversation while running from the angry mother, the two humans ended up heading in the direction of the ruins. Along the way, they passed through &lt;a href=\"Lakkari%20Tar%20Pits\"&gt;an area filled with tarpits&lt;/a&gt;. They couldn't see far through the low hanging mist, but at one point heard what sounded like &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;a dwarf&lt;/a&gt; screaming at the \"scrubs\" to get out of his jungle because they were scaring away all of the game. Once they reached the safety of the ruins, which contained a strange construction of several pillars with a stone ring on top, the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians there allowed them to set up camp but told them that they could only enter if they brought enough crystals to \"\".\nThe next day, Doyle and Eddie embarked on a hike to the nearby crystal cave. When the professor saw the clusters of multicolored glowing crystals filling the cavern, he became extremely excited and began talking about how Galvadon must be close, and before long he was proven right. A group of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who were part of a lost expedition had made friends with Galvadon, who lived in the cave. When they introduced the two explorers to the great creature, Doyle started crying, dancing around and hugging everyone. The paladins told the two adventurers that Spiritsinger Umbra had told them to expect the professor and his asssistant, leading Eddie to deduce that she was the one who had sent the pterrordax to rescue them from the volcano. The group gathered up some crystals, and on the next day they all mounted up on &lt;a href=\"stegodon\"&gt;stegodon&lt;/a&gt;s that the paladins had tamed and met up with the tortollans and murlocs before heading for the titan ruins. On the way there, however, they ran into trouble with the saurok, who had brought an army of dinosaurs and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s with them. Thanks to Galvadon and Umbra's participation in the fierce battle, the saurok were defeated and their apparent leader surrendered. After working out some translations, they all decided to head for the &lt;a href=\"Waygate%20%28location%29\"&gt;Way Gate&lt;/a&gt; together. The saurok leader gave Eddie his compass back and seemed sorry for tying him and the professor up in the marsh. The saurok even offered a replacement for the sandwich he ate, but it didn't seem like he fully understood the concept of a sandwich since it was just a bunch of meat. It was \"a good sandwich though\".\nTogether, the group had no trouble getting to the Way Gate, which turned out to be the tol'vir-guarded titan ruins that Doyle and Eddie had visited before. The tol'vir performed a ritual using the crystals the humans had brought from the cave, and a &lt;a href=\"Amara%2C%20Warden%20of%20Hope\"&gt;giant stone being&lt;/a&gt; appeared. She told the group that they should return from where and when they came, and before long she had everyone casting spells that would help her open the Way Gate. The professor and his assistant decided to shoot one last bit of film before they went through the Way Gate. The two explorers looked back on their journey and hugged one another just before they spotted a giant meteor in the night sky heading towards them. Before they had time to panic, the Way Gate flashed with blinding light and the meteor was gone. Eddie remarked that it all seemed very strange; they were still in Un'Goro, but it seemed different somehow. After some celebration and a few farewells, everyone started going their separate ways, with Umbra and the tortollans solemnly thanking the two explorers and promising to help them get back to Starseeker's expedition.\nUmbra's pterrordax friend dropped Doyle and Eddie off near where their adventure in Un'Goro originally began. Eddie thinks that the pterrordax dropped the professor a little harder on purpose. After a short walk, the two adventurers were back in Starseeker's camp. Oddly, Starseeker didn't seem to surprised to see them and simply said that they must have gotten the worst of \"last night's storm\" judging by the state of their clothes, and it seemed like no time had passed for the main expedition at all. Doyle and Eddie considered telling her the whole story but didn't think she would believe them, and since she was kind enough to lend them new gear they didn't want to spoil the moment. As a closing remark in his journal, Eddie stated that he was still a little confused about everything that had happened, but he was not worried about it. It looked like they were about to make the journey into Un'Goro all over again, and he couldn't wait."}

On &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt;, they come from various &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;s, for which they serve as powerful &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt;s, using their destructive powers to defeat their enemies, while ensuring the studies of their magical field. Therefore, most sorcerers are primarily &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, but they can also be &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe most experienced sorcerers may be recognized by the title of \"High Sorcerer\" or \"High Sorceress\", while those delving in the secular arts are often referred to as \"dark sorcerers\".\nHistory.\nOn Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were the upper class composed of the most powerful sorcerers of the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;, they became obsessed with unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;'s secrets and began rigorously studying the lake's arcane energies. The &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; were also an elite group of night elf sorcerers and served as peace-keepers of the Empire, among them, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was once the personal sorcerer of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the organization was disbanded, and its surviving members renounced the sorcery that had once been their primary purpose.\n6,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Highborne sorcerers infiltrated the lair of the blue dragonflight in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, and succeeded in learning the dragons' techniques. When the dragons confronted them in the forest, the elves attempted to crystallize part of the area and draw magic from the crystals to fight the dragons off, but the spell was much more powerful than anticipated and transformed the entire region as well as twisting the elves' spirits.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;Nazjatar Empire&lt;/a&gt;, while males are more suited for melee combat, female &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; are incredible sorcerers, commanding the power of water and ice at their fingertips. At the head of the Empire, their ancient &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; is known as one of the most powerful magic-users in Azeroth's history, and perhaps the greatest sorceress the world of Azeroth had ever known.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zian%20of%20the%20Endless%20Shadow\"&gt;Zian of the Endless Shadow&lt;/a&gt; was a powerful sorcerer who used the title of \"Sorcerer King\" during his reign, and kept the kingdoms in check through terror and darkness, using the &lt;a href=\"Lantern%20of%20the%20Sorcerer%20King\"&gt;Lantern of the Sorcerer King&lt;/a&gt; to fuel his most powerful spells.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; pledged its support to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and gave large amounts of aid, magi, and sorcerers to the war effort. It was home to the four towers, sanctum to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;' greatest sorcerers. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%27s%20League\"&gt;Sorcerer's League&lt;/a&gt; defended &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, but was eventually destroyed by the undead. During the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, former sorcerers and sorceresses of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mage%20hunter\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of retaining power or to protect Azeroth from the use of uncontrolled magic, sharing the blue dragon's point of view. The mage &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; is stated to be the most powerful human sorceress alive.\nOn Draenor.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; revered the &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; for many generations due to the teachings of the avian sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, they also studied the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic that he had excelled in, becoming great sorcerers as well. Two hundred years after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;, a remnant of the &lt;a href=\"Skalaxi\"&gt;Skalaxi&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt; sought to help rebel &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s against their &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; slavemasters by teaching them in the ways of arcane sorcery, they were later cruelly betrayed by their apprentice ogre sorcerers.\nFor over a thousand years, the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer kings of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; maintained an iron grip over their empire using a variety of artifacts. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt; used the title of \"Sorcerer King\" during his reign, and has mastered techniques that would be considered fringe &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; studies by Azerothian mages. Following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wars\"&gt;Great Wars&lt;/a&gt;, most expatriate ogres from Draenor focus on the path of the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;, but a small percentage choose a life of sorcery as &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre-magi&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first ogre-magi, was referred to as an immensely powerful sorcerer.\nOn Argus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt; were an order of &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; and sorcerers led by the &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt; several years before &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' arrival on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. As specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding, they were renowned for their clever &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; constructs \u2014 which helped build the Argussian capital's wondrous architecture \u2014 and their exploration of new frontiers in summoning. Ultimately, they were destroyed by the eredar leadership for consorting with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and attempting to install Thal'kiel as dictator of Argus.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; accepted &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' offer to join his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the eredar who followed them became skilled man'ari sorcerers in both &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; magics, and were often found in command of contingents of demon forces in the invasions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\n \nAs with the elven priests, the elven sorceresses who remained in Lordaeron paid little heed to their race\u2019s departure from the Alliance. These female magic users, serving as agents to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran, use their arcane powers to aid the Alliance in times of peril. These female magi, sent by the &lt;a href=\"Magocrat\"&gt;Magocrat&lt;/a&gt;s of Dalaran to watch over the volatile &lt;a href=\"Battle%20mage\"&gt;battle magi&lt;/a&gt;, use their arcane powers to aid the Alliance forces whenever Humanity is imperiled. Although their powers are not often used directly in combat, the sorceresses are able to aid the Alliance warriors with a wide array of specialized conjurings and magical effects. In the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Halls of Magic&lt;/a&gt; at the mystical city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, sorceresses diligently study their mysterious arts within the depths of the arcane sanctum.\nIn ', the elven sorceress helped the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to fight &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as they attacked &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. In ', the blood elves also had sorceress, and were produced at the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf%20Arcane%20Sanctum\"&gt;Blood Elf Arcane Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. They are completely identical to their high elven counterpart with the exception of clothes, which have white parts replaced by red.\nIt's notable that human &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; is described as one of the most gifted sorceresses to train in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for generations. Her mentor, the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed that she may become the greatest sorceress humanity has ever produced.\nSorcerers can be found in-game among five other races:\nIn the RPG.\nSorcerers (or sorceress) own great talent for arcane spellcasting, but they have not harnessed it through the intensive training that &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s pursue. Most people do not make a distinction between sorcerers and wizards, although the latter may often refer to the former as &lt;a href=\"hedge%20wizard\"&gt;hedge wizard&lt;/a&gt;s or some other term.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; bear a particular dislike for sorcerers, seeing them as vessels of demonic power. &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, at least, attempt to manipulate arcane power through controlled processes, rather than letting their own bodies act as conduits.\nSorcerers can come from any race. Night elves who take this class are stripped of their racial heritage, effectively transforming into high elves, although they do not physically change.\nHigh elves are renowned for their magic, and on the battlefield, elven sorcerers often accompany Alliance troops into the thick of the fray. Although not physically powerful, the skill and bravery of these elves is beyond dispute. The elven sorcerer prefers to serve as part of a group, preferably in the rear with a few people to guard them. Mana shield is deployed to provide additional protection, while spells like slow and invisibility support their allies. Clad in revealing robes, this elven sorcerer is distinctive. She wears far too much eye shadow."}

He was the one responsible for first summoning the Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nHaving hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain of Ironforge and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins. When Modimus Anvilmar died, a dwarven civil war erupted in which the three most powerful dwarven clans \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 battled for supremacy over the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Having been defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, Thaurissan and his clan were cast out from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Retreating to the beautiful Redridge Mountains, he declared himself Dark Iron emperor in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;a city&lt;/a&gt; he named for himself and plotted vengeance upon his brother dwarves. \nYears later, the Dark Irons launched simultaneous assaults on the two other clans in a conflict that came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Thaurissan personally led the attack on the Bronzebeards in Ironforge, whilst his wife &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt; led the assault on the Wildhammer fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons were intent on claiming all of Khaz Modan for their own.\nAfter a long battle, Thaurissan was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and fled, realizing that if Modgud had failed to destroy the Wildhammers then he would be caught between the armies of the two clans and destroyed. His suspicions were correct, Modgud having died at the hands of Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, though not before cursing the city of Grim Batol and rendering it uninhabitable. With their mistress dead, the army of Modgud was routed, only to be totally annihilated by an army sent by the Bronzebeard clan to relieve the Wildhammers.\nRealizing that supremacy over the dwarves could no longer be achieved by his own force of arms and sensing imminent defeat, Thaurissan, along with &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven\"&gt;the Seven&lt;/a&gt;, delved into forbidden lore and summoned the great Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; at the area now known as the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to destroy his foes once and for all. Horribly underestimating the raw power of the Lord of Fire, Thaurissan, the Seven, and many other Dark Irons were killed instantly in the resulting immolation which destroyed an enormous portion of the Redridge Mountains and formed the great black peak of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Horrified at what devilry Thaurissan had brought upon the land, the combined armies of the dwarves ceased their march on the Dark Iron clan, thus ending the War of the Three Hammers. \nWhile Thaurissan and Modgud were killed, they did have at least one son. The former ruler of the Dark Irons, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, is their direct descendant.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; lingers in the Athenaeum of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Staff&lt;/a&gt; can be found by a experienced &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;archaeologist&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe character who summoned Ragnaros is described as a mad sorcerer, thane of the Dark Irons. The Ruins of Thaurissan was first named after the first pretender who titled himself the Dark Iron king. He is also referred to as sorcerer-king Thaurisan."}

Although their powers are not often used directly in combat, the Sorceresses are able to aid the Alliance warriors with a wide array of specialized conjurings and magical effects. \nInformation.\nThe Sorceress is one of the most powerful spellcasters besides the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;. The Sorceress's &lt;a href=\"%23Slow%20%28Autocast%29\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; spell can render a unit almost useless. With 400 Mana the Sorceress can slow 8 units. A few Sorceresses can slow an entire army. The &lt;a href=\"%23Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; ability is also very powerful because it can take a unit instantly out of action, possibly never to return. Polymorph is excellent on expensive units such as &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, Bears, and &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"%23Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; also has its uses.\nSorceresses are very weak; as with all other spellcasters, they possess Unarmored type armor, making them susceptible to all damage. Units with dispel or spell-stealing abilities can also reduce their effectiveness in battle.\nSpells and abilities.\nSlo (Autocast).\nSlow is a very powerful spell. You can always benefit from several Sorceresses Slowing the enemy. Slow is also the perfect spell to use when the enemy is trying to run away. Often the enemy will leave behind several Slowed units that you can easily take care of for experience. \nnvisibility.\nInvisibility is useful for scouting. Cast it on a ground or air unit, and then use it to scout the map. The unit can scout without having to worry about attacks from towers or &lt;a href=\"Creep\"&gt;Creep&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPolymrph.\nPolymorph can be a total game winner, especially if the enemy has nothing to Dispel it. Polymorph can quickly turn an army into nothing. In team games a Human player can take out as many as 3-4 players using Polymorph and a lot of Sorceresses. Polymorph is the perfect counter to Knights, Abominations, &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Claw%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;, and Tauren.\nManual description.\nAs with the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;elven priests&lt;/a&gt;, the elven sorceresses who remained in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; paid little heed to their race's departure from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.

The cemetery was used for both the rich and poor, having many crypts as well as simple plots. When the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; struck and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began their relentless raids and attacks, the number of cemetery residences skyrocketed. Quickly dug and poorly marked graves can still be seen at Sorrow Hill from the massive casualties suffered in the defense of Andorhal. Eventually, the surviving townspeople stopped burying their dead, and instead dug a mass grave south of the cemetery to incinerate their loved ones, for fear of undeath taking them. The final blow for the surviving townsfolk was when &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lord Uther&lt;/a&gt; was struck down by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;; the final act of the dwindling population before abandoning the town was to erect a great tomb where they buried the torn body of the great hero on the top of the cemetery hill. \"Sorrow Hill\" may refer to Uther's final resting place.\nPresent.\nThe Plague Cauldrons in the surrounding area caused the dead of Sorrow Hill to rise. Deceased soldiers (&lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Flayer\"&gt;Skeletal Flayer&lt;/a&gt;s) and citizens (&lt;a href=\"Slavering%20Ghoul\"&gt;Slavering Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s) stood guard over their graves, defending the southeast road to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20mage\"&gt;Skeletal mage&lt;/a&gt;s rose from their &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill%20Crypt\"&gt;crypt&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast of the cemetery and reports of the Sorrow Hill Scourge commander taking residence in the depths of this crypt became more and more frequent.\nSorrow Hill, despite the strong Scourge presence there, was more of a nuisance to the local &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; contingent, and often new recruits were sent on \"upkeep\" missions to keep the cemetery relatively clear.\nCataclysm.\nSorrow Hill has been taken over by friendly &lt;a href=\"Withdrawn%20Soul\"&gt;Withdrawn Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s.

In \"Warcraft III\", however, the places of the death and burial of Kel'Thuzad were both northeast of the city, not southeast.\nAt the very bottom of the crypt is a small office. A desk, a bookcase, a few bookpiles, etc. Perhaps it is a necromancer's laboratory, or, as suggested above, the tomb of Kel'Thuzad."}

In living beings, the soul is anchored to the body by the cosmic force of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. When a being is resurrected as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, through the use of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; magic, their soul is imperfectly attached to their body through the same Death magic.\nWhen a being dies, their soul crosses the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; between life and death and enters &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they are judged by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; and sent off to one of the realms of the Shadowlands based on their actions in life. Every living soul brings with it a vital force known as &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nManifestation.\nAfter their death, mortal souls usually go to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, however, they may become &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, tortured spirits who writhe in the agony of undeath. Unable to realize that they are no longer alive, they roam the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt;, the trackless wastes between the realm of the dead and the physical world, seeking release from their eternal suffering. Though they are not necessarily evil, they hunger for physical contact, often causing great harm to any living beings they touch.\nWhen a soul is consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, an echo of the soul is all that is left behind. Neither in the physical or spiritual sense of the word would these echoes be considered alive. The echo is merely a twisted reverberation of the anguish left behind by the soul as it is consumed. These twisted echoes of the dead are merely the distorted reflections of once noble spirits.\nWielders of the Light can use &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to appease or grant peace to unrested souls. &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt; magic however consumes souls. When a soul is devoured by fel energies, it produces more fel and is utterly destroyed. An echo of the soul known as a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;soul shard&lt;/a&gt; (or soul fragment) can be produced by the spell caster. Soul shards can be used to power spells, or to create a connection to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, pulling a demon through against its will.\nSouls can also be given physical existence again. This process is called &lt;a href=\"Resurrect%23Lore\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt;. There are two main ways to resurrect a person, through &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, creating an undead, or through other means, most commonly &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; magic. The souls of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are imperfectly attached to their bodies; the dark magic that sustains them is a buffer that prevents their souls from properly joining with their bodies. This is why undead feel only faint sensations of pain or discomfort from most physical stimuli, and why the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is so painful to their existence. The primary exception to this rule are &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es, as liches bind their souls to a &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt; and then use the phylactery to generate a physical form; this process is why lich bodies look nothing like their mortal bodies, and also why it is necessary to destroy a lich\u2019s phylactery to truly kill them.\nSoul gems were used to entrap the soul of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yenniku\"&gt;Yenniku&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first generation of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; were souls of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s infused into the bodies of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nItems are often \"&lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt;\", preventing them from being traded to other characters.\nUtilizing and manipulating souls is a big theme for the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; class."}

The jewel appears to be any of a number of other common baubles found in treasure hordes across the land. Only when the quarter-inch blue jewel is exposed to a magic detecting spell does its strong power reveal itself. The gem's true nature cannot be discovered until it is dipped in blood from an intelligent living creature sacrificed for this purpose. When this ceremony is completed, the jewel swells to 10 times its normal size and begins to glow with a pulsing violet light. The gem can now be used to entrap any one living creature with but a single command word. The target must be within 60 feet for this power to work. The creature within can be released by a second command word from the creature that entrapped it, or held forever in that state. No other known magic can release a trapped individual. The soul within can also be used for a variety of vile demonic purposes known only to a few tortured sages and elders of the Burning Legion. When the jewel is emptied, by whatever means, it returns to its original form. The \"Soul Gem\" cannot hold more than one creature at a time and it may not trap another while one remains within."}

While Soul Dance itself was not modified, the reduction of Brewmasters' base &lt;a href=\"Stagger\"&gt;Stagger&lt;/a&gt; from 30% to 20% and the removal of the Stagger-increasing component of &lt;a href=\"Blackout%20Kick\"&gt;Blackout Kick&lt;/a&gt; were strong indirect nerfs to what was already considered the weakest talent in the row."}

The jewel appears to be any of a number of other common baubles found in treasure hordes across the land. Only when the quarter-inch blue jewel is exposed to a magic detecting spell does its strong power reveal itself. The gem's true nature cannot be discovered until it is dipped in blood from an intelligent living creature sacrificed for this purpose. When this ceremony is completed, the jewel swells to 10 times its normal size and begins to glow with a pulsing violet light. The gem can now be used to entrap any one living creature with but a single command word. The target must be within 60 feet for this power to work. The creature within can be released by a second command word from the creature that entrapped it, or held forever in that state. No other known magic can release a trapped individual. The soul within can also be used for a variety of vil demonic purposes known only to a few tortured sages and elders of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. When the jewel is emptied, by whatever means, it returns to its original form. The Soul Gem cannot hold more than one creature at a time and it may not trap another while one remains within."}

On one such occasion, Saa'ra told Calia that the nightmares will stop once she was ready for them to stop and that there are things she must do and become before that peace would be granted unto her. However, Saa'ra also warned that some of her trials may involve pain and blood. Though Calia admitted it didn't make her feel any better, Saa'ra told her it might once she understood that even painful developments may become hidden gifts and to trust in the purpose of her destiny. Eventually, Saa'ra's insights and warmth would ease Calia's apprehension and comfort her. After their discussion, Saa'ra told Calia to sleep in peace, prompting a calmed Calia to go back to bed.\nFollowing the tragic end of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, Saa'ra watched over the non-decomposing corpse of Calia in its chamber and told &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to wait for &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival. Once Anduin arrived, the naaru stated that Calia would become free from pain and nightmares and that Anduin and Alonsus would bring her back as the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and she herself would have her be. With Saa'ra's guidance, the two priests raised Calia back to life with the power of the Light, but as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;."}

Following the resurgence of the black dragonflight after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he was described as his lieutenant in all things prior to the black Aspect's abandonment of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. When Deathwing entrusted Sabellian with caretaking the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Sabellian remained for decades in what became the shattered &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to lead his &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;own brood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he worked with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the guise of a human named \"Baron Sablemane\", in order to destroy his nemesis &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and his offspring, and take control of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Following their victory, he and his brood became the masters of the mountainous region and imposed their will on it.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the death of Deathwing, Sabellian sees himself as the rightful heir to be the new leader of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, claiming to have been anointed caretaker of the flight by Neltharion himself. When the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; awakened, Sabellian and his dragons left the Blade's Edge Mountains of Outland to return to Azeroth. After they recovered the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;, he and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; began a competition for Neltharion's succession as the new black Aspect.\nThis competition ended when the two brothers delved into &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that his vision of Neltharion's leadership was skewed, and that he had been emulating the wrong path; Sabellian withdrew his claim for Aspect. Instead, he and Wrathion both realized they were not suited, instead turning to their brother &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, who had been counseling them the entire time, to become the new Aspect. After Ebyssian was acknowledged as the new Earth-Warder by Alexstrasza, Sabellian was made general of the black dragonflight to lead alongside him and Wrathion.\nHistory.\nSabellian claims that he has been pursuing the rebuilding of his flight for 'millennia'. Whether or not this means he was somehow spared from the corruption of his people is unknown, nor how he evaded it. He states he was present for Neltharion leading the flight prior to his corruption, and originally aspired to lead the flight to emulate this leadership. He would later go on to acknowledge that Neltharion's leadership was flawed even then.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nAlongside the rest of his flight, Sabellian was called out of hiding by Deathwing following the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing believed that the black dragonflight could replenish themselves on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, away from the other dragonflights, striking up an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Sabellian and his brethren transported the orc chieftains &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt;, and a small party of orcs to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, on their way to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The black dragons destroyed three ships of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20navy\"&gt;Kul Tiran navy&lt;/a&gt; on the way. Once the artifacts were secured he followed Deathwing to the orcs' homeworld of Draenor. Deathwing intended on storing away eggs on Draenor where they could safely be raised without the risk of being attacked by the black flight's enemies on Azeroth.\nOnce on Draenor, the black dragons settled into &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. They were not there long before they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, his offspring, and a small group of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; fighters. The eggs were destroyed and Deathwing was forced to flee from battle. Sabellian was left as one of the survivors of this battle.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhile Deathwing managed to return to Azeroth, Sabellian remained behind on Draenor \u2014 now &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. He is a fierce enemy of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and Gruul's seven sons, and hates them deeply for killing Sabellian's own people and children.\nSabellian has admitted that he counts &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; as one of his friends, though it is implied that Rexxar is not aware that he is a black dragon.\nHe communicates regularly with &lt;a href=\"Samia%20Inkling\"&gt;Samia Inkling&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sablemane%27s%20Blackwhelp\"&gt;Baron Sablemane's Blackwhelp&lt;/a&gt;.\nSabellian wears the guise of Baron Sablemane. He is a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located outside the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Circle of Blood&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; -- the land that was created as a merger of Frostfire Ridge and Gorgrond. He assists adventurers in killing two of Gruul's sons: &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%20the%20Dragon-Eater\"&gt;Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;, reverting to his true &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; form and personally fighting the latter.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Sabellian and his brood of &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s remained in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was unaware of their continued existence.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a report from &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the knows the true nature of Sabellian, that he was still in Outland, and at the time, was not an immediate threat.\nDragonflight.\nAccording to Sabellian's follower &lt;a href=\"Osoria\"&gt;Osoria&lt;/a&gt;, in the years since Gruul's defeat Sabellian has bent the Blade's Edge Mountains to his will. At some point, Sabellian found a way to cleanse the dragons on Outland of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption.\nWhen Sabellian and his brood of black dragons heard the call of the reawakening &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, they left the Blade's Edge Mountains of Outland and returned to Azeroth. They later arrived on the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt; and helped &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to recover the upper courtyard of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Oathstone\"&gt;Obsidian Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. Sabellian began competing with Wrathion for control of the black dragonflight and the position of Dragon Aspect.\nEach claimant was quick to try and enlist adventures to their side, and their followers eagerly backed them up. While Sabellian's were focused on how he had helped his fellow black dragons, Wrathion's were on the success of his ends-of-the-means approached, veering into propaganda with &lt;a href=\"Right\"&gt;Right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Left\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt; justifying his liberation of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; from his trial as necessary to prepare Azeroth for the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, an invasion that was inadvertency started by Garrosh's liberation, since it ultimately led to 's arrival to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where he would start the said invasion. Wrathion's absence during the invasion was not commented on and it was shown that the bulk of Wrathion's support base was his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; agents, while the majority of Sabellian's support base was other black dragons.\nAs Sabellian went to deliver the black dragon eggs from Outland to the Ruby Pools, Wrathion insisted on accompanying him. As the pair traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Lifeshrine\"&gt;Ruby Lifeshrine&lt;/a&gt; via cart, Sabellian insisted they remain incognito, even when Wrathion pointed out that it was obvious that ruse had failed. After various attacks were fended off, the pair were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Thaladrax\"&gt;Thaladrax&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the cart and the eggs within. An outraged Wrathion viewed this as a sign that the others would see reason and pick their new leader and rushed off to inform Alexstrasza. When the Dragon Queen demanded answers, Sabellian revealed that he had used himself and Wrathion as bait to attract their enemies' attention, while his clutch of black dragons safely traveled by air to deliver the eggs. He then pledged his loyalty and that of his flight as &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s heir to her. However, Alexstrasza was unmoved, recalling how Sabellian had played a part in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s twisted legacy, to which he had defended as being a matter of duty. Though she took the eggs under her care, she remarked that she would not get involved in their bickering and the matter of Aspectship between them was a matter for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, to decide.\nDespite this, both Sabellian and Wrathion remained at the Ruby Lifeshrine for a time to see &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Elion\"&gt;Mother Elion&lt;/a&gt;, who described them as \"squabbling like children\", to restore their flight's place there and defended the area during the Primalist attack.\nSabellian and Wrathion then returned to the Obsidian Citadel, continuing their battle against the djaradin, while accepting pledges of loyalty from champions of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Incarnates\"&gt;Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; called upon Sabellian, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. While Sabellian and Wrathion immediately set off to the caverns, Ebyssian detoured and recruited &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; to their mission. Upon their arrival Wrathion found himself held at spearpoint by &lt;a href=\"Khasar\"&gt;Khasar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baba\"&gt;Baba&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raidon\"&gt;Raidon&lt;/a&gt;, while Sabellian observed &lt;a href=\"Iridikron%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;Iridikron's Gambit&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;the Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; had worked alongside the adventurer before, Wrathion turned to them to resolve the matter and confirm what had transpired. After confirming that Fyrakk was responsible for the death &lt;a href=\"Shalkeel\"&gt;Shalkeel&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion joined Sabellian in observing Iridikron's Gambit. He noted how the tunnel was massive and couldn't help but wonder Fyrakk alone entered or if he came with an army.\nBelieving it to be a tactical mistake to wait any longer for Ebyssian and Emberthal to arrive, the pair ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, and encountered &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; forces. As they prepared to battle, Wrathion heard a voice, but it turned to the back of his mind as he rushed forward to bring terror to his enemies. This strategy clashed with Sabellian, who wanted to take a stealth approach and believed that Wrathion was allowing himself to be baited by &lt;a href=\"Summitshaper%20Lorac\"&gt;Summitshaper Lorac&lt;/a&gt;. Even as they clashed side by side against the Primalists, the pair continued to bicker about who would ascend to the obsidian throne. In the aftermath of Lorac's death, Sabellian admitted Wrathion had acquitted himself well in the fight, causing the Black Prince to thank him, only for Sabellian to promise to find a place for him among his troops. About to argue, once more, about who were to be the Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion discovered Fyrakk approaching them and called out a warning to Sabellian, even as the Incarnate attacked. As they lay on the ground, the group was taken captive by deepflayers and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Deepflayer%20Nest\"&gt;Deepflayer Nest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSabellian was able to successfully able to liberate himself and was soon approached by the adventurer, Wrathion, and their new ally the &lt;a href=\"niffen\"&gt;niffen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Honeypelt\"&gt;Elder Honeypelt&lt;/a&gt;. At this reunion, Sabellian revealed that he was unimpressed with Wrathion and admitted that he expected more from the Black Prince after listening to him boast about he had single-handedly slain &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion, however, retorted that it was a team effort, something Sabellian was incapable of understanding. This caused an outraged Sabellian to declare that they were the black dragonflight, that it meant something, and that Neltharion would have never fallen to such a foe. Wrathion was quick to call him out on comparing himself to their father and declared that he had shown his true colors, if that was his aspiration. Sabellian then broke away to investigate a relic that reminded him that used to belong to Neltharion, while Wrathion not realizing what his rival was doing merely thought he was walked away from, and decided to play that game.\nAs he examined the relic, he was approached by the adventurer and admitted that he had felt his head swimming ever since they entered the caverns, and thought the object may be the cause. He thus instructed them to seek out similar pieces in the nearby caves and then formally apologized for his behavior. He admitted that not only had his temper got the best of him, but that he reminded himself of his own &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; in that moment, but declared that it was who he was. He further explained that something about Zaralek was causing him to lose focus and become distracted, a fact which allowed Fyrakk to defeat them so easily. He vowed to not let it happen again and admitted that neither Wrathion nor the adventurer deserved his ire and requested they forgive his reaction and let them continue as companions. His forgiveness was accepted and the adventurer soon returned with news that the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; was present in Zaralek and seeking out the same relics. He was subsequently able to activate the relic and learned about the existence of his father's laboratory, &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after Sabellian, joined the others in &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt;, where he was reunited with Ebyssian and Emberthal and revealed that the Sundered Flame were present within the caverns. As Wrathion set off to learn about more Aberrus, Emberthal and Ebyssian decided to investigate &lt;a href=\"Nal%20ks%27kol\"&gt;Nal ks'kol&lt;/a&gt;, to which Sabellian recommended they ask Elder Honeypelt to serve as their guide as she had proven quite capable. As they departed, Sabellian focused his attention on dealing with Fyrakk. In time Wrathion returned to the town and Sabellian offered to let him join his troops, with a high-ranking position, but Wrathion refused still convinced that he should become the Aspect of the flight. When Ebyssian and Emberthal returned, they found themselves questioned by the pair as to what treasures he and Emberthal had found. Unimpressed with their content, he questioned what was truly important and was who the rightful heir to a legacy of deceit, control, and fear. When Sabellian and Wrathion grew outraged at the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, Ebyssian called them out on their bickering, declared that Emberthal had done right for her people, and encouraged them to let go of the past, as their flight needed them here and now.\nBelieving that Fyrakk's was within the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, Sabellian recruited Ebyssian and adventures with investigating the area and dealing with him. Upon the trio's arrival, they discovered a host of &lt;a href=\"Djaradin\"&gt;Djaradin&lt;/a&gt; within the area, the dragons also noted how the whispers had more power after their arrival at &lt;a href=\"Igira%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Igira's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. As they investigated the area, the group discovered that the djaradin had discovered their elders, albeit only three with the fourth one missing, but also the present of &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, the very poison that drove Neltharion to madness. With this discovery, Ebyssian declared that they had to stop it, in order to prevent the corruption from spreading.\nAs the group did combat with the Zaqali djaradin, Sabellian directed adventurers with learning more about the Zaqali djaradin, by seeing how they make war in order to find their strengths and weaknesses.As they ventured further, they discovered that Fyrakk had already awakened two of the djaradin elders, and did battle against enemy leaders. However, to their horror, they discovered that Fyrakk was bathing within shadowflame and consuming it. Fyrakk subsequently noticed them and attacked, leaving Sabellian infected, and Ebyssian carrying the group to safety on the dragon's back. Amused Fyrakk let them flee, while declaring that he would master what their flight could not control.\nReeling from what transpired, Ebyssian questioned if Iridikron intentionally corrupted his brother or if Fyrakk merely fell into the temptation and vowed he would not lose Sabellian. For his part, Sabellian encouraged Ebyssian to focus on Fyrakk instead of him, only to be soundly rejected as Ebyssian refused to lose anyone to the shadowflame. Following the shadowflame cleansing ritual, the group prevented the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Igira\"&gt;Zaqali's final elder&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to stop Fyrakk before they left the area, Sabellian had adventurers acquire a &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Dragonslayer%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Zaqali Dragonslayer's Spear&lt;/a&gt;, while Ebyssian questioned if these were the words of the general who protected the flight in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; or a defeated warrior looking for revenge. In response, Sabellian declared that they were one and the same as revenge was how he protected their people in Outland. Agreeing with Sabellian's plan, the group ventured off to find Fyrakk, only to discover that he had grown larger as he absorbed the caldera. Undaunted Sabellian attempted to assassinate Fyrakk only to fail as the Incarnate had been prepared for an attempt by the djaradin. With a blast of shadowflame, Fyrakk blasted them away and awakened Igira. As Ebyssian attempted to bring Sabellian and the adventurer to safety, he was pierced by the elder's spear and collapsed to the ground.\nUnwilling to leave Ebyssian, after he had refused to leave him Sabellian remained by his side and healed him, while the adventurer pulled the spear from his hide. Still wounded, Ebyssian and Sabellian had to travel by ground and instructed adventurers with cleansing shadowflame left in Fyrakk's wake by &lt;a href=\"dragonriding\"&gt;dragonriding&lt;/a&gt; through it and to meet them in Loamm once were done. Upon their arrival to the town, the dragons discovered Loamm bathed in flame. Realizing the Fyrakk deliberately attacked the town, an outraged Ebyssian instructed his allies with saving Loamm and the niffen who called it home. In the aftermath, Sabellian blamed himself, and Ebyssian reassured him that it wasn't his fault, that Fyrakk would have caused this suffering regardless of their actions. Thus the pair then reunited with Wrathion and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Seat of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to inform Alexstrasza and the others of what had inspired. Upon learning that shadowflame resided within Zaralek, Alexstrasza initially barred the black dragonflight from returning, unwillingly to risk losing them, before Ebyssian convinced her that they had the strength to resist what lies below.\nSometime later, Sabellian and his brothers returned to the Zaralek Caverns where they worked with a group of soldiers stationed by &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Rest\"&gt;Obsidian Rest&lt;/a&gt;, who remained loyal to the black dragonflight. Sabellian that nothing should stand in the way of their efforts to get inside the Laboratory and that it was of the utmost importance that they succeed in this task. When questioned about his wound, he admitted that it was fine and would take a lot more to take him down. His deeper worry however was what Fyrrak's transgression might mean for all of them, as stronger than the Incarnate had succumbed and lost their way in the shadowflame.\nSabellian later joined the rest of the black dragonflight in fighting against the djaradin within the &lt;a href=\"Battlefield%20Ruins\"&gt;Battlefield Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, with him declaring that it was time to take back what was theirs. In the aftermath of the battle, they discovered that a group of djaradin had been killed by a group of unknown &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; force that still carried Neltharion's banner, and learned of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrakes&lt;/a&gt;. Sabellian noted how the dragonkin remained loyal to Neltharion and questioned if they were coming from Aberrus. Meanwhile, Wrathion personally found the slitherdrakes to be extraordinary creatures. In contrast, Sabellian viewed them as Neltharion's failed experiments that could be made to serve the flight, as fodder for the battlefield. When Wrathion objected to his notion and questioned if he was just fodder to him as well, Sabellian confirmed that was precisely what he was, angering Wrathion who left in a huff. After he left, Ebyssian approached Sabellian and remarked that their fates were one and that they were brothers.\nSabellian was later approached by Ebyssian, causing him to inquire if he should expect a lecture, only for Ebyssian to deny and recruit him for the assault on Aberrus. The black dragonflight united as one as they clashed against &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces within the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Garrison\"&gt;Brimstone Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. During the fighting, Sabellian ordered for the forces loyal to Neltharion to be exterminated as traitors to the black dragonflight. After Emberthal and Ebyssian forced Sarkareth to flee into Aberrus, Wrathion and Sabellian chased him, determined to not let him gain control of the lab. As they ventured into the lab, they were confronted by an echo of Neltharion, who tested each of them to see if they were his true heirs as they fought to claim Aberrus. In the end, both brothers failed as they balked at Neltharion's cruelty, though it was revealed that the echo was, in reality, a &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;, the events of Aberrus shook Sabellian as he confesses that in following Neltharion and aspiring to one day lead the black dragonflight as he did, he became unable, or perhaps unwilling, to acknowledge the malignancy of his father and commander's vision. He provides comfort to Wrathion of how the Black Prince only knew Neltharion as Deathwing, haunting his dreams and reveling in the certainty that he would become him. Both Sabellian and Wrathion then decided that the Aspectship of the black dragonflight should fall onto Ebyssian, one he humbly accepts.\nSabellian then joined the others in returning to the Seat of the Aspects as Ebyssian informed Alexstrasza of what had transpired and took his place as Ebyssian's general.\nQuotes.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nMy loathing of interruptions is overshadowed only by my hatred of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and his seven sons!\nDragonflight.\nGossip.\nI would appreciate your support. Will you swear allegiance to me and help me secure the citadel and a safe future for all dragons?\nWith your help we shall drive back the djaradin and safeguard this citadel.\nGood to see you again, &lt;name&gt;.\nThe Life-Binder's news must be important to have called us all here. If it concerns the Incarnates and she plans to send us after them, I would be pleased to have my fellow black dragons support me.\nI am still the clear choice for Aspect, but my kin are more than capable enough to accomplish such a task with me.\nDialogue.\nSabellian will engage in conversation with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; in the Obsidian Throne before the player chooses a side to support. He will state one of these random lines:\nThis is responded to, also at random, by Wrathion with one of the following:\nSpeculation.\nThe turbulent nature of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and the cascading energies that radiated across &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, may have in fact inadvertently aided in purifying Sabellian and his recovered whelplings from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption."}

Supporting one does not lock out the other, with rewards for getting both to exalted.\nReputation.\nThe Sabellian reputation can be raised by doing weekly quests in the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of these quests, players can repeatedly farm the &lt;a href=\"Djaradin\"&gt;Djaradin&lt;/a&gt; in the area; obtaining &lt;a href=\"Key%20Framing\"&gt;Key Framing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Key%20Fragments\"&gt;Key Fragments&lt;/a&gt;. Restoring these keys will grant a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Obsidian%20Key\"&gt;Greater Obsidian Key&lt;/a&gt; once each week, which can be turned into the chosen dragon for the week. Every subsequent restoration will create a &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Obsidian%20Key\"&gt;Restored Obsidian Key&lt;/a&gt;, which can be turned into Sabellian for 250 reputation.\nThe reputation also accepts &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Sargha\"&gt;Mark of Sargha&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly drop from the Djaradin mobs for 50 reputation each. These marks can also be sold on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;; allowing enterprising players a shortcut to reputation. They will not, however, accept &lt;a href=\"Sargha%27s%20Signet\"&gt;Sargha's Signet&lt;/a&gt;, which is for the Wrathion reputation; so be careful which is obtained.\nEvery 20 keys turned into Sabellian will cause the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Shadow\"&gt;Death's Shadow&lt;/a&gt; rare to spawn. Killing the rare will reward an additional 250 reputation every time it is slain.\nSabellian's reputation holds 6 ranks, each of which requires 8,400 reputation to rank through. Starting at Acquaintance, the player will rank through the following sequentially: Cohort, Ally, Fang, Friend, True Friend. Completing quests and returning keys for Sabellian and Wrathion will also reward &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt; reputation.\nRewards.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

They are almost universally hostile and territorial to all factions on the planet.\nHistory.\nBeasts of the Savage Lands.\nFew creatures embody the savagery of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as much as the saberon, vaguely feline beasts who have adapted to nearly all of this world's diverse environments. From the icy caverns of Frostfire to the steamy &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;jungles of Tanaan&lt;/a&gt; to the maze-like rocky outcroppings of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, there's not a niche that the ferocious saberon haven't conquered. Saberon outwardly appear more advanced than beasts; they have a social structure and can shape simple tools into weapons. Adventurers should be especially wary of saberon hunting parties, whose coordinated attacks, sharp rending claws, and ability to shadowstep behind prey make them deadly indeed.\nTerokk and the Pridelord.\n600 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the saberon tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; delighted in preying upon the flightless &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; of arakkoan society. However, the Bloodmane tribe and its mighty young leader, Karash, grew bored with hunting the birdmen that were confined to the ground and instead made it a sport to bring down the arakkoa who could still fly. Karash trained his followers in the use of nets, ropes, and harpoons and commanded his hunters to bring him ten thousand arakkoa feathers. The Bloodmane initially targeted scouts to hone their abilities without alerting the other arakkoa, but once he was confident in his tribe's abilities, Karash declared war upon the high arakkoa. Bloodmane fighters began ambushing and slaughtering large groups of the winged creatures and laid siege to the spires themselves.\nThe arakkoa were thrown into disarray, for they had believed themselves to be immune to threats from \"lower\" creatures, and the Anhari priests struggled to find an explanation for why their beloved goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly forsaken them. &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, Talon King of the high arakkoa, decided to take drastic action, launching raids on Bloodmane encampments by himself. He single-handedly turned the tide of the war, inspiring other arakkoa fighters to follow him against suicidal odds. After months of whittling away the Bloodmane, Terokk cornered Pridelord Karash and effortlessly slew him, ending the source of the saberon's tactical brilliance and winning the war. Satisfied that his message was clear, the Talon King left the Bloodmane to pick up the pieces of their broken tribe.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe saberon are encountered in nearly every zone of &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and are almost all universally hostile. Unlike many of the other races of Draenor, the saberon are unaffiliated with anyone but themselves; warring on just about every faction that can be found. They are not unintelligent, as some can be found as mercenaries and are capable of speech, such as &lt;a href=\"Vul%27gor\"&gt;Vul'gor&lt;/a&gt;; who serves the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Highmaul clan&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, the &lt;a href=\"Snarlpaw%20tribe\"&gt;Snarlpaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; wiped out an orcish village at the site of their home in &lt;a href=\"Snarlpaw%20Ledge\"&gt;Snarlpaw Ledge&lt;/a&gt;. The ghostly orc, &lt;a href=\"Murgok\"&gt;Murgok&lt;/a&gt;, requests heroes avenge his people. The &lt;a href=\"Steamscar%20tribe\"&gt;Steamscar tribe&lt;/a&gt; are known &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;. They stole the bloom of the genesaur, &lt;a href=\"Dionor%20the%20Carnivorous\"&gt;Dionor the Carnivorous&lt;/a&gt;, after he was felled slaying several &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. His bloom is retrieved by a hero and returned to the ancient, &lt;a href=\"Birchus\"&gt;Birchus&lt;/a&gt;, who later visits this hero's garrison as a merchant.\nThe saberon, &lt;a href=\"Leorajh\"&gt;Leorajh&lt;/a&gt;, was exiled from his people, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmane%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodmane tribe&lt;/a&gt;, for being too weak; ultimately joining with the &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; of the hero that rescued him. The saberon hunter known as &lt;a href=\"Goldmane%20the%20Skinner\"&gt;Goldmane the Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, while non-communicative, was also capable of understanding diplomacy as they too joined the garrison of the hero that rescued them. &lt;a href=\"Prowler%20Sasha\"&gt;Prowler Sasha&lt;/a&gt; joined forces with the orc &lt;a href=\"Kash%27drakor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Kasah'drakor&lt;/a&gt; to rebel against their masters in the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt;. He is non-verbal, but rewards the players for giving him ogre teeth for his trophies. Afterwards, he can be found at the hero's outpost, for Horde or Alliance, if they chose the sparring arena for &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Highpass\"&gt;Highpass&lt;/a&gt;. He can be summoned through the arena's ability alongside the other gladiators from it, aiding the hero in combat across &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackfang%20tribe\"&gt;Blackfang tribe&lt;/a&gt; of saberon were the target of the &lt;a href=\"Saberstalkers\"&gt;Saberstalkers&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Z%27tenga%20the%20Walker\"&gt;Z'tenga the Walker&lt;/a&gt;, they are the strongest tribe he has seen on Draenor. These saberon inhabited the massive area of &lt;a href=\"Fang%27rila\"&gt;Fang'rila&lt;/a&gt;, and were willing to accept challenges to the death at their &lt;a href=\"Blackfang%20Challenge%20Arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the of the were transported to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, some of the saberon were caught in &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;'s teleportation spell and ran off from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; towards the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruthless%20Brigand\"&gt;Ruthless Brigand&lt;/a&gt;s can crash the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Court\"&gt;Ember Court&lt;/a&gt; parties and must be defeated.\nAppearance and culture.\nSaberon are cat-like humanoids, standing around 6-7 feet tall. Their ranks include hunters and warriors, as well as witchdoctors and \"shadowshapers\", both wielders of magic. The saberon have highly developed rituals and customs. At least among the Bloodmane, those that are too weak are apparently forced out of their tribe and left to die.\nMelee types usually wear minimal clothing, often a simple loincloth, and may fight barehanded or with dual-wielded knife-like weapons. In contrast, the magical types are lavishly decorated with complex garments, ornamentation, and feathers, and wield large and lengthy jawbones as weapons. These saberon are adorned with necklaces, belts, shoulders, bracers, and headdresses, and wear wrap-like garments covering their lower bodies.\nThe difference between the appearance of the two groups is likely due to the higher position or rank of the magic-wielding types within saberon culture but may also relate to religious or ritual purposes.\nThey cook and eat other humanoids such as &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpeculation.\nThis species vanished or was completely annihilated when &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor of the main universe&lt;/a&gt; was shattered into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;."}

With the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining Amani have reassembled under new, sturdy leadership in Daakara, seeking to avenge Zul'jin's death and realize his dreams of rebuilding the troll empire.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"To fill the power vacuum left from the death of their warlord, Zul'jin, the remaining trolls of the Amani tribe chose their favored champion, Daakara the Invincible, to reclaim their lost glory.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: No One Pushes Us Around!\nDaakara begins the encounter in troll form. He performs Grievous Throw at random players and uses Whirlwind against nearby enemies.\nStage Two: Got Me Some New Tricks!\nDaakara absorbs the essence of either the &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage Three: Lot More Gonna Fall!\nDaakara absorbs the essence of either the &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nDaakara shifts to one of two possible pairs of animal forms (bear/eagle or lynx/dragonhawk) during the fight, when his health drops down to 80% (bear or lynx) and 40% (eagle or dragonhawk). Transforming wipes his threat (and he is immune to taunts), but debuffs and DoTs remain on him.\nAs a bear, Daakara retains &lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;'s Surge mechanics; three players will need to alternate being the furthest away from the group.\nAs a lynx, Daakara will randomly target a person and pound them with a stun, and each attack adds a stacking bleed. It is important that the tank taunts him immediately upon losing aggro, reducing the damage suffered by random party members. There is a secondary AoE attack that deals light damage to every party member.\nAs an eagle, Daakara summons a number of whirlwinds that periodically pursue players, and deal damage every time a player casts a spell. The whirlwinds follow a relatively predictable pattern: after waiting a few seconds, they move in a straight line to the location of a random player. Merely moving away from where you were standing when the whirlwinds begin moving will allow you to avoid them.\nAs a dragonhawk, Daakara deals periodic AoE fire damage as well as stacking a +% fire damage taken debuff, and casting various fire-based AoE effects. Avoid standing in any fires.\nDakkara also has a &lt;a href=\"hard%20enrage\"&gt;hard enrage&lt;/a&gt; at about 11 minutes which increases attack speed by 150% and damage by 500%, although groups are unlikely to see this happen unless overall dps is mediocre or dps dies early in the encounter. However, it is still possible to succeed in spite of the enrage if the group is lucky enough to get Daakara transformed into Eagle during the last phase since the Berserk does not affect the damage of his attacks in Eagle form.\nQuotes.\nDaakara uses the same quotes as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, with some minor exceptions."}

Dadanga's a big girl; whatever you bring her, there would need to be a lot of it!\nRewards.\nYou will be given the following item:\nCompletion.\nPlacing the sprouts in front of her, Dadanga seems pleased.\nShe nudges a small brown-wrapped package towards you, in exchange for the treat!\nNotes.\nBloodpetal Sprouts are very common in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, they look like large green plants. You must \"open\" them to get the sprout. \nThis quest is often done by &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; as the is found only by doing this quest and opening the Small Brown-wrapped Package. According to Thottbot there is an approximate 2% drop rate of getting this item. \nDue to the low drop rate, it is very possible that the quest must be done many times in order to get the recipe. One method of doing this is as follows. Bloodpetal Sprouts have a short respawn time, so going around the entire perimeter of the crater will not only net you a large amount of Blood Petal sprouts, but a good amount of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Power%20Crystals\"&gt;Un'Goro Power Crystals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Soil\"&gt;Un'Goro Soil&lt;/a&gt; as well. Additionally, if you are a &lt;a href=\"herbalist\"&gt;herbalist&lt;/a&gt; and/or a &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt; you will get a good quantity of raw material doing this. It should only take one run around the crater to get 15 sprouts. While you are traversing the crater, in all likelihood the Sprouts will have respawned, so another go around the crater can be undertaken if so desired.\nOne should note that the Recipe: Elixir of Brute Force is NOT &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be bought and sold at the auction house."}

As one of only three entrances into &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;'s inner bay, the fortress is of great strategic importance to the &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20of%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Admiralty of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The settlement of &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Hill\"&gt;Vigil Hill&lt;/a&gt; can be found beside the gate, with both locations garrisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard\"&gt;Proudmoore Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBuilt with the finest steel from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; mines, Daelin's Gate stood guard over the southern passageway into Tiragarde Sound. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, it would become a target of the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; and their fleet; armed with &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weaponry provided by the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s were able to easily reduce the main gate to ruins. In doing so, they breached the inner section of Tiragarde Sound, beginning to plunder and ransack the surrounding area near &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Hill\"&gt;Vigil Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Only the intervention of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; forces would turn the invaders back, however renewed attacks continued for some time. The destruction of the gate, orchestrated by Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, was hoped to undermine the authority of Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.

As &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, he was the supreme commander of the naval forces of the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. He was a staunch enemy of the Horde, refusing to believe that it could ever change its ways - he greatly hated the orcs and would have been more than willing to see them all dead. Eventually, consumed by his own hatred and devoted to vengeance, the new Horde forces, led by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, were left with no choice but to kill him. His &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore%20%28grave%29\"&gt;grave&lt;/a&gt; is now found at the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lord Admiral's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Second War.\nProudmoore was the leader of the island nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; when the people of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived up north and warned the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would soon invade &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; as well. He was among the human leaders summoned shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;emergency meeting&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron by King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was formed. Once the Alliance was formed, each king argued in favor of them gaining command of the new unified army. Daelin claimed the role should be his, mentioning the power of his navy, and the importance of ships for troop transport and supplies.\nThe role was eventually given to his longtime friend &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; instead, though Proudmoore was given control of the Alliance navy as &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt;. As such, Kul Tiras funded much of the armada of the Alliance and Proudmoore led the naval assault on the orcs, seeking to engage their forces on land, sea, and air.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar heard from human scouts that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had constructed a fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, and he sent Daelin and the Alliance navy to waylay the enemy. The navy intercepted the Horde's vessels near the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, where Proudmoore's sleek vessels and his experience in maritime warfare allowed the navy to quickly outmaneuver the Horde's crude ships and destroy dozens of transports with &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire. Proudmoore realized that he could destroy the entire Horde army at sea and end the war before it even started, but his plans were thwarted when three of the orcs' enslaved &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; revealed themselves and began incinerating the Alliance ships. Proudmoore had no means of combating the dragons and called for a full retreat, causing his fleet to scatter and allowing the Horde ships to reach Lordaeron.\nLater in the war, after the Horde was driven from Lordaeron and &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; was liberated, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; were sailing towards the Horde-controlled Stormwind. However, Proudmoore and his ships were patrolling the waters and managed to overtake the Horde fleet near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;. Just like in the battle at Zul'Dare, the orcish forces were supported by red dragons, but this time Proudmoore had the support of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The gryphon riders outmaneuvered and distracted their larger foes while Proudmoore's ships bombarded the Horde ships. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;Battle of Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; ended with a decisive Alliance victory, with the dragon riders scattering in all directions and most of the Horde's fleet sinking into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The victory was not without loss, however, as the dragon riders had managed to destroy the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt; and in the process killed the Grand Admiral's eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The loss of his son would forever haunt Daelin, and his hatred of the orcs would fester like an open wound for the rest of his life. After the defeat of the orcish navy, Proudmoore discovered a human in the wreckage he initially believed was a survivor from the Third Fleet \u2013 beginning to hope Derek survived as well \u2013 but soon discovered the man was from &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and had been part of a group sent by &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; to guide and assist the Horde. Proudmoore had the man confined and soon found three more survivors with the same story that would be used as evidence of Perenolde's betrayal.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nAfter the Second War, Daelin and other leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; were present at the meeting in &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Proudmoore discussed the rebuilding of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. He later informed the Alliance army of the orc's movements when they were searching for artifacts. Proudmoore stayed beside &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; through the political turmoil that followed the Second War. At a meeting concerning the fate of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, Daelin Proudmoore almost fought with &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; over the issue, but the confrontation never came as both of them had reluctantly agreed not to bring back any weapons. They had even agreed to having themselves searched by selected sentries from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the only military unit they all trusted despite its outward allegiance to Terenas. Subsequently, &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; defused the situation.\nLater, he was present in Stormwind when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;. He was also one of the four jurors during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other judges, he was shocked when Tirion admitted his guilt, which led the paladin to his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; and his exile.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; fleets patrolled the trade lanes hunting pirates and marauders on the high seas. At one point, several Alliance ships reported that they had escaped a band of vicious pirates whose leader carried &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;glowing blades&lt;/a&gt; oozing black smoke, and soon it became clear that those ships were the lucky ones. Admiral Proudmoore led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely human, but after a coordinated cannon barrage, Proudmoore sent the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;\" to the bottom of the ocean and sailed away, believing he had killed them all.\nThird War.\nDaelin Proudmoore remained a close ally of Lordaeron for many years, with his mighty fleets patrolling the trade lanes hunting pirates and marauders. As a prominent leader of the Alliance, Admiral Proudmoore's duty was maintaining order on the high seas. Meanwhile, Daelin's own daughter, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, studied in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; himself (after Daelin was convinced by his wife Katherine to let her go) and eventually becoming romantically involved with Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. He was crushed and horrified to hear the news that Lordaeron was destroyed by the demonic invasion. When he searched Lordaeron for survivors, he found nothing but legions of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, and few survivors.\nProudmoore learned about the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; stealing ships from &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. He and his navy quickly tracked the orcs to the open seas, but both fleets were hit by a storm that caused some of their ships to land on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; sent his daughter &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; to Kul Tiras to be safe from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Daelin personally chose &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; to be her guardian.\nAftermath of the Third War.\nDaelin returned to Kul Tiras and, taking a large part of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; fleet, sailed across the Great Sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in order to search for his daughter and the survivors that fled there after Lordaeron fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had managed to earn &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s trust, Daelin felt that he had to crush the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; before they gained a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. While Proudmoore headed towards land, he ordered &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt; to take an exploratory fleet and scout out the coasts of Kalimdor, while &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt; was to wait and lead a second wave to Durotar.\nHe began raiding the coast and assaulting orcish settlements, but when they began to fight back he withdrew and retreated to the island citadel of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. When he arrived, he was overjoyed to find Jaina alive, but found her keeping some strange company: &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;, all of them allies of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that were with her. Daelin immediately demanded that they all be arrested, but Jaina retreated and helped Rexxar and his friends escape.\nUnwilling to allow Jaina any explanation, Daelin usurped control over &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and used it as the staging ground for his newest &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to have his vengeance on the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, but he was beaten back by their numerous allies and was forced to retreat back to Theramore where he established a naval blockade around Theramore Isle to prevent the Horde from launching a counterattack. What the Admiral didn't count on, though, was his own daughter siding against him. Jaina realized that her father was trapped in the past and that his vendetta against the orcs would only lead to more needless death and destruction for both sides, and aided Rexxar in destroying the &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; then laid &lt;a href=\"A%20Blaze%20of%20Glory%23Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to Theramore and battled their way to his keep, where Rexxar squared off against the Admiral himself. Thrall tried to reason with Admiral Proudmoore, telling him that the Horde was no longer the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;same enemy&lt;/a&gt; he had fought so many years ago, but Daelin refused to believe that the orcs could ever change and launched himself into battle. After an arduous fight, Daelin Proudmoore, victim of his own hatred, was slain in battle. With his death, the battle ceased. Jaina knelt at the body of her prideful father and mournfully asked why he didn't listen. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; told Jaina to remember her father for the proud warrior he was.\nWhen the people of Kul Tiras learned of their Lord Admiral's death, they cried out for vengeance, but the other nations of the Alliance were not interested. Ordeals caused by the plague in Lordaeron were more immediate concerns, and the other allied leaders also had little pity for Daelin's own aggressive actions. The people of Kul Tiras furiously isolated themselves from the rest of the Alliance, but were not angry with all of the Alliance leaders. They instead nursed a bitter hatred only towards Jaina for betraying her family. Daelin's wife &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt; would succeed him as Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras.\nLegion.\nYears later, during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; champions were sent to collect the from his soul in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarbringers: Jaina.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and after her to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; sang \"&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Daughter of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;\" while paying her respects to a graveyard of swords in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Theramore\"&gt;Ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. She took a silver Kul Tiran pendant hanged around one of the sword handles and handed it to a hooded ferryman at the Theramore docks as fare.\nWhile Jaina recalled the events that led to her father's demise, the ferryman sailed Jaina through a canal filled with floating corpses and wrecked ships. The wisps of dead sailors eventually guided their ferry through a stormy ocean until they reached a specific spot where Jaina saw the faces of the dead. With her magic, Jaina raised a sunken Kul Tiran ship from the depths of the ocean, and then she spoke to her father, who was disguised as the ferryman, telling him she was listening to his wisdom now. Daelin turned his face and smiled at her while fading away, presumably glad that his daughter had finally taken the path he always thought was correct.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the Alliance's expedition to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; following the Horde's infiltration of the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina saw Daelin singing a lullaby to her younger self in a dream, before she was called away by &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;her mother&lt;/a&gt;. As the little Jaina left, the vision of Daelin, visibly dead and rotting, claimed that her mother would never forgive her and that she was a murderer, before Jaina frightfully awoke from the dream. Initially, the dream proved to be true, as Katherine imprisoned Jaina at the behest of her chief advisor, Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, who had Jaina sent to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Jaina was trapped within &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt; by the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; king, Katherine and an emissary from the Alliance pursued her there and experienced Jaina's memories of guilt, including the confrontation she had with Daelin before he was killed by Rexxar, and her mourning over his dead body. It was there that Katherine realized that Daelin had become consumed by his hatred, and Jaina had tried to save him from himself, but to no avail. She asked Jaina to forgive her for banishing her, and to learn to forgive her father, as well as herself.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; expressed his belief to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde was forever shackled to the past, Anduin cited Daelin as an example of the Alliance's regrets.\nIn the RPG.\nHe is rumored to be the father of &lt;a href=\"Finnall%20Goldensword\"&gt;Finnall Goldensword&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Kilnar%20Goldensword\"&gt;Kilnar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wildhammer dwarves resented the call to join Daelin's attack on the orcs of Durotar and sent only a token force to aid him. The insult was obvious to Proudmoore, who promised punishment after the war was over. He did not live to carry out this reprimand."}

It is still possible that daemons may be a third race within the ered'ruin. The \"Warcraft I\" appearance for Daemon closely resembles Doomguard, and they both use flaming swords. The \"Warcraft II\" appearance for Daemons shares much fewer similarities due to its more lithe, and humanoid appearance, having more similarities with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s appearance in the Sunwell."}

Their aptitude in the arts of deception and combat are only equaled by their sadistic nature, and the puissance they possess in the black arts of magic. They command the searing fires of Hell as if it were their plaything. They are the true lords of chaos, wreaking havoc at every step and destroying what they wish. There is rumored to be a gateway that appears every thirteenth full moon that bridges the gap between Azeroth and the underworld, and it is during these brief moments that the daemons can come to this place. Legend also states that some have the power to summon these creatures and control them, but if this is so, none are alive to tell the tale of how it is accomplished.\nThese hellspawn are evil incarnate. The ability to summon these dark minions of the underworld has long been lost, though the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; seek to find those secrets once again. Breathing flame and wielding a blade forged in the fires of Hades, destruction and death are their greatest desire. These daemons possess cruelty beyond the imagining of even the sickest mind, and delight in the execution of their plans. If there is a way to send these monsters back into the pits that spawned them without the loss of many lives, it too is a secret locked away in time.\nInformation.\nDaemons are heavy damage dealing melee units which can form the main body of an attacking force. They are at their best when spread around the units, since they are very big, bulky and somewhat slow, they tend to cluster around when attacking, making them quite ineffective in groups. Daemons are the only units in the game which can survive a direct &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt; hit. If under attack by Daemons, distract them by using a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; and then go all out with the Catapults, to wound/kill them while they are busy killing the Knight. Daemons are often considered the best unit in the game and superior to their human counterparts, &lt;a href=\"Water%20Elemental%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Water Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. However, their lack of a ranged attack can put them at a disadvantage in certain situations, such as when the Elementals are behind a wall or building.\nDaemons have a \"Magic\" bar that will slowly decay as time passes. When it is emptied, the Daemon will continually lose HP until it dies. Note that the single Daemon that's present at the start of the campaign mission &lt;a href=\"Medivh%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; is not subject to decay.\nA Daemon will actually \"lose\" HP if targeted by a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Cleric's&lt;/a&gt; Healing spell."}

It widens out quickly, however, into a roughly circular bay with calm waters and a rocky northern beach. You can land almost anywhere along the &lt;a href=\"Shiverwind%20Coast\"&gt;Shiverwind Coast&lt;/a&gt;, if you are an expert sailor in a small boat, but for larger vessels and less experienced crew the only real option is Daggercap. This natural harbor provides an ideal launching point for expeditions throughout the continent."}

The uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; are trying to redeem all the Lost Ones but the Daggerfen have gone too far, for they dabble in &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; and deceit and are beyond redemption by anyone's standards.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; put a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20posters\"&gt;wanted poster&lt;/a&gt; of their leader &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Mummaki\"&gt;Chieftain Mummaki&lt;/a&gt;, who was such a nuisance that if nobody went to hunt him down Denjai planned to go personally. &lt;a href=\"Ikuti\"&gt;Ikuti&lt;/a&gt; also put a wanted poster, and while many &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; people went to claim the bounty none had returned.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Tor%27gash\"&gt;Witch Doctor Tor'gash&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and was looking for someone who could send the &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Murloc\"&gt;Baby Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s to the Daggerfen tribe. The Daggerfen, however, feared these murlocs.\nSociety.\nThe Daggerfen are a highly organized tribe, and of the three tribes of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, they are the most cunning and most aggressive. They are a foul and degenerate people, continually making brutal attacks against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. They act like a band of &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s, and use arts that come unnaturally to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. The only way they understand something is with swift and brutal actions. They may also be good &lt;a href=\"leatherworker\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt;s, as leather clothes bearing their tribe's name can be found throughout the area."}
