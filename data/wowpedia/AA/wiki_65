{"id": "494915", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=494915", "title": "Vanthir", "text": "Vanthir is a prominent resident and former resistance fighter in the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. A tavern owner by trade, Vanthir would rise to particular importance during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, during which he acted as a major &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;rebel&lt;/a&gt; leader within the city.\nThroughout the civil war, Vanthir operated the city's Nightfallen base of operations from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt; tavern, and also oversaw the distribution of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; to the starved populace. Many nightborne would come to depend upon his humanitarian efforts.\nAs the conflict began to shift in the rebels' favor, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; responded by ordering the destruction of the Waning Crescent and its inhabitants. In the ensuing massacre, many civilians were killed and Vanthir himself was taken prisoner, though he was later saved by Nightfallen agents. Vanthir would ultimately survive the rebellion, which saw the Nightfallen victorious. Not long afterwards, he would also be alive to witness the entry of Suramar into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGathering storm.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Vanthir worked as the proprietor of &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;The Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt; tavern near &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt;. As a merchant, he also possessed supply contacts across the city, mainly for &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in the area of the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Terrace\"&gt;Evermoon Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. When not working, Vanthir would enjoy relaxing at a particular corner of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmershade%20Garden\"&gt;Shimmershade Garden&lt;/a&gt;, often reading or napping. He also favored a small eatery just outside the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt; for his meals.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began, Vanthir was one of the many &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; horrified by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s alliance with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. They were supportive of a an attempted coup by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, though when this plot failed spoken dissent fell silent. Vanthir maintained links with the noblewoman &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, who was also quietly opposed to the recent events.\nEventually, First Arcanist Thalyssra would found the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; resistance movement to wage war on Elisande and the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The rebels were initially hopelessly outnumbered, however, and began by making contacts within Suramar City itself. Ly'leth would direct &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; of Thalyssra to Vanthir, who she believed would be of great value to the fledgling rebellion. When he learned that Thalyssra still lived, Vanthir firmly committed himself to the Nightfallen cause.\nCivil war.\nUnder Vanthir, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt; became a focal point for rebel activity within the city. Vanthir would also take it upon himself to distribute &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; to the lower classes of nightborne, who had begun to suffer terrible withdraws from Elisande's contrived rationing of the substance. Vanthir oversaw the commandeering of large quantities of arcwine from the authorities, with his tavern becoming the main distribution center. Vanthir was known to care deeply for the individuals he helped, and was willing to risk everything to make sure they survived. Athough the amounts of arcwine stolen were often large, it would ultimately result in a small amount doled out to each person in need, so small that it was only enough for one day. Those too weak to reach the tavern were given priority, with agents sent out to search for those in need.\nVanthir would attend a major event in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; being held by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of reassuring her supporters in the wake of the unrest. Though Vanthir took no active part, rebel agents acting with &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; used the party as an opportunity to try to assassinate the Grand Magistrix. The attempt would fail, but Vanthir and the Nightfallen agents were not compromised.\nVanthir took an active role in directing resistance activity across the city, issuing orders to Nightfallen agents in missions ranging from prisoner rescue to assassinations. Along with his fellow rebel leaders, Vanthir's efforts meant that the rebellion continued to gain ground, and support, among the nightborne populace. Vanthir met and aided Ly'leth in her successful bid to become Elisande's Advisor in order to spy for the Nightfallen, with the Waning Crescent acting as the headquarters for her campaign.\nThe successes of the Nightfallen eventually drove the Grand Magistrix to extreme measures. Aware of the base the rebels had in the Waning Crescent, Elisande dispatched a force of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to sack the entire district. The residents and the Nightfallen were caught completely off-guard, with large numbers slaughtered in the streets and much property destroyed. Vanthir himself was seized on Elisande's orders to be made an example of, and taken from the scene. Furious, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and her allies became determined to locate and free Vanthir.\nWith information from Ly'leth, and using her own magical talents, Thalyssra was able to determine where Vanthir was being held captive: the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt;. In order to serve as a lesson to other dissenters, he had been placed in a cage on the terrace and left to slowly &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; from the lack of arcwine. By the time rebel agents arrived on the scene and defeated his captor in the form of Second Blade &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt;, Vanthir was very close to being lost forever.\nHis condition dire, Vanthir was quickly given a fruit from the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; tree which the Nightfallen had been cultivating, and which had the power to cure the magical addiction of the nightborne to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. It proved to be just in time, and Vanthir was brought back from the brink. Before departing, Vanthir insisted that they place a &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20Lily\"&gt;Dusk Lily&lt;/a&gt; sigil above the now-empty cage, in order to serve as an example of their own to Suramar's people. The act would deeply rattle Elisande's supporters, and heralded a deadly new stage in the rebellion as a whole.\nAfter his near-death on the Terrace of Order, and with little remaining of his former tavern, Vanthir relocated to the main Nightfallen base in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. There, he would continue to work with rebel forces, now joined by &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; from outside Suramar, in their final push to take the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to Elisande's regime.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI cannot begin to thank you enough for your part in rescuing me.\nWithout such an intervention I would be a &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;mindless husk&lt;/a&gt;, forever tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. Now... I am free of it.\nI have always believed that Thalyssra would lead us to salvation. Now I know for certain that the Nightborne can and will be saved."}

There are three main categories: sea turtles, land tortoises and fresh-water-dwelling terrapins.\nTurtles in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" are similar in appearance, but much greater in size than their real-life counterparts. They can be found both on land, and in water. In \"Warcraft\", turtles, sea turtles, and tortoises are often essentially the same, only differentiated by environment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s are a race of humanoid turtles.\nBackground.\nTurtles of different species are found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Giant%20turtle%20battle%20sub\"&gt;Giant sea turtle&lt;/a&gt;s are native to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;southern seas&lt;/a&gt; and were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The daring &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who control them are dedicated to destroying enemy ships by launching hazardous, steam-driven canisters containing highly volatile liquids that can shred even the strongest of armor. The &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; use &lt;a href=\"turtle%20boat\"&gt;turtle boat&lt;/a&gt;s to travel between their different settlements.\nTurtles are feared by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, who consider them bad luck and give them a wide berth on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Softshell%20Snapling\"&gt;Softshell&lt;/a&gt; turtle meat is considered a delicacy and is the key ingredient in soothing turtle bisque. \nOne of the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; was a reptilian warrior with a shell reminiscent of a turtle. In &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the turtle ancient &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt; is encountered. He may or may not be the aforementioned reptilian warrior.\nAs a mount.\nThere are several types of turtle mounts available. The &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; use &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s as their &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; ground mounts.\nAs a hunter pet.\nTurtles are a family of &lt;a href=\"Pet_talents%23Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity pets&lt;/a&gt; and are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 10. Players that start as a &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; will receive a turtle as their first &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;. Turtles, through the use of their special &lt;a href=\"Shell%20Shield\"&gt;Shell Shield&lt;/a&gt; ability, reduces damage taken by 50% for 12 sec. This makes turtles great tanking pets in a pinch. There are seven different skins available for turtle pets. The most distinctive ones are , a turtle with a fiery shell, and , a light-grey turtle.\nIn the RPG.\nSea turtles are aggressive animals with thick, heavily spiked shells and sharp teeth. Some reports say that naga train these creatures and use them in war. Sea turtles trundle along the ground on elephantine legs and attack smaller creatures \u2014 or creatures of the same size, if prey is scarce. Any creature striking a sea turtle with natural or hand-held weapons takes piercing and slashing damage from the turtle's barbs. However, weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; another type of turtle is described, the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Turtle%2C%20Giant%20Snapping\"&gt;Giant Snapping Turtle&lt;/a&gt;, but the validity of the source is disputed."}

They mostly common occur in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; because of the circumstances given to where the game can be deadlocked intentionally or not. It is less likely to happen in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; because both games are based on points accumulated over time and have no purpose or method to stall intentionally.\nWarsong Gulch can become a turtle game when both teams are at a standstill and cannot capture each other's flag. Example: Both teams have the opposing flag, but the flag cannot be captured until the other one is returned. Both teams have a strong defense, and any initiative for an offensive strike fails to retrieve the flag to its home base. However, some premade groups have been known to purposefully stall a Warsong Gulch battlegrounds in order to &lt;a href=\"honor\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; and camp the opposing team merely for honorable kills. Warsong Gulch turtles in the worst cases tend to go for hours. \nAlterac Valley becomes a turtle when both teams cannot rush the other's defenses quickly enough to make it to the enemy general. A standard Alterac Valley game when ran quickly lasts from 12-15 minutes. Some games if stalled a little but one-sided go from 20-24 minutes. In the really bad situations, an Alterac Valley turtle will last up to 50 minutes. Intentionally causing a turtle in this battlegrounds is for the same reason, honor farming. Turtles here don't last as long as Warsong Gulch because for every kill, the opposing team's reinforcements gets decremented. Defeating the enemy captain and capturing all four towers also brings down the number of reinforcements leaving only the players to farm until the count reaches 0."}

When the Wandering Isle was opened to the rest of the world, &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; who upheld the tenets of Tushui were drawn to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; due to their similar philosophies. Since then, they have taken part in many conflicts and events throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; alongside their new allies.\nThe Tushui pandaren are contemplative, focused on abstract ideals of justice and morality, and believe that a principled life is the only one worth living. Their idealogical opposites are the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, also of the Wandering Isle, but who chose to join with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups represent the majority of pandaren within their respective factions.\nHistory.\nJoining the Alliance.\nThe Tushui philosophy and its followers originated on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; some time ago, and was well established by the time the mists of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; fell. At this time, the group was headed by &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt;, a stalwart and gifted &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, and coexisted in relative harmony with an opposing philosophy in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe future of the Tushui and their fellow pandaren would be forever changed when an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;\" crash-landed into the landmass. In doing so, it mortally wounded Shen-zin Su, and threw the entire island's safety into jeopardy. The pandaren of the Wandering Isle, led by the Tushui and Huojin, were forced to work together with the surviving Alliance crew and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; prisoners from the vessel in order to save the great turtle. Both philosophies would clash during the crisis, with the Tushui opposing the use of drastic and dangerous solutions. Ultimately, the united effort managed to avert disaster.\nIn the aftermath of these events, the pandaren of the Wandering Isle turned their attention to the world at large, now open to them. Aysa Cloudsinger and the other Tushui had grown closer to the Alliance since first encountering them, and were attracted to their ideals and beliefs which resonated with their own. When the invitation was offered, the Tushui and many other pandaren agreed to enter the Alliance, while the Huojin and others sided with the Horde.\nAysa would meet with &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; personally in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and the Tushui quickly established a presence in the capital near the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, they began aiding the Alliance's efforts on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. Representing her people, Aysa became a leader within the Alliance and was present for numerous future events and meetings as part of this role.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, the Tushui and Huojin, representing respectively the Alliance and Horde, would fight for control of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt; and its ancient &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; artifacts in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The Tushui would later establish a &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Landing\"&gt;small base&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; from which members of the Alliance explored the island.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Tushui reinforced the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; garrison with &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Guard\"&gt;Lunarfall Guard&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Captain%20Chien\"&gt;Shield Captain Chien&lt;/a&gt;.

At the outset of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Zandalar\"&gt;war in Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, part of the fleet was stationed at Tusk Isle, notably the flagship \"&lt;a href=\"Rezan%27s%20Claw\"&gt;Rezan's Claw&lt;/a&gt;\".

They make their home along the coasts of the two continents, having settlements in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend and the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; on the Dragon Isles. Most Northrend tuskarr are members of the &lt;a href=\"Kalu%27ak\"&gt;Kalu'ak&lt;/a&gt; faction, while most of the Dragon Isles ones are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Iskaara%20Tuskarr\"&gt;Iskaara Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDespite the absence of any records documenting the tuskarr's past, many significant facts have recently come to light. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that the tuskarr may be descendants of a walrus &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, though for the moment this is only a theory. The tuskarr are constantly beset by the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt;s, but even their enemies marvel at their skill at catching the dangerous creatures of Northrend's waters.\nLong ago, some tuskarr settled on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The tuskarr of Northrend passed down legends of their long-lost brethren.\n500 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt; passed through &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and made an impression on the tuskarr with her tales of fighting &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, and even a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. They told her to seek out the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, thinking her one of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThough they have seen their share of difficult times, they found new allies in their ongoing struggle against Northrend's hostile forces when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the continent for the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, the blue dragonflight descended on the tuskarr of the &lt;a href=\"Coldrock%20Quarry\"&gt;Coldrock Quarry&lt;/a&gt; and killed every single one in the quarry. They wanted the particular stone the tuskarr used for themselves, crafting &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s from it, under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Curator%20Insivius\"&gt;Curator Insivius&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies that poured out from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Indu%27le\"&gt;Lake Indu'le&lt;/a&gt;, through the nearby &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt; used by the blue dragons, destroyed &lt;a href=\"Indu%27le%20Village\"&gt;Indu'le Village&lt;/a&gt; and killed most of its inhabitants who became &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s. The tuskarr who weren't killed immediately became deranged, attacking anyone who came near them.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%22Mad%22%20Jonah%20Sterling\"&gt;Captain Jonah Sterling&lt;/a&gt; ordered them to steal several artifacts from the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; burial ground called &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The angry spirits of the disturbed graves were left howling for vengeance, and the theft was later discovered by the tuskarr, who were unfortunate enough to have several hunters approach the area due to the strange activity of the restless spirits. At the same time, Jonah Sterling and some members of the Northsea Freebooters went mad from the artifacts they stole, and began to wage war against the tuskarr, raiding many villages (such as &lt;a href=\"Iskaal\"&gt;Iskaal&lt;/a&gt;) in order to sell them as slaves to other lands. None of the tuskarr survived their captivity long enough to be rescued due to the brutality they suffered.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, all the items were retrieved, and the plan of the tuskarr was to simply return the artifacts to their proper resting places, in order to appease the ghosts. However, the results of their plan did not play out as expected as the offering came too late. The theft triggered the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; along the coasts of Northrend. One of those kvaldir clans, the &lt;a href=\"Skadir\"&gt;Skadir&lt;/a&gt;, brought their longships to shore at the &lt;a href=\"Riplash%20Ruins\"&gt;Riplash Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. They wiped out the &lt;a href=\"Riplash\"&gt;Riplash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and began sacrificing them to awaken the &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leviroth\"&gt;Leviroth&lt;/a&gt;. When they ran out of naga, they began to sacrifice tuskarr.\nThe kvaldir later attacked &lt;a href=\"Kaskala\"&gt;Kaskala&lt;/a&gt;, the tuskarr capital in Northrend, their longships came sailing out of the mists and the slaughter began. The survivors fled east to &lt;a href=\"Unu%27pe\"&gt;Unu'pe&lt;/a&gt;, which became the main tuskarr settlement in the region. Kaskala was home to many of the carved stone statues that house the spirits of long-gone tuskarr elders, and that alone made the invasion of the kvaldir more difficult for them to bear.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, there was once a tuskarr village on &lt;a href=\"Hrothgar%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Hrothgar's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, but they've all been slain or driven away by the kvaldir led by &lt;a href=\"Drottinn%20Hrothgar\"&gt;Drottinn Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; threat was eventually dealt with, the tuskarr were constantly on the move and looking for food. Some of them have been spotted on &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; parted due to the effects of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the continent was was revealed to the rest of the world, some tuskarr such as &lt;a href=\"Wally\"&gt;Wally&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Angler%20Karu\"&gt;Master Angler Karu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trawler%20Yotimo\"&gt;Trawler Yotimo&lt;/a&gt;, decided to head out and find some new fishing grounds in the south.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the tuskarr &lt;a href=\"Kah%27chu\"&gt;Kah'chu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ku%27ku\"&gt;Ku'ku&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kuu%27ka\"&gt;Kuu'ka&lt;/a&gt; could be found in &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, presumably brought there by the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; attacking their settlements in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; opened its port to non-&lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time in centuries, a group of tuskarr traders arrived to sell their wares. More tuskarr merchants could be also found in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; became the largest Tuskarr settlement since they lost &lt;a href=\"Kaskala\"&gt;Kaskala&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. They also met some tuskarr who told them that one day they'd take Kaskala back from the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, the tuskarr have been supplying &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt; with all the fresh fish they could want.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, they reported that the surviving tuskarr of &lt;a href=\"Pal%27ea\"&gt;Pal'ea&lt;/a&gt; managed to retake their village to the kvaldir, and when they visited it, the tuskarr were still building, making it bigger than before. They also met a crew of tuskarr who explained that they were reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Coldrock%20Quarry\"&gt;Coldrock Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, a process that'll be a long one, as the spirits of their slain shaman still wander among the rocks and must be laid to rest, while the wreckage of fallen surge needles befouls the ground.\nBiology.\nWith their squat and sturdy bodies, tuskarr are generally not built to run, but they do not suffer hypothermia easily: they can survive being submerged in water so cold it would kill most other denizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in minutes. Their tusks get longer and yellower with age, but can also turn yellow if not regularly cleaned. Both males and females possess mustaches. When a tuskarr sighs, they let out a long, whistling note through pursed lips.\nCulture.\nThe tuskarr are a kind-natured nomadic race that roams the southern coastlines of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, guided by the carved cyclopean statues that mark their seasonal fishing routes. Their society is divided into clans, each consisting of a small number of families. Most \"kalu'ak\" carve their tusks with ideograms showing their family and clan affiliation, but some instead engrave symbols for deeds of great distinction. Most tuskarr are mononymous; surnames like \"&lt;a href=\"Kattik%20Sharktasted\"&gt;Sharktasted&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Taruka%20Beastkiller\"&gt;Beastkiller&lt;/a&gt;\" seem to be applied based on special traits or accomplishments.\nAs fisherfolk and traders, the tuskarr have traveled widely and share their information just as freely.\nThere are stone elders all around the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, ranging in size from shorter than a dwarf to taller than a house. A lot of those statues are by the coast, and according to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, they mark the tuskarr fishing routes, but his brother &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; also seen some on big ones inland too. According to Muradin, the stone elder &lt;a href=\"Pal%27ea\"&gt;Pal'ea&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest they saw in any tuskarr village of Northrend.\n\"Kalu'ak\" wear oilskin and fur clothes and create scabbards and baskets from sealskin. They use whalebone and whale teeth as crafting materials for most of their weapons, as well as for other items like buttons, though some weapons are instead made from volcanic glass. In addition, they light their lamps with whale oil. When making camp during their nomadic journeys, they sleep in tents, whereas permanent settlements have buildings made from the bones of great sea creatures. Larger group dwellings are dug deep into the earth. When a clan travels from one stopping point to another, most of the mothers, adolescents, and children travel across the ice in sleds drawn by draft &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;s (and consequently need lots of food stocked up in case of delays or accidents), while the heartier fishers travel there in their boats (allowing them to catch their own food on the way). The tuskarr use giant &lt;a href=\"turtle%20boat\"&gt;turtle boat&lt;/a&gt;s as a transportation system among zones in Northrend. They lead the turtles by use of carrots on a fishing line. They also breed &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt;s as farm animals.\nThe walrus-men practice a form of magic that, on its surface, is astonishingly similar to &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s have not yet deciphered the source of the tuskarr's magic. While the tuskarr serve the elements differently than other shamanistic races, the power that they are able to call forth is formidable.\nThe tuskarr are very patient people, and according to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, it may come from their spirits finding home in stone, as stone endures. Though they prefer peace, the tuskarr fiercely defend their settlements when necessary, and they are no strangers to the conflicts erupting across their home continent. They are not a vengeful race, but justice is seemingly highly valued in their society and their laws demand that all tuskarr must seek retribution against those who shed their kin's blood.\nSeeing their &lt;a href=\"Tuskarr%20Kite\"&gt;iconic kites&lt;/a&gt; soaring above Northrend's shores is a clear sign that tuskarr are nearby. \"Kalu'ak\" children fly kites as a pastime, but settlements can also fly large numbers of kites at once as a way to signal to those far away that something great and wonderful is happening.\nHunting.\nTuskarr society centers around fishing and whaling. This is of such vital importance that a tuskarr's ability to fish affects its social standing within the community. While tuskarr do hunt land animals in lean times, their primary sustenance comes from the sea. They are renowned for their prowess and fearlessness in catching some of the most dangerous creatures in Northrend's frigid waters, including &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"giant%20squid\"&gt;giant squid&lt;/a&gt;. Not even the unnamed leviathans that lurk in the ocean depths are beyond the tuskarr's reach. Most tuskarr fishers use rowboats, while children use kayaks. It's generally held among the \"kalu'ak\" that teaching about fishing methods can only take place between a parent and their child. \nEach clan has a \"catch master\" who weighs each fisher's daily catch and records them using multicolored cords they keep on a \"counting staff\". The tuskarr share food equally, but a catch above the basic requirements earns knots on that fisher's cord. Knots can be traded within the clan for luxuries and tools, or exchanged for coins if they need to trade outside their own small group of families. Knots can also be earned by doing fine embroidery, but this is less respected than fishing.\nThe tuskarr are the masters of sailing the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt; and fishing them. They hunt &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt;s and fish for schools of deep sea monsterbellies, moonglow cuttlefish, and rockfin groupers. They sail through ice floes that none of our captains would go near without an icebreaker, singing songs to the icebergs as they haul their catch.\nFaith.\nThe tuskarr of Northrend worship a small pantheon of deities or spirits, known to consist of &lt;a href=\"Tayutka\"&gt;Tayutka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Issliruk\"&gt;Issliruk&lt;/a&gt; (spirit of war), and &lt;a href=\"Oacha%27noa\"&gt;Oacha'noa&lt;/a&gt; (goddess of wisdom). The &lt;a href=\"Iskaara%20Tuskarr\"&gt;Iskaara Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; worship &lt;a href=\"Gral\"&gt;Gral&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Kauriq%20tribe\"&gt;Kauriq tribe&lt;/a&gt; of the Azure Span worship three &lt;a href=\"Great%20Spirits\"&gt;Great Spirits&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kraunot\"&gt;Kraunot&lt;/a&gt; (Spirit of the Mountain Wind), &lt;a href=\"Otu%27rorq\"&gt;Otu'rorq&lt;/a&gt; (Spirit of the Tumultuous River), and &lt;a href=\"Niliuq\"&gt;Niliuq&lt;/a&gt; (Spirit of the Ocean). Tuskarr in all areas are shown to worship &lt;a href=\"Karkut\"&gt;Karkut&lt;/a&gt;, he who watches over the dead who is said to watch over fallen tuskarr so they do not lose their way. The tuskarr believe that Karkut's spirit is currently walking the earth, gathering the spirits of dead tuskarr. Karkut awaits the spirits of dead tuskarr as they pass on.\nIn addition, the tuskarr carve massive stone heads that allow them to communicate with their ancestors. Each head houses the specific spirit of an elder which acts as both home and body, thereafter referred to as stone elders. A tuskarr shaman uses a set of ritual items to perform a ceremony, in which they recite a chant in a strange language to guide an ancestor's spirit to their rightful statue. In the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Coldrock%20Quarry\"&gt;Coldrock Quarry&lt;/a&gt; is a tuskarr holy site where they carve their sacred ancestor statues out of the living rock, and where they would perform rituals to honor their deceased elders.\nOne of the tuskarr's beliefs is that all souls are one with the magic of the world, and so attempts to control all magic would doom everyone. &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Tomkin\"&gt;Mystic Tomkin&lt;/a&gt; refers to magic as \"Silap Inua\", and says that it \"is harnessed by all thinking peoples to heal or harm. It is the power of life. It is the power of souls living and dead.\" He also says that the efforts by the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to cage all magic is the greatest threat to the tuskarr, and indeed, to all life in the world.\nAn Iskaara &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;funeral&lt;/a&gt; has the deceased put on a boat with several of their belongings and sent out to return to the sea. In celebrating the deceased's life, they will remain with their family forever. On rare occasions the shark spirit &lt;a href=\"Gral\"&gt;Gral&lt;/a&gt; may arrive and devour the vessels, which the Iskaara celebrate as the god choosing the deceased.\nIn Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.\nIn \"\", the tuskarr appear as neutral hostile &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s on maps with the tileset \"Icecrown Glacier\". They attack hostile units on sight and may drop items. There are different unit types of tuskarr:\nIn the TCG.\nA popular pastime in tuskarr culture is the creation of intricate and decorative kites.\nIn the RPG.\nTuskarr are humanoids with solid builds, thick torsos, and broad shoulders. They wear warm furs under oilskin jackets. Their heads are blunt and almost hairless, with a pair of great tusks pointing down from their upper jaw. Their brown faces are friendly and expressive. Most tuskarr do not learn more than Tuskarr and Common, but those who do speak the tongues of their enemies understand Low Common and Zandali.\nThe tuskarr culture is centered around fishing and whaling such that a tuskarr's fishing ability is seen as a moral guideline of sorts. Tuskarr females farm the few crops that grow in the tundra while also collecting a variety of berries and roots. Animal husbandry exists in the tuskarr culture.\nCulture and society.\nThe tuskarr are peerless fishermen and whalers. Their self-contained economy is based on the ocean's bounty. These stout-hearted creatures have a budding society along the frozen coasts of Northrend. Although the tuskarr do not yet have an organized society, their villages lay scattered across icy beaches, bustling with activity and commerce. Communities are established to help with fishing, animal husbandry, and defense rather than political interest. The family is the primary social structure, and tuskarr have no community figureheads aside from familial leadership roles. Kinship usually involves three generations from both the mother and father's sides. Functionally, these extended families are treated as one, so the action of a member is the responsibility of the entire group. Marriage occurs as soon as a man can support a wife, and for females as soon as they reach puberty.\nThe tuskarr are a simple people who place extreme emphasis on family values. Their hierarchy includes the family first, the larger community second and the individual third. Because of the vulnerability of the tuskarr, however, the families tend to keep close proximity with the others. When the families must coordinate, a family is picked at random to take charge for that particular situation. Each family has its own implicit leader, but the entire family bears responsibility for each of its members.\nTuskarr shamans have the power to influence events such as weather, food, and illnesses. Shaman magic is often quite a production, even something like curing the sick: the shaman may speak with ghosts of the patient's relatives and even battle other spirits into submission before forcing them to help heal the patient.\nLaw.\nTuskarr laws are simple. No tuskarr may avoid helping tend to the needs of the settlement \u2014 gathering food, making clothing and housing, patrolling in defense, etc. The sea is communal property for fishing and whaling. Catches are divided among the community as much as is feasible, with those who miss out on one catch getting the first choice the next time. Tuskarr individuals have personal property, but possession is conditioned by actual use.\nTuskarr laws are not meant to punish criminals as much as they are meant to maintain community peace and prosperity. Punishment is mild, usually aimed at injuring one's social position (through gossip, ridicule, or ostracism). Still, some matters are taken seriously. Blood vengeance is always required in return for the taking of a life, which may result in an ongoing feud.\nWar.\nThe tuskarr often war with the indigenous ice trolls and nerubian spiderfolk of Northrend. Though they have done well to evade the undead Scourge, the tuskarr know that it is only a matter of time before the legions of the dead come calling. Tuskarr favor spear weapons and nets as their primary tools of war. Tuskarr warriors coordinate in combat, each working to ensure the well-being of the others. Typically, one member of a squad will attempt to snare an enemy in a net, while the others attempt to dispatch the trapped opposition with their spears.\nTuskarr are peaceful people, but they show little mercy to ice trolls, nerubians and anyone else they consider their enemies. While they sometimes organize raids against foes that threaten the ancestral territories where they build their villages, the tuskarr more frequently defend against their enemies. Anyone wreaking havoc on a tuskarr village, however, unleashes the full wrath of these people.\nThe tuskarr are disciplined and well organized, and each of them takes the defense of his family and village seriously. For many tuskarr, it is a matter of survival, but also of pride, to be prepared against any threat. Because of their reliance on fishing and whaling, tuskarr receive training in the use of nets and spears at a young age. All tuskarr also receive at least rudimentary training in ways to put these implements to use against an intelligent foe. Warriors patrol the areas surrounding their villages and act as lookouts in strategic locations. These warriors warn their people of impending attack.\nWhile they follow no particular leader, tuskarr fight in squads composed of 6 to 8 members of the same lineage. The tuskarr abide by the recommendations of the individual with the most warfare experience, or the one they consider the wisest among them if no warriors are in the group. Most often, the leadership of a squad is divided among 2 or 3 members deemed learned in matters of war. Because the members of a squad are family, the tuskarr warriors are not only extremely loyal to one another but also get along together. They are also used to working together \u2014 after many years spent fishing and whaling with their brothers \u2014 and thus are efficient as a unit in times of war.\nSometimes, a squad includes a couple of specialists. The most common specialist is the net thrower, a dexterous fisherman with some experience in warfare whose mastery with the net causes great trouble to opposing troops. Sometimes, a squad also includes one or two javelin throwers. These warriors carry up to a dozen javelins and provide useful cover fire to the members of the squad. Also, when such an individual is available, a squad includes a shaman who can cast spells to hamper the opposition or heal the troops.\nHunting.\nFishing and whaling form the basis of everything from moral guidance to conversational slang. Boys strive to be good fishermen and girls dream of marrying a good whaler. Success in fishing is a sign of right living, and failure is a sign of moral disorder. The tuskarr afterlife is imagined as a paradise with choice catches and successful whaling without hard work.\nTo visit a tuskarr village, visitors must bring several fresh fish along, to prove they can fish. Fishing is more than just a means to survive for tuskarr \u2014 it's also a moral guideline. If they think that someone cannot fish well, that is a bad person, so evidence of successful fishing means someone must have good morals and therefore must be respectable. If a person brings several large fish, he is treated like a long-lost and much-beloved cousin.\nArchitecture.\nTuskarr houses are solidly built structures of wood and stone, with thick, thatched roofs. They are only one story, and sprawl rather than rise, because of the incessant wind. Heavy shutters cover the windows and short entry halls lead from the outer door to an inner one, which keeps heat from escaping and cold from entering. Their homes are radial, with a single large chamber at the middle and the sleeping quarters arrayed around it. They have large pits in the center, lined with stone, and keep a fire blazing constantly \u2014 it heats the entire house and has spits and trays for cooking food.\nTuskarr are fishers and whalers, and they use every part of the animals they hunt. Whale bones form support beams in their homes, and heavy sealskins and other furs cover the floors and the doorways. They create dyes from various squid inks and fish scales, and have colorful weavings on their walls.\nClothing.\nTusken inner clothing is brightly colored under their thick furs and oilskins. When a tuskarr woman accepts a tuskarr man as her husband, she weaves him a vest and he wears that against his skin. She replaces it once they have children, and again if he becomes the head of their extended family. She repairs it when necessary but otherwise he never takes it off. When males die, they are buried in their most recent vest, and the others are wrapped together to fashion a pillow for the body.\nInspirations.\nThe tuskarr appear to be inspired mostly by Inuit stereotypes, some Polynesian indigenous cultures, and other popular media cultural elements."}

These words have hidden meaning none but the tuskarr understand. Because family is of prime importance to their society, tuskarr family names take precedence over the names of the individuals. Thus, tuskarr family names are stated before an individual\u2019s personal name, and most tuskarr who travel outside their own communities are known simply by such a name. Tuskarr family names are ancient and sacred. The meaning of the family\u2019s name is related to some important characteristic or great historic deed. A tuskarr father gives his family name to his child, but the mother picks out a personal name for her son or daughter shortly after birth. Tuskarr family names are long and complex, while personal names are short and simple. The meaning of a personal name relates to one of the child\u2019s personality or physical traits."}

Originally founded by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; as a clan of &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the cult has been active since before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; but became a major worldwide threat to both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; and the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; shattered Azeroth.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nBeneath the land of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, a society of exiled &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; lived in catacombs under &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. They reveled in the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that leaked from the injured &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, and through the Void they communed with the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s that sought to bring about an end to all existence. The Pale orcs' dark power rivaled even &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic in potency, and rumors of the Pale and their otherworldly abilities eventually reached &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Though he paid little heed to the stories, his master, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, was intrigued. Because Kil'jaeden pressed Gul'dan to ensure victory over the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; at any cost, that meant investigating the Pale to determine if their magic could strengthen the Horde. Gul'dan sent his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the Pale, and if they proved as mighty as the rumors claimed, to bring them into the Horde.\nCho'gall stormed into the &lt;a href=\"Underpale\"&gt;Underpale&lt;/a&gt; expecting a fight, but found none. The Pale did not resist his intrusion for they were eager to share their prophecy of doom: the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, a time when the shadow would envelop the universe and snuff out all life in existence. Cho'gall had little interest in their prophecy but was very interested in their unfamiliar shadow magic. To win the Pale over, Cho'gall used their beliefs to his advantage and claimed that Horde was a weapon by which they could bring about the Hour of Twilight. The Pale reveled in the opportunity to serve as agents of the apocalypse. They committed themselves to the Horde and formed a new clan: the Twilight's Hammer clan.\nAs he too learned to master shadow magic, Cho'gall would see the truth in the Pale's prophecy. It would take him many years, but he would eventually devote himself to their quest.\nFirst and Second War.\nObsessed with the notion that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was the harbinger of apocalyptic doom to all the lands that it ravages, the Twilight's Hammer felt a sacrosanct gratification in the destruction of all that it encountered. Led by the cunning &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight's Hammer had strong ties to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;. Its loyalty to the Horde was not as strong as its belief in its sacred mission of oblivion.\nAfter coming to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; the Twilight's Hammer clan, alongside with the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, led the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish forces in the first attack on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The battle went horribly, as the Horde had not expected such resilient persistence against them. The two clan leaders blamed each other.\nAs the war raged, the Twilight's Hammer became a problem for &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. The Pale were prone to disobey orders and too many wandered off, never to be seen again. Blackhand considered making an example of them and wiping the entire clan out, but Cho'gall intervened; so far, he had only been the Twilight's Hammer's de facto leader, and he offered to become their official chieftain to keep them in line. Blackhand let him try, and was pleasantly surprised when Cho'gall was able to keep the Pale obedient, effective soldiers almost overnight.\nCho'gall's success was in his understanding of the Pale and their beliefs. They worshiped the powers of the Void, and the moment they had arrived on Azeroth they felt the Void call out louder and clearer than they ever had before. The Twilight's Hammer had been hearing the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, ancient evils imprisoned deep within the earth that served the void lords. Discovering them had overwhelmed the Pale, driving them into a state of pure ecstasy. It was seen by the clan as a sign of destiny, that they had found the place where they belonged: the place where they would bring about the Hour of Twilight. As for Cho'gall, while he had believed the Void was a force, he had cared little at first for his clan's mad ravings about dark gods. But now, he had proof they existed. He agreed to help the Pale and brought them under control with a simple notion: the Hour of Twilight was not far off, and the Horde's success was the best way to bring it to fruition. Until then, they had to keep up appearances to Blackhand and obey their true masters in secret. The Pale agreed, and the Old Gods seemed please with the Horde's lust for war and destruction, so it was no great sacrifice to proceed with the conquest of the world.\nAs the weeks passed and Cho'gall attuned himself to the Old Gods, he branded the Twilight's Hammer's prophecies onto the skin of the Pale orcs. He then cut off their flesh to form pages, making a book that codified teachings of the Void: the \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Canticle\"&gt;Twilight Canticle&lt;/a&gt;\". The book would become a source of power and motivation for the followers of the Old Gods for decades.\nCho'gall survived the rise and fall of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. He served a useful purpose to &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; who, with Gul'dan, wished to bring ogres through the Portal to enforce inter-clan civility. Cho'gall was placed as overseer for the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refineries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Gul'dan discovered the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Cho'gall believed that it would herald the end of the world, and so was quick to unlock its secrets. Orgrim Doomhammer ordered the traitorous clans destroyed and while Cho'gall was thought to have been killed in the battle it later turned out that he had survived the battle and then sailed west to the mysterious continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, drawn in by the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfterwards, those of the Twilight's Hammer, Stormreaver, and Blackrock clans who died in the Broken Isles kept reliving the battle in their undeath, until the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; warden &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; put them to rest.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter several years undisturbed on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; was able to recover and expand into a large multiracial &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, employing a myriad of classes from simple &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"aquamancer\"&gt;aquamancer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadowmage\"&gt;shadowmage&lt;/a&gt;s. Former members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; flocked to join the service of the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20lord\"&gt;elemental lord&lt;/a&gt;s and help bring about the complete destruction of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The organization actively spread across the world camping near the locations where they believe the Old Gods and their minions are sealed away, and seeking power from eldritch places such as &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;, which has very strong ties to the element of Earth, and thus may hold powers long held at rest. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Kelris\"&gt;Twilight Lord Kelris&lt;/a&gt; they also show strong resistance in the &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, in the submerged domain of the Old God's favored pet, the ancient beast &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai\"&gt;Aku'mai&lt;/a&gt;. In the nearby &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, cultists of the Twilight's Hammer may be found at the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Master's Glaive&lt;/a&gt;, the site of a large skeleton of a colossal &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;N'raqi&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Soggoth%20the%20Slitherer\"&gt;Soggoth the Slitherer&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe largest groups of the Twilight's hammer waited outside the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; for the mighty &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening, using &lt;a href=\"Windstone\"&gt;Windstone&lt;/a&gt;s to summon powerful &lt;a href=\"Elementals\"&gt;Elementals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Council\"&gt;Abyssal Council&lt;/a&gt;, which may direct the movements of the organization.\nAmong the active cultists on the continent of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the largest group serve &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, even having ambassadors among the elemental lord's other servants, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in the court of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerrig%20Bonegrip\"&gt;Gerrig Bonegrip&lt;/a&gt; founded the shop &lt;a href=\"Bonegrip%27s%20Runes%20and%20Dooms\"&gt;Bonegrip's Runes and Dooms&lt;/a&gt; for the Twilight's Hammer and assists those seeking to free Princess &lt;a href=\"Myzrael\"&gt;Myzrael&lt;/a&gt;, and the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Bel%27dugur\"&gt;Keeper Bel'dugur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; secretly works for the cult as well.\nMidsummer Fire Festival.\nDuring the Midsummer Fire Festival celebrations, the Twilight Cult tries to summon &lt;a href=\"Ahune\"&gt;Ahune&lt;/a&gt;. The Twilight Hammer planned to have him battle &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; to start an &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; war on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nFollowing the death of C'Thun by an army of mortal adventurers (assisted by trapped members of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; dragonflights), the infamous Cho'gall himself apparently took up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; itself. He kidnapped and brainwashed &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; to be his assassin, using her as a tool to sow seeds of distrust between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall intended to sacrifice &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, the prophesied child of three worlds, to release his dark master from his bonds. However, Med'an and his compatriots founded the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. As the Guardian of this new Council Med'an was able to defeat Cho'gall and foil his schemes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight's Hammer made a presence in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; by entering deep in &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Jedoga%20Shadowseeker\"&gt;Jedoga Shadowseeker&lt;/a&gt;, they appeared to be drawn by the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20One%23In%20Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Faceless Ones&lt;/a&gt; which served him and sought to bring about their dark plans. A number of Twilight cultists were also present within the &lt;a href=\"Descent%20into%20Madness\"&gt;Descent into Madness&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, while their banners can also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the war in Northrend, some cultists managed to find &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt; and were planning to reverse the purification ritual performed on it some years ago. In so doing, the cultists would have transformed Light's Wrath into its antithesis: a weapon of pure darkness. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Israen\"&gt;Israen&lt;/a&gt; later found them and stormed their encampment just before they completed their ritual. Their resistance was short lived, and he recovered the weapon for transport to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoomsday Cult.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Invasion\"&gt;Elemental Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Cultist\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the Hammer appeared under the name Doomsday Cult in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer\"&gt;preaching&lt;/a&gt; apocalypse and trying to &lt;a href=\"Cultist%20Infiltrator%20%28Elemental%20Unrest%29\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; those cities. They were ultimately stopped and &lt;a href=\"Detained%20Cultist\"&gt;imprisoned&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nSome time prior the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; the Twilight's Hammer was responsible for two mass murder incidents in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, in a calculated plot to sabotage any remaining relations between the Alliance and Horde. Not only were tensions between both sides increased, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; would severely be injured during the second mass murder incident. Receiving Hamuul's message and under the belief that the orcs were sent by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who highly disagreed with any treaty between the Alliance and the Horde, the mighty &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; would confront Garrosh. In the subsequent duel between them Cairne would lose his life due to &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who exploited Hellscream's ignorance of his own culture. As such the Twilight Hammer is indirectly responsible for Cairne's death and in a stroke of good luck their role in Ashenvale has remained undiscovered. As such the perpetrators of the mass murder incidents have yet to be found, and have not made any in-game appearance.\nCataclysm.\nSeduced by the promises of power and the destructive intentions of the twisted &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Aspect of Death&lt;/a&gt;, they join him in his quest to unmake the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Loyal to the Old Gods, the cultists forged new plates to hold Deathwing's torn body. Their goal was to bring Armageddon to the world.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s grip on the Dark Irons was tenuous, more of her people, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, were falling away from her rule with each day, joining the Twilight's Hammer whose emissaries continued to operate in the Depths. Adventurers sent from Stormwind and Orgrimmar were tasked with thwarting the Twilight's Hammer and Dark Iron alliance.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight Hammer cultists recovered his broken corpse, as well as that of &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, and reanimated them with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magics. The dragons retained a sliver of their former personalities, but they were now obedient servants of the cult. It was their knowledge of how to craft monsters that the Hammer wanted. Thus, Nefarian returned to his own experiments and forged a new generation of chromatic dragons, while Sinharia worked on twilight dragons.\nThey claimed the ancient dwarven fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into their main base of operations under the leadership of their chieftain, the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, wreaking havoc wherever they can. They also have enlisted the help of the dangerous &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their ranks. They lead various campaigns against the world such as the assault on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, performing a ritual to connect the &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir%20ancient\"&gt;Vashj'ir ancient&lt;/a&gt; with a powerful creature far below or undermining the efforts of rebuilding the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. They also maintain a strong presence within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Caverns\"&gt;Blackrock Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, where they ascend to transform into drakonid and are sending supplies back and forth through subterranean tunnels the length of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nNotably, their role in the game is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; in \"Wrath of the Lich King\", and may be considered a \"Cataclysm\"-version of it.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nWith the Twilight Cult in disarray following the demise of its leader, Cho'gall, an enigmatic figure known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt;\" had taken on a more active role in the cult's affairs. \n&lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; delivered his sister, &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;, to the cult.\nThe Twilight father sent a group of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragon\"&gt;Twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to the reunion of the four dragonflights. The assault had to destroy &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and did a diversion to corrupt the eggs of all dragonflights. Thanks to the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, the sanctum was destroyed and the eggs too. The loss was heavy for the dragonflights especially for &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons were chased away from the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and it became the cult's base.\nThey sent an &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;infinite assassin&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; wherever he goes.\nArygos, wanting to become the aspect of magic, wanted to deliver the whole &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to the cult. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, however, became the new aspect and the Twilight Father betrayed the blue dragon. Aedelas Blackmoore killed him in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. His blood activated the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; and the flux of arcane magic gave the life to &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;. \nKirygosa had to breed with Chromatus in order to create a new &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, stronger and more stable. The cult spent his time to hunt the &lt;a href=\"Elk\"&gt;Elk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; feeding the five-headed dragon and to keep an eye on Kyrigosa. Thrall ended up killing Aedelas. Kyri killed some cultists and escaped. On the back of Chromatus, the Twilight Father assited the final assault on the aspects. However, thanks to Thrall, for a little time, the aspects were once again five and ended the chromatus' life. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; fled and in spite of his failure wasn't killed by Deathwing but took his role as &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; back on.\nFirelands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; are members of the cult under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Fandral with his servants arrived during the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; union to jail &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s soul in the elemental plane.\nDuring the opening of the portal on &lt;a href=\"Nordune%20Ridge\"&gt;Nordune Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, Leyara led a assault of fire minions to lay waste to the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt;. The flame druids resurect &lt;a href=\"Alysra\"&gt;Alysra&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Alysrazor\"&gt;Alysrazor&lt;/a&gt;. A long time after that, she attempted to kill &lt;a href=\"Hamuul\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; during a rendezvous at &lt;a href=\"Leyara%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;Leyara's Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, the flame druids didn't stop the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;. The Druids of the Flame attempted to perform a ritual here, but were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Leyara was spotted in the &lt;a href=\"Igneous%20Depths\"&gt;Igneous Depths&lt;/a&gt; and killed by four &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring the final assault, the druids defended their master. The blazing talon assisted Alysrazor during his fight while &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Staghelm\"&gt;Majordomo Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his men were defending the &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Avengers%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Avengers of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; won the war and the Druids of the Flame were annihilated.\nHour of Twilight.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of adventurers, faced off with the Twilight Prophet during the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. The Twilight Prophet is defeated, however the Twilight's Hammer continued to lay siege to Wyrmrest. The cultists fled once &lt;a href=\"Morchok\"&gt;Morchok&lt;/a&gt; was defeated. Some members led by &lt;a href=\"Hagara%20the%20Stormbinder\"&gt;Hagara the Stormbinder&lt;/a&gt; guarded the Focusing Iris within the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, but Hagara and her group were also slain by heroes. The Twilight's Hammer then makes one final attempt to stop the Dragon Aspects, and a war party of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Dragon\"&gt;Twilight Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s accompanied by their &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt; riders damaged the engines of &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;The Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to stop them from catching up to Deathwing as he fled back to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Dragons and the Vrykul were slain, however, &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Goriona\"&gt;Goriona&lt;/a&gt; boarded the ship and attempted to dispose of the heroes, but were ultimately slain, allowing the Skyfire to catch up to Deathwing and finally destroy him with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the death of Deathwing and leadership of the cult the status of the cult is unknown but it can be presumed that the cultist who survived still worship the Old Gods and will remain a threat, however diminished they may be.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWhile the cult has fallen, some remaining members infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; and founded the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt;. The legacy of the Hammer is still pursued by several groups such as &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, bent on unlocking the mysteries of the cult's dark arts.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA still active cell of Twilight's Hammer led by an elemental ascendant, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Bathiel\"&gt;Twilight Lord Bathiel&lt;/a&gt; has persisted within &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. Acting on the orders of the Old Gods themselves, they intend to summon &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai\"&gt;Aku'mai the Devourer&lt;/a&gt; into the world of Azeroth. The cult has been capturing prisoners in order to perform blood sacrifices that will serve as a catalyst for the monstrosity's summoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers raided Blackfathom Deeps and killed the mad servants of the Old Gods, including Bathiel.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Twilight cult traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; of the heroic &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, hidden beneath the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. There, led by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; traitor now known as &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Deacon%20Farthing\"&gt;Twilight Deacon Farthing&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted to resurrect an ancient monstrosity \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 using &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the \"Mistress of Twilight\", a mature &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight drake&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt; took the scattered remnants of the Hammer and led them to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. Leading a reborn &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, she claimed to have heard the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; from beyond the grave, and also learned of a way to use the power of the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; to subjugate the elements to their will. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; later led an attack to stop their plans.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Roads\"&gt;Deep Roads&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, former slaves of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, allied with the Twilight's Hammer. &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Shardkeeper\"&gt;Twilight Shardkeeper&lt;/a&gt;s commanded bound elementals while &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Orelifter\"&gt;Twilight Orelifter&lt;/a&gt;s carried &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; through the tunnels.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Silithus in a last-ditch attempt to kill &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, most of the local Twilight's Hammer cultists were killed in the attack. However, a few still survived and were led by &lt;a href=\"Michiel%20Voidstrider\"&gt;Michiel Voidstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Michiel was killed by adventurers before he could rally the cult into action.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Twilight's Hammer took advantage of the chaos between the Alliance and Horde at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. They successfully revived &lt;a href=\"Soggoth%20the%20Slitherer\"&gt;Soggoth the Slitherer&lt;/a&gt; and were able to call forth massive elementals to do their bidding by harnessing the elemental breaches within &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt; respectively sent Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; with disrupting their efforts.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; entered Blackfathom Deeps in order to confirm that the cultist remained dead, just as the Horde left them. According to the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, the cult members had been drawn to the ruined temple through strange whispers and visions sent by their Void lords. In the ruins, their charge was to protect Aku'mai that would be needed in the Hour of Twilight. Zekhan then reported that since Bathiel's death, no other cultist seemed to have stepped in as leader.\nThe remnants of the cultists at the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Outpost\"&gt;Twilight Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in remain active following the death of &lt;a href=\"Michiel%20Voidstrider\"&gt;Michiel Voidstrider&lt;/a&gt; and despite the efforts of raids ordered by &lt;a href=\"Grol%20Warblade\"&gt;Grol Warblade&lt;/a&gt; on the outpost.\nDragonflight.\nA few years later, a Twilight's Hammer ogre named &lt;a href=\"Cygenoth\"&gt;Cygenoth&lt;/a&gt; used an illusion to disguise himself as a &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and convinced several dragonspawn and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; to become a Deathwing-worshiping cult known as the &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt;. An adventurer and the red dragonspawn &lt;a href=\"Ayasanth\"&gt;Ayasanth&lt;/a&gt; later exposed his deceit.\nNotable members.\nDoomsday Cult.\nThese members appeared during the &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; pre-event.\nTeachings.\nThe Twilight's Hammer is obsessed with bringing the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;s or other scenarios of reckoning in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s upon the world. This may have been already started on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; revealed a set of &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Prophecy\"&gt;Doomsday Prophecies&lt;/a&gt; marked with the iconography of a flaming hammer. With this apocalyptic mindset, new recruits are often sent on difficult or impossible tasks, such as obtaining a black dragon scale or phoenix feather, and sorted out with deadly trials. Their fanatical views can also be seen in their newspaper in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"True%20Believer\"&gt;True Believer&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"Still%20Believing\"&gt;gathered&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Text\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Text&lt;/a&gt;s. Other texts, like &lt;a href=\"Yagyin%27s%20Digest\"&gt;Yagyin's Digest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lorgalis%20Manuscript\"&gt;Lorgalis Manuscript&lt;/a&gt; or the , speak of their worship and sacrifices to the Old Gods.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, an unknown person began nailing disturbing letters to the doors of residences in &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the night. The letters consisted of the following chant to the Twilight's Hammer:\nTwilight cultists who accompanied &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; at one point used the following chant:\nThose who betray the faith of the Twilight's Hammer, and are accused of &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blaspheming&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and their cult, are sentenced to death to serve as an example for the others cultists.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"Cho'gall the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;Ogre-Mage&lt;/a&gt;\"\nClan Colors: \"Violet\"\nBackground: \"Obsessed with the notion that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; is the harbinger of apocalyptic doom to all the lands that it ravages, the Twilight's Hammer feels a sacrosanct gratification in the destruction of all that it encounters. Led by the cunning Ogre Mage Cho'gall, the Twilight's Hammer has strong ties to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;. Its loyalty to the Horde is not as strong as its belief in its sacred mission of oblivion.\"\nDomain: &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nThe history of the Twilight's Hammer begins with &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall was made the leader of an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; after its previous chieftain was executed for disobeying the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. The clan's name was then changed to Twilight's Hammer; its original name and that of its former chieftain was stricken from all records. &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Keeper%20Havunth\"&gt;Havunth&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the original clan.\nA different version of how Cho'gall obtained the clan is presented when the greatest ogre mage, Cho'gall (the leader of the ogre magi and loyal follower of Gul'dan), impressed Doomhammer so much that the orc warchief granted the ogre mage his own clan, Twilight's Hammer.\nThey had a strong tie with the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver Clan&lt;/a&gt;, although their methods and goals proved much different. the Twilight's Hammer proved to be a destructive juggernaut, nearly unstoppable in battle. The ogres and orcs of the Twilight's Hammer embraced raw fury, enjoying the feeling of annihilating everything in their path. They remained loyal to the Horde for a time, only because it gave them a means to focus their slaughter; as the Horde weakened and the Stormreavers died, the remainder of the Twilight's Hammer abandoned both. It is likely that Cho'gall died defending Gul'dan at the Tomb of Sargeras, but the Twilight's Hammer retreated for a time, rebuilding its forces and biding its time. While the truth behind how this happened remains a mystery, the modern Twilight's Hammer retains the destructive nature of Cho'gall's clan, but almost nothing else. Somehow, one of the Old Gods has managed to make this clan its pawn; and since that time, the clan's numbers and power have dramatically increased. Even humans and other former members of the Alliance flock to join the service of the elemental lords and help bring about the complete destruction of Azeroth. The largest groups of the Twilight's Hammer now camp near the locations where they believe the Old Gods and their minions are sealed away; many wait for C'Thun's awakening in Silithus, and others serve Ragnaros in the Blackrock Depths alongside the Dark Iron dwarves. The Twilight's Hammer clan's color was violet.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vyral%20the%20Vile\"&gt;Vyral the Vile&lt;/a&gt; was known to be the leader of the entire cult.\nMilitary forces.\nWhat the Twilight's Hammer lacks in military training, it more than makes up for in fervor. Every member would willingly die for the cult, fully believing the Old Gods would reward them for their sacrifice.\nMembers of lower echelons of the Twilight Hammer (which is most of them) are predominately of the non-magical classes, mostly barbarians, rogues, and warriors. Other non-magical classes are known, but less common. As one ascends through the ranks of the organization, spellcasters become more common. The twilight overlords are almost exclusively spellcasters. Most of the spellcasters are arcanists, specifically elementalists.\nThis hierarchical pyramid is also indicative of how the Twilight's Hammer cult approaches defense. The first cultists the heroes encounter are likely to be low-level initiates. Only if that fails to deter them do the heroes face higher-ranking members, increasing in rank and power as they plunge into the depths of the temple. To catch sight of the inner circle, the heroes must breach the inner sanctum. The twilight lord deigns to fight only if the sect as a whole is threatened (in other words, to preserve his own life or goals). By that point, of course, the heroes are depleted from fighting the cultists, in theory making them easy prey for the twilight lord (which makes him look even more impressive to his followers).\nShould a Twilight's Hammer sect be incited to attack another group, their offensive tactics differ little from their defense. Low-level members act as scouts, while the main force attacks in waves of incrementally increasing power, until they subdue their foe, and the twilight lord \u2014 or one of his representatives \u2014 can swoop in and claim victory. The Twilight's Hammer rarely uses such overt measures, however, preferring instead to scare off those who stand in its way. Accompanying each act of sabotage, kidnapping, or assassination is always an unambiguous \u2014 and gruesome \u2014 sign that the Twilight's Hammer is responsible.\nRedesigning.\nSince the early stages of Cataclysm's development, the Twilight's Hammer Cult was intented to be a face of the \"\", with entire dungeons and zones devoted to them. What was once Cho'gall and his clan became an enormous, world-hating cult that involved all races of Azeroth. The developers felt that they could use existing art of all races and add it to the pre-existing art of the Cult. However, the only art direction the developers came up with was the banner found in the Cult's camps, so they didn't have much to give the Cult their own unique look. One angle that was explored was the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; connection: statues of &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20One\"&gt;Faceless One&lt;/a&gt;s and lamps with the same motif worked into them were designed. The final art direction for the Cult's environment were dragon's heads, scales, and horns, purple flames, and &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; blades. Elementium was chosen to be the Cult's \"key-mineral,\" like &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\". Since the Twilight's Hammer was summoning elementium up from the ground, the developers decided to give unforged elementium the organic, spiny look found within the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "50201", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50201", "title": "Glancing blow", "text": "Glancing blows are combat events that can occur when fighting a mob more than 3 levels higher.\nThese occur only on white damage and result in the attack having its damage reduced in proportion to the difference between the attacker's weapon skill (capped at the attacker's level * 5), and the target's defense skill.\nAt current Glancing blows occur at about 20% of the time versus mobs that are above your level. These attacks only do 75% of their normal damage versus a mob that is 3 levels above you. Bosses are counted as \"your level+3\".\nAgainst &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; with defense roughly equal to or higher than your &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. your weapon skill), you will have a chance to land a glancing blow instead of a normal hit. A glancing blow only occurs on white melee damage and does less damage than a normal blow. If the attacker's weapon skill is \"less\" than his level * 5, the damage reduction will be proportional to the difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the target's defense. \nEffect from weapon skill.\nWeapon skill greater than the normal max for your level (i.e. your level * 5) does not reduce the chance for a glancing blow to land. \nGlancing blows do not occur against players, only against mobs. At present ranged attacks do not result in glancing blows.\nGlancing blow chance.\nPre 2.1.\nPlayers have a chance to perform a glancing blow against &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; equal to 10% plus 2% per point of difference between attack rating and defense. Non-melee classes level 30 and higher have a 60% chance to glancing blow. Non-melee classes from level 11 to level 29 have a (level - 10) * 3% chance of a glancing blow. Weapon skill \"above\" your level * 5, as from gear or racial bonuses, affects neither the damage reduction nor the chances of landing a &lt;a href=\"glancing%20blow\"&gt;glancing blow&lt;/a&gt;. A mob's Defense skill is equal to its level * 5.\nThis formula means that, for a level 60 player with fully trained weapon skill, 30% of all white-damage melee attacks will be Glancing Blows against level 62 &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, and 40% of all white-damage melee attacks will be Glancing Blows against level 63 &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe presence of your weapon skill in this formula, rather than just your level, explains why training up a newly-acquired weapon skill against mobs close to your own level results in many, many Glancing Blows at first.\nPost 2.1.\nThe release notes for patch 2.1 say the following:\nThe new formula seems to be:\nglancing blow chance = 10 + mob defense - player weapon skill\nFor a level 73 mob, that's a 25% chance of glancing blow.\nThe pre-2.1 automatic base glancing blow chance for non-melee classes, when attacking targets level 30 and higher, seems to have been removed.\nPost 3.0.\nExperimentally, players using Recount have consistently seen 24% of their melee auto-attacks against Raid Boss monsters be glancing blows.\nPost 3.3.\nCaster classes no longer have an increased chance to land a glancing blow.\nGlancing blow damage reduction.\nThe damage of a glancing blow is complicated. It starts by calculating the difference between the target's Defense and the attacker's attack rating, where the attack rating is \"capped\" at the attacker's level * 5 (just as it is for determining the chance of a glancing blow occurring). This is then used to calculate a minimum and maximum damage factor. The actual damage factor is then randomized between these two values. The low value starts at 1.3 - 0.05 * rating difference. If the attacker is a caster then this is reduced by 0.7 more. The smaller value of this and 0.6 is kept as the low end. If the attacker is a melee class then instead the lower value of 0.91 and (1.3 - 0.05 * rating difference) is used for the low. Regardless, the low end will not go below 0.01.\nThe high end of the range starts at 1.2 - 0.03 * rating difference. Casters are reduced a further 0.3. The high value regardless of class is kept between 0.2 and 0.99. \nThe average reduction from a glancing blow is therefore (high + low) / 2 using the formulae above. This gives a level 60 player, with a weapon skill of 300 or more, a 15% damage reduction with all Glancing Blows against level 62 &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, and a 35% damage reduction with all Glancing Blows against level 63 &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of 2.0.1, the player's weapon skill is capped at level * 5 in the damage reduction formula, just like it is in the formula for determining the \"chance\" of a glancing blow. (Before 2.0.1, glancing blows landed against a level 63 NPC by a level 60 player with +10 Weapon Skill would do nearly as much damage as the player's ordinary hits did.)\nGlancing blow implications - crit cap.\nThe fact that 24% of all white-damage melee attacks made against a Boss Mob will be Glancing Blows, no matter what you do, has implications when choosing how much Crit Rating gear to use. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;table-based&lt;/a&gt; nature of WoW's attack resolution system, Glancing Blows take \"precedence\" over critical hits. If your combined miss, dodge, parry, block, glancing blow, and crit chance against a mob is 100% or higher, you will never see a normal white-damage hit made against that mob (all your hits will be either glancing blows or critical hits). If it \"exceeds\" 100%, it is your critical hit chance that gets \"pushed off the end\" of the table. Any Crit Rating gear added past this point will not improve your critical hit chance with white-damage melee attacks at all. This is sometimes called the \"Crit cap\" (see &lt;a href=\"Critical_Strike%23Crit_Cap\"&gt;Critical_Strike#Crit_Cap&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the worst case -- dual wielding with no hit rating (27% miss chance) from the front of a Raid Boss mob (10+% parry, 6.5% dodge) who can block (6.5% chance), the crit cap is 26%. Moving behind such a mob removes the chance to block and parry, increasing the crit cap to 42.5%. Adding hit rating, or +hit chance talents, will raise this cap by reducing the chance to miss. Adding Expertise will raise this cap by reducing the chance to parry and dodge.\nIn a raid situation, it is easier to approach the crit cap than you might think. Consider a dual-wielding enhancement shaman with talents but no hit rating (19% miss), meleeing from behind (6.5% dodge, 24% glance). His crit cap would be 49.5%. With a dual mongoose proc (9.6% crit), Leader of the Pack (5% crit), Grace of Air (3.48% crit), Elixir of Major Agility (2.31% crit) and Seal of the Crusader (+3% crit), the shaman would be crit capped with only 26.11% crit from his gear and talents.\nMelee commonly exceeding the 40% crit mark should be cognizant of the cap and adjust their buffs and weapon enchant accordingly.\n\"Yellow damage\" melee attacks, including both Instant attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Sinister%20Strike\"&gt;Sinister Strike&lt;/a&gt; and on-next-swing attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt;, do not produce Glancing Blows. For these attacks, added Crit Rating gear beyond the \"Crit cap\" described above will improve your critical hit chance.\nRanged weapon attacks (Bows, guns and crossbows) do not have glancing blows at all, thus weapon skill does not affect this for them. It works the same for all classes that can use ranged weapons (hunters, rogues and warriors)."}

Some are traveling through central &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly find themselves surrounded by cloaked figures demanding their valuables in exchange for passage. Others, despite their skills and talents, get caught in desperate situations \u2014 and find a member of the Brotherhood stepping forward to assist them, then vanishing back into the night.\nBoth groups tell their stories and hear what others say about the Brotherhood. They hear of how the Brotherhood was cast out of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and how it rebels against the authority that once ruled its members. They hear of how the Brotherhood's members hone their technological acumen and teach one another the secret art of the ambush.\nA character who wishes to join the Defias Brotherhood must mark herself with a cog tattoo on the back of their right hand. A very few choose to mark themselves with a cog tattoo and set off into the wilderness. Out of desperation, dedication, or determination they decide to join the quest of the Brotherhood to change the world one unwary traveler at a time. Turning their backs on society, they join the Defias Brotherhood and become renegades.\nA Defias renegade is wellversed in the staging and execution of ambushes, and rarely falls into one herself. Defias renegades are skilled at finding or detecting non-magical traps. The Defias Brotherhood instructs its members not only in the construction of devices, but also in ways to impede the operation of a functioning device.\nThey are &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and can speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. They are one of two major units of the Defias Brotherhood (who are somewhat tougher)."}

He pauses in the colonnade long enough for you to sneak into the tomb, use the mark, and sneak out.\nYou use the Mark on the pedestal in front of Uther's tomb and statue - it contains the description of the tomb (written in Common). You have to be near the pedestal to use the mark, and it takes 20 seconds to use it.\nWhen you use the mark, the ghost of Uther Lightbringer will appear."}

Have one player designated to run around and activate them, or have several players, each assigned to one crystal. Since the crystals take a few seconds to activate the defense system, you should activate them the moment Ichoron disappears. There are five defense control crystals:\nImportant detail: the tank should tank Ichoron in the pond. Since no add spawn from there, it will totally remove any bad luck you may have when tanking the boss in the middle or elsewhere, where adds may manage to sneak in before you can kill them.\nThree crystals are required before Ichoron enrages and stops splitting. It may be possible to do this achievement by simply killing the globules very fast, but this would require a well-geared group who probably has defenseless already and therefore would have no reason to not use the defense crystals.\nStrategy (Level 90+).\nKill Ichoron as quickly as possible. High level players can kill him in a few seconds (or possibly even in one hit) before he gets a chance to summon any Ichor Globules."}

Although young, she was thrust into a position of leadership and coordinated the kaldorei effort throughout &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; until her death on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, she was raised into undeath as a &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Following the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Delaryn, along with other undead night elves, sought &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to help them.\nBiography.\nBefore the war.\nDelaryn originally held the rank of lieutenant among the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. She accepted the possibility of dying when she first became its member. Since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, she was mentored by the older and higher-ranking Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt;, and the two grew close.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Delaryn reunited with Cordressa when the older Sentinel returned to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; with the surviving &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; members after the events in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Delaryn was present during a conversation between Cordressa and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; in which Tyrande informed the two Sentinels of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s apparent plans to send hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers to Silithus. Not long after, Cordressa and the other high-ranking Sentinels were dispatched south to reinforce Silithus, while Delaryn and the rest of the Sentinels were sent to fill their positions in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Delaryn wasn't looking forward to serving in Ashenvale but was excited at the prospect of serving as the second-in-command to &lt;a href=\"Anaris%20Windwood\"&gt;Anaris Windwood&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinel commander of the region, whom Delaryn admired as a personal hero. However, she quickly became disillusioned after she and the others arrived in Ashenvale and discovered Anaris' harsh attitude.\nWar of the Thorns.\nWhile walking through Ashenvale days later, Delaryn unexpectedly reunited with her lover, the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt;, whom she hadn't met in years. While drowsing in each others' arms a few days later, the two were awoken by a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. After killing the intruder, Delaryn and Ferryn raced back to Silverwind Refuge to find that it had come under attack. Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Vannara\"&gt;Vannara&lt;/a&gt; informed them that Horde rogues were attacking outposts across Ashenvale and that Commander Windwood was out on patrol. Delaryn and Ferryn caught up with the commander and informed her of the situation, but moments later, &lt;a href=\"Rifen\"&gt;Rifen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt; attacked the group and killed Anaris and several Sentinels. Lorash was quickly forced to flee but Rifen was wounded and pinned to the ground. Delaryn, now commander, interrogated the dying rogue and realized in horror that the Horde was clearing a path through Ashenvale to attack Darnassus and that the talk of Silithus had all been a diversion.\nDelaryn quickly sent Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Eriadnar\"&gt;Eriadnar&lt;/a&gt; to inform &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in Darnassus and Ferryn to scout out the Horde army in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, she gathered forces in Silverwind Refuge and prepared to mount a defense at the &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt; by burning the bridges. Not long after Eriadnar and Ferryn's return, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; arrived from Darnassus and opened portals for druid reinforcements. While Ferryn and the druids were sent to harry the Horde's forces, Delaryn's troops held the Horde forces off by firing at them from the western banks of the Falfarren, even despite the presence of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself among the Horde troops. However, the kaldorei were forced to retreat when the Horde began magically freezing the river to allow their soldiers to cross. Having received word from the rogue &lt;a href=\"Tavar\"&gt;Tavar&lt;/a&gt; that Malfurion was on his way, Delaryn gathered with Tavar and a team of druids to make a stand in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; and buy the archdruid time. When Ferryn was not among the druids that Tavar gathered, Delaryn knew that he was likely dead but refused to give herself time to grieve.\nThe elves gathered nearby corpses and placed them in Astranaar, masking their wounds to make them look as if a battle had taken place in Astranaar, before hiding around the town to ambush the Horde forces. When High Overlord Saurfang arrived, Tavar disguised himself as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and tried to lure Saurfang into the open, but the orcs saw through the deception and killed him. Moments later, Malfurion arrived, and Delaryn's forces leapt from the trees to ambush the Horde soldiers. The attack nearly succeeded until Warchief Sylvanas joined the fray, forcing the night elves to retreat. In the midst of the battle, Sylvanas made eye contact with Delaryn and smiled briefly at her.\nDelaryn and the remnants of her forces reunited with Malfurion as well as with Sentinel Eriadnar at the border between Ashenvale and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, where they witnessed Malfurion calling upon the forest's &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy many of the intruders and form an impenetrable barrier. Not long after, the night elf fleet arrived and began bombarding the Horde forces on the shore. However, when the wisps began to disperse and Saurfang scaled the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; to invade Darkshore from the north, Malfurion knew that Darnassus was lost and ordered Delaryn to take her forces to &lt;a href=\"Mist%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Mist's Edge&lt;/a&gt; to do what they could.\nBurning of Teldrassil.\nDelaryn fought fiercely and witnessed how the night elf ships that could still set sail fled from &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. She was hit by multiple Horde arrows, shrugging off the first few until the last one caused her to collapse on the ground. In that moment, the dying Delaryn saw Ferryn beside her, and she realized that he was dead and that what she saw was only an image conjured up by her mind.\nDelaryn then saw Sylvanas approaching and asked her why she would invade the tree; the Horde had already won and only innocents remained in the tree. The Sentinel tried in vain to remind the warchief of her past life as the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General\"&gt;ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas told Delaryn not to grieve, for she would soon join her loved ones. Delaryn explained that she grieved for Sylvanas, for she had made life her enemy, and that was a war she could never win; that she could kill her people, but she could never kill hope. In response, Sylvanas turned Delaryn's head so that she was forced to gaze at Teldrassil in her final moments, then gave her forces the order to burn the tree.\nThe ghostly image of Ferryn urged Delaryn to close her eyes and let go of her hatred and fear, but the Sentinel refused, and the image of the druid vanished. Delaryn's thoughts then turned against &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; for having abandoned the kaldorei despite all that they had given in Teldrassil's defense. In her last moments, Delaryn wondered if it would hurt when she passed into oblivion.\nTides of Vengeance.\nWhen the Horde returned to Darkshore, Delaryn was sought out by them specifically on Sylvanas's orders. The attempts to raise her were fought off by the night elves, first by &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; who was slain, and then by Tyrande and Malfurion. However, although Tyrande managed to kill one of the Val'kyr, the Horde succeeded in raising not only Delaryn but also Sira. Delaryn and Sira told Tyrande that she and Elune had abandoned them despite their trust in her, and so now they were &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Delaryn became captain of the Forsaken's new night elf &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s. \nWhen the Horde controls &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; she can be found at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, where when talked to remarks that she and the Horde are on the same side now and that death has a way of making everything clearer.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Delaryn appears after the death of the &lt;a href=\"AzerMEK%20Mk.%20II\"&gt;AzerMEK Mk. IIs&lt;/a&gt; to defend the platform of &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;. Upon defeat, she remarks that the Alliance's hope will fail them, before escaping.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries clashed with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s loyalists, which saw the conflict ending in Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. As a result, many of the undead within the Horde felt lost, betrayed, and abandoned, including Delaryn and the other Forsaken night elves. Seeking to help them, &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; arranged a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Though initially surprised, Derek and Calia quickly offered to help the dark rangers and subsequently left the estate with them, vowing to help them find a future rooted in something beyond hatred and malice.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Delaryn relocated to the rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; where she stood guard at the northern entrance, raining arrows at the blighted undead. She was amongst the Forsaken who moved into the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; following its cleansing. While some of the Forsaken night elves departed to rejoin the Alliance, Delaryn remained with the Horde. When questioned about this, Delaryn admitted that she didn't know if the kaldorei would welcome her, as during that violent time of confusion she fought against them and lost their faith. However, Delaryn wouldn't blame them for their distrust. She then admitted that while they were on the road of accepting themselves, they weren't done, but fortunately were not alone anymore.\nWhen informed about &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt; being in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, from Maw Walkers aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt;, she was glad that he wasn't in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; anymore, and that he had a chance to know peace.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, after the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28zone%29\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Delaryn traveled there as well and was found with a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28Emerald%20Dream%29\"&gt;Dark Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Encampment\"&gt;Central Encampment&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Sent by &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, she was looking for the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, and she sent them to Lilian and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; who were hunting the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\n \"(The Burning of Teldrassil cinematic plays)\"\nDo not fear, we are on the same side this time.\nDeath has a way of making everything clearer.\n&lt;Delaryn's body is long cold.&gt;\nWe must defeat the Horde and their vile warchief, though it might cost us that which we hold most dear.\nIshnu-alah. We walk the night.\nAfter Darkshore, I do not know if they would welcome me. In that violent time of confusion, I fought against the kaldorei. I lost my faith.\nI would not blame them for not accepting me, or the others that were raised in the aftermath. We may be on the road to accepting ourselves, but we are not done. And, fortunately, we are not alone anymore.\n&lt;Delaryn's subtle expression twists with a pained emotion, which then melts to relief.&gt;\nI am glad to hear that he is not in that dark, terrible place anymore. At least one of us has a chance to know peace. Thank you for telling me.\nIn a different place and a different time, I would find this place profound... and beautiful.\nBut now I just feel nothing.\nEven that has been taken from me."}

At the request of &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, she managed to convince the paladin order to create an alliance with the Conclave to destroy the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. After she found her true path in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Delas officially became the first night elf paladin and champion of the Silver Hand.\nHistory.\nDelas is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Moonfang%20%28family%29\"&gt;Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, a family of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who lived in a village of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, she followed the path of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and for many years she studied to be a &lt;a href=\"priestesses%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Iron%20Horde\"&gt;war against the Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Delas traveled with her sister &lt;a href=\"Daleera%20Moonfang\"&gt;Daleera Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in , and settled at &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in .\nDuring their battle against &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27var\"&gt;Gul'var&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Woods\"&gt;Cursed Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; asked Delas to prepare a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; in the night elf outpost, in order to sanctify its water and use it against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the forest. Consequently, she sent Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20of%20Lunar%20Rock\"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Rock\"&gt;Lunar Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Secluded%20Glade\"&gt;Secluded Glade&lt;/a&gt;, which she considered perfect for use in the dedication of the moonwell to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Once the chunk was in her possession, she assured them that she would complete the Archmage's request.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; told her that the creatures of the woods were cursed by the same &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies keeping Khadgar from scrying into Gul'var, she asked the adventurers to kill a few &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Toad\"&gt;corrupted toads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Wolf\"&gt;cursed wolves&lt;/a&gt;, because she considered that it was better to kill them than to let them suffer any longer. She then mentioned that if they had been in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, she would have tried to save them by other means, but that under the current conditions they didn't have time for that.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Delas joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, an order uniting all the priesthoods of Azeroth, and participated in the ritual of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in order to return the &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saraka\"&gt;Saraka&lt;/a&gt; back to its holy form, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the invasion, after the Conclave learned that the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; intended to attack the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; with his armies of demons, she explained to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of the Conclave that she has been studying &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; for some time, and asked them to find &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Runestone\"&gt;Demonic Runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, in hopes of discovering something that would help them locate Balnazzar. After acquiring the runestones, she resolved to find a quiet place to decipher them. At the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;Antonidas Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, she was asked by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, sent by her friend &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt;, to assist the paladin order in deciphering the &lt;a href=\"%3ACodex%20of%20Command\"&gt;:Codex of Command&lt;/a&gt;. She accepted the request, and asked for the &lt;a href=\"%3AFel%20Lexicon\"&gt;:Fel Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Demon%20Blood\"&gt;Flasks of Demon Blood&lt;/a&gt; to be able to quickly help translating the book. After she deciphered the tome, she revealed to the Highlord that it contained records of the Legion forces at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;, and their plan to open a portal directly to the demon world &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. Since the situation was serious, she requested the Highlord's permission to accompany them at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to offer her services to the Silver Hand, she entered the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; to meet Aponi, and then promised to send word to the Conclave for reinforcements. She later accompanied Aponi and &lt;a href=\"Arator%20Windrunner\"&gt;Arator Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; with their combined troops to destroy the demonic portal at Felblaze Ingress.\nHowever, after their arrival, all the paladins and priests present were defeated by Balnazzar and his army, and Delas was taken with them to Niskara for unknown reasons. She was later rescued by the Highlord of the Silver Hand and the High Priest of the Conclave, and helped them to save the other prisoners. When she returned at the Netherlight Temple, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; asked her and the High Priest to try to get an audience with the war council of the Silver Hand, and to convince the paladins to help them defeat Balnazzar. At the Sanctum of Light, they were welcomed as guests and met &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Julia%20Celeste\"&gt;Justicar Julia Celeste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; who eventually agreed to bring their aid to the Conclave after listening to her arguments.\nDuring the preparations for the battle against Balnazzar, Delas met the Highlord in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions%20%28Sanctum%20of%20Light%29\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt; and told them that after she walked into the halls of the Sanctum of Light, she discovered a new path to complete her training which she considered incomplete, and asked to join the ranks of the Silver Hand. In front of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Altar of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;, she took her sacred oath and pledged her life to the paladin order. The Highlord accepted her induction, and through their holy powers, she was reborn as the first night elf to join the Knights of the Silver Hand. She was later present during the battle in the Netherlight Temple, and fought the demons alongside her paladin and priest allies.\nLegionfall.\nDuring the campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Delas met the Highlord in the Sanctum after they determined the worth of paladin recruits, and asked them if they would deem her worthy if they tested her on the moment. Despite her desire to join the offensive on the Broken Shore, she explained that she began to doubt herself after discovering her family's sigil among the demonic runes she have been deciphering. She then asked the Highlord to seek out her family at &lt;a href=\"Andu%27talah\"&gt;Andu'talah&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, in order to find what was the connection of her ancestors with the Burning Legion, and to discern if she was truly worthy to join the Silver Hand.\nIn Val'sharah, the Highlord met &lt;a href=\"Erelyn%20Moonfang\"&gt;Erelyn Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, who was relieved that Delas did not come, as she would have been horrified to learn that an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; raised their ancestors in service of the Legion. After they killed the demon, the Highlord returned to Delas with a &lt;a href=\"Felstone%20Pendant\"&gt;Felstone pendant&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Scroll%20%282%29\"&gt;blank scroll&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerus%27%20Journal\"&gt;journal of Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; from within &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;. After soaking the scroll in demon's blood, Delas was shocked to learn that her uncles had made a pact with the Legion in life; his family would be protected, but the souls of their family would be bound to them for eternity. Panicked, Delas implored the Highlord to smash the pendant with their &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;, as it bound her soul to the Legion.\nUpon its destruction, she found that it contained the soul of &lt;a href=\"Nerus%20Moonfang\"&gt;Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; himself. Angrily demanding an explanation, Nerus solemnly apologized for his actions but told them that they could still save the Moonfang family spirits enslaved by the Legion. Traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Highlord freed the night elf spirits and slew &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder%20Zorak\"&gt;Oathbinder Zorak&lt;/a&gt;, ending the curse placed upon the Moonfangs. Following this, Nerus pledged himself to the Knights of the Silver Hand to begin to atone for his actions, which Delas commented was a start for his redemption.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nDelas Moonfang is a Holy Paladin &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nQuotes.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nElune-Adore, &lt;class&gt;.\nLegion.\nGreetings to you, priest.

She remains in the rear of a battle, organizing the efforts to retrieve and heal the wounded."}

In preparation for their reemergence in the world, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;the shadowy master of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; commanded Emperor Vek'lor to create a new obsidian statue superior to all other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Destroyer\"&gt;Destroyers&lt;/a&gt;. Vek'lor sought his twin brother's aid in the task, and while Vek'nilash used his physical might to craft a grand body of volcanic rock, Vek'lor fortified the shell with powerful magic. \nEmperor Vek'lor named the finished construct Moam, and observed as the dark master infused it with life. He was pleased and surprised to find that the improved Obsidian Destroyer was far more versatile than its earlier counterparts. The &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt; intended to use Moam as a colossal weapon, knowing that its strengths would help it survive in the thick of melee as well as magical combat-but they did not expect for the construct's abilities to advance further without their own assistance. \nFar more surprising, even to the arcane emperors, was Moam's ability to summon burning elementals crafted of pure mana. \nIt was only after Vek'lor witnessed this demonstration of Moam's unbridled power that the source of the construct's seemingly limitless energy was revealed - three tortured dragons: Arygos, Merithra and Caelestrasz, trapped alive within Ahn'Qiraj but not granted the mercy of death as the emperors had believed. \nThe twins were stunned to learn that their overseer had somehow bound the three dragons, then drained their inherent magical energy and corrupted it for his own use - fortifying not only Moam, but the rest of his twisted creations as well. Truly, it seemed as if there was no limit to the powers of the Ancient One.\nStrategies.\n3 Priests, Warlocks, and Hunters.\nHaving three each of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; (Viper Sting does not stack) makes this fight easier, if you have the coordination together. Basics of this strategy are mana drain, ice traps/banish, and DPS like crazy.\nStarting out, you need to send in your MT, any non-mana users, and the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to heal. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s should stay behind and wait 2\u20133 seconds before running in (This will prevent them from getting their mana drained by Moam).\nHave all three &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and all three &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s drain mana. Also have a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; keep a &lt;a href=\"Viper%20Sting%20%28hunter%20ability%29\"&gt;Viper Sting (hunter ability)&lt;/a&gt; on it. This is enough mana burning to keep Moam from doing an Arcane Explosion. All other classes will be doing damage and healing.\nAfter 90 seconds, 3 arcane elementals (Mana Fiends) will spawn - You want Moam to be below 45% by this time. &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can lay freeze traps in front of the Mana Fiends, then have a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; banish when he is able. Using &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;/Freeze Trap, a hunter can pick up the add and prevent the arcane explosion. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s will re-banish whenever capable.\nWith Moam a 45%, 1 &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; can take a quick break to perform heals on essential members (no more than 30 seconds). At this point Non-stop DPS on Moam will bring him down easily.\n3 priests and 3 warlocks.\nHave all three &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and all three &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s drain mana. Also have a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; keep a &lt;a href=\"Viper%20Sting%20%28hunter%20ability%29\"&gt;Viper Sting (hunter ability)&lt;/a&gt; on it. This is enough mana burning to keep Moam from doing an Arcane Explosion. All other classes will be doing damage and healing.\nAfter 90 seconds, 3 arcane elementals (Mana Fiends) will spawn. The warlocks will keep these banished for the remainder of the fight. Priests will continue to mana burn. The rest of the raid will continue to attack Moam and try to kill it before it reverts to normal. Since Moam cannot move while it is turned to stone, there is no need for the raid to manage aggro.\nWhen Moam dies, the raid should heal themselves. Let the banish end on the Mana Fiends one at a time and proceed to kill them. They do not despawn when Moam dies, but if the Mana Fiends wipe the raid when Moam is dead, they will despawn.\nIf the raid is short on warlocks, the elementals can be burned down as they only have approximately 15,000 health. It may be advisable to have 3 warlocks as the elementals do considerable AoE arcane damage.\nNote that the priests will possibly run out of mana during this fight. Druids can use Innervate on priests if necessary. Mana potions are highly recommended. Priests should be aware that Inner Focus and the free spell therein do not count as casting for purposes of interrupting 100% mana regeneration. A carefully timed Inner Focus and mana burn can result in enough regeneration to cast the spell once more.\nFewer than 3 priests or warlocks.\nAll priests and warlocks should still be mana burning Moam, but it will do an Arcane Explosion. Let it explode at about 80 seconds. This will cause Moam to turn to stone with very little mana, allowing warlocks and priests to keep up the mana drain so Moam will not not revert to normal prematurely.\nEveryone but the main tank and a healer needs to run away from Moam before it does the Arcane Explosion. A &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Arcane%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Arcane Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; on the tank is recommended. After Moam explodes, it's mana returns to 0. When it stoneforms, either kill or banish the Mana Fiends and finish Moam off.\nDPS.\nIf the raid has a lot of DPS, the raid can try to kill Moam in under 90 seconds to prevent it from turning to stone and summoning Mana Fiends. If the raid is lacking warlocks and priests, then this may be the raid's best strategy. He has about 340000 HP, requiring an average DPS from the raid of 3778 in this time (just under 200 DPS per person on average).\nNot enough DPS.\nIf the raid is wiping to Moam when it reaches full mana and there are not enough warlocks, hunters, and priests to mana drain it fast enough, then &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s can shapeshift into cat form for extra damage. Since druids in cat form are not affected by the mana drain, Moam will have fewer players to mana drain from."}

The \"World of Warcraft\"-specific term for a \"mob\" is &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt; which was coined by Blizzard and first used in \"Warcraft III\". The term \"mob\" is in widespread use in the &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; genre, which spread into WoW early on.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", mobs differ from &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s in that they are usually monsters that share a common name with several others rather than having a unique name or title (but, see &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; mobs), are non-friendly to everyone, are non-interactive, and/or exist solely for the purpose of being killed. These are part of the main aspect of &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; and are found throughout the game world. Note, though, that &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; NPCs are essentially mobs. There are also \"named mobs\" that are either quest related which are usually stronger than the surrounding unnamed mobs or rare mobs that are often &lt;a href=\"Elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", mobs differ from &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt;s in that critters are primarily for ambiance, provide no direct experience and little or no loot, and are trivial to kill. There are subtle mechanical differences, such as critters cannot be targeted by the use of the tab key (mobs can be).\nEtymology.\nThe term was originally used in (Multi-User Dungeons/Dimensions/Domains), the text-based precursors to MMORPGs. In many MUDs, in-game objects are defined either as stationary item \"objects\" (ranging from fountains to wearable equipment that you could pick up) or \"mobiles,\" shortened to \"mobs\" (this included any NPC, be they aggressive monster or friendly shopkeeper, even if they were not actually moving around due to STAY_ROOM or similar flags in their properties)."}

It is a function of the difference between your level and the mob's level. Click &lt;a href=\"DifficultyColors\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; For a full table list per level\n Red: Mob Level &gt;= Char Level + 5\n Orange: Mob Level = Char Level + (3 or 4)\n Yellow: Mob Level = Char Level \u00b1 2\n Green: Mob Level &lt;= Char Level - 3, but above Gray Level\n Gray: Mob Level &lt;= Gray Level\nThe highest mob level that gives you no experience is the Gray Level. It varies based on your character level as follows: (\"notes where levels have not been confirmed\")\n Char level 1-5: Gray level = 0 (all mobs give XP)\n Char level 6-39: Gray level = Char level - FLOOR(Char level/10) - 5\n Char level 40-59: Gray level = Char level - FLOOR(Char level/5) - 1\n Char level 60-70: Gray level = Char level - 9 = 51 @ 60, 61 @ 70\nBasic Formula.\nThe basic formula has changed in Patch 4.03a to be relative to the Mob's level and not your own. \nThe amount of experience you will get for a solo kill on a mob whose level is equal to your level is:\n XP = (Mob Level * 5) + 45, where Char Level = Mob Level, for mobs in Azeroth\n XP = (Mob Level * 5) + 235, where Char Level = Mob Level, for mobs in Outland\n XP = (Mob Level * 5) + 580, where Char Level = Mob Level, for mobs in Northrend \nFor example, a level 60 character killing a level 60 mob in Azeroth gets (60 * 5) + 45 = 345 exp. Killing a level 60 mob in Outland gives (60 * 5) + 235 = 535 exp.\nHigher Level Mobs.\n XP = (Base XP) * (1 + 0.05 * (Mob Level - Char Level) ), where Mob Level &gt; Char Level\nThis is the amount of experience you will get for a solo kill on a mob whose level is higher than your level. This is known to be valid for up to Mob Level = Char Level + 4 (Orange and high-Yellow Mobs). Red mobs cap out at the same experience as orange. Higher elite mobs may also cap at the same amount (ie are not doubled).\nLower Level Mobs.\nFor a given character level, the amount of XP given by lower-level mobs is a linear function of the Mob Level. The amount of experience reaches zero when the difference between the Char Level and Mob Level reaches a certain point. This is called the Zero Difference value, and is given by:\n ZD = 5, when Char Level = 1 - 7\n ZD = 6, when Char Level = 8 - 9\n ZD = 7, when Char Level = 10 - 11\n ZD = 8, when Char Level = 12 - 15\n ZD = 9, when Char Level = 16 - 19 \n ZD = 11, when Char Level = 20 - 29\n ZD = 12, when Char Level = 30 - 39\n ZD = 13, when Char Level = 40 - 44\n ZD = 14, when Char Level = 45 - 49\n ZD = 15, when Char Level = 50 - 54\n ZD = 16, when Char Level = 55 - 59\n ZD = 17, when Char Level = 60 - 84\nUsing the ZD values above, the formula for Mob XP for any mob of level lower than your character is:\n XP = (Base XP) * (1 - (Char Level - Mob Level)/ZD )\n where Mob Level &lt; Char Level, and Mob Level &gt; Gray Level\nExample calculations:\n using Char Level = 20.\n so Gray Level = 13, by the table above.\n killing any mob level 13 or lower will give 0 XP.\n Basic XP is (Mob level * 5 + 45). \n Killing a level 20 mob will give (20 * 5 + 45) = 145 XP.\n For a level 21 mob, we have XP = (21 * 5 + 45) * (1 + 0.05 * 1) = 157.5 rounded to 158 XP.\n ZD is 11, from the table above.\n For a level 18 mob, we have XP = (18 * 5 + 45) * (1 - 2/11) = 110.4 rounded to 110 XP.\n For a level 16 mob, we have XP = (16 * 5 + 45) * (1 - 4/11) = 79.54 rounded to 80 XP.\n For a level 14 mob, we have XP = (14 * 5 + 45) * (1 - 6/11) = 52.3 rounded to 52 XP.\nFor a full table valid before Patch 4.03a, complete with in-game observed values, see: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//mosa.unity.ncsu.edu/WoW/library/xpgrid.html\"&gt;Greenman's Solo XP Table&lt;/a&gt;\nFor a basic spreadsheet valid before Patch 4.03a that performs these calculations, see: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//spreadsheets.google.com/ccc%3Fkey%3DpEGVQcx6fU9Kaz4Kk51AJHw\"&gt;Solo Experience Google Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;\nElite Mobs.\nMobs that are flagged as &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; will give twice the amount of experience as a normal mob for the same level.\n Elite XP = 2 * XP\nThe &lt;a href=\"API%20UnitClassification\"&gt;API UnitClassification&lt;/a&gt; function can return 5 levels of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; status: \"worldboss\", \"rareelite\", \"elite\", \"rare\", and \"normal\". Mobs classified as \"elite\" gain the 2x bonus as described. Mobs classified as \"normal\" and \"rare\" do not. The other two classes are unknown at this time.\nMobs in 5-man instances give slightly more XP, but mobs in some raid instances give no XP. Raid instances that DO award XP include Upper Blackrock Spire, Zul'Gurub and Karazhan.\n(\"elites in instances give 2.5 * XP when solo-ed; untested for normal mobs in instances - )\"\n(\"confirmed zero XP at lv 58 in Molten Core and Zul'Aman. confirmed XP gain in Zul'Gurub when a lv 56 dinged 57 but exact amount earned is unknown - \") \"Confirmed XP gain for Lvl 74 in Karazhan - \" \"(Some monsters, like in the Amphitheater of Anguish, give the doubled exp PER player. If you do those quests with less than five players, you'll get more experience than this formula. The total amount of exp they deliver is 10 * normal_XP. Has to be confirmed, through. )\"\nRested Bonus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"rested\"&gt;rested&lt;/a&gt; bonus doubles the experience given by a mob.\n Rested XP = 2 * XP\nThis bonus is often reported as 50%. Consider this example for clarification:\n a Level 11 rogue, fighting a level 10 Forest Lurker.\n Basic XP for this level combination is 86 points.\n The rogue is fully rested.\n Combat log shows: \"Forest Lurker dies, you gain 172 experience (+86exp Rested bonus)\"\n The experience bar shows that the rogue gained a total of 172 XP.\n So the XP gained was 86 (Base XP) + 86 (Rested Bonus)\nThe bonus is not 50% of the base XP, it is 50% of the total XP gained.\nThe bonus is not 33% of the total gained, that is, the rogue above did not gain 172 + 86 XP total.\nThe rested bonus is accumulated as a certain number of future XP points. Your bonus on a kill will never exceed the amount of future XP points stored. Thus, if you have no rested bonus, and you stay briefly at an inn you will only accumulate 1 or 2 points. On your first kill thereafter, your Rested bonus will be that 1 or 2 points, not the full 100% bonus.\nSolo Experience Modifiers.\nThe experience amounts given above assume that the solo character and their pets have done 100% of the damage to kill the mob. Experience will be reduced when:\nExample: You're 6th level fighting a 6th level mob. If the ungrouped helper is level 10 or lower damage the mob, you will get full XP because a character level 10 or lower can receive XP from a 6th level mob. If the ungrouped helper is level 11 or higher, you get a tiny fraction of the XP.\nThe effect of this is that power-leveling low levels is much less effective than at higher levels. It is faster for low levels to kill without help, than it is to powerlevel them. It also makes it hard to determine the solo XP for high level mobs, since you won't get an accurate number unless the character does 100% of the damage.\nThe way to power-level is to be near the character level you're power-leveling. Thus, a 49th character will be much more effective than a 70th character in power-leveling a 40th level character. More effective would be multiple 49th characters power-leveling the 40th level character.\nLevel 60 and Up Characters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion raised the level cap from 60 to 70 when it was released. The Gray Level for a level 60 character changed from the previously known 47 to 51. The Zero Difference value at level 60 is indeed 17, and remains there up to level 69.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; expansion raised the level cap from 70 to 80 when it was released. The Gray Level and Zero Difference values did not change from their 60-69 values. The only significant change is the zone modifier was raised from 235 to 580 for kills made in Northrend zones.\nGroup Experience.\nThe following is after very limited testing. The formulae here are best guess.\nAssuming everyone in the group is the same level\nModifiers:\n 1 person = 1.0\n 2 person group = 1.0\n 3 person group = 1.166\n 4 person group = 1.3\n 5 person group = 1.4\nExample:\n 1 person = 100xp\n 2 people = 50xp each.\n 3 people = ~39xp each.\n 4 people = ~33xp each.\n 5 people = ~28xp each.\nRaid-sized groups dramatically decrease experience gained (the party bonus does not apply).\nTwo Character Groups.\nIn a group of two characters, the total experience awarded for the mob is calculated using the solo XP formula and the level of the higher character. The experience is always divided between the two characters in the same ratio, regardless of how much damage was caused by each. The ratio for each character is determined by the formula:\n CL1 = Character 1 Level, assumed to be the higher level character\n CL2 = Character 2 Level\n MXP = Solo Mob Experience, as calculated above for CL1\n XP1 = MXP * CL1 / (CL1 + CL2), the experience awarded to character 1\n XP2 = MXP * CL2 / (CL1 + CL2), the experience awarded to character 2\nNote that XP1 and XP2 appear to be rounded to an integer value. The rested bonus available to each character is then applied based on the rounded amount of XP.\nThere is no group XP bonus for groups of only two players.\nExamples:\n A duo of levels 35 and 34 kill a mob of level 30.\n CL1 = 35\n CL2 = 34\n ML = 30\n MXP = 128 (the solo XP as calculated for the level 35 char)\n XP1 = 128 * 35 / 69 = 64.9275 (rounds up to 65)\n XP2 = 128 * 34 / 69 = 63.0725 (rounds down to 63)\n A duo of levels 36 and 34 kill a mob of level 34.\n CL1 = 36\n CL2 = 34\n ML = 34\n MXP = 187.500 (the solo XP as calculated for the level 36 char)\n XP1 = 187.5 * 36 / 70 = 96.429 (rounds down to 96)\n XP2 = 187.5 * 34 / 70 = 91.071 (rounds down to 91)\nWhen the mob is gray to the higher level character but not to the lower, the higher character will get no XP. The lower character will get some small amount of XP. (\"No idea how this is calculated or scales at this time. However, it does depend on the higher level's level. Ex: a level 70 grouped with a level 15 kills a level 20 mob. The level 15 gets less xp than if the higher level was a level 40\")\nI have leveled one hunter from 35 to 41 (so far) with a level 70 hunter. The best that I can tell the formula is pretty much the same as with any group, only halved, although I consistently receive one single experience point more than I would expect, so that a level thirty-five alone against a same-level elite would receive:\n2 * ((5 * 35) + 45)\nor 440 experience. However, when grouped with a seventy, it gets divided:\n((2 * (5 * 35) + 45) * 35 / (35 + 70))/2 + 1\nTrials (the day before patch 3 drops) shows that the elites in instances have a modification of 2.75.\nFormula is now:\n((2.75 * (basexp * levelmodification) * charlevel / (charlevel + 70))/2 + 1\nExample Code.\nLUA function for calculating xp based on the above figures\n function CalcXp()\n t = UnitLevel(\"target\");\n p = UnitLevel(\"player\");\n if ( t == -1 ) then\n return 0;\n end\n if ( t == p ) then\n xp = ((p * 5) + 45);\n end\n if ( t &gt; p ) then\n xp = ((p * 5) + 45) * (1 + 0.05 * (t - p));\n end\n if ( t &lt; p ) then\n -- need gray level \"g\"\n if (p &lt; 6) then g = 0; end\n if (p &gt; 5 and p &lt; 40) then\n g = p - 5 - floor(p/10);\n end\n if (p &gt; 39) then\n g = p - 1 - floor(p/5);\n end\n if (t &gt; g) then\n -- need zero difference \"z\"\n if (p &lt; 8) then z = 5; end\n if (p &gt; 7 and p &lt; 10) then z = 6; end\n if (p &gt; 9 and p &lt; 12 ) then z = 7; end\n if (p &gt; 11 and p &lt; 16 ) then z = 8; end\n if (p &gt; 15 and p &lt; 20 ) then z = 9; end\n if (p &gt; 19 and p &lt; 40 ) then z = 9 + floor(p/10); end\n if (p &gt; 39) then z = 5 + floor(p/5); end\n xp = (p * 5 + 45) * (1 - (p - t) / z);\n else \n -- t &lt;= g, mob is Gray\n xp = 0;\n end\n end\n xp = floor(xp+0.5); -- result is rounded before calculating rest bonus\n if ( GetRestState() == 1) then\n xp = xp * 2;\n end\n if ( UnitClassification(\"target\") == \"elite\" ) then\n xp = xp * 2;\n -- what about \"worldboss\", \"rareelite\"... not sure how the XP scales\n end\n if (xp &gt; 0) then\n return xp;\n else\n return 0;\n end\n end\nThese are C++ functions for calculating any mob XP (this is from my experimentation with a Palm OS WoW-like game, from which I 'stole' most of the formulae).

{"id": "210720", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=210720", "title": "Model", "text": "A model is a representation of an &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; in the game world. It is the spacial structure of the object within the game space environment. Depending on the game engine, the model may have other various properties at various nodes, indicating joints, flexibility, attachment points (for holding an object) and other physical properties. \nA WoW model is \"3-D graphic object\". Producing a workable 3-D graphics model is a fair piece of work, combining artistic skill with a good amount of coding and debugging. Because they are somewhat labor intensive to produce, models get reused for different objects, generally with a \"reskinning\" (recoloring) for a different look. The \"Wowhead\" website (see external links) tracks equipments using the same model.\nIn WoW, you do not see the 3-D model per se; rather, you see a series of 2-D renderings of the 3-D models from your point of view. If you end up with a camera point of view inside a model, including your own character, you will see the 3-D graphic model from the unskinned inside. For example, druids in bear form can see out of their own mouths when they fall into tight locations, forcing a zoom-in.\nStealth and invisibility can be accomplished by a percentage transparency of the skinning (). This appears to be the technique that WoW uses, as stealthed rogues are often partially visible, and it allows the other model properties to continue to interact within the game environment. \nMobile objects, especially &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, will usually have some \"animations\", posing sequences, associated with the model. Some static objects will as well. Active &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s will usually have an animated model. \nThe game's physics engine defines how an object's graphic model interacts with the game world environment.\nGeosets.\nPlayer models in \"World of Warcraft\" are divided into pieces (also known as \"geosets\"\u2014sets of geometry, so to speak) that can be toggled or swapped out. This allows for customization and is used for things such as hair, horns, and of course, equippable items. While many of the game's armor items simply apply their textures to the character's base model, there are many items that replace a section of the model with an alternate, more armor-shaped version. This gives armor a less \"painted on skin\" look and adds variety among different items.\nCloak models.\nOddly, many older cloaks that had tapered and swallowtail (note: not official names) models were at some point converted to the standard rectangular model. These models do still exist in the game though, just in much smaller numbers.\nForearm models.\nThough these are mostly used for gloves, some shirts/robes use the folded over model to portray loose sleeves. For example, &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Astral%20Warden\"&gt;Robe of the Astral Warden&lt;/a&gt;."}

As the wife of Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan, she had first pick of the Dark Irons' most powerful enchanted artifacts. Yet she was never quite satisfied with the offerings on hand. Modgud would often dispatch her servants to find new relics that she could study and use as instruments in the creation of spells. One of these dwarves returned with &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;a blade&lt;/a&gt; that thrummed with dark energy. Modgud was immediately taken by it. For days, she retreated into her archives to unravel the dagger's mysteries. At times, she could be seen talking to the weapon. When she later emerged, Modgud called for the dwarf who had brought the blade in order to thank him. No one could find him. No one could even remember his name or his face. It was as if he had simply vanished into thin air.\nDuring the War of the Three Hammers, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;'s bravery was their greatest weapon, and Modgud sought to take that from them. Under the thunderous clash of hammer against axe, she screamed an incantation and wove her profane spellwork. She slid her enchanted dagger over her palm and let her blood spill onto the stones of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Modgud's foul ritual brought Grim Batol's shadows to life. They sprang from the city's dark nooks and crannies, falling upon the Wildhammers with blades forged of night.\nBy some feat of courage, Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros\"&gt;Khardros&lt;/a&gt; rallied his remaining Wildhammer warriors and launched a desperate counterattack against the Dark Irons. Khardros bulled through his enemies with the single-minded focus of a war golem, only coming to a stop when he found Modgud. The sorceress unleashed her dark power on Khardros, but he pressed his attack. Then Modgud reached for her black blade-the weapon that had turned Grim Batol into a den of nightmare. It was not there. She had lost her cherished weapon. Or, as some would claim, the weapon had abandoned her. With one mighty blow of his hammer, Khardros mortally wounded Modgud and secured victory for the Wildhammers. It is said that as the sorceress lay dying, she repeated one phrase over and over again: \"You promised...\"\nLegacy.\nDespite her death, Modgud's use of dark magic on the city, spread an evil taint through the fortress. Realizing that Grim Batol was now uninhabitable, the Wildhammer dwarves sought out a new home in &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. This evil taint corrupted the remaining &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; that had fled the losing battle to the depths of Grim Batol, and warped their descendants into the &lt;a href=\"Skardyn\"&gt;Skardyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nModgud apparently had a &lt;a href=\"Modgud%27s%20Blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"General%20Umbriss\"&gt;General Umbriss&lt;/a&gt; later added to his possessions, while his &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Trogg\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt; also have a curse called Modgud's Malady."}

An immense statue of Modimus stands guard at the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Gates of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven race lived in peace under &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. However, their society grew too large within the confines of their mountain cities. Though the mighty High King, Modimus Anvilmar, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. Modimus was known for his diplomacy when dealing with these three clans, and the Bronzebeards, ruled by Thane &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, held especially close ties to the High King. However, Modimus is perhaps most notorious for his death; after the High King passed away from old age and before his eldest son could be officially crowned, civil war broke out between the three clans.\nLegacy.\nWhile Modimus has long since passed on, he is a revered hero. His descendants, the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt;, continue to play an important part in dwarven history to this day, and he is depicted by the great statue at the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Gates of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nModimus wielded the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Hammer of the High King&lt;/a&gt;, which disappeared during the civil war. Many years later, the three pieces of the hammer, each held by one of the three dwarven clans, were to be publicly reforged into one as an act of unity between the members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the discovery that the original parchment stating that the hammer had been shattered in the first place was fake and that two of the hammer fragments may have been fabricated as well, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; shattered his piece of the hammer and instead proposed that the dwarven clans move forward from the past and unite with a fresh start.\nThere is a small village called &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;, likely named after him.\nIn the RPG.\nHe had closest ties to the Bronzebeard clan by blood and history. The mighty statue of King Anvilmar is found at the city gates of Ironforge. It is a massive statue nearly 100 feet high. The dwarf depicted there wore intricate chain armor and held two great hammers on high. His mouth was open in a soundless battle-cry."}

Mogrin was devastated as he had failed his mission and would die without honor. Rexxar, however, volunteered to deliver the message for him, for the sake of honor. Mogrin was grateful but was unable to tell Rexxar any additional information before dying in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe information contained in Mogrin's message to Thrall may have pertained to &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s impending invasion of Durotar. After it is delivered, Thrall and his advisors spoke of vague &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; activity in Durotar, supporting this. However, Thrall seemed caught completely off-guard by the scale and source of the human incursions.\nHe referred to Warchief Thrall as his chieftain, which may mean that Mogrin was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, which Thrall was previously the chieftain of. &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, whom Thrall later made chieftain again, had not yet returned from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to the Frostwolf orcs' home in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.

Proud, hateful, and powerful both physically and magically, the mogu are the foremost enemies of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. They have fought over the future of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; since time immemorial.\nThey were created by the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s during the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to shape and protect the land. An extension of &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Keeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;'s will, they were agents of order, obedient and mighty. They would later be afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; becoming mortal, eventually losing their way and valuing power and control above all else. Under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; was formed and came to dominate Pandaria. They used the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; to form new creatures. They were even able to reverse the curse of flesh among themselves. After the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;Pandaren revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the downfall of the empire, the mogu clans scattered.\nFollowing the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the mogu clans made various attacks to reclaim their former glory from the pandaren in the ensuing chaos. &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zhao-Jin%20the%20Bloodletter\"&gt;Zhao-Jin the Bloodletter&lt;/a&gt; in particular led their clans against the pandaren-controlled &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of the newly resurrected Thunder King, the mogu were again defeated.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe mogu are a &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; race manufactured by the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; during the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They were created to dig out the myriad waterways and rivers of the world. &lt;a href=\"Ra-den\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; used the artifact known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;the Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, which could channel the fury of storms, to bestow life upon the mogu. Some say that the mogu race was created in the image of &lt;a href=\"Norushen\"&gt;Norushen&lt;/a&gt;. They were once a legion of stone, heartless and obedient, and by their masters' command, the mogu fought the terrible &lt;a href=\"Aqir\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, shaped the mountains and carved the rivers of the land. The mogu created a magical cradle of life in a hidden valley now known as the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor many ages, the mogu guarded the work of the titans, fighting against the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarms. The mogu served the titanic watcher &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; when the titans left Azeroth. Those who answered directly to Ra were known as the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s used the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; on the mogu, they became terrified as their stone forms transformed them into mortal beings. They soon began to breathe, to bleed and to die. But with the flesh came the other curses of mortality: pride and greed, fear and anger. No longer united in purpose, the mogu fought amongst themselves. Powerful mogu warlords gathered up followers and made war on one another. Their battles scorched the land, terrifying the other mortal races.\nThough the curse made the mogu mortal, they later found a way to reverse the process. Despite this, the vast majority of mogu, including Lei Shen, appeared to remain fleshy.\nThe Thunder King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the mogu found &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful mogu necro-lords ruled their &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s from crypts dug deep beneath the surface.\nIt was during this time that &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; was born. Son of a warlord, when he came of age and commanded his own legions, he announced his intent to awaken the gods. Only his most loyal of followers accompanied him where no mogu had dared tread: into the very heart of the &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Mountain\"&gt;Thundering Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the sacred home of the one the mogu had called their master. History does not record what Lei Shen found when he ascended the mountain and disappeared into its vaults. But when he returned, he wielded the power of a thousand storms and declared the mount to be his seat of power. Atop its summit he built a majestic and forbidden city. Armed with the power of storms, Lei Shen, now known as the Thunder King, gathered together his followers and rose to power \"the mogu way\", eliminating his rivals one by one. Many mogu saw in Lei Shen the unity of purpose that had been lacking in the generations since their masters had fallen silent. They flocked around the Thunder King's banner and eagerly did his bidding as he enslaved the other races, believing - as Lei Shen did - that the \"lesser\" races should serve the mogu, just as the mogu had once served their masters.\nPossessed of immense size and strength, the mogu built an empire based on might, in which the weak \u2013 other races \u2013 were subjugated, and the strong \u2013 always mogu \u2013 ascended to power. Imposing stone monuments and titanic siege engines displayed the power of the mogu to the rest of the land. They turned their strength on the lesser inhabitants of Pandaria, shaping flesh to their whims as they shaped rock. The great &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, which separates the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Pandaria, was built by the mogu's slaves during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandaren revolution.\n12,000 years ago, mogu emperors ruled &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the gentle &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; as their slaves. The lucky ones clowned enough to entertain their mogu masters. Those pandaren lived in stone palaces, and their lives knew relative luxury. But that luxury ended when a joke offended and only the snapping of a spine or the popped removal of a head could inspire more mogu laughter. Throughout many emperors' reigns, the pandaren may have attempted several failed uprisings. Although &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tsao\"&gt;Emperor Tsao&lt;/a&gt; reformed the slave laws, allowing the pandaren more freedom, his successor's actions led to the downfall of the mogu empire. &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Lao-Fe\"&gt;Emperor Lao-Fe&lt;/a&gt; was brutal and had very severe and strict rules on slaves. He ruled with a no-weapon policy, but the pandaren, through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu and established an &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; that would prosper for thousands of years. One hundred years after the downfall of the mogu empire, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; launched a &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;full-scale invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Pandaria to destroy the Pandaren empire and restore the rule of the land to their mogu allies. The mogu clans, no longer led by a central ruler, began to break up and fall. However, the majority of mogu clans assisted the Zandalari in their invasion, launching raids of pandaren towns, villages, and farms. The Zandalari penetrated deep into Pandaria, and besieged &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their attempts, the attacking forces eventually lost the battle, turning the tide of the war and causing a Zandalari retreat. After the war, the mogu clans scattered completely, and most of them were not seen again for centuries. Warlords and emperors that were killed, were buried in &lt;a href=\"Tu%20Shen%20Burial%20Ground\"&gt;Tu Shen Burial Ground&lt;/a&gt; by pandaren.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter millennia of prosperous rule by the pandaren, mogu scouts returned to the land. However, it seems the mogu had something much grander planned than just scouting the world. A few mogu clans began attacking regions of Pandaria, gaining control of small towns and farmlands. A few clans had become united by a new king, &lt;a href=\"Xin%20the%20Weaponmaster\"&gt;Xin the Weaponmaster&lt;/a&gt;, whose lofty dreams of conquest threatened the region. However, despite his attempts, Xin was killed before any of his plans could come to fruition.\nThe mogu later stepped up their attacks, launching full-scale assaults on the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, besieging Niuzao Temple. Every defeat they suffered seemed to strengthen them, as new waves of mogu began to appear, now reunited with the Zandalari, who had returned to Pandaria. Having rebuilt their former alliance, the Zandalari began to fulfill an ancient prophecy to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;First Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The mogu launched a full-scale assault in a last attempt to reconquer Pandaria.\nThe mogu craved the domain they once held, and to regain it were willing to sweep usurpers and invaders alike into the dust. Awakened from his tomb by his old &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; returned, promising to reclaim his ancient empire. The Thunder King reemerged on the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; that served as his seat of power, gathering armies from all over Pandaria to his island citadel.\nOnce more the heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were called forth to take on this threat, doing so in the midst of their own dark and bloody war reignited by the decimation of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the betrayal that split the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Waging war on two fronts isn\u2019t easy and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; had no interest in anything more than using the power of both factions to put down a more clear and present danger.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing Lei Shen's defeat at the Throne of Thunder, the mogu splintered and began warring for dominance. Many new clans arose from the ashes, including the &lt;a href=\"Baruk%20clan\"&gt;Baruk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dokani%20clan\"&gt;Dokani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zan-Tien%20clan\"&gt;Zan-Tien&lt;/a&gt;.\nPromised a new empire by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kao-Tien\"&gt;Kao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; mogu led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vilnak%27dor\"&gt;Vilnak'dor&lt;/a&gt;, attacked the Zandalari at &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, it was a distraction so that Zul could begin his coup against &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Temple of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Rezan\"&gt;Temple of Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, more mogu appeared to aid Zul after his rebellion became public. The &lt;a href=\"Lei-zhi\"&gt;Lei-zhi&lt;/a&gt; mogu aided some of Zul's followers in leading a mutiny aboard several ships at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Fangs\"&gt;Isle of Fangs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tusk%20Isle\"&gt;Tusk Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; followed the mogu to Zandalar and spied on them at Warport Rastari.\nIn addition to aiding Zul in his revolt, several mogu clans have sought the power of the &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that, similar to the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the power of the earth is theirs by right. The powerful mogu &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt; were disturbed from their rest recently by in unknown numbers.\nIn the years following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms was restored to its original state and the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; clan loyal to &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; was restored. However, with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; released from his &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, the warring Baruk, Dokani, and Zan-Tien took advantage of the chaos and descended upon the Vale to claim it. In addition, the Zan-Tien sought to capture the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;. Together with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, the Rajani, &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; defended the vale.\nCulture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, contains some of the secrets of their &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;lost empire&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; facilities and libraries. Mogu culture is very heavily influenced by their former masters. Over time, the mogu developed aspects of culture on their own, although main titan principles are still practiced by mogu to this day.\nMagic.\nUnlike \"lesser races\" that need schooling in the arts of magic, the ability was innate in the mogu. From what is known about mogu usage of magic, it is clear that their magic users did not fall into known categories, such as &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. Special emphasis was placed on &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shaping&lt;/a&gt; or spirit-capture magic. The mogu are flesh-shapers and can create other creatures. They are known to have created the &lt;a href=\"saurok%E2%80%8E\"&gt;saurok\u200e&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDeath was not final for some mogu, instead being a mere stopover on the path to a new body. &lt;a href=\"Spiritbinder\"&gt;Spiritbinder&lt;/a&gt;s used their foul magic to transfer these spirits from one shell to the next.\nSlavery.\nIn many ways, the mogu are based on brutal strength and terrible cunning. Even with powerful magic at their disposal, the mogu often preferred to use &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; to build their massive monuments. Enslaved humanoids were marked with branding irons. Forged of iron and imbued with spells of subjugation and pain, manacles with inward-facing spikes were forced onto the slave races of the mogu. The blood of many mogu slaves were shed with a &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Bone%20Whip\"&gt;bone whip&lt;/a&gt; fashioned from the spine of some large and ancient creature. An &lt;a href=\"Anatomical%20Dummy\"&gt;anatomical dummy&lt;/a&gt; of a pandaren was used to document torture techniques.\nWhen the mogu had exhausted their options for enslaved mortal warriors, they turned their attention to creating armies of animated constructs to do their fighting for them. These &lt;a href=\"terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;terracotta warrior&lt;/a&gt;s would sometimes sit dormant for centuries.\nIn contrast to the unarmed combat and simple weapons of the first pandaren monks, the favored weapons of the mogu were based on fear rather than practicality. They were large, cumbersome, and difficult to wield.\nCompanions.\nFavorite pets of the ancient mogu princes, the dog-like &lt;a href=\"quilen\"&gt;quilen&lt;/a&gt; make loyal and fearless companions and mounts. Mogu sorcerers, keepers of the secret to bringing stone to life, prefer &lt;a href=\"Imbued%20Jade%20Fragment\"&gt;stolid stone companions&lt;/a&gt; over more beastly familiars.\nGovernment.\nThe mogu empire was a meritocracy as well as an absolute monarchy/dictatorship, where the previous regime and/or dynasty must be overpowered and executed. As a part of mogu culture, when a clan's leader is killed, it is customary for rivals to immediately murder his family and thus exterminate the clan lineage forever.\nValley of Emperors.\nThe mogu view their dead as a collection of parts. Souls could be bound to stone for later use. Flesh and blood could be reforged to extend the lives of those loyal to the emperor. To be buried intact was a symbol of great power and respect. The &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of Emperors&lt;/a&gt; serves as the resting grounds a hundred generations of warlords, kings and emperors who once ruled Pandaria.\nRelations with the Zandalari.\nWhen the mogu still ruled over Pandaria, they were allied with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;. However, both the mogu and Zandalari held contempt for one another. The mutual contempt between the two would grow to polite indifference. They trusted the other not to attack because they were confident they would defeat the other. While Zandalari and mogu stood back to back, they did not watch the other and did not see the other falter. The Zandalari assisted them against the embryonic Pandaren empire. Despite being defeated and pushed from the island now called Pandaria, the Zandalari, just like the mogu, remained in Pandaren lore, and slowly turned into Pandaren children's \"bogeymen\".\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; that once shrouded Pandaria now gone, the Zandalari, curious about Pandaria and their ancient mogu allies, have dispatched forces to Pandaria in an attempt to re-connect with the mogu. It seems they want to help them retake the land from the Pandaren and once again bring it under mogu rule. However, the Zandalari seem too desperate to acquire Pandaren territory and appear to have more motives than just helping out their ancient mogu allies.\nAppearance.\n&lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; once met a mogu, a head and a half taller than she, ebon skinned, strongly built. [He] possessed a leonine aspect that was uniquely suited to Pandaria. His brows, beard, and hair were as white as his flesh was black. When she'd first seen statuary depicting the mogu, she had thought it highly stylized. Meeting them in the flesh dispelled that notion, and seeing them in action suggested that any round softness of form hid only a sharpness of purpose and courage.\nMale mogu stand between a head to a head and a half taller than &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; women. In rare cases, they can be taller than a male Zandalari. Some mogu are only about a foot taller than a &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mogu that is a foot taller than a jungle troll would be around 9'4\" tall.\nMogu blood is black in color.\nClans.\nMogu live in &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, led by powerful warlords. For a time, &lt;a href=\"Xin%20the%20Weaponmaster\"&gt;Xin the Weaponmaster&lt;/a&gt; was king of the clans.\nSpeculation.\nGender and reproduction.\nWhile initially created by the titans, sources such as the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen%20%28object%29\"&gt;Lei Shen lore object&lt;/a&gt; describe mogu as being 'born' to other mogu, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Dynasty\"&gt;The Lost Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" say that mogu can have sons (though not how). This suggests at least some degree of reproduction by mogu themselves, following their being affected by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. However, all mogu known to currently exist are male. Mogu females used to exist, with mothers and sisters being used in mogu insults, a famous saga about Lei Shen and Sparkmancer Vu's feud over a woman, and &lt;a href=\"Monara\"&gt;Monara&lt;/a&gt; being a slain queen (and the last queen) of the mogu. This raises the issue of the current state of mogu reproduction.\nSince mogu females have existed in the past, it can be surmised that they were created by the titans along with the males. Their apparent lack of presence raises a number of possibilities:\nIt should also be noted that no mogu children have been found to exist, although they are mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Sparkmancer%20Vu%23Epitaph\"&gt;Sparkmancer Vu's epitaph&lt;/a&gt;. This may again suggest that both the females and children are being kept well out of harm's reach, or that neither are any longer to be found in Pandaria. While it seems natural to assume that mogu would reproduce through sexual means, the initial creation of mogu using titan technology should also be remembered, especially considering &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s possession of much of that technology. Such technology would likely be capable of producing fully-grown mogu.\nIt is possible that when mogu regained their stone bodies after Lei Shen's conquests, the females were reshaped into asexual male-looking bodies.\nWhile it is possible, if the mogu rely on sexual reproduction to propagate their species, it seems unlikely that they would have allowed all of the females to die out. This suggests that females are likely still in existence, albeit evidently far from any non-mogu eyes. Indeed, if the 'rumors' about the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Consorts\"&gt;Twin Consorts&lt;/a&gt; being the only known mogu females are founded in pandaren experience, this may suggest that no females have been witnessed by any non-mogu race in many hundreds or even thousands of years, if at all. While mogu relics (and the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Monara\"&gt;Monara&lt;/a&gt;) prove that females have existed in the past, this serves to illustrate both the common lack of knowledge on the subject and the apparent scarcity of mogu females.\nLei Shen's &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Consorts\"&gt;Twin Consorts&lt;/a&gt; are rumored to be the only known female mogu in existence. However, these have been confirmed to have been specifically created by Lei Shen, and are \"a direct reflection of his will rather than any broader sense of mogu culture as a whole.\" This description in itself suggests some notable difference between the Consorts and their real-life counterparts unless it refers only to cultural differences, such as in the roles of men and women within mogu society. For speculation on the creation of the Consorts, see &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Consorts%23Speculation\"&gt;Twin Consorts speculation&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Monara\"&gt;Monara&lt;/a&gt;, known as the \"last queen of the mogu\" apparently represents the last ruling female in mogu society (at least at the level of monarch), slain shortly before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the time of N'Zoth's assault on Azeroth, several female mogu were seen to exist. One, General Xing, is of the Rajani faction, who have remained loyal to their origins as defenders of Azeroth, and thus is not likely to be the result of reshaping or a reflection of a tyrant's will. She resembles the Consorts, implying that they do indeed represent the female mogu form.\nMogu do have the ability to take the spirits from one body, or an already dead mogu, to a newly constructed body. It's possible that many of the mogu that have existed simply move on to a new body when their last one has failed. However, if this was the case many previous leaders would have come back and either retained their place in society or attempted to take it back."}

{"id": "335627", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=335627", "title": "Mogu empire", "text": "The mogu empire (or Mogu Dynasty) possessed immense size and strength. The &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; built it based on might, in which the weak \u2014 other races \u2014 were subjugated, and the strong \u2014 always mogu \u2014 ascended to power. So brutal was their regime that its name is never uttered aloud: &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; call it either the \"Old Kingdom\" or \"First Dynasty\". The mogu empire was a meritocracy, where the previous regime and/or dynasty must be overpowered and executed. \nThe mogu empire was founded by &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Thunder King.\" He united the mogu, defeated the other pandaren races, and built an empire that would last for thousands of years. \nHistory.\n15,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the mogu had fallen to disarray after they became afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Clans and warlords engaged in brutal power struggles during this &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing that would temporarily unite them was the emergence of each new &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; swarm.\nThe Thunder King.\nDuring this era, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; was born to a minor warlord. When his father was murdered, Lei Shen wandered the land for many years, eventually finding &lt;a href=\"Ra-den\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Mountain\"&gt;Thundering Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Angry at Ra-den's abandonment of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s' purpose, Lei Shen overpowered the highkeeper and stole his power. Claiming the birthright of the titans, Lei Shen set out to unify the mogu as masters of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and guardians of its &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. He crushed all opposition and fear of his powers soon turned to devotion.\nMany mogu saw in Lei Shen the unity of purpose that had been lacking in the generations since their masters had fallen silent. They flocked around the Thunder King's banner and eagerly did his bidding as he enslaved the other races, believing \u2014 as Lei Shen did \u2014 that the \"lesser\" races should serve the mogu, just as the mogu had once served their masters.\nAt the height of the mogu empire, the &lt;a href=\"Spiritclaw\"&gt;Spiritclaw&lt;/a&gt;s were a sect of &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and the most elite and most feared of the emperor's troops.\nThe two empires.\nLei Shen believed that although the mogu might never be fully cleansed of the curse of flesh, other beings of flesh would always be beneath them. Thus, he began a campaign of enslavement in the lands surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; pledged their loyalties to the mogu empire in exchange for preferential treatment. The &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;'s small empire was the first to fall. Next were the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; who sought the protection of &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen, the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Though a powerful &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;, Xuen could not match the Thunder King's stolen titan power and was forced to watch as the mogu bound the pandaren into slavery. They were forbidden from learning how to read or write or speak any language other than the mogu tongue.\nPossessed of immense size and strength, the mogu built an empire based on might, in which the weak \u2014 other races \u2014 were subjugated, and the strong \u2014 always mogu \u2014 ascended to power. Imposing stone monuments and titanic siege engines displayed the power of the mogu to the rest of the land. They turned their strength on the lesser inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flesh-shaping\"&gt;shaping flesh&lt;/a&gt; to their whims as they shaped rock. The great &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, which separates the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Pandaria, was built by the mogu's slaves during the rule of Lei Shen. The mogu empire had a unified language, an established system of weights and measurements, and the first set of written laws on Azeroth.\nSoon, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s took notice of the otherworldly powers wielded by the Thunder King. &lt;a href=\"Zulathra\"&gt;Zulathra&lt;/a&gt; a high priest of the Zandalari proposed to Lei Shen an exchange of each other's secrets; the mogu's arcane power for the trolls' knowledge of the lands beyond the vale. Together, the two empires would be unstoppable. However, both the mogu and Zandalari held contempt for one another. The mutual contempt between the two would grow to polite indifference. They trusted the other not to attack, because they were confident they would defeat the other. While Zandalari and mogu stood back to back, they did not watch the other and did not see the other falter.\nThunder falls.\n12,200 years before the Dark Portal, Lei Shen sought to claim the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; guardians were to become honored members of the mogu empire under his leadership. However, the tol'vir became furious upon learning that Lei Shen had betrayed Highkeeper Ra and refused. The mogu army marched on Uldum accompanied by their troll allies. The tol'vir could not resist them and instead configured the Forge of Origination to purge the area around Uldum of almost all life. The death of the Thunder King and most of the Zandalari leadership left massive power vacuums, striking a mortal blow to both empires. A succession of emperors followed Lei Shen, but none would ever wield as much power as he had.\nThe Pandaren Revolution.\nOver the next 200 years, the mogu empire continued lording over the vale. Its slaves suffered greatly under Lei Shen's successors, each ruler more cruel than the last. The final emperor, &lt;a href=\"Lao-Fe\"&gt;Lao-Fe&lt;/a&gt;, was proficient enough in this regard to earn the title of 'Slavebinder' early in his reign. To maintain obedience among the empire's slaves, he was known to tear families apart, even for mild or benign transgressions. One such common punishment was for the children of slaves who were perceived to be disobedient to be sent to the Serpent's Spine wall to act as fodder for the ruthless mantid swarm.\nA pandaren brewmaster named &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the mogu's extreme cruelty towards slaves was a symptom of their weakness. The mogu empire had grown dependent on its servants. Because pandaren were not permitted weapons outside the Serpent's Spine, Kang developed a new unarmed fighting style disguised as an artistic dance. Combined with the secrets of inner strength learned from Xuen, Kang's pandaren monks began their revolution. Their first major victory at the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; prevented the mogu from using the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; to create any new twisted soldiers. This drew other races into the rebellion to topple the mogu empire. As more and more slaves rebelled, the empire fell into chaos. Eventually Lao-Fe was defeated by Kang in hand to hand combat, but Kang sustained mortal wounds in return. The pandaren and the other races flourished as peace and prosperity came to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and its surrounding areas. A new &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt; emerged, built on the principles of justice, wisdom, and benevolence.\nThe mogu's Zandalari allies had assisted them against the revolution. Despite being defeated and pushed from the island now called Pandaria, the Zandalari remained in pandaren lore, and slowly turned into pandaren children's \"bogeymen\".\nAttempted rebirth.\nAfter the mists collapsed, the Zandalari sent out their forces to Pandaria. It seemed they want to help the mogu retake the land from the pandaren and once again bring it under mogu rule. However, the Zandalari seemed too desperate to acquire pandaren territory and appeared to have motives beyond just helping out their ancient mogu allies.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nA storm brewed on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the newly risen Thunder King: &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and the invading &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; forces who supported his bid to regain his seat of power over &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Once more the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were being called forth to take on this threat, but they did so in the midst of their own dark and bloody war reignited by the decimation of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the betrayal that split the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Waging war on two fronts wasn't easy and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; had no interest in anything more than using the power of both factions to put down a more clear and present danger.\nThe Horde and the Alliance worked for some familiar faces as they make their way through the island. Each faction's finest were spearheading the assault: the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmperors and kings.\nDespite the name \"First Dynasty\" or \"Mogu Dynasty\", the mogu empire was ruled by several different dynasties over the years."}

A long, mithril-and-wood rifle, its barrel the size of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; head, replaces its left arm. Its right hand is a huge, distorted claw-fist, and above it on the arm sits a perforated iron nozzle projecting from a dragon\u2019s mouth. Arcing over the contraption\u2019s back, like spider legs, are two spindly arms. One ends in a pair of scissor-like blades, while the other ends in a circular saw that whines as it spins. The pilot, a goblin with a mad grin, is visible through a rectangular window in the thing\u2019s front. The goblin\u2019s hands dart among a bewildering array of levers, buttons and hanging chains.\nRazdunk\u2019s steam armor is legendary on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, and he prefers to intimidate and threaten his opponents into submission rather than actually attack them. When forced into combat, Razdunk begins by using his arcitech connection ability to imbue frost nova into his long rifle (opening a small hatch in the armor\u2019s side to touch the weapon), then blasts away with it. After this tactic, he takes great joy in all of his armor\u2019s weapons, flailing away with rifle, dragon mouth, steam fist and slicers. If Razdunk is having problems hitting his opponents, he calms down enough to make single attacks with his steam fist. If the battle looks grim, he attempts to escape with the help of invisibility.\nRazdunk's &lt;a href=\"familiar\"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"toad\"&gt;toad&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20%28toad%29\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt;."}

As such, she is both Princess of Ironforge as well as Empress of the Dark Irons. Since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Moira serves as the Dark Iron representative on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, Ironforge's ruling body.\nAn only child, Moira's relationship with her father Magni would become strained as she reached adulthood, particularly following the death of her mother &lt;a href=\"Eimear\"&gt;Eimear&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the princess was ambushed and captured by the order of Emperor Thaurissan of the Dark Iron clan. Despite the circumstances, Moira and her captor would ultimately fall in love, and have a child \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Magni, believing these events to be mere rumors, sent a squad on a rescue mission that resulted in Emperor Dagran's death. However, Moira refused to return to her home. Having inherited the Dark Iron throne, Moira would steadily consolidate her power and that of what she considered her new people. After Magni's petrification during the Cataclysm, Moira marched on &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and tried to seize power, but the attempt was thwarted by the King of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder Varian's suggestion, the clans established the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the new ruling body of Ironforge and the united &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; people, with Moira representing the Dark Iron clan. She would continue to be heavily involved in Ironforge's politics as conflict between the clans constantly threatened civil war. Since the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen-Regent has also taken a more active role in the Alliance itself, and was a prominent member of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, an order of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s that fought the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Later, she was a driving force behind the Dark Irons' official entry into the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nYouth.\nMoira Bronzebead was born to King Magni Bronzebeard, King of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. While Magni did love his daughter, he had always wanted a son to rule the throne after him, and was disappointed that Moira was not the male heir he had hoped for. Nevertheless, Magni did love and raise Moira. But after her mother &lt;a href=\"Eimear\"&gt;Eimear&lt;/a&gt; was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane troll&lt;/a&gt;s, Magni - acting on Eimear's last wish to always be there for Moira - began training Moira in the ways of the warrior to prepare her for anything. This formed a rift between the two of them, as he forced her to be something she was not.\nThe laws of succession for Ironforge state that Moira, having no brothers, would be the rightful heir to the throne. However, even though it would have been highly unlikely that Magni would ever dispute that claim, he still believed that a woman could not rule with the same ability as a man would be able to. His opinion on the matter was known to those he would have had some regular contact with, such as &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and others, such as &lt;a href=\"Aerin\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears later, when &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; sent envoys to Ironforge to ask for aid against incursions from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, Moira volunteered to help and set out toward Lakeshire with twenty-one guardsmen, but as the group was traveling through the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, they were ambushed and captured by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Moira was brought to &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;, who intended to use her as a hostage of last resort once war began. Thaurissan believed that Magni would never consider assaulting Blackrock Mountain if it meant putting Moira in harm's way. However, Thaurissan found himself falling in love with Moira; she had a sharp wit and strong will, and was not intimidated in the slightest by her predicament. The two dwarves began to speak at length about their hopes for the future, and Thaurissan confided in Moira that he wanted to free his people from enslavement and was willing to do anything to achieve that. &lt;a href=\"Kharan%20Mighthammer\"&gt;Kharan Mighthammer&lt;/a&gt;, the only escorting guard to survive the kidnapping, came to believe that the Princess was presumably ensorcelled, reporting this to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s that came to rescue him.\nKing Magni, upset that Moira was with an arch-enemy of his family, sent a team to kill Emperor Thaurissan and retrieve the presumably ensorcelled Moira back to Ironforge. However, Moira refused to come home and announced that she was pregnant; additionally, the death of her husband has left a terrible, fiery rage within her heart. She would not be heard from for a few years, estranged from her father, who still preferred to believe that she was captured and seduced via magical means rather than contemplate that she had fallen in love and married a Dark Iron of her own free will. Although devastated by the news and despite the rift between father and daughter, Magni hoped that some day Moira would return to Ironforge, and never made any move to disinherit her.\nAfter all of this happened, Aerin and a few other qualified women were promoted to become a part of Magni's elite guard. Aerin believed this was a result of him finally realizing that his sexist attitude had not been very fair to Moira.\nMoira stayed in Shadowforge after her husband's death. Hoping to further Dagran's plans to free the Dark Iron from Ragnaros' tyranny, she spread the news that the &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; was amassing an army and that Dagran Thaurissan's death only had delayed its formation. She also told of riches and artifacts hidden in his stronghold, the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. She hoped that this would attract adventurous (or greedy) heroes that would strike at the Firelord and banish him. Her plan succeeded, with her finding an unsuspecting ally in the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, who had their own rivalry with the denizens of the Firelands and offered their own rewards for striking against Ragnaros. Soon, powerful champions broke into the Molten Core, destroyed Ragnaros' protective runes with the aid of the water elementals and banished him back to the Firelands. The Dark Iron dwarfs celebrated and many pledged themselves to Moira for orchestrating their liberation.\nNow, Moira turned her attention to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; that occupied the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. She knew that the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Black Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; had entered an alliance with the orcs and conducted experiments to create &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;draconic monstrosities&lt;/a&gt;. Her spies made sure that word of that reached &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde was infuriated. Champions traveled to Blackrock and defeated both &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his master, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, taking the head of the dragon with them to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons had lost another enemy thanks to Moira's shrewdness.\nThe Shattering.\nIn the wake of King Magni's petrification, Moira returned to Ironforge with her infant son &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; to claim the throne. Backed by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, Moira ruled Ironforge arrogantly and with an iron fist. She had the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s moved out of the city and the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; closed, holding all the people of Ironforge hostage, including Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who was there as a Stormwind diplomat that would aid the dwarves in such troubling times.\nBeing royals, Moira and Anduin proceeded to engage in a subtle battle of political niceties and social status. Moira 'invited' (ordered) Anduin to a private official dinner to which she was intentionally late and kept him standing by his chair; to her annoyance, he in turn only bowed to her as an equal and not a ruler. During dinner, having learned the more personal details of her past from Aerin, Anduin managed to subtly trick Moira into dropping her guard for a short while in order to provoke an honest reaction from her and learn her true motives. Moira revealed that she was never ensorcelled by her husband but rather fell in love with him because he respected her, unlike her father who always wanted a son and didn't think a female was fit to rule. While Anduin privately agreed that she had been wronged, he quickly realized that Moira had not turned that into a strength, but had allowed her resentment of Magni to eat away at her.\nAfter Anduin escaped to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; learned from Anduin of how Moira and her Dark Iron clan had taken over Ironforge and had held him hostage. Enraged, Varian and eighteen operatives embarked on a mission to liberate Ironforge and assassinate Moira. When Varian was about to execute Moira, Anduin \u2014 who had rushed back to Ironforge \u2014 convinced Varian that it would be better to guide Moira to be a better leader instead. Despite Moira being a tyrant who held the city hostage, she was still the legitimate heir to the throne and killing her would only put the succession of Ironforge into question, thus leading to more chaos and conflict that could lead into another &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;bloody civil war&lt;/a&gt; and suck the rest of the Alliance into it. Where as if she lived; through her and her son all dwarven clans could unite. Varian slowly agreed but was also conflicted as Moira had caused so much chaos and had already threatened the safety of his son. Varian agreed to spare Moira\u2019s life but stipulated that if Moira was to be a leader and unite the dwarves, then she\u2019d have to earn her crown by earning her people's respect. In order to take into account the opinions of all dwarves, Varian called for the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Moira's uncle &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thane\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire and Iron.\nMoira is trying in every way to integrate the Dark Iron clan into the Ironforge Kingdom. To do so, she planned to reconstruct the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Hammer of the High King&lt;/a&gt; (even with fake pieces if need be) as a symbol of unity between the dwarven clans. &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; hesitated to give his piece but after several days of convincing all three parts were together and ready to be forged. The next day, Moira and &lt;a href=\"Drukan\"&gt;Drukan&lt;/a&gt; found Kurdran and &lt;a href=\"Sky%27ree\"&gt;Sky'ree&lt;/a&gt; during a walk. Drukan feared the gryphon and even disrespected her but Moira convinced her advisor to apologize. Moira then thanked Kurdran for giving the final part of the hammer and left. After Sky'ree's death, Kurdran was shocked and took the Wildhammer piece. Moira saw this and the two started to argue. Kurdran then realized that she also tried to focus estrangement on the Wildhammer clan in order to shift the Bronzebeard dwarves' alienation away from the Dark Irons. During the public ceremony to reforge the Hammer of the High King, Kurdran smashed the Wildhammer piece, justifying that the dwarves' unity could not be based on a physical artifact that could be broken apart one day, and they should begin anew with a clean slate. Muradin gladly agreed to this, and Moira having been politically outmaneuvered, was forced to follow suit, having also the Dark Iron piece of the hammer smashed.\nCataclysm.\nEven though Moira is Queen-Regent to the Dark Iron clan, some Dark Irons are not loyal to her or her son. After the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; loyal &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; attack the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and was repelled, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Stonebreaker\"&gt;Commander Stonebreaker&lt;/a&gt; sends an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to inform the Council of what had happened. Moira refuses to believe that Dark Irons are attacking Ironforge until Muradin vouches for Stonebreaker's loyalty. After Muradin and Falstad call her out for not being able to control her own people, she determines who is responsible for the attacks and has Dark Iron &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;, who is working for the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, arrested for treason.\nThe three rulers were visited by &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; who was looking for Magni. The Council could not help her and Moira was indignant at how rude Li Li was.\nBlood in the Snow.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;dwarven capital&lt;/a&gt; by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But what the King did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; declined to offer aid in Ironforge\u2019s defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the Dark Irons would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, then Ironforge will fall under siege. Only Moira offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons will prove their loyalty to the Council, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira, her &lt;a href=\"Forgeguard\"&gt;personal guard&lt;/a&gt; and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nWhen they arrived at &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that their enemies were using an unnatural storm to prevent their forces from advancing on them. At Varian's request, Moira led her personal guard against the enemy troll village once the king's champions stopped the magical storm protecting Shimmer Ridge. After rescuing the surviving mountaineers and slaying the elemental that the trolls were satiating with blood sacrifices to elicit the unnatural storm, the king's champions regrouped with Moira\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Forgeguard\"&gt;Forgeguard&lt;/a&gt; and together their forces slew the Zandalari leader and captured the Frostmane village.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Varian commended Moira and the Dark Irons on their victory, even stating that the Bronzebeards and Wildhammers will regret not having been there to share in her glory. Moira however, humbly stated that her intention was to protect and impress, not to shame; to which Varian acknowledged that she accomplished just that. Both returned to Ironforge to announce her victory to the Council. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nMoira Thaurissan and a contingency of dwarven troops drill into the Siegeworks. They encounter &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Siegecrafter Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;, who unleashes his newest creation, the Ironstar, against the Alliance heroes. Moira orders her men to attack the monstrosity but her dwarven troops are slain by it. Siegecrafter Blackfuse escapes leaving Moira and the Alliance adventurers. Witnessing the destructive powers of Blackfuse's creation, Moira warns the Alliance heroes to be careful.\nWar Crimes.\nMoira, alongside other Alliance leaders, received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; inviting them to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. She traveled to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; noticed her arguing with a pandaren about the cart they were traveling by to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. She was present during the trial itself and a vision from the past, the one when Moira was almost executed by Varian, was shown.\nThe Jade Hunters.\nMoira and the other members of the council would blackmail &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; to form a team and help rebuild the Jade Serpent statue.\nFault Lines.\nFour years after &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;'s petrification, Moira was asked by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and some of the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s to talk to her petrified father, as she often did when times were trying, in the hopes that it would wake him up. Moira herself saw it as a fool's errand and scolded her father, saying that the thought of his daughter sitting the throne of Ironforge would eat him up inside and that he never gave her a chance to prove herself due to being female. However, to the vast surprise of both Moira and &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt;, Magni suddenly awoke with a mighty crash as a living statue made of diamond. Though the Council of Three Hammers were worried about what Magni's return would mean for the political stability of Ironforge, Magni replied by saying that he had not come to reclaim his crown, but to offer a warning about the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return. He asked his daughter to see him off and talked with her outside the gates of Ironforge. He revealed that he had watched her progress and develop into a leader since her return, and unlike what she had thought earlier that day, that he couldn't be prouder of what she'd become. Saying that he had failed her as a father and hoped she would give him another chance to be a family again, the former king headed off to warn the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, wanting to give Moira time to think about it and letting her know that his connection to the earth would allow him to watch over her. As Moira watched him walk away, she began to cry.\nLegion.\nMoira along with the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt; event.\nAfter the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Moira attends the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and says she knows what Anduin is going through, for she too has lost a father and king.\nShe later works with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to unite priests of every religion at the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;. She sends the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vicar%20Eliza\"&gt;Vicar Eliza&lt;/a&gt; to train Zealots in &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; and needs &lt;a href=\"Lumenstone\"&gt;Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt; for crafting armor and weapons in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Moira can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, she is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBefore the Storm.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, Moira welcomed King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who had gifted &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; ten wagons of &lt;a href=\"%3ABarley\"&gt;:Barley&lt;/a&gt;, being the primary ingredient of dwarven brews. Ironforge treated Anduin and his entourage to a feast to celebrate this gift. By the time dessert was being served, Moira, Anduin, and her son &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; strolled through &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to help them digest their meal. As they walked, Anduin reminisced about his last visit to Ironforge and thanked the Council of Three Hammers for attending his father's funeral, especially Moira since the last time &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and Moira met in Ironforge, he tried to kill her. Moira made light of the past event and explained that she and Varian made peace with that moment a long time ago and stated that they even grew to respect each other. She also admitted that if she had been in Varian's position and Dagran had been held hostage, she'd probably have done the same thing. Both Moira and Anduin spoke of their fathers, how the Council of Three Hammers are now much more harmonious, and &lt;a href=\"Aerin%20Stonehand\"&gt;Aerin Stonehand&lt;/a&gt;'s influence on Anduin's swordsmanship. As Anduin and Moira had a pleasant conversation while Dagran explored &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, a messenger told them that &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has returned to Ironforge and required a conference with the both of them. Moira and Anduin found Magni in the &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29\"&gt;Library&lt;/a&gt; section of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Explorers\"&gt;Hall of Explorers&lt;/a&gt;, conversing with &lt;a href=\"High%20Explorer%20Muninn%20Magellas\"&gt;High Explorer Muninn Magellas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;Captain Tread Sparknozzle&lt;/a&gt; stood beside them listening intently. Magni explained that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is wounded, and that they must set to healing her or all will perish. Thus Magni has been recruiting priests and other healers for that express purpose. Moira proposed that they reach out to the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; to aid in this endeavor. Anduin also showed the council of Alliance leaders the shard of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; he had and explained its relevance to Azeroth and technology. With their purpose clear, the leaders of the Alliance set out on their tasks. Before Moira left, however, she introduced Magni to his grandson.\nLater on, Anduin, Velen, and Moira portaled to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where Moira recruited the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; in their endeavors to heal Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' destruction. Anduin also told them about Azerite and urged them to recruit other healers such as &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to their mission. After accomplishing their task, Anduin gave Moira his shard of Azerite to deliver to Mekkatorque, while he made preparations to return to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMoira was among the Alliance leaders that gathered in the newly-constructed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. There, they would discuss the potential addition of &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;new races&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance, a line of thinking that drew the Queen-Regent's thoughts to the future of her own &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; were smelting &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; at Anduin's request. As Moira was watching them, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; who damaged the Black Anvil and stole &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, the hammer used to smelt Azerite. After Ironfoe was recovered from &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;MOTHERLODE!!&lt;/a&gt;, Moira sent the Alliance champion and &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve a piece of the core to repair the anvil. Following that, the champion and &lt;a href=\"Anvil-Thane%20Thurgaden\"&gt;Anvil-Thane Thurgaden&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; to charge it with the power of the defeated &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. While they were there, they discovered the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; attempting to revive the Firelord because they saw Moira as a weak ruler. The cult was fought off, but not defeated.\nWith Ironfoe retrieved and the Black Anvil repaired, Moira returned to Stormwind where she and Anduin made the Dark Iron dwarves' membership into the Alliance official, as it had not been official before due to an oversight. Afterward, Moira is present at the Black Anvil when new Dark Iron adventurers set off to explore the world.\nShe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Moira was present at Stormwind Embassy meeting where she learned that the armistice ending the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was signed. Moira acknowledged that both sides had suffered terribly during the war, with mistakes being made on both sides. She then declared that what mattered now was how they moved forward, and she questioned if they would learn something from all the bloodshed and loss, or keep on repeating the past.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nMoira and her family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, they spoke with &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nStormwind Embassy.\nThe Alliance an' Horde have both suffered terribly in this war, an mistakes were surely made on both sides.\nWhat matters now is how we move forward! Do we learn somethin' from all o' the bloodshed an' loss, or do we keep on repeatin' the past?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; needs strength. Unity. The king's plan tae bring in fresh blood is a good one.\nAs fer the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance needs us now more than ever.\nIf only I can show the rest o' me clan how much we need allies ourselves, perhaps we can finally all agree that we are indeed already part o' the Alliance.\nThe Alliance needs strength. Unity. The king's plan to bring in fresh blood is a good one.\nBut I can't help thinking of my own Dark Iron clan. Of the fractures that divide us.\nIn Hearthstone.\nMoira in the against &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, the last boss of the Blackrock Depths wing in the \"\" adventure for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". The boss fight revolves around defeating Thaurissan while keeping Moira alive; if she dies at any point during the fight, Thaurissan will deal 30 damage to the player's hero at the start of his next turn, which in most cases means the player's instant death.\nSpeculation.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Kharan%20Mighthammer\"&gt;Kharan Mighthammer&lt;/a&gt; says that someone must have tipped off the Dark Iron dwarves that ambushed and kidnapped Moira, one could speculate it was the princess herself.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is described as being a frothy, sticky substance with a light glow. Excess amounts are usually carried in &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Mojo\"&gt;flasks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Mojo\"&gt;decanters&lt;/a&gt;.\nMojo can be taken from trolls and animals. Additionally, some ogres are said to use mojo. &lt;a href=\"Beads%20of%20Ogre%20Mojo\"&gt;Some ogre jewelry&lt;/a&gt; is said to contain mojo power and at least one ogre known as &lt;a href=\"Warosh\"&gt;Warosh&lt;/a&gt; had his 'mojo' sucked from him, he tasked adventurers with reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Warosh%27s%20Mojo\"&gt;his mojo&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses.\nMost of the major troll tribes use mojo in their own unique ways. The &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; used trace amounts of mojo in their old currency, the &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20Power\"&gt;Paragons of Power&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari tribe&lt;/a&gt; uses mojo in many ways, their &lt;a href=\"freethinker\"&gt;freethinker&lt;/a&gt;s employ it in their armor while their &lt;a href=\"illusionist\"&gt;illusionist&lt;/a&gt;s use it in their incantations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; High Priests empowered themselves with the mojo of their fallen loa and animated their golems with large quantities of the substance. The &lt;a href=\"Darkest%20Mojo\"&gt;Darkest Mojo&lt;/a&gt; is a substance employed by the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; in order to animate their dead into Mummies. The \"Darkest Mojo\" is described as a black, cottony clump that fizzles in your hands.\nMojo, at least in some cases can be used interchangeably with &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Sweat\"&gt;Troll Sweat&lt;/a&gt; for the same effect.\nWater from &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s will dilute the effectiveness of mojo without completely eliminating it.\nSome mojo is the blood of a loa. The &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; prophets drank the blood of their loa, to gain their power. The blood the prophets drank of is referred to as mojo in many cases.\nSpeculation.\nThe term mojo could probably be used for (bad) magic."}

The post was deleted quickly by a Blizzard CM and then re-posted.\nAlthough some say that Blizzard's haste to bury the story points to it having some relevance there are minor details that seem to disprove it. The geographical location of Lashindow, as he described it, is impossible on the current Kalimdor map. He places it in between the Barrens, Ashenvale and the Stonetalon Mountains, but there is no such space there, not even undeveloped space. The creation of this zone would require a massive reworking of those three zones.Also, there some minor issues in the writing, in particular the use of apostrophes (\"the Ogre's demigods\" should be \"the Ogres' demigods).\nThis rumor is also seemingly lended credibility by what some say is a picture of the new race in the existing concept art for the upcoming expansion. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/imageviewer.html%3F/burningcrusade/%2Cimages/art/%2C13%2C26%2Chttp%3A//worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/artwork.html%3F3%404\"&gt;A Mok'Nathal in Outland?&lt;/a&gt;\n However, this is most likely a full-blooded Orc, since his skin is clearly dark green. Rexxar, the only Mok'Nathal shown in the WarCraft universe, possessed the peach complexion of an ogre.\nRumored Mok'Thanl Racial Abilities &amp; Mount:\nThe Wild's Blessing:\nWhen activated, the Mok'nathal has a 25% chance to stun an enemy for two seconds when hit. Lasts 10 secconds.\nCallous:\n+5% defense\nHeated Brand:\n+10 Fire resistence\nThe Wild's Offerings:\n+10 to Leather Working\nAnd of course their mounts will be bears. Oh my.\nDue to a long period of inactivity, the original thread has been deleted from the Blizzard forums as per forum policy. Nevertheless, the poster admitted to making the entire thing up some time before the thread was deleted; though not before a lengthy 23 page discussion.\nStill, there is a possibility that the Mok'Nathal will become a new race in a future expansion..."}

The children of these forced unions were called mok'nathal, possessing the strength of ogres and intelligence of orcs. The Bladespire kept the mok'nathal in chains and bred them together to create even more. To ensure their loyalty, the ogres threatened to kill entire families if even one of the members rebelled.\nImperator Kelgrok unshackled many of these mok'nathal and ordered them to make war on the orcs of Frostfire Ridge. The mok'nathal formed the bulk of the Bladespire army that rampaged across Frostfire, seizing many tracts of resource-rich land. Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; called upon the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; clans that lived nearby to unite, but the Thunderlords - led by Garad's estranged son &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; - rejected the offer. Thunderlord orcs raided Bladespire settlements alone in the dead of night, slaughtering young and old alike. In the meantime, the united Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army fought the Bladespire and managed to capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarad was surprised to learn that Leoroxx and the other mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves. Garad and Leoroxx came to an agreement to help each other destroy the Bladespire clan forever. Leoroxx returned to &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; and incited open rebellion among the mok'nathal. They rose up against their oppressors and set fire to the stronghold as the Frostwolves and Whiteclaws crashed into Bladespire's outer defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for a full bloody day before the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out. In the heart of the fortress, Leoroxx strangled Imperator Kelgrok with the chains he had worn for so much of his life.\nThe orcs and mok'nathal had won but at the cost of many lives including Garad's son &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt;, who had sacrificed himself to let many young mok'nathal escape. Afterward, Garad offered Leoroxx and his people land in Frostfire, but Leoroxx declined because he knew the half-breeds would never truly be accepted by the orcs. The mok'nathal settled in a remote corner of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. Resources were scarce, but they were able to live in peace. They swore off fighting, only taking up arms to defend their meager lands from threats.\nThe mok'nathal pushed the Bladespire ogres to &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Outpost\"&gt;Bladespire Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this refers to this battle or another one is unclear.\nRise of the Horde.\nEventually, a force of orcs known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arose on Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; offered ogres and mok'nathal a place in the Horde to increase his numbers.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand considered annihilating the mok'nathal but stayed his hand. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, son of Leoroxx, had joined the Horde and convinced Blackhand to spare his people. Rexxar had not agreed with his father's isolationist policies and longed for battle, as well as believing the Horde could help the mok'nathal find sources of water and food. However, in time Rexxar would learn the Horde's purpose was not noble.\nIn the novel \"Cycle of Hatred\", Rexxar is described as \"the last of the Mok'Nathal Clan\", and it further says that he was \"Born of orc and ogre blood both, as most of his now-defunct clan.\" With the revelation that they still exist in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, it's likely Rexxar simply believed he was the last one.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nFollowing the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde claimed &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thunderlord Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and from there Rexxar wished to find more of his people and perhaps make peace with his father. In time &lt;a href=\"Garm%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Garm Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Mok'nathal were at &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt; within the eastern &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, while warning that the Mok'nathal were in danger. Though Leoroxx had refused to cooperate with the Old Horde he was willing to work with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, provided that they proved their worth by slaying &lt;a href=\"Vekh\"&gt;Vekh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnosh%20Brognat\"&gt;Gnosh Brognat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dreadwing\"&gt;Dreadwing&lt;/a&gt;. Leoroxx congratulated them and remarked that slaying the chiefs of the three greatest threats the mok'nathal faced was something to be proud of.\nMeanwhile, Rexxar had discovered that the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; were directing the Ogres against the Mok'nathal, and with Horde champions by his side would eventually kill &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%20the%20Dragon-Eater\"&gt;Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;. With their deaths, Rexxar declared the Mok'nathal free.\nDragonflight.\nThe mok'nathal were invited to attend the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly surprised &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt; as the mok'nathal were considered half-breeds, lesser than true orcs, by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing how times have changed, Leoroxx decided that the time had come to reconnect with his son, with &lt;a href=\"Silmara\"&gt;Silmara&lt;/a&gt; hoping their inclusion to the festival would see the mok'nathal end their isolationist policy.\nMembers.\nUnnamed.\nAll of these people, with the exception of Rexxar, can be found in &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar is located at nearby &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thunderlord Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;s, the Mok'nathal are known to tame various pets, including &lt;a href=\"quilbeast\"&gt;quilbeast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWarcraft III.\nOther named half-ogres who may or may not be mok'nathal include Mag Bearmaul, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Tagar Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;, Gorsh Talonfang, Maxx Rocmane, Gaz Boartusk, Mok Rocksnout, and Gish Eagle Eye. \"They are &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;s that can be hired from &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20Camp\"&gt;Mercenary Camp&lt;/a&gt;s in The Frozen Throne.\"\nIn Warlords of Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, only &lt;a href=\"Rexxar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; is seen with no mention of the other mok'nathals. In &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Journey%20into%20Draenor\"&gt;an early WoD preview&lt;/a&gt;, it is implied that they were to appear in larger numbers.\nIn the RPG.\nIt had been thought that the mok'nathal half-ogres had been extinct on Azeroth, but after Rexxar's exploits on Azeroth, the mok'nathal are showing up again. They can be &lt;a href=\"wilderness%20stalker\"&gt;wilderness stalker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bone%20crusher\"&gt;bone crusher&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHalf-ogres are named mok'nathal by the orcs, which translates to \"The Sons of &lt;a href=\"Nath\"&gt;Nath&lt;/a&gt;,\" who is an ogre war god.\nThe \"Horde Player's Guide\" implies that \"mok'nathal\" (lower-case) is the Orcish term and honorific for \"half-ogre\", while half-ogre is the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; name for the race."}

Under the command of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw swore fealty to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. After Blackhand's death, the Dragonmaw maintained their fealty to the late Warchief by pledging themselves to Blackhand's &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;sons&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonmaw were later empowered by the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to enslave the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, including the Dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; herself, forcing the noble dragons to fight for the Horde throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. During this time the clan were based out of the ancient stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, which housed the prison of Alexstrasza.\nThe Dragonmaw retained their dominance of the red flight even after the Horde's defeat at the end of the war, but lost control over their winged captives during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Grim Batol was destroyed by the vengeful dragons, forcing the clan to flee into the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they remained relatively dormant for years and clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the clan, including their chieftain Zuluhed, remained on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and instead pledged their service to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, enslaving the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;nether dragons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. The Azerothian Dragonmaw were eventually recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during the invasion of the Twilight Highlands in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, a great deal of the Dragonmaw remained fiercely loyal to Garrosh during and after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, allying with the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;Iron Horde Incursion&lt;/a&gt;. In both of these occasions, they had traded out the now destroyed &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s they used for &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. It is noted they also breed these dragons in the Twilight Highlands, forming bonds with them without having to break them.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorfax%20Angerfang\"&gt;Gorfax Angerfang&lt;/a&gt; became chieftain of the clan after the downfall of Zaela. He and his Dragonmaw have had a tumultuous relationship with the Horde in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;; though this was ultimately resolved as their clan was welcomed to Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. Gorfax is resolute in the idea of redeeming the Dragonmaw's tainted legacy, or to have the clan die trying. \nEtymology.\nIn their native Orcish, the Dragonmaw clan is known as \"Nelghor-shomash\", or \"Cry of the Beasts\", a name they earned by learning to tame the winged &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s of Draenor. The Dragonmaw fondly referred to their mounts as \"nelghor\", or \"loyal beasts\", and would later apply the same term to the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. All orcs would eventually refer to dragons as \"nelghor\". The name of the Dragonmaw clan never changed, but its meaning surely did.\nHistory.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw dwelled in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, near the border with &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, and tamed the fierce &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s that hunted on the outskirts of the region. The alternate universe's &lt;a href=\"Agurak%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Agurak's Fall&lt;/a&gt; roughly corresponds to the location of their home.\nThe Dragonmaws were among the clans &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; cited when he tried convincing the orcs to go to war against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Dragonmaw were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of Draenor to another. 3 years later, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; was charged with eliminating the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; and formed a lightly armored but highly mobile invasion force from the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and Dragonmaw clans. After dozens of orcs were incinerated by the arakkoa's &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;immense cannon&lt;/a&gt;, Kargath convinced the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcast arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; to sneak into Skyreach and sabotage the weapon. The Outcasts were successful, but Kargath and his forces then proceeded to slaughter the Outcasts alongside the high arakkoa, throwing some of the latter into &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde assault led to the destruction of high arakkoan civilization and the near-extinction of the Outcasts.\nAfter the Horde had conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused the orcs to hunt most of Draenor's native creatures to extinction. The Dragonmaw turned on their trained rylaks and used them as a source of food.\nThe Dragonmaw accompanied the Horde through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. After Warchief Blackhand was killed by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw honored their fealty to him by pledging themselves into the service of his sons, &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Demon Soul.\nAt the end of the First War, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; intended for the orcs to gain control of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact from the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; which could be used to destroy or control dragons, but which could not be wielded by any dragon. Deathwing believed that &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the Dragonmaw, would be the most receptive and sent him vivid dreams and visions of his clan taming and riding strange, powerful winged creatures. The thought of once again soaring in the sky was irresistible, and if properly tamed, these dragons would make excellent \"nelghor\". Deathwing coaxed Zuluhed to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orastrasz\"&gt;Orastrasz&lt;/a&gt; guarded the Dragon Soul. The Dragonmaw immediately fell upon the guardian, and though over a dozen orcs perished in the fight, they eventually managed to kill the dragon. Zuluhed ordered his clan's greatest &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, to recover the artifact. Nekros shattered the relic's defenses and renamed it the \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;\" due to the faint &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies lingering on it. Far from Redridge, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; sensed the breaking of the artifact's wards and set out with several of her red dragons to hunt down the artifact.\nThe dragons finally traced the Demon Soul to the orcs during the Horde's conquest of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to Alexstrasza, Nekros had learned much about the artifact and how to wield it from dreams and visions sent by Deathwing. Nekros used the Soul to inflict excruciating pain on Alexstrasza, causing her to plummet from the sky, and then proceeded to enslave her as the other Dragonmaw bound her in chains. While Nekros could only use the Soul on one dragon at a time, he inflicted a lash of pain on the Dragonqueen every time a dragon swooped down toward the orcs, and the message was clear enough. By enslaving Alexstrasza, Nekros effectively bound the red dragons to his will, as the great creatures feared that their queen would be tortured or even killed if they did not obey the Dragonmaw. Warchief Doomhammer was greatly pleased by this development, but as it would take time to reliably control the dragons he commanded the Dragonmaw to take control of the abandoned fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros and his followers imprisoned Alexstrasza and her followers in the stronghold's depths and prepared to use the dragons as battle mounts.\nThe Second War.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim later pressured Nekros into providing aerial support for the Horde fleet in the form of three dragons, despite Nekros' initial protests that their training as battle mounts wasn't finished. Near the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde fleet was intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; navy, but the Alliance ships were forced to retreat when the dragons revealed themselves and engulfed the fleet in fire. After months of hard work, the Dragonmaw learned how to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20rider\"&gt;ride&lt;/a&gt; their winged captives in battle, and dozens of dragons were used to devastating effect during the Horde attack on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, despite the dragons weeping in sorrow as they slaughtered the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and burned down the forests. When Orgrim prepared to leave Silvermoon behind to instead march on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; convinced the Warchief to leave them behind to unravel the barrier surrounding the elven capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Doomhammer ordered the Dragonmaw to also remain behind and force Gul'dan's followers to march west if the shield had not come down within three days. The Warchief also gave the Dragonmaw permission to feed Gul'dan to their dragons if he disobeyed.\nA few days after Doomhammer left, Gul'dan gathered his allies and set out to abandon the Horde to instead find the lost &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonmaw moved to bar his path, but neither side risked fighting and instead the Dragonmaw set out west to rejoin the main Horde force and warn Orgrim of Gul'dan's betrayal. Upon hearing the news, Orgrim sent the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; to hunt the traitors down. Later, the Horde were forced to abandon their siege of Capital City and instead retreat south into Khaz Modan. Doomhammer gathered Zuluhed and as many Dragonmaw warriors as he could and told them to rally the scattered dragon riders at Grim Batol and then transport them, Alexstrasza, and the rest of his resources to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Orgrim also commanded Zuluhed to send some of the dragon riders to seek out the Black Tooth Grin forces still at sea to inform them of the new rendezvous point at Blackrock as well as guard them from the Alliance navy.\nThe Dragonmaw did not arrive at Blackrock in time to aid Doomhammer during the Horde's last stand against the Alliance. Seeing that the Alliance was triumphant, the Dragonmaw retreated to Grim Batol and continued breeding and training their red dragons, so that they would at least have weapons in case they were discovered by their enemies. Meanwhile, the Black Tooth Grin forces now barricaded in Blackrock Spire gradually reached out to other large groups of survivors in an attempt to rally them under their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;new banner&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonmaw clan pledged their support and offered to give some of their enslaved dragons to the forces at Blackrock if they were ever needed. However, Zuluhed and many of the other Dragonmaw instead returned to Draenor. One group of the clan in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; helped defend the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance at the very end of the Second War.\nThe Battle of Grim Batol.\nWhen the news came of Draenor's &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;apparent destruction&lt;/a&gt; months later, the Azerothian Dragonmaw believed Zuluhed to have been killed in the catastrophe. Nekros Skullcrusher took command over his people and ordered them to continue lording over Alexstrasza and the dragons in Grim Batol. With most of the other orc clans having been captured and placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw were the last group of orcs large and strong enough to upset the delicate peace in Lordaeron. The clan continued holding domain over a large portion of northern Khaz Modan using dragons and small units of foot soldiers, even launching raids in Lordaeron using their dragon riders. Meanwhile Nekros maintained his control over Alexstrasza and built up a secret army within Grim Batol, intending to unleash it upon the Alliance, reunite the Horde and continue the orcs' conquest of Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; high councilor Krasus - the &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; form of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, one of Alexstrasza's consorts - sent the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; to free Alexstrasza from the Dragonmaw in Grim Batol by somehow destroying the Demon Soul - which, using one of Deathwing's scales, he did. In her fury, Alexstrasza then tore Grim Batol apart and ate Nekros whole. The Dragonqueen and her vengeful kin incinerated the greater bulk of the Dragonmaw clan before Alliance troops rounded up the remaining survivors and threw them into internment camps, with the exception of a few clan members that managed to flee into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The defeat effectively put an end to the last bastion of orcish power in the world and signaled the end of the Horde and the end of the orcs' furious bloodlust. Some of the interned Dragonmaw orcs later rejoined the Horde after being freed from the internment camps by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperations in the Wetlands.\nThe Dragonmaw were all but destroyed after they lost control of their dragons after the Second War. The dragons were not happy with their old masters and fiercely hunted the Dragonmaw. What few remained fled from Grim Batol, with one group seeking refuge in the mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, specifically at the &lt;a href=\"Angerfang%20Encampment\"&gt;Angerfang Encampment&lt;/a&gt; east of &lt;a href=\"Whelgar%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Whelgar's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros' son, &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, took up leadership of the clan and vowed revenge against the dragons who slew his father. While not the same threat as they were when they had dragons, these Dragonmaw were still fierce opponents.\nWhile they normally hid in the hills, a group of Dragonmaw expanded into &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to cut off &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the Wetlands. Meanwhile, Nek'rosh aimed to lay siege to Menethil itself \u2014 which would have been effectively blocked from reinforcements due to the fighting in Algaz \u2014 and ordered the construction of several &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. He was ultimately defeated by Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and his head was brought to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Stoutfist\"&gt;Captain Stoutfist&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending the Dragonmaw threat to Menethil.\nThe orcs who claimed the Twilight Highlands soon came into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Narkrall%20Rakeclaw\"&gt;Narkrall Rakeclaw&lt;/a&gt; states that the two clans have fought against each other in both Grim Batol and the Wetlands, while &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Thundermar\"&gt;Colin Thundermar&lt;/a&gt; claims that the Wildhammers have fought the Dragonmaw \"up and down these highlands since the last war\".\nA group of Dragonmaw warriors was stationed within the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Garrison\"&gt;Dragonmaw Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing\"&gt;Blackwing Cabal&lt;/a&gt; protecting &lt;a href=\"Grethok%20the%20Controller\"&gt;Grethok the Controller&lt;/a&gt;.\nA wrecked Dragonmaw &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Belt\"&gt;Green Belt&lt;/a&gt; of the Wetlands, with &lt;a href=\"red%20whelp\"&gt;red whelp&lt;/a&gt;s, implying it was destroyed in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutland.\nThe Dragonmaw who traveled to Draenor, including Chieftain Zuluhed, survived the shattering of the world and its transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and came to serve the Betrayer, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, applying their knowledge of all things draconic to enslave Outland's &lt;a href=\"netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;nether dragons&lt;/a&gt;. In their stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Fortress\"&gt;Dragonmaw Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw tortured captured drakes in an attempt to bend them to their will. Many drakes gave up hope and chose to instead do the bidding of the Dragonmaw, while others sought refuge in the skies above the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Fields\"&gt;Netherwing Fields&lt;/a&gt;, refusing to land for fear of being captured by Dragonmaw war parties. The Netherwing matriarch herself, &lt;a href=\"Karynaku\"&gt;Karynaku&lt;/a&gt;, was captured by Zuluhed and held prisoner atop the Fortress, bound by chains that sapped her power. The Netherwing and their patriarch, &lt;a href=\"Neltharaku\"&gt;Neltharaku&lt;/a&gt;, were powerless against Zuluhed, who possessed unknown powers and was likely empowered further by Illidan.\nMeanwhile, a group of Dragonmaw under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt; established a &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;base camp&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Ledge\"&gt;Netherwing Ledge&lt;/a&gt;, once a bastion of sanctuary for the Netherwing. There, they were charged with strip-mining the island of all natural resources in order to supply Illidan's armies out of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. However, Mor'ghor's Dragonmaw took much for themselves and sold whatever they hid away to the highest bidder \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was involved, as were some independent third parties. The Dragonmaw also thoroughly gathered &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Egg\"&gt;Netherwing eggs&lt;/a&gt; in order to ship them off to parts unknown. Mor'ghor specifically had some form of agreement with &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, the black flight's matriarch, who requested Netherwing eggs for Deathwing's experiments in exchange for allowing the Dragonmaw to ride upon the backs of black drakes as needed.\nEventually, an adventurer sent by Neltharaku freed several drakes enslaved in Dragonmaw Fortress by using an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Nethervine%20Crystal\"&gt;enchanted nethervine crystal&lt;/a&gt; and helped them turn on their masters. The adventurer eventually succeeded in killing Zuluhed himself, retrieving the key to Karynaku's chains from his corpse and freeing the great dragon. The adventurer was then sent to Netherwing Ledge to infiltrate the Dragonmaw's ranks and sabotage their operations under the disguise of a fel orc. After gradually ascending through the Dragonmaw's ranks, the adventurer was finally promoted to the first highlord of the Dragonmaw and presented to Illidan himself by Mor'ghor. However, Illidan saw through the adventurer's disguise and furiously ordered Mor'ghor to kill the infiltrator, forcing the adventurer to flee on the back of another undercover Netherwing agent, &lt;a href=\"Yarzill%20the%20Merc\"&gt;Yarzill&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dark Portal reopened, a number of Dragonmaw were forced to serve the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nMor'ghor survived Illidan's wrath and the events in Outland and managed to flee to Azeroth, where he declared himself Warchief of the Dragonmaw and asserted a reign of terror over his clansmen with the aid of several of his fel orc enforcers and warlocks, seemingly with the intent of turning the Azerothian Dragonmaw into fel orcs as well. This was much to the dismay of more traditional-minded Dragonmaw like &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, who despised the \"half-demon\" Mor'ghor for his \"contaminated\" blood and saw his actions as leading their clan to ruin.\nBy the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw had clung to the edges of the Twilight Highlands. Around this time, the Horde were presented with an opportunity to redeem their old Dragonmaw allies. Despite their past crimes, it was the will of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; that the once-maligned Dragonmaw join the Horde in battle once again. Though no less wild and difficult to deal with than when they ruled Grim Batol, the clan's knowledge of dragons and warfare was of unquestionable importance, especially amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm.\nHowever, when the Horde forces arrived near &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to negotiate with the clan, Mor'ghor killed the negotiators and captured the Horde adventurer as a bargaining chip. With the help of Zaela, the adventurer was able to escape and inform their superiors of the tensions between the regular orcs and the fel orcs within the clan. Using this information, the Horde forces launched an offensive on the shores of Dragonmaw Port while the adventurer slipped behind the battle lines and met up with Zaela. Together, they armed the port's merchants and workers with supplies sent by the Horde fleet, inciting the populace to rebel against Mor'ghor's loyalists. Zaela, the adventurer and a handful of other rebels proceeded to face Mor'ghor in his stronghold and finally kill him. Zaela declared that wherever the Horde would take the clan, they would keep their heads high and their blood pure and that a new Dragonmaw dawned with Mor'ghor's death. Shortly afterward, Warchief Garrosh arrived and welcomed the Dragonmaw into the Horde, with Zaela as their new leader.\nShortly afterward, Dragonmaw Port's \"flimsy wooden walls\" were quickly replaced with sturdier constructions. As the Dragonmaw's arrangement with the Horde put them in direct conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde set up a command post south of the port to prevent the Alliance's forces from moving up the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Shore%20%28Twilight%20Highlands%29\"&gt;Twilight Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Gralok\"&gt;Gralok&lt;/a&gt; and a group of Dragonmaw warriors set up a defensive perimeter at the &lt;a href=\"Slithering%20Cove\"&gt;Slithering Cove&lt;/a&gt; to the north in order to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Blackscale%20naga\"&gt;Blackscale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from moving upriver to reinforce the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; engineers and the Horde adventurer, they were able to fend off the naga and kill their leader, &lt;a href=\"Fathom-Lord%20Heth%27Jatar\"&gt;Fathom-Lord Heth'Jatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe adventurer was then sent to assist &lt;a href=\"Narkrall%20Rakeclaw\"&gt;Narkrall Rakeclaw&lt;/a&gt;, who was amassing a wing of drake-riders at &lt;a href=\"Bloodgulch\"&gt;Bloodgulch&lt;/a&gt;, the heart of the Dragonmaw empire. Narkrall was unimpressed by the hero and tasked them with assisting in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thundermar%20Ruins\"&gt;Thundermar Ruins&lt;/a&gt; before sending them to wrangle a wild black drake back to Bloodgulch. While the adventurer was gone, Narkrall and the drake-riders launched a violent assault on the Wildhammer settlement of &lt;a href=\"Thundermar\"&gt;Thundermar&lt;/a&gt;, but the attack was repelled by the dwarves with the help of their new Alliance allies and Narkrall himself was killed. Warlord Zaela was immensely frustrated by this, for while Narkrall himself was meaningless, he had earlier revealed to Zaela the reason behind his ability to control black drakes: he had somehow come into possession of &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Demon%20Chain\"&gt;:the Demon Chain&lt;/a&gt;, the very length of chain to which the Demon Soul was once fastened. The adventurer retrieved the chain from Narkrall's corpse and proceeded to assist Zaela in defeating Narkrall's drake mount, &lt;a href=\"Torth\"&gt;Torth&lt;/a&gt;, who had broken free from his former master and vowed revenge against the Dragonmaw.\nZaela continued to assist the Horde during their efforts against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; at the Bastion of Twilight, with a wing of drake rider reinforcements being called in during the climactic battle with &lt;a href=\"Skullcrusher%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Skullcrusher the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nElsewhere, the &lt;a href=\"Gorshak%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Gorshak War Camp&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by the Twilight's Hammer, killing most of the Dragonmaw that lived in the town. &lt;a href=\"Mackay%20Firebeard\"&gt;Mackay Firebeard&lt;/a&gt; and a group of dwarves ransacked the camp's supplies and weapons and killed or drove out the remaining orc stragglers with the help of an Alliance adventurer. In the north, the Dragonmaw town of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Drakgor\"&gt;Drakgor&lt;/a&gt; suffered a similar fate, being destroyed by Twilight cultists who then proceeded to perform &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; summoning rituals in the ruins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Carnage\"&gt;Crucible of Carnage&lt;/a&gt; used to be an old Dragonmaw fighting pit. The Dragonmaw champion &lt;a href=\"Torg%20Drakeflayer\"&gt;Torg Drakeflayer&lt;/a&gt; was one of the arena's combatants, proclaiming that all of the highlands belonged to the Dragonmaw, including the Crucible.\nTo this day, the Dragonmaw and Wildhammer remain locked in seemingly endless battle in the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, a vitally strategic chokepoint to the Twilight Highlands war effort, each faction hoping to claim definitive ownership of the peaks.\nA portion of the Dragonmaw remained in the Wetlands. &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Whelgar\"&gt;Prospector Whelgar&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to deal with the Angerfang Dragonmaw and their chief, &lt;a href=\"Gorfax%20Angerfang\"&gt;Gorfax Angerfang&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonmaw near &lt;a href=\"Greenwarden%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Greenwarden's Grove&lt;/a&gt; quickly became a nuisance to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, launching several suicidal but ineffective attacks on the grove. More disturbingly, however, these orcs began rounding up and capturing nearby &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly in a crude attempt at reviving their dragon-taming traditions. They could also be seen fighting &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Slavehunter\"&gt;ebon slavehunters&lt;/a&gt;, while the black drake &lt;a href=\"Pyrricion\"&gt;Pyrricion&lt;/a&gt; assaulted them with fire. &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Iczelia\"&gt;Huntress Iczelia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; asked Alliance adventurers to cut down the Dragonmaw whelpstealers to put an end to their dragon enslaving and prevent them from pressing further west. Another Dragonmaw group resided in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt; and stole a keg of ale from the nearby &lt;a href=\"mountaineer\"&gt;mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Rharen\"&gt;Rharen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Grugelm\"&gt;Grugelm&lt;/a&gt;, much to the two dwarves' dismay.\nCivil war in the Horde.\nWarlord Zaela vocally admired Garrosh's style of leadership; the Dragonmaw were just as intolerant of insubordination as he was. In the words of &lt;a href=\"Koak\"&gt;Koak&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw now belonged to Hellscream, depending on him for vital resources and military support.\nZaela was summoned by Garrosh to help put down the burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3.0\"&gt;escalation&lt;/a&gt; of the conflict between the rebels and Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, Zaela could be found at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, projecting her will onto an enslaved black &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered a large amount of proto-drake eggs. The Gob Squad member &lt;a href=\"Grit\"&gt;Grit&lt;/a&gt; commented \"Proto-drake eggs... is Garrosh working with the Dragonmaw? Orcs on proto-drakes sounds bad to me. Very bad.\"\nZaela and some of her finest soldiers were tasked with the naval defense of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; when the Alliance and the Darkspear Rebellion launched their &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; on the city. The Dragonmaw defended &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Landing\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Landing&lt;/a&gt; from the invading forces, with Zaela herself overseeing the battle from atop the back of her fearsome proto-drake, &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt;. The defenses were shattered and Galakras was brought down, but Zaela managed to escape with her life. In the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, many crates with the Dragonmaw symbol can be found.\nKoak was one of the few Dragonmaw to side with the Horde and the rebellion over his own clan, forever marking him as an outcast. &lt;a href=\"Duroz%20Scaletaker\"&gt;Duroz Scaletaker&lt;/a&gt; was another Dragonmaw who sided with the Horde over the clan.\nWar Crimes.\nZaela and other Dragonmaw orcs still loyal to Garrosh fled to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; following the Siege of Orgrimmar, where they successfully hid from scouts sent by &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to look for them in the Twilight Highlands. &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; contacted Zaela and tasked her with gathering other loyalists in the form of &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Kairozdormu provided the Dragonmaw with &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragons&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and provide a distraction while he freed Garrosh and helped him escape to .\nIron Horde incursion.\nWhen Garrosh instructed the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; vanguard as to their mission in Azeroth, he urged them to rendezvous with his old ally, Zaela. The Dragonmaw warlord and her loyalists captured &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, joining forces with the Ironmarch to create the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron\"&gt;Black Iron&lt;/a&gt;. Zaela apparently planned to destroy &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with some form of doomsday weapon, but she and her armies were ultimately destroyed by adventurers from the Alliance and Horde.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorfax%20Angerfang\"&gt;Gorfax Angerfang&lt;/a&gt; is present in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; during the prestige ceremony when &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; commends a Horde adventurer for their battles against the Alliance.\nDragonflight.\nThe Dragonmaw are invited to Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. A number of clan members expressed some disbelief that they were invited, including their chieftain, Gorfax. Gorfax lamented the torrid experiences that Thrall has borne witness to concerning his clan, stating that he hoped the festival could mend ties.\nLater in the festival, the clans gathered to allow orcs to choose their clan, including the Dragonmaw. Here, the chieftains described their clans to prospective recruits. Gorfax was honest and described the sad history of the clan, recounting their past as rylak riders, then their dark turn to slavers under the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Hordes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their corruption in the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Gorfax also chastised his own actions for supporting &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, prior to his demise. If questioned on his clan's dishonor, he claimed that he would not have their clan's strength be dictated by enslaving another race, and would like the Dragonmaw to stand on their own merits; or see the clan die trying to redeem themselves. He also re-affirmed his people's place is in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \nUpon orc champions requesting to join the Dragonmaw, Gorfax reaffirmed that it was their wish. He subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Gorfax accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of the clan.\n&lt;a href=\"Artesh\"&gt;Artesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mallia\"&gt;Mallia&lt;/a&gt; were offered an invitation by &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;; though the two were hesitant out of fear of prejudices. Mallia stated they would converse with the spirits and do as they bid on this matter.\nCulture.\nAppearance.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Dragonmaw clan members originally all had the same chartreuse yellow skin color already accessible to orc player characters, giving them a distinct look as a group. This skin color can still be seen on &lt;a href=\"Garneg%20Charskull\"&gt;Garneg Charskull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ma%27ruk%20Wyrmscale\"&gt;Ma'ruk Wyrmscale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; was another example before his death.\nIn \"\", the Dragonmaw orc received a new unique model, with gray skin (similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;), special facial features and distinctive tattoos. However, some Dragonmaw (such as &lt;a href=\"Innkeeper%20Turk\"&gt;Innkeeper Turk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; in some appearances) use the standard gray-skinned Blackrock model instead.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"player%20character%20revamp\"&gt;player character revamp&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", the Dragonmaw model lost the unique dragon tattoos and their eyes now glow a bright yellow. The reason for this is unknown.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" card combines the two Dragonmaw designs by depicting an orc with both the tattoos of the \"Cataclysm\" model and the glowing eyes of the \"Warlords of Draenor\" model.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Velora%20Nitely\"&gt;Velora Nitely&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonmaw orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; have nice, thick shinbones.\nReputation rewards.\nThose members of the Horde who endorse the Dragonmaw clan will find themselves rewarded with masterfully crafted pieces of armor and mystic trinkets that reflect the clan's history of domination.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"&lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt;\"\nClan Colors: \"White\"\nBackground: \"Led by the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; Zuluhed, the Dragonmaw clan is a small but elite faction within the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With its legacy dating back into the time before the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, the Dragonmaw was quick to become one of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s strongest supporters in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After his demise, the Dragonmaw honored its fealty to Blackhand by pledging itself into the service of his sons and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;The Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt;. Using ritualistic &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; dowered by the ancient Shaman, the Dragonmaw clan was responsible for the capture of the Dragon Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstraza&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde's current subjugation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth.\"\nDomain: &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nThe Dragonmaws employed several &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Mulfseam%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Mulfseam\u200e&lt;/a&gt;, when they were still holding &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. They also constructed the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nFate of the dragons.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; claiming to be one of the last known black dragons alive on Azeroth at the end of ', it seems that all of the black dragons under the Dragomaw's command either perished in battle against the Alliance or the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, or broke free from their masters' will, forcing the Dragonmaw to put them down (such as was the case with &lt;a href=\"Torth\"&gt;Torth&lt;/a&gt;). Whichever the case, it's clear that the Dragonmaw no longer had black dragons under their control by the time of '.\nRelations.\nIt is unknown if the Dragonmaw clan ever reconciled with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during their time in the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Golluck%20Rockfist\"&gt;Golluck Rockfist&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, mentions that \"Zuluhed and Nekros are dead, but the debt we owe to the reds is far from repaid.\""}
