Eventually, an &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Commander\"&gt;Ashenvale Commander&lt;/a&gt; appears in front of Brutusk with a squad of sentinels.\" \n\"Despite a rain of arrows, Brutusk barrels through the sentinels, knocking the commander aside. Finally, the party arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Rampart\"&gt;Mor'shan Rampart&lt;/a&gt;, but it is revealed that Gorka did not make it, having been shot through the chest by one of the elves' arrows.\""}

Frightened by the recent attack by Kael'thas Sunstrider's forces, the Warp Splinter is unable to differentiate friend from foe and is liable to attack any who disturb it.\"\nStrategies.\nGeneral Information\nIgnoring adds strategy.\nFor most groups, this is a much easier strategy. Unless your group has below average DPS, you can just ignore the adds and focus all damage on Warp Splinter alone. While he will get healed several times this way, the fight will be shorter than the other strategies if the damage can outweigh the heals. The tank should position the boss so that it is facing away from other party members, so that the others will not be hit by Arcane Volly. When using this tactic one good option is to tank Warpsplinter as far away from the entrance as possible, this ensures that no group member except possibly the tank will get hit by the adds until Warpsplinter sacrifices them. The healer and ranged DPS should stay close together and use mass CC abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt; when the adds are close.\nAnother good spot for this strategy is to have all range dps/healer standing under the big tree on the left and tank the boss where it stands (within the platform but in max range of the dps/healers who are under the tree). Make sure the boss is facing away form the dps/healer.\nStrategy with AoE.\nWarp Splinter is quite easy with significant AoE damage. The tank should tank Warp Splinter where he stands when you enter the room, while the ranged DPS and healing should cluster up 31-35 yards from Warp Splinter (in range for damage, but out of range of Arcane Volley). DPS Warp Splinter until he spawns adds. When he does, DPS should hit each of the adds one time to pull them together, then AoE them all down. A single warlock can handle 4-6 of the adds with &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seed of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, while a mage will probably need backup from a Hunter or some single-target DPS. When the adds drop, continue DPSing Warp Splinter until he dies.\nYou can get problems with treants moving too slowly for AoE or the tank unable to keep aggro, in this case you can let the first wave go through and heal the boss, conserving mana and letting the tank generate enough threat, then do full AoE on the following waves.\nStrategy without AoE.\nWhile Warp Splinter is significantly harder without AoE, he is by no means impossible. You will, however, need excellent DPS. All ranged DPS should spread out around the edges of Warp Splinter's area, and DPS as hard as they possibly can. When the adds spawn, each ranged DPSer should stop DPS on Warp Splinter and DPS the adds. All melee DPS should stay on Warp Splinter. The reasoning behind this is that the fight is going to take a while with surviving adds, and melee DPS is going to take damage when taking down adds (as well as losing DPS by having to constantly change positions). Thus, healers save enough mana to keep going throughout the very long fight. Healers should put on any regeneration gear and drink potions early.\nAlternative (healer friendly) strategy: alternative tank position.\nTank Warp Splinter half the way toward his starting position between the two hedge rows, while the healers and range damage dealers stand grouped in the middle circle at his starting position at max range(avoiding his warstomp). The adds spawn around the middle circle and start walking towards the middle where the damage dealers can easy take them down (they have better overview and thus AOE control). The healers will benefit much from this rearranged positions because they do not have to stop healing while the adds spawning and all team members are in heal range. If the healers take aggro from the adds the near damage dealers can quickly take it down. You have better control over healers and range damage dealers standing outside warp splinters warstomp and AOE healing effects are more efficient because more team members standing together if something goes wrong. Support like player totems or auras also effect more team members. If you have melee damage dealer in your group let them take care of remaining adds running towards warp splinter.\nL.O.S. strategy.\nIn reality this is a combination of all of the above listed information with a bit of clarification.\nThis strategy conserves everyones mana, lets the tank build plenty of threat and allows all ranged classes to completely avoid the arcane volley.\nTank spot is on the left side of the circle where Warp Splinter stands. Have the ranged players stand just behind the middle large tree on the left (there is a row of three of them). The tank should position himself so Warp Splinters back is facing the group. He will be standing almost in the grass this will allow the ranged to stay behind the middle tree where the Arcane Volley will not hit them. Warrior tanks should use berserker rage to avoid the first stun which will allow him plenty of time to play with the positioning. Ranged should be doing only white damage to conserve mana at this point. Don't worry about the first set of treants, the group hasn't done much damage so it wont matter when they heal him and in the mean time the tank is building MAX threat. As soon as the first wave of treants is over start MAX DPS. Use any of the above AOE or ADDKill methods to kill the adds as they come but remember to stay behind the tree, then go back to MAX DPS. He dropped rather quickly and the healer still had 90% mana. Obviously this works best with a primarily ranged group.\nLoot.\nNote: Similar to &lt;a href=\"Tavarok\"&gt;Tavarok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mana-Tombs\"&gt;Mana-Tombs&lt;/a&gt; who can be mined after kill, herbalists with a high skill in &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt; can \"skin\" Warp Splinter for additional herb drops.\nReward.\nReputation: \nHeroic:"}

They were native to many areas of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and following the planet's destruction they became corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into warp stalkers and gained the ability to teleport by phasing in and out of the physical and astral dimensions at will. This ability disturbs magical energy flows and causes spells to fizzle out wherever the creatures blink into existence, making them an annoyance to magic-users. There are reports that Legion officers use warp stalkers as &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s.

Return to &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Goretooth\"&gt;Warlord Goretooth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt; when the mission has been accomplished.\nDescription.\nBy order of Warlord Goretooth, the following inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; must be destroyed:\nThe rotund menace, Highlord Omokk.\nThe cruel and ruthless &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, War Master Voone.\nOverlord Wyrmthalak, taskmaster of the lesser city.\nYou will also be required to return any important documents that you may find.\nSucceed and be honored.\nFail and be forgotten.\nYou will also receive:\nProgress.\nWarlord Goretooth salutes.\nCompletion.\nWarlord Goretooth's dull green skin turns a pasty white for a brief moment.\nQuest strategy.\nThe lowest level that you can attempt this quest is Level 58. The quest is a 5-man run through &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. The main targets are &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Omokk\"&gt;Highlord Omokk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Master%20Voone\"&gt;War Master Voone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Wyrmthalak\"&gt;Overlord Wyrmthalak&lt;/a&gt;. You must also obtain the &lt;a href=\"Important%20Blackrock%20Documents\"&gt;Important Blackrock Documents&lt;/a&gt;, which spawn randomly in one of four places.\nWhen you enter the instance, walk up the ramp, kill the orcs sitting on either side, and then the patrol. Continue up the ramp again and make a right out of the doorway, killing a second patrol on the way. Near the doorway to the left are two mobs. It's possible to &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Soothe\"&gt;Mind Soothe&lt;/a&gt; them and hug the far wall to avoid fighting them. Once out of the S-shaped hallway, you find yourself on a large platform with some Orcs. Instead of fighting them, hug the wall to your right and jump off the edge. You'll see two ledges sticking out of the wall further down, so make sure you aim for these. After reaching the bottom, the next area if full of spiders. Careful pulling and stopping any runners is the key here. After the spiders, make sure you look for the documents by the pile of skulls on the Ogre platform.\nSoon afterwards you should run into &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Wyrmthalak\"&gt;Overlord Wyrmthalak&lt;/a&gt;. Once Wyrmthalak is dead, check for the documents and head back to the previous room that was full of Orcs. Jump down the first crack and Omokk should be nearby. After ridding yourself of Omokk, check for the documents again.\nFight your way out of Omokk's area, continue across the bridge, and jump down the first crack you see. &lt;a href=\"Bijou\"&gt;Bijou&lt;/a&gt; should be nearby. Fight your way down to the main floor of the Troll area and make sure you take a right at the bottom fork of the ramp down. Hugging the wall should get you to Voone in a total of 6-7 pulls from Bijou. If you have not yet found the documents, they should be near this last boss.\nThis rather roundabout way will save you some time and prevent a lot of unnecessary fighting."}
{"id": "283886", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=283886", "title": "Warlord's Command quest chain", "text": "Warlord's Command was the Horde quest chain that leads to obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Drakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, the key to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the most arduous quest chains in the game, involving killing a variety of powerful elite creatures across the world as well as a raid in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. It may require several &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; runs as well, to acquire the key to the raid area.\nObtaining the Drakefire Amulet to Enter Onyxia's Lair (Horde).\n&lt;a href=\"Warlord%27s%20Command\"&gt;Warlord's Command&lt;/a&gt; (5 man LBRS).\nThis is where it all begins, at level 55. You talk to at the top of the tower in &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, except you need to actually *talk* to him - he's got a conversation line you can follow through (around 6 pages or so) before he'll give you &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Goretooth%27s%20Command\"&gt;Warlord Goretooth's Command&lt;/a&gt;, which starts the quest &lt;a href=\"Warlord%27s%20Command\"&gt;Warlord's Command&lt;/a&gt;. The quest requires that you run a 5-man &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and kill all the leaders (, , and ). NOTE: You also need to pick up that spawn near a random leader in LBRS. This is by far the hardest part of the Onyxia key questline.\nIt is possible to bypass the ogres and the trolls and go straight to the orc/dragonkin area, and that there is a hole near Wyrmthalak that you can jump through to reach the ogres.\nWhen you enter the BRS instance, walk up the ramp, kill the orcs sitting on either side and then the patrol. Walk up the ramp again and make a right out the doorway. Kill the second patrol and you are ready for the next part. You could &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Soothe\"&gt;Mind Soothe&lt;/a&gt; the two mobs closest to the doorway on the left here and just hug the wall to skip fighting. Once out of the S-shaped hallway, you find yourself on a big platform with some orcs. Instead of fighting them, you can just hug the wall to your right and jump off the edge. You'll see two ledges sticking out of the wall further down, so make sure you aim for these. When you're all the way at the bottom here you'll be almost at the spiders. Careful pulling ahead is the key and make sure you avoid runners. After the spiders, \"make sure\" you look for the documents by the pile of skulls on the Ogre platform.\nOnce Wyrmthalak is dead, check for documents and head back to the previous room that was full of orcs. Jump down the first crack and presto, Omokk is only one pull away! \"Check for docs again!\" Fight your way out of Omokk's area, across the bridge and jump down the first crack you get to (where Bijou is hiding). Fight your way down to the main floor of the troll area and make sure you take a right at the bottom fork of the ramp down there. Hugging the wall should get you to Voone in a total of 6-7 pulls from Bijou.\nThis way should save you a lot of time since you skip a LOT of killing this way.\nImportant Blackrock Documents.\nThe look like papers on the ground and are spawned near a random boss (usually within about 10 feet of where they stand). On mouse-over they are called \"Inconspicuous Documents.\" Once you find them, everyone on the quest can loot them (as of 1.7) - the documents do not despawn.\nCompleting the Quest.\nOnce you've finished up in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, return to &lt;a href=\"The%20Badlands\"&gt;The Badlands&lt;/a&gt; and talk to Warlord Goretooth to complete the quest. He gives you the quest &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg%27s%20Wisdom\"&gt;Eitrigg's Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Eitrigg%27s%20Wisdom\"&gt;Eitrigg's Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; (Orgrimmar).\nWarlord Goretooth gives you this quest when you complete the quest Warlord's Command. He tells you to go speak to and then see . Eitrigg is in Thrall's throne room in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The tricky part is that Eitrigg doesn't have a ? or ! over his head - you just have to walk up and talk to him and click through the conversation. Once you've completed the conversation, Thrall's question mark will light up and you can complete the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Horde%21%20%28quest%29\"&gt;For The Horde!&lt;/a&gt; (UBRS).\nThrall is shocked to learn that claims to be the true warchief and sends you off to kill him. Not only is this quest a step in the Onyxia key line, but it also offers , the , and the as rewards.\n&lt;a href=\"What%20the%20Wind%20Carries\"&gt;What the Wind Carries&lt;/a&gt; (Orgrimmar).\nListen to Thrall to get the next quest.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Champion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;The Champion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; - Seek out Rokaro (Shadowprey Village in Desolace).\nSo now that you have Warchief's blessing that you provided for yourself, you get to waste most of it while you fly to &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. You will find at the top of the hill, from the docks.\n&lt;a href=\"Mistress%20of%20Deception\"&gt;Mistress of Deception&lt;/a&gt; - Go Talk to Myranda the Hag (Western Plaguelands).\nAnother easy part that sends you across the world. Go to &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; (slightly northeast of &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Point\"&gt;Chillwind Point&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;) and deliver a letter from Rokaro to (a Gnome). She'll send you to obtain 20 s to disguise yourself as a member of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Oculus%20Illusions\"&gt;Oculus Illusions&lt;/a&gt; - Black Dragon Eyeballs (UBRS).\nAnother simple section that takes a group and some time. Go run &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. You'll notice that all the black dragon enemies (other than the generated spawns in the Rookery) drop two eyeballs each. Because the drop rate is 100% for a pair of eyeballs this is reasonable to do with several people needing the quest. Return the eyes to Myranda.\nVisiting &lt;a href=\"Emberstrife%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Emberstrife&lt;/a&gt; (Dustwallow Marsh).\nMyranda the Hag will make you the and send you off to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to talk to . Get to Emberstife's cave on the southern wall of Dustwallow. Once you're in the cave equip and use the necklace to transform you to look like a dragonspawn from UBRS (fun!). Go talk to Emberstrife like this, and he won't attack you. Pick up the three quests from him about killing important dragons from the other dragonflight.\nKilling three Elite Dragons (Tanaris, Winterspring, Swamp of Sorrows).\nThere is an elite named dragon in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; (outside the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; (in the back of a cave filled with elite dragonspawn), and &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; (wanders around the lake that the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt; has sunken into). The quests are raid quests. You can have as many as your raid will allow. Previous releases only allowed 5-man, although these dragons are easy enough to do in a sub-5-man group.\nKilling Chronalis &lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Skulls%2C%20Chronalis\"&gt;The Test of Skulls, Chronalis&lt;/a&gt; (Tanaris).\n hangs out outside the Caverns of Time, southeast from &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling Scryer &lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Skulls%2C%20Scryer\"&gt;The Test of Skulls, Scryer&lt;/a&gt; (Winterspring).\n is in the back of a cave filled with blue dragonkin in &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;, south-southwest of &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt;. There is a rune on the ground that will teleport you to the top of the mountain, so take care not to wander onto it during the fight.\nKilling Somnus &lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Skulls%2C%20Somnus\"&gt;The Test of Skulls, Somnus&lt;/a&gt; (Swamp of Sorrows).\n wanders around the lake in eastern Swamp of Sorrows (the same lake that the Sunken Temple has sunken into). Somnus is easily the hardest of the three dragons as he hits hard and has the ability to sleep people (if this happens to your only healer then it's bad news).\nVisiting Emberstrife Again (Dustwallow Marsh).\nVisit Emberstrife once again. Turn in the three skulls and get the next quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Skulls%2C%20Axtroz\"&gt;The Test of Skulls, Axtroz&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Test%20of%20Skulls%2C%20Axtroz\"&gt;The Test of Skulls, Axtroz&lt;/a&gt; - Yet Another Elite Dragon (Wetlands).\nGo to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in eastern &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and kill . This is also a raid quest.\nVisiting Emberstrife Again...receive the quest &lt;a href=\"Ascension...\"&gt;Ascension...&lt;/a&gt; (Dustwallow Marsh).\nThis all seems so familiar. Go and turn in the skull to Emberstrife and then it's off to Rokaro... again.\nFinding Rokaro Again (Desolace).\nRokaro will give you the quest &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Black%20Dragon%20Champion%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Blood of the Black Dragon Champion&lt;/a&gt; to travel to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and slay .\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Black%20Dragon%20Champion%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Blood of the Black Dragon Champion&lt;/a&gt; - Drak's Blood (UBRS).\nPretty straightforward. Do a full UBRS run (make sure to get the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; attunement quest before you go in!). When you kill Drakkisath (last UBRS boss) he'll drop for the quest. As of patch 1.11, Drakkisath will drop blood for everyone running the quest (previously he would drop only two to four blood).\nSpeaking With Rokaro Once Again. (Desolace).\nNow that you've spent all this time on the quest line, you have to go back to &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and speak with again. Turn in the blood, get your , rejoice. This part alone is worth 10,900 experience points, so if you were able to do this before reaching 60 you should be most of the way there by now."}

Bloodhilt was appalled that the Alliance were able to capture &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and sack &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gar%27dul\"&gt;Warlord Gar'dul&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of the Horde forces in the area. When Horde adventurers encountered him in &lt;a href=\"Vendetta%20Point\"&gt;Vendetta Point&lt;/a&gt; he ordered them to destroy the siege weapons outside of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; and kill Alliance looters in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Taurajo\"&gt;Ruins of Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the adventurer's strength, Bloodhilt sent the adventurer and his vanguard to inform Gar'dul that he was coming to &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the nervous Gar'dul was able to convince the adventurer to arrange for a private meeting in the northern tower in Desolation Hold, Bloodhilt arrived. After arriving at the tower he and Gar'dul had a short exchange where Gar'dul claimed that he had been reinforcing the Horde's grip in the Southern Barrens. Bloodhilt correctly pointed out that it was the adventurer that helped reinforce the Horde's control in the region. Gar'dul mentioned that the Alliance had gained reinforcements from the Eastern Kingdoms and that he had been cut off only to be interrupted by Bloodhilt who relieved him of command. Enraged, Gar'dul refused and attacked Bloodhilt and the adventurer, yielding when beaten. Bloodhilt, enraged that Gar'dul yielded, asked him what part of \"Victory or Death\" did he not understand before throwing him out of the tower window to his death.\nWarlord Bloodhilt then assumed command of Desolation Hold and sent adventurers to claim the region for the Horde. He also ordered the assassination of the \"Butcher of Taurajo\", &lt;a href=\"General%20Hawthorne\"&gt;General Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nHe left Desolation Hold when the Horde headed for &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. He was put in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Offensive\"&gt;Dominance Offensive&lt;/a&gt; by Warchief Garrosh Hellscream and controls his forces from &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt; and can be found at the top of the main building. Hellscream has also tasked him to keep a close eye on the goblin and blood elf reinforcements he sent him as Hellscream distrusts their leaders. Bloodhilt too was distrustful of the blood elves as well as the goblins. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;Domination Point scenario&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked the base and Bloodhilt, Nazgrim and what remains of his vanguard team, and Horde adventurers successfully repelled the Alliance invasion. Bloodhilt's forces also &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;attacked Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; sent Alliance heroes to kill Bloodhilt.\nHe was then replaced as Warlord of Desolation Hold by &lt;a href=\"Crawgol\"&gt;Crawgol&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nMake this quick, &lt;class&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;The Warchief&lt;/a&gt; personally sent me to evaluate our progress in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and when I get here I found our towns aflame and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; dogs running amok.\nNow - the business of winning this war!\nAcross the scarred terrain to the east, the Alliance hopes to build an overland link between their coastal strongholds. They think to build a fortress here, in the center of the Barrens. In the center of MY Barrens.\nIt will not stand.\nDesolation Hold, later\nI will not rest, &lt;name&gt;.

Gar'dul rebuts this by saying that the Alliance has received reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and that he has been cut off. Bloodhilt interrupts Gar'dul and relieves him of command. Enraged, Gar'dul refuses and attacks Bloodhilt and the player but yields when beaten. Bloodhilt, furious that he yielded, asks him what part of \"Victory or Death\" did he not understand, before throwing him out of the tower window to his death. \nWarlord Bloodhilt then assumes command of Desolation Hold, and Gar'dul's body is seen on the ground.\nQuotes.\nThis is Desolation Hold, &lt;class&gt;.

When &lt;a href=\"Hixin\"&gt;Hixin&lt;/a&gt; used a parchment that Gurthan had written, but never issued, to trick &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20Xuexing\"&gt;Taskmaster Xuexing&lt;/a&gt; into using the &lt;a href=\"huatang\"&gt;huatang&lt;/a&gt; in battle, thus ensuring the latter's death, Gurthan revealed that he had become aware of the plot. As such, when Hixen tried to plead his case, the Warlord did not hesitate to order his &lt;a href=\"quilen\"&gt;quilen&lt;/a&gt; to kill his former adviser.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Fulmin\"&gt;Fulmin&lt;/a&gt; suggested using a relic in their possession to beat back the swarm and invade mantid lands, as the huatang was meant to do, an unconvinced Gurthan remarked that the relic was not a weapon. However, Fulmin was able to convince the Warlord to let him use the relic in battle, though Gurthan warned Fulmin that he was risking his life with the unstable relic. With the relic successfully cutting off the Empress' connection to the rest of the Mantid, Gurthan was noted to have smiled at the panic and pain shown by the mantid swarm.\nFulmin, once again, came to his master and showed him a way to house the Queen's remains after conquering the mantid. However, Gurthan was surprised to learn Fulmin had devised that through an arcane spell, the Mogu could trap the Mantid queen's spirit in an urn, which could then be called forth to show the other Mogu tribes Gurthan's success against the Mantid. A pleased Gurthan remarked that Fulmin would receive more responsibilities in the future and then ordered him to teach him the spell, as he intended to crush the mantid that day.\nWhen the Mantid Empress was moved, as part of a plan by &lt;a href=\"The%20Klaxxi\"&gt;The Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, Gurthan ordered his warriors to attack the mantid while he guarded the relic. As the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27ruk%20the%20Wind-Reaver\"&gt;Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver&lt;/a&gt; decimated the Mogu that remained, the Warlord ordered Fulmin to leave and safeguard the artifact in order to keep the mantid swarm docile. With his guards dead and &lt;a href=\"Ninil%27ko%20the%20Bloodcaller\"&gt;Ninil'ko the Bloodcaller&lt;/a&gt; and the Wind-Reaver before him, Gurthan decided to use the spell Fulmin taught him on himself to ensure that the mantid could not kill him. With his spirit forever trapped in the urn, if ever damaged he would merely return to the urn instead of being destroyed."}

In order to defend the Steamvault, Kalithresh relied on a number of potent mixtures. His seat of power was lined by a series of tubes containing rare liquids, which could be used to augment his already significant strength. Ultimately, however, his power was of no avail, since he was killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s associated with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Deep within the Steamvault, the naga have begun experimenting with a mysterious substance to strengthen their warriors and purge them of fear. Kalithresh was one of Lady Vashj's first servants to volunteer as a test subject for this dark elixir. As reward, he has been charged with guarding the expansive Steamvault and ensuring the region's arcane machinery operates without interruption.\"\nStrategy.\nAs the last boss of the max-level Coilfang wing, Kalithresh is an appropriately difficult and time-consuming fight; a &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; with a twist. Around 600 DPS per DPS class is a good number; assuming three DPS and a tank, this will end up with a combined group DPS output of around 2.2k, which will destroy the containers in a little under five seconds.\nHe is fought in a room lined with containers called Naga Distillers, full of some unknown substance. The party must keep up steady DPS on him, as he has a fairly large amount of health, and he periodically reflects magic. His only other ability of note at this point is a randomly targeted Impale, which does 500 damage every 3 seconds. If he retargets someone before their Impale wears off, it will stack and refresh the duration, so healers must be paying attention.\nEvery so often he shouts and begins to channel a spell to the closest Naga Distiller near him. At this point, the container becomes targetable, and the party must attack it. Note that the Warlord continues attacking while channeling, so the tank will still be taking damage. However, if he is not enraged his damage on any average geared tank will be negligible, so it's recommended everyone in the party moves DPS to the Naga Distiller, including the healer. It is imperative that the container be destroyed before he finishes channeling (10 seconds). If he manages to get the spell off, he enrages, increasing his attack speed by 75% and his damage by 70%. This ability will stack if more containers are not destroyed. Since they are only targetable while he's channeling, there's a certain urgency to this fight. As he will use this technique on the container close to him, a good technique to killing the containers quickly is if the tank places the boss next to each container. That way you maximize the time you have the whole group attacking the container. Just make sure you have someone healing the tank. As long as the party manages to kill each container before Kalithresh powers up from it, he will remain under control and easily handled. The Naga Distillers have about 10,000 hitpoints each, so its best to have all DPS and the tank switch to containers when it becomes available. If everyone is on it quickly, it only takes a few seconds to kill, so you shouldn't lose aggro. Then pull him to the next closest container, so you know which one he will target next. Rinse/repeat till he's dead.\nDagger rogues: because DPS on the Distillers is probably the single most important aspect of this fight, and the time spent running around the tanks to try to find the \"back\" can mean the difference between an enrage and a broken Distiller, dagger rogues should rotate their camera so they can see the top of the container: a star indicates the \"front\" of the tank, so standing on the opposite side will enable dagger rogues to backstab and maximize their damage.\nRogues and feral druids should save their energy for a container when the timing for a container is near.\nIf you notice that your party doesn't break the containers fast enough, you can use this macro. It will mark the container with the Skull raid icon and send a Raid Warning to the party.\ncodice_1\nHow to tank the boss.\nThere are two common methods on how to tank the boss.\n1) Choose which container to tank the boss near. Tank him near there. Make sure that container is the closest to the boss but also be far enough away that it will take him time to get there. This works best when you have more melee dps than ranged dps as the melee dps will not have to run as far.\n2) Fight the boss in the center of the face on the floor right around where the mouth is open. Doing this situates him equidistant to all the containers and works best when you have more ranged than melee dps. The normal order which he typically follows for the containers is back left, front left, back right, front right when you are facing the boss before the fight. \nFacts about the containers:\nThe channeling will not begin until the boss gets to the container yet the container is targetable when the bosses chooses it. No matter what, the dps stop what you are doing to attack the container. Each of the tanks has 10000\u00a0hp in normal mode.\nAs a variant, once you have 2 or 3 containers in the same area destroyed, tank him there and use some method of slowing his movement, such as a hunter trap. When he goes for the next container, which will be further away at this point, you'll have an extra 2\u20133 seconds to destroy the container. During this time the tank should intercept the container and all DPS switch target. Mostly this technique works best for groups with ranged DPS. The more containers you destroy, the further he has to go to get to the next one, and the more time you gain from the trap-kite.\nHeroic.\nThis fight in heroic is more or less the same, except that he hits harder, has substantially more hitpoints and each of the Naga Distillers has 14000\u00a0hp (a 40% increase from normal mode)\nAt Level 80+.\nAt level 80 (and higher), Kalithresh (and the instance as a whole) can be soloed. With good gear and DPS, you will not need to break the containers, and can probably burn Kalithresh down before be finishes channeling the first. Even if he does enrage, basic healing (or potions) can save you long enough to finish him off.\nSpeculation.\nIt is speculated that the mysterious liquid might have been a weapon Vashj's Naga were developing to increase their martial prowess."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he sought to fulfill the pact the Zandalari had made with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; long ago, but was put down by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nShadows of the Horde.\nFollowing the rebirth of the Thunder King, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Zandalari to begin the process of resurrecting his warlords. Despite interference from &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his allies, the Zandalari were able to resurrect Warlord Kao after sacrificing two &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Dao\"&gt;Brother Dao&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Shan\"&gt;Brother Shan&lt;/a&gt;. Once resurrected, Vol'jin noticed that despite his resurrection at their hands the mogu warlord viewed the Zandalari with contempt. Furthermore, only &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; anticipating Kao's fury at the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; presence and Vol'jin's quick action saved the lives of &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Cuo\"&gt;Brother Cuo&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing he was unable to do anything at this time, Kao took no action, but Vol'jin upon seeing the fury in warlord's eyes knew that Kao would not forget nor forgive either Vol'jin or &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; for their part in this.\nUpon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and rejoining his master, Kao sought out Vol'jin upon which Kao expressed his belief that only a fool would oppose the Thunder King. Kao went on to say that his master decreed that the warlord could slay as many pandaren as he desired; Vol'jin's companions included. Upon Vol'jin's departure from the Isle of Thunder, Kao remarked that Vol'jin could never have been trusted for being in league with the &lt;a href=\"Shado-pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt; and was unimpressed and shocked when &lt;a href=\"Vilnak%27dor\"&gt;Vilnak'dor&lt;/a&gt; appointed Khal'ak to lead Zandalari against the Shado pan and their allies. However after seeing Khal'lak in action, Kao was more willing to let her and remarked that he would lend his two bodyguards - &lt;a href=\"Chae-nan\"&gt;Chae-nan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deng-Tai\"&gt;Deng-Tai&lt;/a&gt; - to assist. Though agreeing that Khal'ak would be a good choice, Vilnak'dor was quick to point out to Khal'ak that Kao saw her as an enemy and would poison the Thunder King against her.\nDespite Warlord Kao being one of the Thunder King's generals, he was nowhere to be found on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; when the Alliance and Horde assaulted it.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Warlord Kao arrived to &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to claim land he believed was the mogu's by right after &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; promised the mogu a new empire. Kao, Vilnak'dor, and the &lt;a href=\"Kao-Tien\"&gt;Kao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; mogu attacked the Zandalari and Kao was slain by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. After his death, Vilnak'dor revealed to the Zandalari that Kao's attack was only a distraction to keep them away from &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; as Zul began a coup."}

A staunch follower of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, she fought at his side during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. When Garrosh was overthrown, Zaela joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; with him, and now leads the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; expedition within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nTwilight Highlands.\nZaela is first introduced alongside &lt;a href=\"Gregor\"&gt;Gregor&lt;/a&gt;, chastising him for his reluctance to aid &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet out of his fear of the current Dragonmaw &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, none other than &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Horde's failed negotiations with the tyrannical Mor'ghor, Zaela finds and releases the player from their captivity, returning their confiscated gear.\nZaela is highly worried about the future of the Dragonmaw under the corrupted Mor'ghor, citing him as a traitor to his own blood, and that he and his &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s would bring about the destruction of the clan. She sends the player back to the Horde fleet, bargaining that if Mor'ghor is deposed, she and the true Dragonmaw would be the Horde's allies forevermore.\nThe Horde forces lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt; from the shore, and the Dragonmaw themselves take up arms against the fel orcs with supplies sent by the Horde fleet. The fight is taken directly to Mor'ghor, and with the help of the Horde, he is disposed of. Zaela announces that a new Dragonmaw dawns with his death. Meanwhile, the Horde and the Dragonmaw route out the remaining fel orcs, and Garrosh himself returns to meet Zaela.\nIn the wake of Mor'ghor's death, Zaela is named leader of the Dragonmaw, and welcomed into the Horde by Garrosh.\nDespite the Dragonmaw taking up arms with the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Narkrall%20Rakeclaw\"&gt;Narkrall Rakeclaw&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Bloodgulch\"&gt;Bloodgulch&lt;/a&gt; is less than pleased with his new allies. Taking the \"Demon Chain\", an item used to project will upon sentient beings (in particular, &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s) and his own subdued black drake, &lt;a href=\"Torth\"&gt;Torth&lt;/a&gt;, Narkrall leaves to annihilate the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; outpost of &lt;a href=\"Thundermar\"&gt;Thundermar&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to gain support from the clan- against Zaela. Narkrall is left for dead in the process, having not anticipated the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; backing the Wildhammer, and the chain is returned to Zaela. Torth, however, survived the encounter, and fled the scene free from the chain's influence.\nNow free from his enthrallment, Torth sets his sights on revenge against the Dragonmaw. Zaela is able to subdue him outside &lt;a href=\"The%20Gullet\"&gt;The Gullet&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to put him under the chain's influence once more. Unwilling to serve, Zaela concludes that he must die.\nZaela later relocates to &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt;, joined by a Horde liason named &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cozwynn\"&gt;Lady Cozwynn&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. She has gained the title of Warlord, and assists &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; alongside Cozwynn during the showdown with &lt;a href=\"Skullcrusher%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Skullcrusher the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nZaela and Garrosh developed a strong bond during the conflict.\nEscalation.\nZaela was summoned by Garrosh to help put down the burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;; she was found at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; projecting her will onto an enslaved proto-drake. agents were sent to spy on her and overheard her converse with a nearby &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;; she expressed disdain for the trolls' rebellion, and maintained hope that Garrosh would move against them soon. She was surrounded by corpses of executed trolls.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nZaela, a member of the True Horde, oversaw the defense of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;'s shores during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; atop her fearsome drake, &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt;. She faced off against the naval forces led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. After Galakras was shot down from the sky, Zaela was launched from him. Upon hitting the ground, however, she threw down a smoke pellet and vanished, evading adventurers for a time.\nWar Crimes.\nZaela, having survived the Siege of Orgrimmar, flees to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; with what remains of the Dragonmaw clan. A message from &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;a dragon&lt;/a&gt; sends her gathering up other loyalists to the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;. She also attacked &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt;, freed &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;, and recruited pirates.\nZaela and the Dragonmaw ally with the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and attack the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, causing a distraction long enough for Kairoz to free Garrosh and escape with him. After she was sure the two made it, she called for retreat.\nThe Iron Tide.\nAt some point, she lost an eye. As Garrosh's only ally on Azeroth, Zaela is located in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; guarding the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Tharbek\"&gt;Commander Tharbek&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion force of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. There she owns a &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;. They later moved to Upper Blackrock Spire and claimed it as their main base of operations. The adventurers of the Horde and Alliance invaded the place and she commanded Tharbek to finish them off while she went to finish her \"weapon\".\nWarlords of Draenor.\nLater, she is encountered as the final boss of revamped &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Tharbek and the proto-dragon with whom she had forged a close bond, &lt;a href=\"Ragewing%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Ragewing the Untamed&lt;/a&gt;. Zaela was one of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde's&lt;/a&gt; most ardent followers. Despite her zeal, however, she was still slain by adventurers in the midst of a plot, utilizing a doomsday weapon, to induce the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and destroy &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Echo of Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; is faced at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to attune a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to .\nPersonality.\nZaela's personality would appear to be rather contradictory. In \"Cataclysm\", Zaela appeared to be accepting of other races. Zaela admired Garrosh for leading a diverse group of people, worked closely with the Forsaken, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cozwynn\"&gt;Lady Cozwynn&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; Garona, and frequently stood up for the Horde player against the more extreme members of the Clan. Zaela was portrayed as rather cautious in this portrayal, not approving of foolhardy attacks on the Alliance, and wanting to focus on the Twilight's Hammer. \nLater on Zaela was portrayed as far more brash - undertaking risky military attacks - as well having a condescending attitude towards the other races of the Horde, believing the Horde should be comprised of only orcs. This is assumed to be due to Garrosh's influence.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nGossip.\nThis stronghold is fortified, but our enemies close in from all sides.

Now, as she readies a doomsday weapon in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, her moment of vengeance draws near.\"\nOverview.\nZaela begins by engaging players on foot, but once sufficiently injured will retreat to a flying proto-drake for a time. For the remainder of the fight, the party must deal with Zaela and swooping flame breath attacks from her drakes.\nStrategy.\nThe encounter begins with a basic phase 1. Zaela's Destructive Smite hits the tank hard. Her Black Iron Cyclone will cause her to fixiate on a random non-tank party member while &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt;-ing. Simply stay spread out and be ready to move. \nPhase 2 begins at half-health and has Zaela temporarily hop on her proto-drake while adds attack the party. During this phase, proto-drakes will begin breathing fire on the platform in straight lines. When Zaela comes back, it will be a challenge to move away from both the drake's fire breath and her Black Iron Cyclone, particularly on heroic when the drakes change locations faster. Speed increasing or transportation effects like &lt;a href=\"Body%20and%20Soul\"&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Walk\"&gt;Spirit Walk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; are highly valuable.

Millennia have passed, but the warlord still serves the chaotic might of the Old God N'Zoth. Deathwing has now unleashed this legendary faceless one to crush the defenders of Wyrmrest Temple.\"\nAbilities.\nWarlord Zon'ozz will enrage after 6 minutes of being engaged, except when under the Raid Finder difficulty.\n In Heroic Difficulty, the awakening of the Maw of Go'rath causes many different types of tentacles to emerge and attack the players.\nStrategy.\nSeparate into one squad of melee and one squad of ranged. These two squads will be responsible for preventing the Void of the Unmaking from hitting the walls (or the boss prematurely).\nPhase 1.\nAt the pull, the tank should face the boss toward ranged DPS. The boss will spawn the Void of the Unmaking in front, so facing him towards ranged causes it to spawn near ranged. Immediately after this happens, the tank should rotate the boss to face him away from the raid, because a Psychic Drain will soon blast any players (hopefully just the tank) in a cone in front of the boss.\nDisrupting Shadows should always be dispelled, but carefully. The victim must have enough health to survive the 60000 damage, and any other raid damage going on. The knockback caused by the dispel could throw players into the Void at an inopportune time.\nWhile the Void is active, the raid should strive to make it bounce between ranged and melee. The Void should always be bounced by a team, since the damage is divided among nearby players, making the healing much less desperate. The more times it bounces, the more damage it does each time it collides with a player. When the collision damage is high enough to make the healers anxious, the tank should kite the boss into the path and melee should get out of the way and let the void strike the boss.\nThe Psychic Drain starts out as a moderately dangerous, but survivable, attack. As the boss stacks Focused Anger the Psychic Drain becomes more and more damaging until it can one-shot the tank. To cope with this, the tank must use a defensive cooldown in anticipation of the blast. Most squads trigger a black phase after the second Psychic Drain and before the third, so the tank should be ready to activate some cooldown before the second Psychic Drain at approximately 2 minute intervals.\nPhase 2.\nWhen the Void collides with Zon'ozz, the boss loses his stacks of Focused Anger, and suffers a debuff which increases the damage he suffers from player attacks. Unfortunately, it also activates a variety of tentacles which attack the raid.\nThe raid should pile up to do AoE heals while the multitude of tentacles zap the raid. It common for each black phase to be mitigated by using one healer's cooldown. Druids use &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; ; Priests use &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Hymn\"&gt;Divine Hymn&lt;/a&gt; ; Paladins use &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Mastery\"&gt;Aura Mastery&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; ; Shaman use &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Link%20Totem\"&gt;Spirit Link Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\n30 seconds after Zon'ozz is struck by the Void the battle will return to phase 1. Zon'ozz will generate another Void, so the tank should face him toward ranged DPS in anticipation. Once the void is spawned, point the boss away from raid to minimize the damage from Psychic Drain.\nRepeat until the boss dies.\nHeroic.\nThe only major difference in Phase 1 is that when Disrupting Shadows is dispelled, the dispel effect (shadow damage and knockback) will not only happen to the targeted player, but to all players within 10 yards of the targeted player. Disrupting Shadows can therefore only be safely dispelled if the player is far away from other raid members; often, this will not be able to safely happen, and healers will simply have to heal through it.\nPhase 2 is significantly changed. The tentacles which attack the raid become attackable; additionally, the Black Blood of Go'rath debuff deals damage based on stacks, which are only reduced when a tentacle is destroyed. Killing the tentacles therefore becomes a high priority for the raid.\nThe following table details the tentacle spawns:\nThe tank will need to need to move to the Claw, as it does massive raid-wide damage if not tanked. In 25-player mode, a plate wearer or feral druid in bear form should handle the second Claw -- it does not melee hard, so these players should be able to survive it.\nMelee should burn the Flails down, as they spawn close to Zon'ozz and the Claw. Once the Flails are down, they should move to the Claw. Classes that can cleave or perform splash damage are at an advantage as they can spread damage to Zon'ozz (who would have followed the tank to the Claw).\nThe Eyes spawn on the edges of the room, and these are best handled by ranged to reduce travel times and allow more effective group healing. Shadow Gaze can be interrupted, but there is no cast bar for it, which makes interrupting difficult. In 25-player mode, ranged should also kill the second Claw.\nIf any tentacles are still alive when Phase 2 ends, ranged should quickly finish them off while melee focuses on Zon'ozz.\nIf the raid ends up taking the fight to a fourth Phase 2, they should ignore all tentacles and blow all cooldowns to bring Zon'ozz down before the enrage timer runs out.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The generations of warfare on Azeroth have given warmages time to hone useful spells into simple and secret rituals, called \"battlemagics\", which are passed from warmage to another. Warmages are proficient with all simple melee and ranged weapons, and light armor. They can wield a sword in one hand, and a staff in the other. Armor of any type interferes with the warmage's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). As warmages accompany warriors into battle, they become better at defending themselves than other &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s. They develop greater martial skill in the crucible of battle."}

At the start of the battle for Alterac Valley, Drek'Thar is protected by four Warmasters, one for each of the Horde Towers; each is named for his Tower, rather than given a personal name. The exceptions to these are &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Laggrond\"&gt;Warmaster Laggrond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Garrick\"&gt;Warmaster Garrick&lt;/a&gt;.\nTied to their general, Warmasters cannot be pulled separately from Drek'Thar. The only way to deprive the Frostwolf General of his protectors is to destroy the Towers before assaulting Frostwolf Keep. As each Tower is destroyed, the associated Warmaster is removed from the Valley.\nEach Tower must be protected carefully if the Frostwolf wish to keep their Warmasters, as there is no way to gain more. Furthermore, each Warmaster - and thus each Tower - represents 75 &lt;a href=\"Reinforcements\"&gt;Reinforcements&lt;/a&gt;, a full 12.5% of the initial Frostwolf army. Losing all four Warmasters and Towers means losing half of the Frostwolf Reinforcements. Still, losing Towers may be considered acceptable losses if other objectives are archived in the meantime.\nEach Warmaster is an elite of the level cap for the Valley - level 60 for 51~60 AV, level 70 for 61~70 AV - and uses &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Level 60 Warmasters vary greatly on health, ranging from 27,000 to 60,000; but the level 70 versions all have 140,000 health. Each generally requires his own tank and healer, so it is often advisable to destroy as many Towers as possible before beginning the encounter.\nPatch 2.3 changes.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;2.3&lt;/a&gt;, Warmasters and their counterparts, the Stormpike &lt;a href=\"Marshal\"&gt;Marshal&lt;/a&gt;s, could be pulled separately from their Generals. Additionally, the destruction of an Alliance Bunker would not only despawn a Marshal but also spawn an extra Warmaster - and vice versa.

Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight's Hammer's army: the elite drake riders of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s personal escort. Led by the insidious Warmaster Blackhorn, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Dragonriders, Attack!\nFlying alongside the Skyfire and surveying the scene while his massive twilight drake lobs balls of destruction at the gunship, Warmaster Blackhorn gives the order for his elite dragonriders to swoop into battle.\nStage Two: Looks Like I'm Doing This Myself.\nOnce the Skyfire's defenders defeat three waves of dragonriders, Warmaster Blackhorn leaps down onto the deck of the gunship.\nStrategy.\nWarmaster Blackhorn is a two phase encounter, the first phase has the raid deal with three different types of adds, while the second phase has the raid deal with the Warmaster himself. This raid encounter is very similar to the Gunship Encounter in Icecrown Citadel (Which earned both of them the nickname, Lootship).\nPhase 1.\nThe first phase of the encounter is about controlling adds and managing raid damage.\nThe first type of adds are the Twilight Elites (the and ); these adds need to be picked up by the tanks. Melee will primarily focus on bringing these adds down, while classes with DoT capabilities should apply them. There are three waves of elites that spawn on a set timer, and the raid should aim to have both elites dead before the next two spawn.\nThe elites apply stacking debuffs on their tanks; to clear these, tanks should alternate which elites they take each wave (i.e. one tank will do Dreadblade-Slayer-Dreadblade, with the second tank doing Slayer-Dreadblade-Slayer). The Dreadblade cleaves while applying its debuff, so the tank on the Dreadblade should take care that the Dreadblade is faced away from the raid. For this reason, the Dreadblade should be killed before the Slayer.\nPeriodically, the elites will perform Blade Rush, charging towards a random player and performing 100,000 physical damage to anyone within the path. The path is clearly marked with a visual effect, so players should move out of it as soon as they see it.\nThe second type of adds are the s -- each wave, two will spawn, drop the aforementioned Twilight Elites on the deck, then circle the boat. The drakes will periodically fire Twilight Barrage at the ship, causing a non-negligible amount of shadow damage to it. If any players are standing within the Twilight Barrage zone, the shadow damage will be split amongst those players instead. For this reason, at least two players should soak each Twilight Barrage, although a single player with high enough health can solo-soak it. A common strategy is to demarcate the boat into four quadrants and assign players to soak all Twilight Barrages within their quadrant.\nThe NPCs on the boat will periodically harpoon a drake and reel it in. When this happens, ranged must immediately switch to the drake and kill it before it breaks free and returns to circling the boat. Killing a drake reduces the frequency of Twilight Barrage, and all drakes need to be killed to push the fight into Phase 2. Note that the drakes are unable to break free in LFR difficulty.\nThe final type of add, not present in LFR difficulty, is the . These are dropped on to the deck on a set timer. When they are dropped off, they will turn invisible, then reappear a few seconds later while making a line straight for the ship's bridge. The sapper must be killed before it reaches the bridge, otherwise it will kamikaze-style detonate its explosives and take off 20% of the ship's health (and potentially taking out any players in the immediate vicinity). The Sappers can be stunned, slowed, and Death Gripped by death knights to prevent them from reaching the bridge.\nWhile all of this is happening, will fly above the boat and periodically cast Twilight Onslaught, which is effectively a larger and harder-hitting variant of Twilight Barrage. The vast majority (if not all) of the raid members will need to stack in the Twilight Onslaught zone when it is cast, to split the massive damage amongst as many players as possible (thus making it healable) and to protect the ship from taking too much damage. Unless the raid is going for , Twilight Onslaught must be prioritised over Twilight Barrage if both occur at the same time.\nOn heroic difficulty, Twilight Barrage will place a 15 second debuff on soakers increasing shadow damage taken by 50%; soakers should co-ordinate amongst themselves so that they do not soak a Twilight Barrage while they have the debuff on them. Additionally, parts of the deck will be periodically covered with fire which will, after a while, be extinguished by NPCs; this mechanic serves as a rather severe positioning constraint.\nPhase 2.\nThe second phase of the encounter starts when all the Twilight Assault Drakes have been killed, and is essentially &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;. Any surviving Elites from Phase 1 should be killed immediately when Phase 2 begins.\n will swoop down, drop Blackhorn on to the ship, then continue to harass the raid from above. One tank should immediately pick Blackhorn up and face him away from the raid. Melee will work on Blackhorn, while ranged will deal with Goriona.\nGoriona will cast Twilight Flames on the deck and, like all fire, this should not be stood in. Once Goriona's health reaches 20%, she will abandon Blackhorn and leave the encounter, freeing up ranged to assist on Blackhorn (and stopping the Twilight Flames casts).\nBlackhorn has two main abilities. The first, Disrupting Roar, will do AoE damage to the entire raid, and also interrupt and silence for 8 seconds any casters within 10 yards; ranged should always stand at least 10 years away from Blackhorn. The second ability, Shockwave, will be cast in the direction of a random player, and will do around 100,000 damage to players within his 80 yard AoE cone and stun them for 4 seconds. Shockwave is entirely avoidable, so the raid must be alert for Shockwave casts and be prepared to move out of his AoE cone.\nAdditionally, Blackhorn applies a Sunder Armor debuff to his current tank. The off-tank should taunt the boss when the main tank receives two stacks; thereafter, the tanks should switch whenever the non-active tank's stacks fall off.\nFinally, Blackhorn has the Vengeance ability, which causes him to deal 1% increased damage for each 1% health taken off him, and effectively acts as a soft enrage (in addition to the 4 minute hard enrage on Phase 2). The raid should co-ordinate defensive cooldowns as Phase 2 progresses, and also pay close attention to Shockwave casts, as Vengeance can cause Shockwave to one-shot raid members towards the end of the encounter.\nOn heroic difficulty, Goriona will land on the deck when she reaches 80% health, and will need to be picked up by the non-active tank. All DPS must immediately switch to Goriona, as Blackhorn's Siphon Vitality ability places a severe penalty on damaging Blackhorn while Goriona is still active.

However, a powerful &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Cho%27war%20the%20Pillager\"&gt;Cho'war&lt;/a&gt; gathered a large group of ogres and rebelled against the gronn. They were, in the end, successful and drove the gronn out of the hill. Cho'war took leadership of the fractured ogre clans left behind by the gronns' overthrowing, and thus, the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; were born. The only tribe not under the banner of Warmaul in Nagrand is the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt;, who constantly fight the Warmaul over territory.\nDenizens and Quests.\nWarmaul Hill is populated by numerous &lt;a href=\"Warmaul%20Brute\"&gt;Warmaul Brute&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warmaul%20Warlock\"&gt;Warmaul Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter generally with &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; minions. The quest &lt;a href=\"War%20on%20the%20Warmaul\"&gt;War on the Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; requires you to dispatch 15 of each. A number of captive &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; orcs are held in individual cages scattered around the hill - their freedom is the objective of &lt;a href=\"Finding%20the%20Survivors\"&gt;Finding the Survivors&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27war%20the%20Pillager%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Cho'war the Pillager (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; requires you (and allies) to slay the big man himself.\nNotes.\nTwo elite &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Gronn\"&gt;Mountain Gronn&lt;/a&gt; patrol the path up to Warmaul Hill, occasionally pummeling ogres whose patrol paths enter their aggro radius. It is best to pull these separately from other mobs given their higher health (14,912) and greater damage. An amusing tactic if you are playing a class with the ability to leave combat, such as the rogue's &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; or hunter's &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, is to do a running pull of three or four nearby ogres, engage one of the mountain gronn and then leave combat, and watch as the gronn turns on and makes short work of the ogres. If you time it correctly, you can then reopen on the (probably heavily wounded) gronn just as it kills the final ogre and before it resets to full health."}

The podcast has a large fanbase that actively contributes emails and phone calls that are used during the show. \n\"The Instance\" first aired on January 7th, 2006 with hosts Scott Johnson and Andrew Konietzky from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//cranialjacksandconverse.blogspot.com/\"&gt;Cranial Jacks &amp; Converse&lt;/a&gt;, and has been running on a regular weekly schedule (personal circumstances of the hosts permitting). Randydeluxe was added as a third host in December 2006. Andrew left the show in May 2007. \nScott and Randy continued hosting the instance together until February 12, 2011 (Ep. #217), which was Randy's last episode because he got a job at Blizzard. \nIn 2008, \"The Instance\" won the Bloggers Choice Award for Best Podcast and The Podcast Awards Best Gaming Podcast, beating out nine other finalists, none of which were World Of Warcraft-related.\nIn 2011, \"The Instance\" won a Stopie for Best News Coverage among all other World of Warcraft Podcasts. \nIn addition to the podcast, \"The Instance\" is also broadcast live on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.theinstance.net/live\"&gt;The Instance uStream page&lt;/a&gt; when it is being recorded.\nShow Sections.\n\"The Instance\" is divided into different sections. They are typically in the same order:\nBig News of the Week.\nThis covers breaking news related to WoW, Blizzard or the MMORPG game space.\nRumors and Scuttlebutt.\nScott and Randy talk about WoW-related, and sometimes completely unrelated rumors, predictions and analysis.\nTown Cryer.\nThe hosts refer to their e-mail and answering machine to play phone calls, read e-mails and ask one another series of \"Quickfire Questions\".\nDrop of the Week.\nAn external site, movie, WoW-related product or addons is highlighted.\nThe main body of the show is followed by an exit segment comprised of calls, recordings, comedy bits and songs that the hosts receive each week.\nRegular Contributors and Topics.\nThe podcast features regular contributors who add information and entertainment to the show.\nCurt Schilling (Retired).\nMr. Schilling has made regular appearances on \"The Instance\" since his interview in episode #102 - \u201cThe Curt Schilling Episode\u201d. As an unofficial \"third-chair\", Mr. Schilling contributes to the topics of discussion drawing from his personal experience as a WoW and EQ gamer, and a MMO developer.\nPatrick from France (Retired).\nPatrick Beja's regular segment is called the \"Mod Tip of the Week\" and usually consists of a description of an &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;AddOn&lt;/a&gt;, including who the mod is useful for, why Patrick likes it and where you can find the mod. All of Patrick's mods are listed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//theinstance.net/patricks-mods-of-the-week/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (usually updated after the show).\nAt Blizzcon in 2007, 2008, and 2009, Patrick met up with \"The Instance\" listeners. At Blizzcon in 2008, Patrick was joined by Randy in interviewing such Blizzard luminaries as &lt;a href=\"%20Michael_Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeff_Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russell_Brower\"&gt;Russell Brower&lt;/a&gt;. Randy regularly jokes that the show has since had a \"special relationship\" with Russell Brower, making it difficult for Mr. Brower to appear on the show, unless Scott can come up with something non-WoW-related to talk about.\nPatrick has also appeared on several episodes as \"third-chair\", and done standalone interviews for the show.\nPatrick announced on the Instance 160 &lt;a href=\"http%3A//theinstance.net/2009/08/the-instance-160-blizzcon-day-two/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that he is leaving do to acquiring a job with Blizzard, and thus didn't want to create a conflict of interest.\nShawn Basic (Retired).\nShawn \"Shawn Basic\" Coons provided submissions for &lt;a href=\"newbie\"&gt;newbie&lt;/a&gt;s featured in many episodes during 2006-2007, which captured basic information and tips for lower level and casual players of the game. Shawn left the show after Episode 56, returning to guest host Episodes 70 and 100.\nMean Gene (Retired).\n\"Mean\" Gene Marques offers the PvP Tip Of The Week, almost always listened to by the hosts just before Town Cryer (along with Patrick's Mod Of The Week). Tips include (but are not limited to) &lt;a href=\"Twink\"&gt;Twink&lt;/a&gt;ing, speccing for PvP, or how to conduct yourself in Battlegrounds and World PvP.\nHe has also made guest hosting appearances on Episode #100 on Episode #111.\nIn 2009, \"Mean\" Gene announced that he was retiring from &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; and this from his segment on WoW. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forum.myextralife.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D24043%26amp%3Bhighlight%3DRetirement\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Scott announced that they'll just continue on with this show in the middle, which usually would have been taken up by \"Mean\" Gene and Patrick Beja\nIn 2012, Mean Gene restarted the defunct PvP Tip of the Week segment independently providing tips for Star Wars: The Old Republic on his blog. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//meangeneproject.com/%3Fp%3D258\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nDarrell the Tip Giver.\nStarting in late 2007, Darrell's submission to \"The Instance\" was the Tip Givers' Tip of the Week (TGTOTW), a comedy spot that was the first bit played after the hosts sign-off. Originally a tongue-in-cheek series of suggestions for all those wishing to submit tips to the show, TGTOTW grew to become many listeners' favorite part of the show, with both comedy and advice for anyone aspiring to create tips, or do a podcast of their own.\nDarrell the Tip Giver has also done a mash up of clips from the previous episode to form something that often has a completely different meaning than what was said in the episode. This first started in episode 137 and continued through 182 when the birth of his daughter greatly diminished his editing time. All mashups done after 182 were done by other contributors.\nBuxley.\nSteve Pietrowicz has been contributing as the character \"Buxley\" in the \"Ask Buxley\" comedy segment since Episode #116. Buxley explains things that happen in the World of Warcraft universe according to his own view of the world, which has very little to do with what's really going on. It does make sense to him though. Buxley is a level 80 Tauren Shaman and is a proud member of Alea Iacta Est.\nAlea Iacta Est (Retired).\nA regular returning item that usually appears in Rumors and Scuttlebutt (but not exclusively) is news or updates concerning the on the US-Earthen Ring server. Alea Iacta Est was formed as a companion guild to \"The Instance\" and Extralife Radio and was announced on February 13th, 2007. \nThe phrase \"Alea Iacta Est\" means \"the die has been cast\", and is in reference to what Caesar supposedly said as he crossed the Rubicon in northern Italy in 49 B.C. A more detailed discussion can be found &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alea_iacta_est\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most prominent mention of AIE on \"The Instance\" was on episode 74b: \"Rest In Peace, Bruce Galloway\" in which AIE members and Instance listeners made a special tribute to AIE member Bruce Galloway (aka Milliway) who passed away on August 2nd, 2007."}

Bruor's men have captured and trained a number of adult jormungar. Take control of one using the orbs along the northern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Snowdrift%20Plains\"&gt;Snowdrift Plains&lt;/a&gt;, then search the plains for the colossus and use your jormungar's acid breath against it. \nProgress.\nHave you defeated the iron colossus and spared the refuge from destruction?\nCompletion.\nWe've done it, we've really done it!

We must warn &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; gets it in his mind to rebuild his forces. The only way to secure the victory you have won today is to go to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and defeat Loken for all time!\nNotes.\nThis quest triggers &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Snowdrift%20Plains\"&gt;Snowdrift Plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Narvir%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;Narvir's Cradle&lt;/a&gt; areas. The usual mobs are removed from both areas. The Colossus is removed from the scaffolding and wanders through the Plains area, and past the Cradle area.\nAll along the northern edge of the Snowdrift Plains are &lt;a href=\"Jormungar%20Control%20Orb\"&gt;Jormungar Control Orb&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tamed%20Jormungar\"&gt;Tamed Jormungar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Jormungar%20Handler\"&gt;Earthen Jormungar Handler&lt;/a&gt;s. Use the orb to mount the jormungar.\nAbilities while emerged:\nWhile submerged, the jormungar is capable of moving through the snow, but cannot attack. Hit 1 to emerge from the ground, rooted. You can start moving the moment you hit submerge, even though the animation hasn't finished going.\nSubmerge, then find the colossus. It has ~330,000 HP, while the jormungar has 50,000. Emerge inside the hitbox so the acid spew will hit and the DoT will tick. Fastest way to kill the colossus is to hit 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, repeat.\nThe colossus casts a ground slam, which does 15,000 damage in front of the colossus. The cast time is ten seconds, so if he starts to cast it, submerge and either get out of range (which isn't too far) or get behind him.\nIf you pull him too far from his route he evades.\nHe will start to attack you while you are submerged when you enter his melee range.\nWhen the jormungar submerges or emerges, it seems to like to change direction so be wary when trying to run through the Colossus to avoid ground slam. Holding down right-mouse helps."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20King\"&gt;Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; learned of this, he went to the Jade Warlord and told him of a hidden cache of artifacts he found that granted untold power, and demonstrated the truth of his words by showing the incredible feats he could do using &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion&lt;/a&gt;. The Monkey King had done this many times before with other would-be conquerors, and would subsequently lead them to their deaths--such as by walking off a cliff, or into a &lt;a href=\"Shado-pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt; ambush. This time, however, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; he led the Jade Warlord into turned out to contain an ancient store of the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s knowledge that would grant terrible power to the mogu. Realizing his mistake, the Monkey King battled the Jade Warlord until one of the mogu's errant spells froze them both in jade. Though they could not move, they could still speak to each other. The &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; believed this to be a fate worse than death for the Jade Warlord.\nTen thousand years later, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; learned of the Monkey King's resting place as well as an incantation to release him from his imprisonment.

This quest chain serves both to entice characters to explore the &lt;a href=\"plaguelands\"&gt;plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; zones and to reward diligence with access to further adventure.\nThe ultimate reward of this quest is the , which unlocks the door to Scholomance without resort to &lt;a href=\"lockpicking\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; methods.\nThe Key to Scholomance.\nA Call to Arms.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have sent out heralds (or their equivalents) to all the major cities, asking for help for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"scourge\"&gt;scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nProving your mettle.\nBoth Commander Valorfist and High Executor Derrington need to weaken the Scourge forces before beginning an assault against the scourge in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. They have different plans, though...\nCommander Valorfist intends to send forces up the east road into the ruins of Andorhal. But doing that requires pushing the scourge back, winnowing their forces in &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;. That's where you come in. You are directed out to Sorrow Hill, to slay a number of both the flayers and the ghouls.\nHigh executor Derrington, on the other hand, has the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; on hand as both an obstacle and an opportunity. Rather than face a two-front war, he wants you to burn down the command tent of the Scarlet Crusade encampment between &lt;a href=\"Felstone%20Field\"&gt;Felstone Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalson%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Dalson's Tears&lt;/a&gt; and use a scourge banner to blame it on the scourge. The Crusade already has a mad on about the scourge, so with any luck they'll concentrate on the scourge and leave the Argent Dawn forces alone for a while.\nBoth the Commander and the High Executor then send you back into Andorhal to put a magical marker beacon on each of the four watchtowers. You are told that the scourge have been using them for directing troop movements. You aren't told exactly how the beacons help the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps they allow those signals to be read? Perhaps they actually confuse the signals somehow? Who knows. Regardless, the towers are slated as high priority targets in the coming attacks.\nYou proceed to mark the towers with the beacon torches. At pretty much every tower, you have to ward off a few of the defenders, so it is no easy task. But finally, you return to report success!\nForging a key.\nDerrington (or Valorfist) feels you have proven yourself enough that he trusts you to shepherd a new task: forging a key to allow entry to &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, the keep on &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. He directs you to the person who would be creating the key.\nThe first thing that Arbington (or Dithers) sets you to, is gathering up appropriate fragments from the reanimated skeletons in the Andorhal area. Yes, it's going to be a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, quite literally.\nThere are a lot of skeletons, and with a little martial persuasion, you are able to gain &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Fragments\"&gt;skeleton fragments&lt;/a&gt; fairly easily. You take them back to your contact who then imbues them with magic to allow them to survive the next portion of the process: forging a key blank with &lt;a href=\"thorium%20Bar\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Dithers and Arbington direct you to the same mercenary goblin blacksmith in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Krinkle%20Goodsteel\"&gt;Krinkle Goodsteel&lt;/a&gt;. He's the only one known to produce the mold needed for the project. But it gets better... the Argent Dawn is asking you to take on the costs for the mold. 15 gold, payable in advance.\nKrinkle takes your gold and gives you the mold. Fortunately, he also tells you just what you have to do to forge the stem of the key.\nThat part... not so easy. You need the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20Mold\"&gt;Skeleton Key Mold&lt;/a&gt; (with the imbued skeleton fragments packed inside) and 2 . And you need literally volcanic heat to fuse the thorium and bone together. Fortunately, the nearby &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; has an active volcano in it. Krinkle points you to a lake of lava atop &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;Fire Plume Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you get there, you find the whole volcano teeming with &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. You dodge most of them, but in working your way up the volcanic cone to the lake, you do have to destroy a number of them. Right near the lake, you spot what might be the granddaddy of all fire elementals: &lt;a href=\"Blazerunner\"&gt;Blazerunner&lt;/a&gt;. You are able to stay safely away from him while pouring the thorium into the mold. You don't linger around; the elementals are coming back.\nBack to Dithers (or Arbington) you go, where you get the bad news. The &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; ruling the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; possesses a signet in the form of a scarab. That very signet must be the head of the skeleton key. And he won't surrender it willingly.\nIt is some consolation that the military commander (&lt;a href=\"Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Derrington\"&gt;High Executor Derrington&lt;/a&gt;) also &lt;a href=\"Alas%2C%20Andorhal%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;wants the lich dead&lt;/a&gt;, but for different reasons. What could be better than going up against Certain Death? Getting paid twice for it!\nThis task, though, is beyond your abilities alone. You gather up a number of other adventurers, and storm the center of Andorhal. The Lich has many, many minions surrounding him. It takes some time to slash and chop your way through them, but finally you face off against the lich. Through your combined might, you are able to destroy him and lay hands upon his phylactery, where lies the scarab. (You shatter the phylactery and take a shard back to the commander as proof to him of the deed. You've already got his scarab, but... whatever.)\nYou bring back the scarab, and Alchemist Arbington (or Apothecary Dithers) completes the key and hands it to you. \"Waste no time in trying it out\", he says."}

The quest it starts tasks heroes to return it to its owner, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe necklace was intended to be given by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to her sister, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, before Alleria left through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; assault on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was given an identical necklace. The three necklaces were once part of a larger one given to Alleria by their parents, which she had melted down and crafted into three lockets in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The emerald she kept for herself, and she gave the ruby and the sapphire to her second, &lt;a href=\"Verana\"&gt;Verana&lt;/a&gt;, to deliver to her sisters.\nDuring the brutal &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas gazed upon her necklace, lost in thought. Knowing that she would likely not survive the colossal battle, she mused that she would be reunited with Alleria soon. However, following her death and resurrection as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, the necklace had disappeared. Sylvanas' body was hurled onto a meatwagon, and the necklace was no-where to be found.\nLater, Sylvanas would break free of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s dominion, regain her body, and go on to found her own empire of undeath, comprised mainly of many other murdered humans and elves killed at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill, there was no trace of her necklace, which was left behind in Quel'Thalas. \nLady Sylvanas' necklace would ultimately be found by &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; adventurers several years later, at Sylvanas' own former place of residence, &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves, who had found a strange kinship in their former &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger General's&lt;/a&gt; people, returned it to her. Lady Sylvanas was shocked to lay eyes upon it again, though quickly composed herself and stated that it, like Alleria, was a long-dead memory; dropping the necklace and dismissing her visitor.\nHowever, in a rare moment of emotion, Sylvanas summoned a choir of &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s and began to sing a &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;melancholic tune&lt;/a&gt; for her homeland. At its climax, she knelt down and picked up her necklace once more.\nSylvanas would later store the sapphire in a small box and lock it away in the desk drawer in her personal quarters, alongside other mementos of her living life, so she could forget. The next time she took it out to look at it was after Vereesa sent her ruby locket to Sylvanas in an effort to reconnect to her, during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Sylvanas, Alleria, and Vereesa reunited years later, they seemingly dropped their necklaces from Windrunner Spire, Sylvanas later mentioning before &lt;a href=\"Lirath\"&gt;Lirath&lt;/a&gt;'s grave that at the end of their failed reunion, the three sisters, unable to reconcile their lasting differences even after reminiscing about their shared past, each chose to give their necklaces \"to the sea\".\nQuests.\nThe Lady's Necklace drops from any of the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Ranger\"&gt;Fallen Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deatholme%20Acolyte\"&gt;Deatholme Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s residing in &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nDuring the \"&lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20trilogy\"&gt;Sunwell trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\", Lady Sylvanas traveled to Quel'Thalas for reasons unknown. This was never particularly elaborated upon, though it is possible that Sylvanas intended to recover her beloved necklace."}

He later joins &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAround the time of , Herk was part of a group that had been sent to reconnoiter &lt;a href=\"sector%2017\"&gt;sector 17&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, the location of the High Tinker's quarters.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Herk was one of the gnomes assembled in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;Captain Tread Sparknozzle&lt;/a&gt; and a gnome &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Elite%20Aerial%20Rangers\"&gt;Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Emaedi%20Autoblast\"&gt;Emaedi Autoblast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fizzi%20Tinkerbow\"&gt;Fizzi Tinkerbow&lt;/a&gt;. He helped guide the G.E.A.R. Commander through &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Arcane%20Engine\"&gt;Prototype Arcane Engine&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently traveled with the rest of G.E.A.R. to the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; to defend it from the &lt;a href=\"Ironbound\"&gt;Ironbound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. When the rangers discovered that the troggs were under the control of a &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;, Winklespring identified the enemy leader as &lt;a href=\"Telzo%20Sparkspanner\"&gt;Telzo Sparkspanner&lt;/a&gt;. G.E.A.R. subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which Tinkerbow had tracked Sparkspanner's signal to\u2014using their &lt;a href=\"First%20Squadron%20Prototype\"&gt;prototype bombers&lt;/a&gt; but were forced to land on the &lt;a href=\"Foot%20Steppes\"&gt;Foot Steppes&lt;/a&gt; when the signal tracker started going haywire. To give Tinkerbow time to figure out the new trajectory, Winklespring set up a &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Cloaking%20Device%20%28Storm%20Peaks%29\"&gt;cloaking device&lt;/a&gt; and instructed the Commander to thin the numbers of the nearby Ironbound using a &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Assault%20Tank\"&gt;de-shrinkified assault tank&lt;/a&gt;. The rangers subsequently relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Terrace of the Makers&lt;/a&gt; closer to the signal's source, from which Winklespring and the Commander set about clearing out Sparkspanner's army outside &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;; the Cog Captain piloted one of the bombers while the Commander manned the gun to rain destruction down on the troggs and reprogrammed constructs. After the plane was struck, Winklespring maneuvered it into Sparkspanner's location\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt;\u2014where he and the rest of G.E.A.R. confronted Sparkspanner and his giant mech, the &lt;a href=\"Smasher%20X900\"&gt;Smasher X900&lt;/a&gt;, with Winklespring and the Commander fighting the mech head-on while Tinkerbow and Autoblast defended the flanks from waves of troggs. Sparkspanner was finally defeated, after which Winklespring instructed the Commander to return to New Tinkertown and give Captain Sparknozzle a report of the succesful mission.\nWinklespring later made his way to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; and was recruited to &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;. As the most experienced pilots of the team, he and the adventurer flew the lead during the journey from Boralus to Mechagon. After arriving on the island, he can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Overspark%20Expedition%20Camp\"&gt;Overspark Expedition Camp&lt;/a&gt; acting as a &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;, but can only be seen by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; characters."}

These perks can include a unique &lt;a href=\"starting%20zone\"&gt;starting experience&lt;/a&gt;, customization options, &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"class%20mount\"&gt;class mount&lt;/a&gt;s, a higher starting level, and other flavor mechanics. The concept of a hero class is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20heroes\"&gt;\"heroes\" in \"Warcraft III\"&lt;/a&gt;. The current hero classes are: the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"hero class\" is commonly misunderstood to mean that the class is more powerful than other classes. The term instead signifies a unique playstyle and experience, as well as denoting a class of heroes which start at an already \"heroic\" or \"veteran\" level, with an experience and gear to match.\nHero classes.\nDeath knight.\nThe first hero class, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; was announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt; and was released with . They start in a unique, phased &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20starting%20experience\"&gt;starting experience&lt;/a&gt; set in . The death knight can be a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;. They do not use &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s while tanking, they instead use &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons and heal after losing Health. Death knights also use melee and non-melee magic abilities.\nDemon hunter.\nThe second hero class, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; was announced at &lt;a href=\"Gamescom%232015\"&gt;Gamescom 2015&lt;/a&gt; with the reveal of . Their &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter%20starting%20experience\"&gt;starting experience&lt;/a&gt; is set in &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum, the Shattered Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. A leather-wearing melee class, demon hunters fulfill DPS and tanking roles, using flips, dives and agile attacks to evade damage while defeating foes using one-handed weapons and magical abilities.\nEvoker.\nThe third hero class, the &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; was announced with the reveal of . The evoker class is tied directly to the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; race; all dracthyr are evokers, and vice-versa. Evokers wear &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt; and have two specs: magical DPS and healer. Their abilities are themed after the five main &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Their starting experience will take place in the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; zone of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAll the hero units of \"Warcraft III\" were originally supposed to become hero classes in \"World of Warcraft\". Hero classes were still listed in 2005 on the \"Under Development\" page of the original website. When a character hit level 40, it could start specializing in skills to become the same kind of hero. However, as Blizzard developed talent trees, they dropped the idea as they believed that the trees would provide enough customization. For example, a night elven warrior could specialize into wielding two one-handed weapons and essentially be a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, while a dwarven warrior could fulfill the fantasy of a &lt;a href=\"mountain%20king\"&gt;mountain king&lt;/a&gt;, or an undead warrior could become a death knight.\nIt was stated at the time by &lt;a href=\"Nethaera\"&gt;Nethaera&lt;/a&gt; that current plans were to introduce one new hero class per expansion set.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nMany ideas were considered for the \"Wrath\" hero class, which were narrowed down to four front-runners. \nRunemasters were a type of enchanters who wrote runes on their bodies to give them different physical powers. However, a lot of the features of the runemaster were given to the death knights and, later, the monks. Some of the ideas for the necromancer class were also incorporated into the death knight instead, which was chosen as the hero class. The monk was later added as a regular, non-hero class in \"\".\nBard.\nThe Bard hero class was announced on April 1st, 2008, as a &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard hoax.\nAccording to the announcement, the Bard \"can vanquish evil with the power of ROCK!\" and wields a two-handed \"ax\" (that is, an electric guitar). Screenshots revealed a new \"Fret Bar\" interface (resembling that of the \"\" games) powering the Bard's \"Groove\" resource system. Blizzard claimed that the \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion would ship with a &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;-themed \"guitar-based keyboard peripheral\".

It is known that both &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Raleigh the Devout&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; are determined to eliminate the leadership of the Scarlet Monastery, albeit for different reasons.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nHerod can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, where he is known as Herod the Bully. It seems his reputation for brutish behavior started early.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nA shadow of Herod appears as a part of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;Trial of the Champion&lt;/a&gt;, where players face random memories of past bosses.\nMists of Pandaria.\nHerod was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Armsmaster%20Harlan\"&gt;Armsmaster Harlan&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategies.\nA full group of properly leveled players should be used when attempting to defeat Herod. His &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; damage is impressive and can put a huge hurt on cloth-users. A Healer should stay behind and focus on healing, as with any boss fight. It is advisable for the ranged dps and healers to remain on the stairs to avoid Whirlwind, however, the Healer must be careful not to lose line of sight to the Tank.\nHerod will initially perform Rushing Charge, exactly like a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, to the player who draws first &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;. He will proceed with basic melee swings until he's lost a good deal of health. He will then initiate a &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;-like attack (signaled by the quote below) that will render him invulnerable to spell damage. This attack deals &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage to anyone standing close by, so players should just run out of range and anyone able to use a ranged weapon should be shooting at him. Hunters should make sure to pull their pets back as well.\nIf your Healer has a low mana pool, or is not the proper level for this instance, have everyone bandage if they get hit by Herod's Whirlwind attack, so the heals can be focused on the Main Tank. \nAfter Herod is defeated, twenty &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Trainee\"&gt;Scarlet Trainee&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn. Do not be intimidated, as they can be taken out with one hit. If there is a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; present, they should use AoE attacks to wipe them all out.\nAlso, if you try to run outside the room, Herod will sprint, increasing his movement speed by 60% and almost certainly catching up to you; if you don't get affected by this, 3 Scarlet Myrmidons will spawn and block your path.\nQuotes.\nAggro:\nEnrage:\nWhirlwind:\nKilling a player:"}

After Lordaeron fell and Parqual was transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, he kept Brownie as one of the only remnants of his old life.\nWhen Parqual got the opportunity to reunite with Philia at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; years later, he took Brownie Bear with him to give as a gift to his daughter. Philia became tearful when Parqual showed her the stuffed animal, but the rules of the meeting prohibited her from touching it until after the event.\nUltimately, the Gathering ended with the tragic deaths of Parqual and the other &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; members. Their friends and relatives subsequently buried them at a &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;graveyard in Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, where Philia left Brownie Bear sitting next to her father's tombstone."}

{"id": "16652", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16652", "title": "Broxigar", "text": "Broxigar (a.k.a Broxigar the Red, Broxigar the Red Axe, or simply Brox) was a veteran &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; whose comrades were slaughtered in battle and who sought his own death in battle because of his guilt. Sent back in time to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Brox became an important figure in the war, and was chronologically the first orc ever encountered on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the new altered timeline. At the final battle of the war, Broxigar leapt through the portal opening in the collapsing &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and died in a blaze of glory after having become one of the only known mortals to ever inflict a wound on &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nHe was the older brother of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBroxigar was born on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and the older brother of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt;. Broxigar and Varok also had an unnamed half brother, sharing the same mother but different fathers. Brox grew up alongside his friend &lt;a href=\"Garno\"&gt;Garno&lt;/a&gt;, who was practically like a brother to him.\nBrox was a veteran of the First, Second, \"and\" Third Wars \u2014 well-known among his people for his heroic actions in helping to hold a vital mountain pass against hordes of demons during the Third War. Of all of his comrades, Brox was the only one left alive when orcish reinforcements finally arrived on the battlefield. Though he was greatly honored by his people, Brox never forgave himself for his \"cowardice\" in surviving while all of his comrades died a noble, glorious death. Even his niece &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, who was just a child at the time, could sense the guilt he felt upon his return to his family.\nWhen the Horde shamans detected the temporal anomaly in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Brox and a younger warrior were sent to investigate. Brox's companion, &lt;a href=\"Gaskal\"&gt;Gaskal&lt;/a&gt;, was killed and Brox himself was thrown ten thousand years into the past along with a &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the night elves.\nIn due course, Brox was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping. Though the night elves treated him like an animal, the novice priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; was kind to him, giving him food and healing his injuries. Brox called her \"&lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;\", believing that the powers of healing she used were granted to her by the spirits.\nBrox was eventually freed by Tyrande who had meanwhile teamed up with two other time-travelers, the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and his former pupil, the human mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. Brox stood guard over the comatose &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; as the latter destroyed a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; spell disrupting the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgainst the Legion.\nBrox's fighting skills earned him a fair reputation among the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Though typically xenophobic, the night elves accepted him (although the presence of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; may have influenced that somewhat).\nWhen Brox's axe was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;s that captured him, Malfurion, under the forest demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' direction, created a mystical &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;axe of wood&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with a piece of Kalimdor's magic, making it light as a feather and stronger than any mortal-forged axe. In Brox's hands, it was to be the death of literally thousands of demons and allowed him to achieve the unthinkable against their lord.\nA blaze of glory.\nAt the final battle over the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, Brox realized that if the world and the future were to be saved, his companions needed more time. Brox leapt from the back of one of the red dragons also carrying Rhonin into the swirling portal that was opening at the bottom of the funnel. When he passed through, and arrived on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he proceeded to slaughter multitudes of demons, blocking their advance towards the portal, slaying so many that he ended up standing atop a mountain of their corpses \u2014 mocking more to come to challenge him. It was there that he eventually attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, who came personally to put an end to the orc's life. However, Brox did the impossible, and with the Axe of Cenarius struck a small wound in Sargeras' leg. This wound would later be the focus of Krasus and his allies' spellwork, that for a second, tore Sargeras' attention away from his struggle to keep the portal open... allowing Malfurion and Illidan to close it upon him. Brox's life was ended by Sargeras, right before the demon entered the portal, by the jagged edge of Sargeras's &lt;a href=\"Gorribal\"&gt;broken sword&lt;/a&gt;, and Krasus saw Brox's lifeless corpse impaled on its end. With this final act of loyalty, Broxigar the Red sealed his place in history as one of the only known mortals to have ever assaulted the Burning Legion's leader.\nBroxigar the Red died, not a mere honorable death, but was graced with an unimaginable glory never being heard of in the history of the orcs. In the afterlife, he finally reunited with his deceased comrades in the past.\nLegacy.\nAgainst all odds, Rhonin found Brox's Axe of Cenarius after the battle, having not been lost with his death on the other side of the Well, and washed up on the shore of the new &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. When Krasus returned to the present day, his first act was to take the Axe directly to Thrall. Disguised as an orc shaman, Krasus told his tale of how Brox helped stop another demon invasion, and implored the Warchief to &lt;a href=\"Lok%27vadnod\"&gt;sing songs&lt;/a&gt; of Broxigar the Red, his legendary life, and his glorious sacrifice.\nThe night elves raised up a statue to him, making him the only orc to have ever been given homage by them. Tyrande and Malfurion honored him after the war and even after all these millennia, the mere mention of Brox's name is enough to remind Tyrande of how they lost him, causing tears to well up in her eyes.\nNow his brother, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, High Overlord of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; holds his name in honor.\nVarok also mentions Brox when you turn in &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang's&lt;/a&gt; battle armor.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt; grew up to warrior age and after proving her skills, Thrall gave her the Axe of Cenarius, of which Thrall's most trusted shaman had seen in a dream that it should go to her. She felt honored to wield such a fabled weapon. False dreams of Brox were sent to Thura of him being betrayed and killed by Malfurion himself, as part of a larger plan to free himself from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Tyrande referred to Broxigar as \"one of the great heroes of Azeroth\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; of Argus witnessed Broxigar's arrival and his last stand against Sargeras. They didn't know his name or the new world he'd come through the portal from, but his single blow on the Dark Titan \"was never forgotten.\" They managed to retrieve his necklace, a boot, and a shoulder pad, and dubbing Brox \"the Great Warrior\", erected the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Great%20Warrior\"&gt;Shrine of the Great Warrior&lt;/a&gt; using his mementos in &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nBroxigar appears at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; in a flashback to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. When Brox is fighting off demons on a bridge in the hold alone, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; aid him by closing the portals they are coming through. The three then battle &lt;a href=\"Malvingeroth\"&gt;Malvingeroth&lt;/a&gt; together.\nDragonflight.\nDuring Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Broxigar briefly manifested alongside the spirits of other famous orcs, including his brother &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt;, in response to an offering prepared by an orc adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;. Brox commended the adventurer for being like him by being willing to risk their life and fight to the end for a just cause, and told them that he looked forward to meeting them again in the afterlife.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

As such most of them are goblins, even though there are also &lt;a href=\"hobgoblin\"&gt;hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; bruisers employed by the goblins.\nThe bruisers are responsible for upholding law and order with a firm hand, and ensuring that all exchange is fair. And as the bruisers improve their weaponry and training, they have to cut off their free time. According to &lt;a href=\"Muzzlecrank\"&gt;Muzzlecrank&lt;/a&gt;, the bruiser's pay in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; was good.\nThey wander the streets of their respective cities making sure that the visitors do not create disturbances that would in any way disrupt the flow of trade. The goblins rely very heavily on commerce and do whatever it takes to keep things running smooth. They cannot allow the pettiness of the world conflicts to interfere with their business. If any members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; cause disturbances on city grounds, the Bruisers are quick to react, assaulting the aggressors and running them out of town, killing them if necessary. It is due to the Bruisers that skeletons of dead players continually litter the ground in the cities that they occupy, especially on PvP servers. This may have to do largely with players accidentally attacking players of the opposing faction by right-clicking them instead of an NPC.\nIf a bruiser is attempting to attack a player and that player cannot be reached, the Bruiser will shoot the player. To fix this, a player should make themselves reachable to the Bruiser. However, Bruisers will sometimes continue to shoot the player, resulting in a swift death. Shots fired by Bruisers have significant knockback.\nAreas.\nThe fourteen cities and areas protected by the Bruisers are:\nNote: On a PvE server, if you visit a goblin city, it is suggested that you not be flagged for PvP at the time, as you may accidentally get yourself attacked (and killed) by the Bruisers through no fault of your own.\nReputation.\nKilling &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; Bruisers will increase your &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; by 25. However, this has to be paid with -62.5 &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and -62.5 &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; (which adds up to -125 &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;rep&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the RPG.\nGoblin Bruisers are &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and can speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is a hard, melee-oriented boss with &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;high gear requirements&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrutallus can be seen on the far north in the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; outside on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, being taunted by the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madrigosa\"&gt;Madrigosa&lt;/a&gt; flying in the air above.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; enter the Sunwell Plateau and approach the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Iniquity\"&gt;Den of Iniquity&lt;/a&gt;, a room overlooking the Dead Scar, Brutallus fights and kills Madrigosa. After he is killed, his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; blood seeps into Madrigosa's body and raises her as &lt;a href=\"Felmyst\"&gt;Felmyst&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrutallus later &lt;a href=\"Brutallus%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;returns as a world boss&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nCurrently, Brutallus has 7,351,300 Health (previously 10,500,000) and a 6-minute enrage timer, meaning 20,420 DPS (previously 29,167) is required to beat him before the berserk timer. Kills have lasted no more than 6:28, and most likely, you'll be lucky to live past 6:10.\nAs it is plainly obvious, Brutallus is a massive gear check (in more than one way). \nThe strategy to this fight is very simple: Make your raid into a \"V\" shape, with 1 tank at each top end of the V and respective soak groups behind him, and have the melee group at the vertex of the V so that they are always behind Brutallus (no parrying). Each soak group takes 3 meteor slashes, the other tank taunts, and that group takes 3 meteor slashes, rinse repeat.\nFor Burn, that person must leave the group and run to a spot where they won't get slashed but be healed for the debuff, which everyone should be very spread out so that the burned person does not cause Burn to happen to other players.\nThe maximum amount of healers you can bring to this raid is 8, as 9 healers will almost certainly not get you enough DPS to kill him. If your healers can do it, bring only 7 healers.\nIt should be noted that the fight\u2014more specifically Meteor Slash\u2014was slightly changed in 2.4.1. Its range was 30 yards but is now far longer, most likely to stop an exploit. Because of this, your positioning will have to be a bit more delicate to make sure a burned player isn't in any way in the cone of meteor slash.\nThe toughest part of this fight is the class balance of the raid. Warriors (and Rogues) can do extremely high DPS, especially with &lt;a href=\"Warglaive%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Warglaive&lt;/a&gt; sets giving a very big bonus to this demon boss, but too many and you won't have enough soakers. Shadow priests help out a lot with &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt; healing their group (the soaker groups), but their DPS is \"capped\" at 1400-1500 DPS under normal raid circumstances, even with the best gear possible. It will be up to you and your guild to find the best balance for killing Brutallus.\nUsing destruction potions/haste potions for the DPS is pretty much required, and your melee should have Elixir of Demonslaying over Flasks of Relentless Assault, full raid consumables, including food and buffs (you will need every single buff you can get to increase your healing and damage), even if it includes having a discipline priest waiting outside the instance buffing your casters with imp spirit and that extra paladin for the extra blessing.\nThings in this fight you don't have to worry about:\nDamage on the tanks is \"extremely\" high, but continuous and predictable.\nA strategy with 3 tanks enables you to avoid his stomp ability, while one with 2 tanks enables you to beat the enrage timer more easily.\nAt level 80.\nIdeal raid composition: 4 healers, 2 tanks, 19 dps\nAt level 80, considering Brutallus is a gear-check and dps race, there is little strategy required beyond burning him down as quickly as possible with two exceptions:\nFollowing this strategy should minimize deaths to the raid and ensure a quick kill.\nPTR glitch.\nOn the PTR, Brutallus was capable of being enslaved by a Warlock. This required the player to wall jump, and was considered an exploit. He spreads a debuff similar to &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Blood\"&gt;Corrupted Blood&lt;/a&gt;, and can't be killed outside of the Sunwell Plateau instance. In a later build, he was affected by a scaling bug, which resulted in him being only slightly taller than players."}

According to the &lt;a href=\"Archivum%20Console\"&gt;Archivum Console&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Reply-Code Omega is one of two possible reply signals following by planetary diagnostics after the arrival of Algalon.\n\"Planetary re-origination\" would result in the destruction of modern Azeroth and its reconstruction from the raw materials, recreating Azeroth from the original Titan blueprint. The re-origination device itself, the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; desert. Given the death of Prime Designate &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s, the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;one Dragon aspect&lt;/a&gt; and the death of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;, and the release of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the chance of Algalon sending such a signal is estimated around \"99.99%, repeating of course\".\nAlgalon has stated that he has signaled for planetary re-origination at least several times in the past, resulting in the destruction of entire planetary systems (i.e. an entire world), and over time, the combined deaths of a \"million-million lives\".\nIn reality, once Algalon has been summoned to a world, he does not actually have to send Reply-Code Omega: if there is no reply code from him within a certain amount of time, planetary re-origination will proceed regardless from &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. This is why, having rearranged the reply code from Omega to Alpha after his defeat, he urges haste in sending Reply-Code Alpha in his stead.\nSeveral years later, the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; sought to activate Reply-Code Omega to wipe out the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s - and everyone else with it."}
