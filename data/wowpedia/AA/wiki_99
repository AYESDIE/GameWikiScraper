However the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had learned of the town as well and established their own camp. In order to eliminate the Horde forces present, Griley came up with an idea to grab anything of value and then blow it up when the orcs approached. The orcs being suspicious, sent in goblins to check things out and when they dug deep enough Griley blew the goblins up. With the orcs distracted Griley, Tarlo, and the others tossed their ropes over the west gate and sneaked out.\nWhen the Pandaria campaign began, Tarlo was one among the first people to join the campaign. When the Pandaria campaign ended, Tarlo was somewhat bitter. While noticing that &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;was breached&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was in chains, he was also quick to note that Pandaria had been &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;ravaged&lt;/a&gt;. He was also convinced that once the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;new Warchief&lt;/a&gt; got settled in that there would be another war between the Alliance and the Horde. \nWhile returning home the ship \"&lt;a href=\"Patron%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Patron's Pride&lt;/a&gt;\" a storm at sea forced Tarlo overboard nearly making him drown. After reaching the surface he saw the Patron's Pride leaving but understood that turning out for one soldier in a storm like this was foolhardy. As he remarked to himself, \"Better one man overboard than a hundred.\" \nWhile searching for a way to keep himself afloat he noticed three pandaren anglers, &lt;a href=\"Mei%20Pa\"&gt;Mei Pa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuo\"&gt;Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shi%20Ga\"&gt;Shi Ga&lt;/a&gt;, who were quick to bring him abroad their boat. After rescuing him, they invited Tarlo to fish with them and each took turns in telling the tale of &lt;a href=\"Xun\"&gt;Xun&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing the end of the tale, Tarlo was able to find a measure of peace as he fished alongside them."}

Before they hit the ground, stand where they'll hit to harmlessly bounce them back to the sky. If they hit the ground, they will do wide area damage and stun for a few seconds.\nOccasionally, Kairoz summons a swarm of Lesser Sands of Time or a single large Sands of Time. If Khadgar's tanking, his elemental will occasionally taunt all of the adds to it. Try to stay somewhat near Khadgar so he can help AoE them all down. Beware that frequently, the larger Sands of Time will fixate on the player regardless of the aggro table.\nPhase two.\nIn this phase, Kairoz has these abilities:\nAt this point, Kairoz stops summoning adds and shifts to full dragon form with a standard frontal cone breath attack and tail swipe. Sidestep out of the breath. He now has a new ability, Ripples in Time, that will one-shot just about everything in line of sight. Hide behind the rocks outside the clearing."}

Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Tarren Mill was a simple &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeronian&lt;/a&gt; town.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Forsaken afterward, where it served as the staging point against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Garok\"&gt;Dun Garok&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the town was improved and reinforced. Tarren Mill now stands as a bastion of the Forsaken power, while its former rival Southshore lies in ruins.\nHistory.\nThe Second War.\nTarren Mill was once a thriving &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; town. During the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; sent a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Archer%23High%20elven%20archer\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt; south to survey the supposed &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat in the area for themselves. Shortly after passing through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac grasslands&lt;/a&gt; near Tarren Mill, the elves were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; troops.\n&lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces to the town in order to free the archers that had been captured and were then being held in a nearby prison camp. With the success of the mission and with the safe return of the elves from the orcs, the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Council of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; then resolved to combine the armies of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with those of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nTwo years after the ending of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Tarren Mill was still inhabited by humans and in a pristine state. &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; stayed here, and he met the mage &lt;a href=\"Borel\"&gt;Borel&lt;/a&gt; on an occasion in the town.\nIt was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by the traitor &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; who were looking for the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. They were eventually defeated by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;, Jorad, &lt;a href=\"Harkyn%20Grymstone\"&gt;Harkyn Grymstone&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Groth\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Voll\"&gt;hunter's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Snee\"&gt;band&lt;/a&gt;, and later by the town's denizens.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, the town was taken over by the Forsaken. Tarren Mill was depicted as a small town, with a &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;, a few houses and withered orchards. In the years between the Forsaken take over and the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Tarren Mill was as concerned with keeping its borders safe from the &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; thieves that roamed the surrounding areas as dealing with the Alliance. During this time, the town was, as many Forsaken settlements were, in a state of disrepair.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Battle for Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; eventually escalated into a battleground between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and Tarren Mill. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from Southshore and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers from Tarren Mill frequently clashed in full-blown skirmishes in this notorious conflict. This can be seen with &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Thaivand\"&gt;Novice Thaivand&lt;/a&gt; who directs adventurers to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeds to battle the inhabitants of Southshore before either being driven off or fleeing from the town.\nCataclysm.\nTarren Mill was rebuilt using the new Forsaken architecture first used during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;invasion of Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The only traces of what the town used to be is the old barn on the outskirts of town. &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde war effort to finish off the Alliance remnants remaining in Hillsbrad as well as defending against the Stormpike counterattack from the north. Following &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Apocalypse\"&gt;Stormpike Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of Tarren Mill were successful in destroying the last major Alliance force in Hillsbrad, delivering the region entirely to the Horde.\nLegion.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Rotbringer%20Velthux\"&gt;Rotbringer Velthux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flameweaver%20Verathix\"&gt;Flameweaver Verathix&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched an &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on the Hillsbrad Foothills. Their main goal was to take the largest Forsaken town there, Tarren Mill. It was successfully repelled by &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;, the town denizens, and some &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Cromush joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance went to establish dams at &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt; and encountered &lt;a href=\"Melisara\"&gt;Melisara&lt;/a&gt; at Tarren Mill. Horde forces out of Tarren Mill were attempting to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance champions were sent to reset their progress by laying explosives, encountering &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Wordeen%20Voidglare\"&gt;Magus Wordeen Voidglare&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s patrolled Darrowmere River preventing Horde troop movement. Under the cover of darkness, Horde champions were sent to infiltrate their roost and slay their mounts at Tarren Mill.\nTarren Mill is under attack!\nBefore the introduction of &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, Tarren Mill was often inaccessible because of the frequent all-out war that took place right outside it, and oftentimes even inside it; this situation was created because &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; was so close by. In the early days, it was not uncommon for every single NPC \u2014 merchants, quest NPCs, and even the &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master\"&gt;bat handler&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to be killed immediately upon their spawning. The &lt;a href=\"honor%20system\"&gt;honor system&lt;/a&gt; did eventually manage to curb this slaughter, but it didn't even put a dent in the real problem: &lt;a href=\"ganking\"&gt;ganking&lt;/a&gt; of low-level players, a problem that existed mainly because Horde players arrive there at level 20-30, whilst many Alliance players go there 5 to 10 levels later.\nThe huge load of dozens of players fighting at once created massive zone-wide slowdown, oftentimes leading to a condition known as 'lag death' simply because a network connection couldn't possibly handle the overload \u2014 more than once an entire server has crashed whenever hundreds were fighting simultaneously. If one were to be either foolish or masochistic enough to turn on the LocalDefense channel (or, alternately, the WorldDefense channel), the phrase that gave Tarren Mill its nickname would literally crowd out anything and everything else in the chatbox. A very similar situation happened at Southshore; if the Alliance were not attacking Tarren Mill, the Horde would be attacking Southshore. Upon the introduction of the honor system all out wars would be held containing upwards of 100 players per side resulting in many servers actually crashing.\nA common sight (if one's hardware could manage to show it) was a veritable wall of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; charging the town, with another wall of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; rushing forward to meet them. Common latency times were 5+ \"seconds\", with the highest values of 7+ seconds. Since the introduction of &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, however, what was once a fool's dream is now a reality: sporadic peace in Tarren Mill. However, on PvP servers, it is still a favorite area for Alliance players to hunt lower-level Horde players.\nTarren Mill vs. Southshore.\nWith \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" the developers plan to recreate the \"timeless struggle\" between the two towns with a new 100v100 \"team deathmatch-style\" battleground, available only for a limited period. The battleground will recreate the zone as it was in vanilla \"World of Warcraft\".\nIn The Burning Crusade.\nIn \"\" expansion, adventurers are transported to the past to help preserve the timeline by aiding a young &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of heading straight to Durnholde, however, players may explore a portion of Hillsbrad, including both Tarren Mill and Southshore.\nIn the RPG.\nTarren Mill is a major &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; stronghold, which includes a garrison of high-level Horde champions who repel raids from &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. It is the biggest Horde threat in the region, and &lt;a href=\"Aretain%20Naris\"&gt;Aretain Naris&lt;/a&gt;' ultimate goal is its destruction. For its part, Tarren Mill sends patrols to search for Aretain's men, but so far he has managed to elude them.\nHumans once ran this mill, but it fell to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Darthalia\"&gt;High Executor Darthalia&lt;/a&gt;, attack the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;'s citizens mercilessly. The Alliance is constantly sending troops from Southshore to retake it.\nIf heroes approach Tarren Mill, its defenders will watch them, but won't openly attack. If they come within a half-mile, a raiding party will move to intercept them. The soldiers will warn them to go away, and attack if they fail to comply. They are not interested in parley.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Mounted%20Resistance\"&gt;Mounted Resistance&lt;/a&gt; has the location marked as Tarren Mill, describes the area as having a roost, and has &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; as the objective. It is possible that the location is a mistake as Tarren Mill is not known to have a roost protected by Gryphon Master Talonaxe. It could have been &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; instead. Alternatively, it could mean that the Wildhammer clan took control of Tarren Mill and built a roost there during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tarthen's elderly master had long ago inherited the powerful greatstaff &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, and was in the process of choosing which apprentice would take it up next. Tarthen fully expected to receive the staff, as he eclipsed his fellow apprentices in raw power and potential. However, his master put little weight in such things, and on the day of the ceremony he instead gave Ebonchill to another apprentice, who embodied the qualities of compassion, wisdom and comradery.\nTarthen wallowed in anger and bitterness. Believing that he had been wronged, he was determined to prove himself and stole Ebonchill from its new owner, taking great care to cover up evidence of his crime. In secret, he practiced with the greatstaff and learned to wield its energies. Only a small handful of his most trusted Tirisgarde allies knew of his theft, and they alone witnessed Tarthen bending Ebonchill's magics to his will and were awed by the power at his fingertips. Once he was confident that he had mastered Ebonchill, Tarthen set out to succeed where all of the other Tirisgarde had failed and defeat Aegwynn.\nAccording to a missive later sent to the Council of Tirisfal, Tarthen confronted Aegwynn in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of the power used by the two magi, the duel was one of the greatest to have ever occurred between a Tirisgarde and the renegade Guardian, but also one of the shortest. When Tarthen unleashed Ebonchill's stored power against Aegwynn, she immediately turned the energies back on him with a &lt;a href=\"%3Acounterspell\"&gt;:counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, encasing him in a layer of diamond-hard ice. Despite Stranglethorn's hot weather, Tarthen was still frozen solid when the authors of the missive found him, and it took considerable effort to thaw his corpse and wrench Ebonchill from his lifeless hand."}

Her cord on the catch master &lt;a href=\"Kattik%20Sharktasted\"&gt;Kattik&lt;/a&gt;'s counting staff is colored blue, blue, green, red, and yellow. When she was young, her father took her out to sea to teach her to fish, as is traditional among tuskarr. However, the very next day, she was invited to go kite-flying and her father went to sea alone only to never return, leaving Taruka alone with her mother &lt;a href=\"Makusha\"&gt;Makusha&lt;/a&gt; and her younger sister &lt;a href=\"Unka\"&gt;Unka&lt;/a&gt;. The mast from her father's boat washed ashore a week later, becoming one of only two things she had left of him. The other was his cherished spear, which he'd almost never used. Years later, Taruka shortened the mast and stepped it in her own tiny boat; due to her slight build, she could not row one of the bigger boats and relied on sailing most of the time. Without her father's guidance, she taught herself to fish through trial and error.\nOne afternoon, as the clan was stocking up on food for a journey to &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;, Taruka returned to the camp with a catch of seven &lt;a href=\"Spotted%20Yellowtail\"&gt;spotted yellowtail&lt;/a&gt;. Her rival &lt;a href=\"Onaaka\"&gt;Onaaka&lt;/a&gt; (who had caught a huge &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Salmon\"&gt;emperor salmon&lt;/a&gt;) belittled her for the catch and Kattik gave her only one knot as a reward, claiming that the fish were small and three had early gill rot. Taruka was disappointed by this, since she was saving up on knots so she could buy kite silk for Unka from the hoarder &lt;a href=\"Warrak\"&gt;Warrak&lt;/a&gt;. She took the yellowtail to her friend, the butcher &lt;a href=\"Larati\"&gt;Larati&lt;/a&gt;, who admitted that no other catch master would've given her more knots and did not believe Taruka's claim that she would catch more and bigger fish. Shortly after, Taruka was sought out by the old fisher &lt;a href=\"Harooka\"&gt;Harooka&lt;/a&gt;, who warned her about a danger in &lt;a href=\"Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;Lyquokk Strait&lt;/a&gt; and told her to instead take the safer route around &lt;a href=\"Praak%20Island\"&gt;Praak Island&lt;/a&gt; on her way to Kamagua. Taruka became suspicious and concluded that the other fishers were simply trying to keep her away from a prime fishing spot. \nAfter a sullen dinner with her sister and mother\u2014who was working on a shirt as a slower way to earn knots for Unka\u2014Taruka went out to the family's sled and looked at her father's scabbarded spear, reminiscing about how he had once told her \"If I need the spear, &lt;a href=\"Oacha%27noa\"&gt;Oacha'noa&lt;/a&gt; will tell me so\". As she thought this, she suddenly heard a strange voice say \"Yes\", even though no one else was near. A gust of wind then appeared and deposited several ice crystals in the pattern of a &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Oacha'noa's mark\u2014at her feet. Taruka interpreted this as a sign from the goddess and took the spear with her as she set out in her boat the next morning.\nShe headed north along the coast until Praak Island appeared in the distance. After some hesitation, she steered into Lyquokk Strait but saw no signs of fish anywhere. After an hour of sailing, halfway into the strait, she saw a &lt;a href=\"beast%20of%20Lyquokk%20Strait\"&gt;huge sea creature&lt;/a&gt; approach and realized that Harooka's warning had been honest. She got her father's spear free before the beast moved under her boat and lifted it out of the water. The boat capsized, but she jumped up and grabbed onto the creature's scales. When the monster dived headfirst into the water again, she slid down its back towards it neck and managed to plunge the spear into its eye and brain, killing it. The creature disappeared in the deep, depositing Taruka in the water. She found and climbed onto her upturned boat and was at a loss for what to do until the beast's corpse bobbed back up to the surface. Realizing that its body was filled with air and could therefore function as a ship, Taruka tied her boat to the creature's tail, stepped the mast in its blowhole, and attached various other parts to the corpse to create a makeshift rigging that she could roughly steer. The dead beast attracted many scavengers, and Taruka used her net to catch enough fish to keep her fed on the three-day voyage north to Kamagua.\nWhen she arrived to the town, everyone wanted to help tow her strange vessel/catch into the harbor. One of them was Onaaka, who quietly admitted that it was a very good catch. Dozens of tuskarr gathered on the shore to witness the spectacle, including the catch masters of all the clans as well as Makusha and Unka. When Taruka waved to her family, everyone waved back. Taruka Beastkiller, as she was now being called, singled out Kattik in the crowd, stated that she didn't think her latest catch had any gill rot, and jovially asked him how many knots it was worth."}

The surrounding forests have been corrupted after the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, cloaking the land in constant darkness for decades. The walking dead choke the &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;s, and foul creatures known as &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; have overrun many of the outlying &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;steads. Even worse, the political instability orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; caused the abandonment of the town and its surrounding areas by the authorities and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;. This has left the stubborn people of Duskwood little choice but to defend themselves. Besides its &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, the village also has a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and their adherence to the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; cult, &lt;a href=\"Ello%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Lord Ello Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; ruled the town while &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a local militia that works to keep the roads free and the creeping darkness that plagues the land back for as long as possible. Following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; succeeded the late Althea as the commander of the organization. The people of Duskwood are a jumpy and suspicious lot, but they are desperate for any aid they can get against the evil that now surrounds their homes.\nBefore their treason, the Council of Darkshire was responsible for enforcing justice in the town, notably by ordering death sentences for those who sold the bodies from cemeteries in Duskwood. In the town hall, &lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Daltry\"&gt;Clerk Daltry&lt;/a&gt; keeps records on the people that live and pass through the town, although some of his records are a little outdated. According to &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt;, he had to hide his \"true self\" from the people of Darkshire as they react poorly to &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; that found prosperity through the farmsteads which dotted the surrounding fertile region of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, as its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably Grand Hamlet in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ebonlocke%20%28family%29\"&gt;Ebonlocke family&lt;/a&gt; already used to live in the town before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst War and aftermath.\nAround the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Hamlet lost several &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;of its nobles&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, driven insane by the &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;demon within&lt;/a&gt;, drained the life of all humans nearby in order to battle his mother &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. A few years later, when Medivh was killed by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy unleashed by his death corrupted Brightwood, slowly turning the land into a dangerous, thorny blight.\nAt some point during the war, Grand Hamlet was the target of orc raiding parties, as they were amassing a large army to march against the town. While the armies of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; managed to repel them for a time, the town was ultimately destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Following the victory of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the town was rebuilt with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Supreme Commander Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw the efforts to repatriate the kingdom's citizens\nLegends.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin &lt;a href=\"Dougan\"&gt;Dougan&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Adena\"&gt;Adena&lt;/a&gt; settled near Grand Hamlet with their twin baby girls, &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the corruption continued to spread over time in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Hamlet was renamed Darkshire, and several townsfolk decided to investigate &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, the presumed source of the curse. When they disappeared, Dougan summoned his friends &lt;a href=\"Kardan\"&gt;Kardan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voldana\"&gt;Voldana&lt;/a&gt; for a rescue mission. However, the paladin was killed in the tower and his comrades had no choice but to adopt his children, as his wife lost her mind due to the grief and couldn't protect them anymore from the dangers of Duskwood.\nSeveral years later, the twin sisters returned to their childhood home with their adoptive parents. There, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s until &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Dodds\"&gt;Watcher Dodds&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; came to help and brought them to Darkshire, where &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; announced their mother's death. At &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, the twin found an army of undead heading for Darkshire, and among them the reanimated corpse of their mother. The group and the watchers later managed to save the town by eliminating all the undead.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBefore he retired from active duty, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Haggard\"&gt;Marshal Haggard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; used to get drinks at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Darkshire.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Ladimore\"&gt;Morgan Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; returned to Duskwood but only to find his house ruined and his family missing. He traveled to Darkshire and met a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; who advised him to check for their gravestones at &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. However, he refuted everything and rode from Darkshire to nearby &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, thinking that perhaps his family had fled. He ended his life when he discovered the truth, and later returned as the undead &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Ladim\"&gt;Mor'Ladim&lt;/a&gt;, killing many innocents and watchmen of Darkshire until he was put down by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance, the political manipulations of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; led the kingdom to pull all their troops out of Duskwood. Left to fend for themselves, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; was established to defend against the various threats that plagued the town. Formed and trained entirely by the people of the forest; they had to contend with marauding &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They were involved in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abercrombie\"&gt;Abercrombie&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt;; as well as the manhunt for the murderer &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; required the assistance of the Night Watch to save &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ello%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Lord Ello Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; had to refuse because the town would have been overrun by evil before the guards could even reach the edge of the forest.\nSome Darkshire citizens have also set out to deal with the evils of the region, such as the &lt;a href=\"Carevin%20family\"&gt;Carevin family&lt;/a&gt;, which has dedicated itself to battle against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, wild &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, and their allies.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Darkshire and rented a room at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt; for a few days. He spent his nights at the bar, writing, until he left the town in a hurry as he was hunted by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; learned that &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; was a place filled with evil and undeath, &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Delan\"&gt;Anchorite Delan&lt;/a&gt; came to Darkshire in order to help its inhabitants in pushing back the darkness.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unit%20Darkshire\"&gt;Unit Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to help the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Riders.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Archmage Karlain&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Darkshire in search of his son &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;. The watchers he questioned revealed that the young man had recently been in the town, questioning everyone he could about the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, until he disappeared once more while investigating his leads. After he retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from the worgen in &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;, the priest &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; returned to Darkshire and spent the night at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt; of the .\nCataclysm.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a number of townsfolk were complaining about someone nailing disturbing letters to their doors in the middle of the nights. While the culprit could not be identified, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult were trying to recruit the citizens with their apocalyptic notes. As such, the mayor was notified of the situation and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; was placed on high alert by &lt;a href=\"Role%20Dreuger\"&gt;Role Dreuger&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the town was invaded by furious &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s through the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Rift%20%28Cataclysm%29\"&gt;Elemental Rifts&lt;/a&gt; appearing across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They were driven back by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s forces were so taxed by &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;greater evils&lt;/a&gt; that they couldn't spare a single &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt; to protect Darkshire. However, many &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were later ordered by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to report to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, as the Night Watch forces were stretched thin defending against marauding wolves and bands of wild &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Althea also sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Bailiff%20Conacher\"&gt;Bailiff Conacher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; for more reinforcements.\nAt some point, feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; managed to break into the &lt;a href=\"Darkshire%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; and tore the place to shreds, destroying half the archives in the process.\nAfter years of fight, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Carevin\"&gt;Jonathan Carevin&lt;/a&gt; and his family still continued their expulsion of all evil and &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;heresy&lt;/a&gt; in Duskwood, asking the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in their quest to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the town was caught in chaos. The ruling &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt;, a few citizens, and some &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;ers joined the fanatical &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; cult, which used the town as their base of operations. Led by &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Sister Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, the cultists murdered several innocent inhabitants under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;, in order to organize a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic ritual in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Among the loyal watchers, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; could be seen protecting several citizens and mentioned that the defection of her comrades was certainly due to dark magic. The slaughter was later discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; who stole the ritual reagents to buy time and also attempted to kill &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;. However, the assassination attempt failed, and while Althea escaped to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; where she was killed by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, the councilmen seemingly managed to escape.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the township was still active and free from the Veiled Hand, while &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; succeeded &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; as the new Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to overwhelm Duskwood and Darkshire with an army of undead by corrupting the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt;. The advance of the undead was slowed down by the efforts of the watchers, until &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; defeated the necromancer and recovered the purified holy torch.

Some &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s later helped to reduce the Scourge's numbers in the area, before transmitting a report from the Lieutenant to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gregor\"&gt;Commander Gregor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to brief them on the situation in the region.\nFilm universe.\nSet to the south of , Grand Hamlet is the hometown of &lt;a href=\"Taria%20Wrynn%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Queen Taria Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and her brother , a place as quiet and quaint as .

It is known for its characteristically shadowed woods and rocky beaches, littered with ancient ruins and mountainside caves. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; claim the shore as part of their new kingdom, and &lt;a href=\"sentinel\"&gt;sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the road from the port of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to the south. It was the only Alliance zone on the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; before it became contested during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld night elf ruins stand crumbling on the cliffs, infested with &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt; and haunting &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s. Cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; ambush unwary travelers from their hideouts beyond the road. Even the seas are unsafe, as bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"frenzy%20%28Fish%29\"&gt;frenzies&lt;/a&gt;, gigantic &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s, and hostile &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s lurk beneath the waves. The night elf village of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; served as a friendly trading post before its destruction in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde managed to conquer most of Darkshore after the Burning of Teldrassil, despite some parts of the regions initially being contested. However, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and most of the surviving night elves returned to reclaim their lands from the Forsaken and the goblins occupying them. Under &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership and with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt;, the kaldorei were able to destroy most of the Horde forces in the area, decisively winning the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and making &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; their new stronghold. However, the night elves eventually abandoned Bashal'Aran, allowing the settlement to return to ruins, and Tyrande and her Sentinels began largely focusing their wrath against the Horde elsewhere.\nHistory.\nThe Darkshore region is named after the odd mist that tends to blanket anything. It is mostly shunned by the night elven race. Many attempts have been made to settle the land, but all had fallen to failure, in fact, Auberdine was the only stronghold in the region. Several &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt; have also lived for centuries in the area.\nDarkshore was once home to the twin cities &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over by &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;. The cities were ruined by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; approached, Athrikus promised to save his people. In truth, he trapped their souls within soul gems, allowing them to \"live forever\", but he used them as a power source for himself.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and led a group of druids into Darkshore. From here they planted a new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA few years later, a corruption spread throughout Darkshore, resulting in sickness among the wildlife. &lt;a href=\"Alanndarian%20Nightsong\"&gt;Alanndarian Nightsong&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; for aid after the situation had become something of a crisis for the local &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;. Suspecting a poison in the water, &lt;a href=\"Dendrite%20Starblaze\"&gt;Dendrite Starblaze&lt;/a&gt; sent a young druid to gather a sample from &lt;a href=\"Cliffspring%20Falls\"&gt;Cliffspring Falls&lt;/a&gt;, the source of most drinkable water in the region. The sample was filthy with pollution; Alanndarian reasoned it must have affected Darkshore's entire water table. However, what caused the pollution was unclear, and she felt the water may not have been the corruption's only source. With the druid's help in gathering materials, Alanndarian created a salve to heal the deer.\nUltimately, evidence pointed to the water streaming down from the corrupted region of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; tampering with the water supply being the culprits of the corruption.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun%27s%20forces\"&gt;armies of C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDarkshore took a heavy toll from the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 its landscape was wrecked, perhaps more thoroughly than any other part of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. For a time, the area was unapproachable due to gale winds, with several Cenarion druids sent there went missing. Auberdine was completely destroyed, the ground was cracked and flooded with streams and whirlpools, and there are fires, storms and other hazards of nature ravaging the zone. The night elves are in survival mode, helping &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s and, wherever they can, fending off the advances of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;, the naga, and the Shatterspear trolls.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, recently returned from the Emerald Dream, has traveled to the epicenter of the destruction, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Vortex\"&gt;Eye of the Vortex&lt;/a&gt;, and called upon the ancient powers of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; to contain the devastation, preventing Darkshore from being shattered and swept away into the ocean.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; was shielded from most of the devastation caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, due in large part to the power of the ancient guardians residing therein. Protecting the grove required an enormous amount of energy, though, and as a result, most of the guardians have gone into a sort of slumber. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s will have to figure out a way to wake them and bring them into the fight to ensure the survival of Darkshore.\nThe night elves built the town of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; further north from Aubderdine, in order to maintain some foothold on Darkshore. The village is made up of new buildings, as the night elves cleared away the ruins they could not restore. Most of the night elves currently living in Darkshore have focused their attention on reclaiming Auberdine and helping out any survivors that can be found.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; started establishing footholds on northern Darkshore, and the night elves have responded by scouting and preparing to defend the area from the seemingly hostile trolls.\nJust south of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; is a whirlpool that leads to a secret cavern. Adventurers wanting to go there must make a great dive.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde set up a blockade around Kalimdor trapping the night elven fleet at Darkshore and &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance \"sent\" false intelligence about attacking the blockade there. Instead, the Alliance attacked &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nDarkshore became a battleground between the Alliance and Horde as the Horde pushed north to attack Teldrassil, particularly at the &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the island of &lt;a href=\"Nazj%27vel\"&gt;Nazj'vel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde entrenched themselves in northern Darkshore under &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Blastgineer%20Bombgutz\"&gt;Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz&lt;/a&gt;, who was drilling near the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and although &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt; was apparently for a while held by &lt;a href=\"hippogryph%20rider\"&gt;hippogryph rider&lt;/a&gt;s, they were attacked by Horde forces in an attempt to secure their faction's aerial superiority over Darkshore once again. They also maintained bestiaries near the southeastern &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, which were set aflame by Alliance forces. Goblin salvager efforts by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goggath\"&gt;Captain Goggath&lt;/a&gt; to use Azerite-powered &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s to dismantle the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, were discovered by &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Duskrunner\"&gt;Huntress Duskrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and Alliance forces attempted to steal or sabotage their technology. In &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dentaria%20Silverglade\"&gt;Dentaria Silverglade&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the evacuation of surviving night elf civilians to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, but was targeted for assassination by Horde forces, with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Guard%20Aldo%20Rockrain\"&gt;Blood Guard Aldo Rockrain&lt;/a&gt; leading a Horde army against her, which was in turn confronted by Alliance defenders.\nBattle for Darkshore and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Darkshore became a &lt;a href=\"warfront\"&gt;warfront&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power covering the entire region in perpetual darkness under a lunar eclipse, and further empowering &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her people.\nAlthough the rest of the Alliance was unable to directly assist them, the night elves and their &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; allies launched a naval and land attack upon the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; as they fought over the region. The old Highborne settlement of &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; is established as their de-facto regional base of operations and capital, the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; is used as a weapon by the Forsaken to cover much of the occupied lands towards the shoreline, and outposts such as the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; are apparently destroyed and rebuilt throughout the course of the conflict.\nThe battle ultimately ended in the Alliance's favor, with the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Black%20Moon\"&gt;Army of the Black Moon&lt;/a&gt; decimating the Forsaken and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; troops, leaving Bashal'Aran and Darkshore itself in Alliance hands once again.\nAfter the Fourth War, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; visited the area. Except for some wildlife, they found that little life remained in the mists of Darkshore; birdsong gone, chased off by the wails of those unwilling to pass on. &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; remain ruined, but the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt; are still active. As they wandered northward to see the remains of Teldrassil, the pair had to be careful not to be seen, as to not start another war and don't trouble the night elves. After avoiding the main road, they didn't have to be so careful. The forest roads were once highly patrolled, but now they're mostly left alone, with Tyrande and her Sentinels focusing their wrath elsewhere.\nGeography.\nDarkshore consists of a long strip of coastline in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It is sheltered to the east by mountains, which protect the wildlife in Darkshore from most the taint of the &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the taint has spread into Darkshore via the various rivers flowing through the zone from their sources in Felwood; bringing the taint with them which is turning the land grey and dead, and poisoning the wildlife and &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s with an insatiable rage. Between the mountains and the beach lies a forest consisting mainly of evergreens. To the south, the forest thickens and the mountains recede, leading into the deep wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The most prominent feature of the land after the Cataclysm is a massive, swirling &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Vortex\"&gt;vortex&lt;/a&gt; of energies, roughly in Darkshore's center.\nDarkshore contains no &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s of any type and no &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, but a warfront takes place here. It contains two &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; travel hubs: the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; village &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; at the north and the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; at the south.\nTravel hubs.\nIn addition to the below flight paths, there are Nightsaber Riders southeast of Lor'danel who can transport players to &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Ruins of Mathystra&lt;/a&gt;, and from the Ruins of Mathystra all the way to &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Village\"&gt;Shatterspear Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nIn Darkshore, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; has called a massive swirling vortex of air to hold the land together as he and the night elves attempt to stop the rampaging elementals. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the troubles of the zone, in order to keep Malfurion's attention away from the work being done in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nQuests in Darkshore range from level 10-20. Players arrive in &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; and push southwards into the zone, until the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; border. Quest chains of note include fighting the wildlife corruption, rescuing the survivors of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against the invading &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, striking back against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, containing the natural disasters that have wrecked the zone, and fighting the newly unearthed servant of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nToys and loot.\nAdded in patch &lt;a href=\"8.1.0\"&gt;8.1.0&lt;/a&gt; and available for level 50 players in the &lt;a href=\"Warfront\"&gt;Warfront&lt;/a&gt; phase, a large number of rare creatures drop mounts, pets, and toys. Rares can only be looted once per Alliance/Horde capture cycle.\nDig sites.\nDarkshore has only one &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nDarkshore was once one of the most prosperous regions of the Kaldorei empire, and great cities such as &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; were the pinnacle of civilization at that time. Much of the coastline was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and it was many years before the night elves began to rebuild in the area.\nAfter the Sundering, some night elves settled in the continent's northern reaches, on and near &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, including the port at the mountain's northern foot. However, the few night elves in Darkshore left the area in the course of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, moving to the safety of Mount Hyjal and the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. A small number of night elves returned after the war to the cold and desolate beach to revive the port. They dwelt in the village of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, which was used as a ferry outpost. The remainder of the seaside is left in ruins.\nDarkshore is one of the last refuges of the night elves, distant enough from Mount Hyjal to have been spared the worst damage from demonic attacks. After the night elves returned here after the Third War, they found to their dismay that small parts of the land are tainted by the corruption from Felwood in the east.\nAuberdine keeps the majority of Darkshore under control, but the eastern border is gradually getting more and more corrupted. There are pockets where some nasty beasts have made their homes, and the extremely suspicious \u201cMaster's Glaive\u201d which may or may not be a deceased Old God, but generally things are pretty happy here. The fishing and boating industries are exceptionally strong.\nPeople and culture.\nThe night elves have a limited presence in Darkshore. They subsist mainly on what they can catch in the ocean and what they can get through trade. When not fighting one another, naga and murlocs that lurk elsewhere in the ruins of Darkshore attack any travelers who look like easy pickings. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit a series of caves beneath the port. Uncultured but friendly to night elves in the past, their time in the ruins has turned many of them feral. The night elves of Darkshore are friendly and organized and used to travelers.\nGeography.\nTerrain type: Temperature aquatic (nonflowing water), medium forest, and forbidding mountains.\nDarkshore covers northwestern Kalimdor, and the tainted land of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; rises toward Hyjal to the south. The rocky cliffs, sandy soil, and ever-present sea mist ensure that little worth noting grows in Darkshore. Kelp, seaweed, and rocks litter the beaches, and a few sparse trees dot the landscape away from the beach. Once a thriving night elf settlement, it is little more than a desolate beach dotted with ruined buildings. The weather is cold and stormy much of the time, with a wicked wind stirring up the waves. Rain and fog are prevalent for a good part of the year, allowing only the most talented sailors to navigate the dangerous waters. Shipwrecks of the less talented litter the shallower waters and beach.\nThe night elves currently living in Darkshore have focused their attention on rebuilding Auberdine. Most of the town is made of new buildings, as the night elves cleared away the ruins they could not restore. Many ruins remain through the coast, and harsh winds and salt water continue to corrode the once sturdy buildings. These worn pillars and crumbling structures are not totally abandoned - stories about that &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; are slowly taking the ruins for their own.\nRains, winds, rocky beaches, and sheer cliffs that have split the ground make the place inhospitable. Besides natural dangers typical of the area, aggressive wildlife roams the grassy hills and stalks among the dark trees.\nAs a coastal area, Darkshore is cooled by a sea breeze and is perpetually humid. Rain is frequent but mild. The majority of the forest is peaceful and tranquil, but a few spots have been corrupted by the presence of warlocks or tainted furbolgs. Darkshore is dotted with several bodies of water, including at least one fairly large waterfall on the eastern side; I thought I saw movement behind the falls as I passed, but I can't be sure. The eastern edge of Darkshore is marked by a large mountain range, which separates Darkshore from Felwood (directly east) and Moonglade (northeast).\nBrann's visit.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Darkshore by boat from Menethil Harbor, to work his way from the top of Kalimdor down, and thus Auberdine was a better option than Theramore. Darkshore was the first he had seen of Kalimdor and was impressed. It was just at the beginning of spring when he arrived, and the temperature was surprisingly cold in Darkshore, but beyond that the environment was quite hospitable. The massive numbers of trees reminded him of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; razed the city. Fortunately, the elves here seemed to be in minimal danger. There are small bands of murlocs and corrupted furbolgs in Darkshore that might cause a wandering adventurer trouble, but they pose no threat to the town itself.\nHe was, however, not the first member of the Explorer's League to reach Darkshore. Brann was greeted immediately on the arrival by a stout dwarf named &lt;a href=\"Archaeologist%20Hollee\"&gt;Hollee&lt;/a&gt;, one of the excavation leaders. A good number of other dwarves are about the area, inspecting the numerous ruins; and one in particular named &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Remtravel\"&gt;Remtravel&lt;/a&gt; may have found some objects linked to the titans.\nHe was fortunate that there was room in the inn when he arrived, which was apparently something of a rarity. The town was extremely busy, which I understand was in part due to an upcoming festival, the &lt;a href=\"Rain%20Dance%20%28festival%29\"&gt;Rain Dance&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile the villagers are almost exclusively night elves, the few humans and dwarves living in the area have made a good impression on them, and they were quite willing to answer Brann's questions about the area. The dwarves here are few, but they are experienced adventurers, and most of them are members of the Explorer's Guild. Kalimdor is a land of many mysteries, and the dwarves here spend their time investigating these secrets, focusing specifically on Titan ruins and the creations of their enemies, the Old Gods.\nThe only truly native creatures in the area are furbolgs, and sadly those here are corrupted. The night elves do their best to find a cure for the once noble creatures, but sadly, the power of the Burning Legion allows no antidote.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is known for its characteristically shadowed woods and rocky beaches, littered with ancient ruins and mountainside caves. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; claim the shore as part of their new kingdom, and &lt;a href=\"sentinel\"&gt;sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the road from the port of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to the south. \nThis rocky area stretches along Kalimdor's north coast. Rains, winds and rocky beaches make the place inhospitable. Old night elf ruins stand crumbling on the cliffs, and murlocs and naga lurk within. The night elf village of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; serves as a friendly trading post.\nThe region is not without dangers, however. Aggressive wildlife roams the grassy hills and stalks among the dark trees. The ruined cities of the night elves are infested with &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt;s and haunting &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, and cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; ambush unwary travelers from their hideouts beyond the road. Even the seas are unsafe, as bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"frenzy%20%28Fish%29\"&gt;frenzies&lt;/a&gt;, gigantic &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s, and hostile &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s lurk beneath the waves. \nHistory.\nDarkshore was once one of the most prosperous regions of the Kaldorei empire, and great cities such as &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; were the pinnacle of civilization at that time. Much of the coastline was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and it was many years before the night elves began to rebuild in the area.\nAfter the Sundering, some night elves settled in the continent's northern reaches, on and near &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, including the port at the mountain's northern foot. The night elves left Darkshore in the course of the Third War, moving to the safety of Mount Hyjal and the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. A small number of night elves have returned to the cold and desolate beach to revive the port. They dwell in the village of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; and currently use it as a ferry outpost. The remainder of the seaside is left in ruins.\nDarkshore covers northwestern Kalimdor, and the tainted land of Felwood rises to Hyjal to the southeast. The rocky cliffs, sandy soil, and ever-present sea mist ensure that little worth noting grows in Darkshore. Kelp, seaweed, and rocks litter the beaches, and a few sparse trees dot the landscape away from the beach. Once a thriving night elf settlement, it is little more than a desolate beach dotted with ruined buildings. The weather is cold and stormy much of the time, with a wicked wind stirring up the waves. Rain and fog are prevalent for a good part of the year, allowing only the most talented sailors to navigate the dangerous waters. Shipwrecks of the less talented litter the shallower waters and beach. The night elves currently living in Darkshore have focused their attention on rebuilding Auberdine. Most of the town is made up of new buildings, as the night elves cleared away the ruins they could not restore. Many ruins remain outside Auberdine, and harsh winds and salt water continue to corrode the once sturdy buildings. These worn pillars and crumbling structures are not totally abandoned - stories abound that murlocs and naga are slowly taking the ruins for their own.\nThe night elves have a limited presence in Darkshore. They spend much of their time keeping the area directly around the port town of Auberdine safe. The night elves subsist mainly on what they can catch in the ocean and what they can get through trade. When not fighting one another, naga and murlocs that lurk elsewhere in the ruins of Darkshore attack any travelers who look like easy pickings. Furbolgs inhabit a series of caves beneath the port. Uncultured but friendly to night elves in the past, their time in the ruins has turned many of them feral.\nGeography.\nDarkshore consists of a long strip of coastline in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It is sheltered to the east by mountains, which protect the wildlife in Darkshore from most the taint of the &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the taint has spread into Darkshore via the various rivers flowing through the zone from their sources in Felwood; bringing the taint with them which is turning the land grey and dead, and poisoning the wildlife and furbolgs with an insatiable rage. Between the mountains and the beach lies a forest consisting mainly of evergreens. To the south, the forest thickens and the mountains recede, leading into the deep wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkshore contains no dungeons of any type, and no battlegrounds. The &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; village &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; is the region's only travel hub, and Alliance aligned.\nTravel hubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; is the only travel hub in the zone, and is Alliance aligned. It provides flight paths to many areas in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and has boat access to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nDarkshore is home to several night elves of note. In the village of Auberdine, &lt;a href=\"Terenthis\"&gt;Terenthis&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young night elves to investigate the corruption of the local furbolgs. He is assisted in his efforts by &lt;a href=\"Thundris%20Windweaver\"&gt;Thundris Windweaver&lt;/a&gt;, who also seeks to uncover the secrets of the Highborne haunting the region's ruins. And in the Grove of the Ancients, the great &lt;a href=\"Onu\"&gt;Onu&lt;/a&gt; ponders the presence of the Twilight's Hammer cult at the Master's Glaive.\nQuests.\nQuests in Darkshore range from level 10-31, though most fall between 10 and 20. Quests of note in this zone include locating and assisting a dwarven prospector, investigating various taints in the local wildlife, and aiding in eliminating the menace of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkshore used to be infamous due to its multiple underwater quests, however, these quests aren't so devious now that the breath timer has been increased to three minutes."}

The islands were volcanically active.\nHistory.\nNew home of the Darkspears.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; were once part of the fragmented &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. For centuries, near-constant famine and warfare plagued the trolls. The Darkspear were smaller and as not savage and ruthless as the other tribes, and so they were easy targets to their fellow Gurubashi, who were immensely cruel to them. At some point after the first opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspears finally decided to abandon the Vale. They sailed west and settled on a remote string of islands.\nThe Judgement.\n&lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; and more Darkspear had lived in a village in one of the islands for many years. Vol'jin's father had recently had a vision where he saw his own end and realized changes were coming to the islands. Some time after, Vol'jin and Zalazane went into the jungle of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt; to be tested by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; living there. They were young, too young to do such a test, but Vol'jin wanted to become a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; before his father's vision happened.\nThe two trolls had to fight the jungle creatures and pass the tests the loa put on them. During the next months they would survive in the First Home.\nThird War.\nArrival of the Horde.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; behind at the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s stolen fleet, which was being pursued by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet, was scattered and heavily damaged by a fierce storm. The ships that remained with Thrall happened upon the islands of the Darkspear, where they landed on a cove to take refuge. After the storm passed, the orcs began to repair the vessels. Here they made peaceful contact with &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the native trolls, who believed that he had seen the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; in a vision. The &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; Sen'jin explained to them the islands used to be theirs alone, however, some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, who were part of Daelin's fleet and had also been stranded, had recently established an outpost on the islands and were warring with the natives.\nThrall and his forces attacked a nearby human camp in hopes of avoiding drawing the attention of the main outpost, but in the end, other Kul Tiran patrols encountered them. With the help of the orcs, Sen'jin also managed to purified a healing fountain which had been fouled by some strange gasses coming from underground.\nBefore the Kul Tirans could muster the strength to threaten the orcish camp, as well as to aid the Darkspears, Thrall led a siege to the human outpost, but while the battle was raging, a surprise attack by a &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s caught both forces off-guard, and Thrall, Sen'jin, and their attacking warriors, as well as the human survivors, found themselves captured.\nThe underground caverns.\nThe prisoners were taken underground, to a cavern system linking dungeons. It had a massive &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;, a great &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; and the murlocs' temple to their goddess, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded the &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;Underworld Minions&lt;/a&gt;. A troll explained to Thrall that the murlocs would kidnap surface inhabitants and take them into the caverns to be sacrificed to their deity, an appeasement apparently needed to prevent the islands' destruction. Tired of waiting, Thrall forced his way out of the prison and freed his orcish and troll companions while battling the enemy captors and the imprisoned humans.\nAfter crossing the underground fortress, the Horde forces managed to reach the altar to Zar'jira, where the murlocs had taken Sen'jin to be sacrificed. Although they managed to defeat the fish-creatures, it was too late as Sen'jin had been mortally wounded. As the caves began to collapse, Sen'jin told Thrall that according to his visions, it was he who would lead trolls off the islands. Thrall offered Sen'jin and his people a place in the Horde, which they readily accepted as they saw little future on their war-torn island home, but it was already too late for the old witch doctor.\nExodus.\nAfter escaping the caves, the Sea Witch, outraged by the defilement of her temple, revealed herself as the island's volcano erupted. The captured Horde forces returned to the orcish landing site while the witch began harrying the camp as the ships' repairs were hurriedly completed. Thrall was forced to hold off waves of murlocs while reaching the varied troll settlements and rescuing their occupants to safety. Eventually, the troll refugees and the orcs got on the ships in time and escaped the devastation brought upon the island. The Sea Witch threatened the sailing ships that the Dark Tide would be coming for them, and there would be nowhere for them to hide.\nAftermath.\nThe island and its settlements were thought to be destroyed and sunk as the Horde sailed away to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. However, many trolls decided to remain behind for the time being.\nAfter three months in the jungle of the First Home, Sen'jin's son, Vol'jin, and Zalazane finally returned after succeeding in their trials. Once back to their village, the young trolls saw that it had been attacked. As they walked to the settlement, they saw the troll bodies arranged on the edge of the village while the other trolls put them in positions of peace. Vol'jin and Zalazane walked towards the center of the village and on their way there they saw crews of trolls building lots of ships in a nearby lagoon. Once they reached the village's center while watching all the misery and death, Master Gadrin approached the young trolls and explained to them what happened, yet Vol'jin somehow already knew, as if the loa spirits had shown it to him. Taking charge of the evacuation and with the help of Zalazane, Vol'jin helped his people to prepare for their final leave.\nAfter gathering as many supplies as they could, the Darkspear struck out west after the Horde, hoping to find peace and rejoin their brethren in the distant lands of Kalimdor.\nGeography.\nThe island Thrall visited was divided by some smaller islands. It also had an active volcano. There were few &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; villages dotting it; a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; outpost and some smaller camps; and some &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; settlements. An underground fortress occupied by &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and gnolls was seemingly located under the volcano.\nThe jungle of &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt; grew on one of the islands and was filled with &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. The village of Vol'jin and Sen'jin was on that same island and had a lagoon nearby.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Darkspear islands (not used as a proper noun) were the former home of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; and were located near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s were defeated the first time, the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; split up, and the Darkspear tribe set off to claim their own lands, or possibly reclaim them (hinting that they settled on these islands at a previous point).\n\"&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" states that the Darkspear tribe before the Third War lived in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, on an island near the Maelstrom.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, he was shipwrecked on one lone island somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; that was close to the Maelstrom. It was here that he met the Darkspear trolls and saved them from zealous &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, thereby enlisting them as members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall and his orcs were fleeing from a human internment camp when they crashed into one of the Darkspear islands, near the Maelstrom.\nThe Darkspear refugees had lost their homeland \u2014 which had sunk to the bottom of the sea \u2014 and they agreed to travel to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with Thrall. The alliance between the Darkspear and the Horde thus began.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spitescale\"&gt;Spitescale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; may have previously inhabited these islands.\nLocation.\nThe \"Warcraft III\" map suggests the islands were located very close to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Later the troll race page on the official website stated they were located in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Visual%20Guide\"&gt;Ultimate Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;s\" says that the Darkspear tribe were forced to relocate to an island in the Great Sea. Rather than a group of islands, it also mentions one island.\n states that Thrall landed there when he was crossing the Great Sea. It also says that the Darkspears relocated on the string of islands (more, rather than one) west of Stranglethorn, whose coast meets the South Seas.\nIt could be speculated that the Darkspear Islands were located somewhere on the border of the South Seas and the rest of the Great Sea.\nIt should be noted that the Maelstrom in the RPG was part of the South Seas."}

After liberating the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; from Garrosh's Kor'kron, capturing &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and cutting off the roads to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin allied with the Alliance to lay siege to Orgrimmar itself to end Garrosh's reign. After Garrosh was deposed, the rebellion was reorganized into a new Horde with Vol'jin as Warchief, which led him to take up residence in Orgrimmar.\nThe rebellion took place during , a &lt;a href=\"world%20event\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt; that lasted the length of &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3.0\"&gt;Patch 5.3.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nAllies.\nVol'jin's dialogue during the event indicates that most of the non-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; Horde is supportive of the Darkspear Rebellion. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; in particular is backing Vol'jin's efforts, and the chieftain vaguely mentions &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; needing no excuse to depose Garrosh. However, with his eastern allies across the sea (and the former still finishing up on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;), Vol'jin is forced to collaborate his initial push against Garrosh with only the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; Horde. Through the quest chain, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; also ostensibly pledge themselves to the cause through &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, though their forces are stretched thin with many of their people still in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a number of neighboring orcs also denounce Garrosh as Warchief and lend aid to the rebellion. The &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; is also explicitly reporting to Vol'jin, though where this leaves &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; and the bulk of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; is unclear.\nHorde &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s of all races are instructed to take part in the rebellion. If the player is an orc, Vol'jin's standard greetings dialogue will change somewhat, questioning whether Garrosh's self-destructive Horde (of which the player is reaping no benefits from, unlike the \"fat and happy\" &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;) is something the orc player sees value in at this point. \nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are also instructed to lend aid to the burgeoning rebellion, to ensure Garrosh's forces (themselves anticipating and preparing for an Alliance invasion) do not gain a momentum over the outnumbered trolls. tasks the &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; to speak on behalf of the Alliance and to represent its interests to Vol'jin, whose trust the player earns at the culmination of the quest chain."}

During &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s exodus from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde rescued the Darkspears from the mysterious &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;. The Darkspear tribe owed Thrall and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s a great debt and allied themselves with the Horde in gratitude.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; and then later his son, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear tribe became integral to the Horde, with Vol'jin acting as one of the most trusted advisers to the leaders of the Horde. This culminated with the troll himself becoming Warchief, though he would later be slain defending Azeroth against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. With his passing, the tribe went leaderless for a time, before &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; was approached by the leaders of the Horde to take up the mantle. Despite his death, Vol'jin is still active among his people as a spirit, having communicated with them throughout their adventures on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, and was key in advising &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; when she was troubled in her path.\nHistory.\nOnce a part of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the portion that would eventually become Darkspear suffered heavily when the empire split into separate tribes as they were smaller than the rest.\nThe Darkspear are mortal enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. They were also at war with the &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt; for years and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodscalp tribe&lt;/a&gt; is also said to be their enemy.\nDuring their time in Stranglethorn, they would be plagued by constant famine and warfare for centuries as they were not so savage and ruthless like the other tribes, and that made them an easy target.\nThird War and aftermath.\nAs tribal rivalries erupted throughout the former &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear tribe found themselves driven from their homeland in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. This occurred at some point after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; opened, as the tribe was familiar with the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mai%27Zoth\"&gt;Mai'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; and ogres only came to Azeroth with the portal. Having settled on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20islands\"&gt;Darkspear islands&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe soon found themselves entangled in a conflict with a group of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, they also found new enemies in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s when a &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;-fleet landed on the island in search for some orcs who had stolen some ships. The trolls' fate seemed sealed until the orcish &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his band of newly freed orcs, which were the orcs the humans were looking for, took shelter on the island after a heavy storm. The orcs managed to defeat the humans, but their victory was short-lived. Controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;Underworld Minions&lt;/a&gt; captured the Darkspears' leader &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; along with Thrall and several orcs, trolls, and humans. They were all brought to a complex prison made by caves below the island. Thrall managed to free himself and his companions but was ultimately unable to save the trolls' leader. Although Sen'jin was sacrificed to the Sea Witch, he was able to reveal a vision he had in which Thrall would lead the Darkspear trolls from the island.\nAfter returning to the island's surface, Thrall and his followers managed to fend off further attacks by the Sea Witch and her murloc minions and set sail for Kalimdor once again. Under the new leadership of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear swore allegiance to Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and followed him to Kalimdor. Now considered enemies by all other troll organizations except the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; tribes, the Darkspear are held in contempt to this day. Yet, the Darkspear have not forgotten being driven from their ancestral homes, and this animosity is eagerly returned - especially towards the other jungle trolls. Having reached and founded the orc's new homeland, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls carved out another home for themselves \u2014 this time among the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern shores of the new orc kingdom.\nHowever, with another approach by Kul Tiras and its navy, the Darkspear were forced to retreat inland under an onslaught of &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s of the commander Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls &lt;a href=\"Troll%20berserker\"&gt;berserkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bat%20rider\"&gt;bat rider&lt;/a&gt;s, fighting alongside their Horde brethren led by the &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, evacuated their tribe to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. There, they helped the Horde in gathering an army to fight against the Admiral in Theramore. Eventually, the enemy armada was defeated and the trolls returned to Echo Isles, only to be later betrayed by a witch doctor named &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; who began using dark magic to take the minds of his fellow Darkspear. As his army of mindless followers grew, Vol'jin ordered the free trolls to evacuate once again, and Zalazane took control of the Echo Isles. The Darkspear have since settled on the nearby shore, naming their new village after their old leader, Sen'jin. From &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; they, along with their allies, send forces to battle Zalazane and his enslaved army. The Darkspears' efforts, however, failed to drive Zalazane from the Echo Isles.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDarkspear tribe members are found in Horde settlements across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, participating in various campaigns. Notably, they set up the bases of &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malaka%27jin\"&gt;Malaka'jin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. They also coordinated efforts against the other jungle troll tribes in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and to save &lt;a href=\"Yenniku\"&gt;Yenniku&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Darkspears arrived in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"Trol%27Kalar\"&gt;Trol'Kalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, several Darkspear trolls joined the &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; force in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, while others, commanded by &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt;, established a fairly large presence in the swamplands of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they sought to not only establish a solid base for the Horde in which they could defend the area against Alliance attacks and other threats, but to commune with and possibly call on the spirits of the broken world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nMembers of the Darkspear tribe were seen among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; led a group of dragon-hunters and established a small camp named &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Dragon's Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the victory against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the frozen continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin renewed his bid to defeat Zalazane and launched a brilliant assault on the isles. With the help of the tribe's ancestral loa, the courageous Darkspears killed the maddened witch doctor and seized their embattled home. Of late, political changes within the Horde have sparked fears among the Darkspear tribe regarding its future. Vol'jin's close ally Thrall recently named Garrosh Hellscream temporary Horde warchief. Thus far, the brash young orc has put the Darkspear leader and his tribe on edge, causing many trolls to leave the Horde capital, Orgrimmar. Although spirits are high among the Darkspears after &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Zalazane's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, tension lingers concerning what place the trolls will have in Garrosh's Horde.\nCataclysm.\nWith the changes wrought by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s into the original &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls repurposed the rest of the valley, transforming it into a troll district.\nWith the trolls controlling their home again, &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, leading her &lt;a href=\"Spitescale\"&gt;Spitescale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Soon her subjects and the sea witch herself were defeated by the trolls.\nDarkspears expanded their views and learned the ways of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, joining the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nA small group of Darkspear trolls returned to the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, establishing &lt;a href=\"Bambala\"&gt;Bambala&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the Cataclysm, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s gathered together Azeroth's troll tribes in an attempt to unify them and restore them to their former glory - even if it meant turning against the other races of Azeroth. Despite ensuring the aid of &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari failed in securing the allegiance Vol'jin and the Darkspear who view the Horde as their true people. Knowing the grave threat on the horizon and realizing that the Horde alone could not stop it, the Darkspear sent emissaries to both the Horde and the Alliance to combat the emerging threats in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; failed to successfully assassinate the Darkspear Chieftain Vol'jin, the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, declaring martial law. The hostile Kor'kron were defeated, Echo Isles liberated, and its inhabitants were protected by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Horde loyalists. As the events against Garrosh escalated, the Darkspears living in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; were placed under martial law.\nFortunately, Vol'jin recovered from his wounds in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and returned to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;: an open Horde rebellion against Garrosh's tyranny. The Kor'kron returned and this time attacked &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; but failed to take it. After acquiring all the allies he could, he took the fight to Garrosh's loyalists across &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and ; culminating with Garrosh being overthrown in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Having earned the respect of the other Horde revolutionaries, Vol'jin was named the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWith Vol'jin as the new Warchief of the Horde, several headhunters have become guards of Orgrimmar along with tauren and many &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and other members of the tribe were deployed to the alternate , establishing &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Darkspear's Edge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, serving the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and taking an active role in the events in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, , and &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; during the final push against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion invaded Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; fought on the front lines along the Darkspear. In the heat of battle, he was gravely wounded, and his spirit later passed into the realm beyond. Though his tragic death at the fateful &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; shook Darkspear society to its core, the Darkspear trolls are still as committed to the cause of the Horde as they ever were. With Vol'jin's death the tribe became leaderless and were figuring things out during the Legion's invasion.\nFollowing the attaining of Prestige rank 2, the player is congratulated by the various leaders of the Horde, and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; is present in lieu of the late Vol'jin.\nMembers of the Darkspear tribe joined various &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter the Legion's defeat, they participated in the Orgrimmar parade, awaiting Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;. The Darkspears still have no new leader, though Rokhan and Gadrin may be potential public faces. Sylvanas plans to appoint someone she can work with and control, before the trolls choose someone who might want to challenge her position. The trolls also attended a dinner ceremony and participated in the presentation of their ritual, an idea requested by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bwemba\"&gt;Bwemba&lt;/a&gt; then attended the dinner itself with Horde leaders.\nFollowing the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde, a troll was seen assisting the elves with cleaning the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn expedition of Darkspears led by &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; worked alongside the Zandalari and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; on Zandalar, battling the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The tribe led the efforts to recruit the Zandalari to join the Horde, showing up prominently throughout both &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, where they were granted an embassy of their own, and &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, where they aided with gathering the various Loa of the swamplands to the cause of the Zandalari to combat &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Talanji%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Talanji's Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. So close did the two tribes grow that Talanji attempted to honor the tribe and their fallen chieftain by allowing him to rest in &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, typically a place reserved for Zandalari kings and queens, before the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. The Darkspear were also key in helping Talanji come to terms with her role as a leader in Zandalari society; with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; advising the princess several times. \nRokhan also led the tribe in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, where the Darkspear would take to the field in force. There, they fielded all manner of troll warriors, including &lt;a href=\"troll%20golem\"&gt;troll golem&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time, known as &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Trollem\"&gt;Darkspear Trollem&lt;/a&gt;s. The tribe was one of three major forces in the region, fighting alongside the veterans of the Horde led by &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and the elves of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. They were also key during invasions in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, where they worked alongside Zandalari witch doctors to invoke voodoo spirits to attack the Alliance at &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt;'s behest.\nThe tribe defended the city of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; alongside various races of the Horde and the Zandalari. Darkspear trolls were present in the procession for &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; after his death in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. They were later guests of honor during &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation as Queen, where &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; represented the tribe in special garb and rode alongside the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; as part of Talanji's personal entourage. During this time, the spirit of Vol'jin watched on as Talanji underwent her trials by the Loa to be appointed the new queen as well. Rokhan appeared as a vision by &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, to represent the Zandalari's new pact with the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit broke free of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s grasp and attacked the Darkspear on the Echo Isles in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of the tribe sided with &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s rebellion during the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The troll, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, who had acted as Saurfang's confidant, stood alongside him in his final moments until his mak'gora with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, the leadership of the Horde requested Rokhan to take up the mantle of chieftain for the Darkspear tribe, which he accepted.\nCulture.\nUntil they joined the Horde, the Darkspear tribe were cannibals. Since then, they officially gave up &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to have a fondness for rice.\nIt is common practice in the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; for Darkspear to either sleep directly on the hard ground, or lay out rough mats outside of huts to sleep on.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Snake\"&gt;crimson snake&lt;/a&gt; is favored among the Darkspear trolls for not only its vicious nature, but also its steadfast loyalty.\nThe Darkspears participate in &lt;a href=\"pohkisa\"&gt;pohkisa&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the night of remembrance. Each month when the light of the white moon is lowest, the trolls celebrate family lost in the previous moon cycle. It starts slow and somber, with names of the dead sung in the chorus of their mourning songs. Soon, the sadness disappears as the heartbeat of the drum circle swells with pride as they celebrate the safe passage of their loved ones into Bwonsamdi's care.\nPhilosophies.\nDarkspear trolls are often found in the company of reptiles. Their mounts are raptors, they sell snakes as pets, and their shadow hunters summon cobras. According to &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Janidi\"&gt;Seer Janidi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zabra%27jin\"&gt;Zabra'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear consider the serpent to be a powerful spirit, but they disdain bird spirits as \"weak, capricious, and best left to the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Nimboya\"&gt;Nimboya&lt;/a&gt; refers to a \"Great Serpent\", likely a serpentine &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; though which one is unknown.\nSome Darkspear seek to enter the realm of &lt;a href=\"Samedi\"&gt;Samedi&lt;/a&gt;, loa of the Dead when they meet their demise. &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; is a loa who watches over the tribe's dead and has close ties to Vol'jin.\nIt appeared to have been a custom when they lived in Stranglethorn Vale to give troll youths to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the other jungle troll tribes, the Darkspear are shown to be quite egalitarian in regards to gender. Some female trolls wear wedding nose rings.\nThe story about &lt;a href=\"Gri%27lek\"&gt;Gri'lek&lt;/a&gt; is sacred to the Darkspear trolls.\nOccasionally, some Darkspear &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; travel to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to live with the tauren and adopt their ways. &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; refers to these trolls as \"blue tauren\".\nThey would seem to be skilled with alchemy based on the troll bat riders' skill with chemicals and the ability to upgrade Headhunters to Berserkers apparently through potions.\nWhen a troll of the Darkspear tribe dies, they get &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;cremated on a ritual pyre&lt;/a&gt; and their ashes are stored within an urn.\nDarkspear loa.\nOriginally part of the Gurubashi Empire, the Darkspear continue to worship many of the Gurubashi loa. In addition to them, they also worship &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian of the Dead. On the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Night\"&gt;Isle of Night&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspears leave offerings on the small shrine dedicated to the bat loa &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain the loa's blessing of safe passage under the cover of darkness. After the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; made an offering to &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkspear trolls.\nOne tribe of jungle trolls was forced to overcome its prejudices when it encountered the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and his mighty Horde. The trolls of the Darkspear tribe, long since exiled from their ancestral lands in Stranglethorn Vale, were nearly destroyed by a band of aquatic &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, but Thrall and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; managed to save them. In return, the grateful trolls swore an oath of eternal allegiance to the Horde.\nLed by the cunning shadow hunter, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear trolls now make their home in Durotar along with their orcish allies. Their village, named after their fallen tribal elder &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, lies along the eastern coast of the harsh, rocky land. The Darkspear tribe also occupies tracks within the nearby jungles of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs part of the Horde, the trolls have extended their loyalty to the mighty &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, but they have little trust for the manipulative &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, whom they believe will visit only misery and strife upon their allies. It is not explicitly known what they initially thought of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, but since the elves were addicted to and freely practiced demonic magic, it is likely that the trolls did not think much higher of them than they do of the Forsaken. However, during the Rise of the Zandalari, the Darkspears worked together with the sin'dorei and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; rangers against the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari allies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsland Trolls.\n\"Island Trolls\" was the name, which later was &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned to Darkspear tribe, given to this group of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the ' demo. The missions involving them were not included in the retail release; however, they did reappear in ' as a custom campaign.\nThis could suggest that the Darkspear trolls, while once being jungle trolls, have become and may be considered island trolls.\nAppearance.\nDarkspear trolls have skin colors that range from pale, ghostly blue to bruised purple to sickly green. Their skin color is usually just one of those three colors, although sometimes there are trolls with mixed skin pigments but this is not so popular. Male trolls are hunched over in &lt;a href=\"WoW\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt; and generally have long, protruding tusks that grow from under their upper or lower lip. Male trolls also have rather long noses and very messy, matted hair. Female trolls, on the other hand, stand up straight and erect in &lt;a href=\"WoW\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt;, have rather small or squashed-in noses, and usually have hair in a wild updo or strewn across their breasts in thick braids.\nClasses.\nTroll characters can play as a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%26amp%3B%20Horde%20Compendium\"&gt;Alliance &amp; Horde Compendium&lt;/a&gt;\" mistakenly calls the Darkspear tribe the Darkspear clan.\n&lt;a href=\"Vok%27fon\"&gt;Vok'fon&lt;/a&gt; is a Darkspear outcast because he openly spoke against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that they would make the Darkspears weak. &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Bloodteeth\"&gt;Ana Bloodteeth&lt;/a&gt; is another Darkspear who left the tribe because she wouldn't abandon cannibalism.\nTheir relationship with the noble orcs and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; has begun to change the Darkspear trolls' savage natures. Darkspear trolls, however, deny their dark legacy. The Horde has taught them camaraderie, restraint and, to a lesser extent, kindness. They tell tales of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Witch%20Hut\"&gt;green witch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the Darkspears, two philosophies hold equal sway.\nThe Darkspears who were present when Thrall saved their tribe hold a great respect for the orc leader. Thrall\u2019s spirituality and strength intrigued them, and the trolls decided that Thrall\u2019s teachings held merit. These trolls see shamanism as a way to improve their race. They choose to live in the future. They enjoy their alliance with the Horde and support their new allies by revering what they revere. \nFemale trolls hold no place in regular troll society. Male trolls consider them mates, nothing more \u2014 though they honor female trolls who prove themselves in battle. Tauren (and orcs, due to a recent decree from Thrall) value their females as more than mates and allow them to rise to positions of power. Female Darkspears find this concept interesting, and some choose to live in the future because they sense it affords them greater opportunities than standard troll culture. \nMaking a choice and implementing that choice are two different things, though. The Darkspears who try to live in the future struggle to reconcile their old habits with these new ways. Some come closer to the target than others, but what marks these trolls is their willingness to try.\nTrolls who live in the future pursue the paths of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Darkspears were in big trouble, and then Thrall saved them. The tribe swore loyalty to Thrall and joined the Horde, but some still cling to the old ways. They value their elaborate, structured culture, but they know the Horde does not approve. These trolls decided to do what it takes. They maintain the facade of embracing shamanism but either practice their voodoo traditions in secret or blend the two in a strange amalgam. The Darkspears who have not entirely discarded their tie to voodoo don\u2019t see themselves as betraying their Horde allies. They serve Thrall with utter loyalty but remain pragmatic. Should the Horde fail the trolls, they have their ancestral faith to fall back on. Trolls who do what it takes also favor the witch doctor class, but carefully avoid the darker aspects of the calling (at least when other races are watching).\nThey can be &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potion%20doc\"&gt;potion doc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;primals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"wilderness%20stalker\"&gt;wilderness stalker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe trolls of the Darkspear tribe lived in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, on an island near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, practicing their ancient cannibalistic variety of &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and tainted shamanism. The Darkspear tribe had few enemies; they fought with the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s on occasion, and perhaps a night elf here and there, but generally these trolls were highly secluded and had very little contact with the remainder of the world.\nSpeculation.\nThe exact date of their exile from &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; is not stated, but due to the mention of how they remember &lt;a href=\"Mai%27Zoth\"&gt;Mai'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the exile may have happened some time after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, considering Mai'Zoth was likely created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; during the war. Alternatively, it could have happened as early as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, as Mai'Zoth could have been a rare example of a naturally born ogre mage who traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

It feeds on &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;unnamed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; was foretold to stop the Darkstorm, and it lent its grace to shield the world. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, the naaru was protected by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Order of the Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, with his brother &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; becoming a member as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Highlord Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; wished to spread the strength and corruption of the Legion across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;, with Azeroth resisting due to the protection from the naaru. Greydon was bestowed the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; who kept it for himself instead of giving it to the superior swordsman that was Silverlaine. The two brothers fell out, and Silverlaine stole the naaru's blade and went to confront the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of killing him, Silverlaine was convinced to join the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; instead. When Silverlaine returned to the order, he killed the naaru, shattering the Diamond Blade and the order. Despite the Legion's victory, the Darkstorm couldn't come. The naaru's essence survived in the shards of the Diamond Blade. Over the years, Greydon and later his son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt; and adoptive daughter &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; were gathering the shards all over the world.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, the Darkstorm was kept in an altar in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; as a purple mass of liquid shadows, ever moving, ever whispering of unspeakable secrets. In the meantime, Greydon and Aram were captured in the stronghold, and Makasa, wielding the reforged Diamond Blade, led an army there in order to rescue her family. If Xaraax could obtain the Diamond Blade, he could destroy it and nothing would stop the Darkstorm. A great battle ensued that resulted in Malus, who had been deemed useless by the demonlord, betraying Xaraax when he was about to corrupt the Diamond Blade. Malus impaled the dreadlord on the altar that swallowed him, hoping it would send him to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted Malus ordered his servants to bring his bodyguards, the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s to fuel the Darkstorm, and then he would feed it Greydon, whose essence it needed. The ogres and imps were sucked and the slithering mass became a portal, the beginnings of the Darkstorm, and with whispers emanating from within, louder more sinister, and in language too frenzied to make out. Soon it expanded into a black vortex. In the following chaos, Makasa and her friends, Malus and his demons, and the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; fought against their enemies. Eventually, Aram gave Makasa an opening to deal with Malus. As Makasa killed Malus with her Diamond Harpoon, the Darkstorm roared, and then its energies dissipated, ending the Darkstorm threat."}

This culminates in a confrontation with Chief Darktide Engineer &lt;a href=\"Razz%20Ricketroz\"&gt;Razz Ricketroz&lt;/a&gt; atop the mountain as he tries to tame the &lt;a href=\"Darktide%20Matriarch\"&gt;Darktide Matriarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssault on Darktide Roost.\nTo complete the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Darktide%20Roost\"&gt;Assault on Darktide Roost&lt;/a&gt; daily, players can kill Iron Horde personnel and the local wildlife, burn banners, or collect rylak eggs.

Go west to find the silithid hive in Un'Goro Crater and obtain a scent \ngland from one of the bugs. I'll also need some samples of the native Un'Goro soil.\nProgress.\nFinding a suitable scent gland might take a bit - the gland can't be damaged, but the process of getting one certainly doesn't lend itself to it. As for the soil, \nI'd assume it should be easy enough to find.\nAnyway, do you have the items I need to make the lure?\nCompletion.\nThe scent gland, ah yes. The membrane appears intact - excellent. The soil, yes, this should work out perfectly. With my special additions, I should be able \nto grind all this up into the perfect lure.\nGive me a moment to make the lure, &lt;name&gt;.

In the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Chamber of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, the rogue hero met the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Council of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; who invited them to take their seat as the final Shadow, and help them lead the Uncrowned.\nAfter the presentation of the secret organization, their methods, and their goals, the now complete Council of Shadows organized itself to obtain the legendary artifacts that are &lt;a href=\"The%20Kingslayers\"&gt;The Kingslayers&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;The Dreadblades&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fate\"&gt;Fate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Gorefang\"&gt;Gorefang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akaari%27s%20Will\"&gt;Akaari's Will&lt;/a&gt;, to equip their champion who operate outside and vanquishes their foes.\nThe Shadow Council celebrated their success over glasses of wine after successfully securing all of the artifacts, but they were poisoned by &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, Kingpin of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, who had survived in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; through the use of neurotoxin against its opponents. However, she was defeated by the Last Shadow, and had no other choice but to serve the latter or to be executed by the Uncrowned. She chose the second option and joined the ranks of the organization with her men.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Uncrowned began to mobilize their agents on the Broken Isles. Subsequently they organize the recruitment and training of new agents, with among the members of the Defias Brotherhood, under &lt;a href=\"Lonika%20Stillblade\"&gt;Lonika Stillblade&lt;/a&gt; who founded the &lt;a href=\"Lonika%27s%20School%20of%20Roguery\"&gt;School of Roguery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the recruitment of &lt;a href=\"Winstone%20Wolfe\"&gt;Winstone Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; into their ranks, the Uncrowned became interested in the discovery of the body of an agent in the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;sewers of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing that the SI:7 would take too much interest in them, Ravenholdt sent his agents to investigate the situation in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; had increased the number of agents he has in Horde territory, and ordered the elimination of &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt;.\nRealizing that something was wrong with Shaw's behavior, the Uncrowned began to investigate the relationship between the SI:7 and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Blade\"&gt;Red Blade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Citrine%20Bay\"&gt;Citrine Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that the Spymaster ordered the pirates to execute Amber Kearnen in exchange for access to Stormwind Harbor and a royal pardon for their past crimes committed. They also got their hands on a mysterious letter with a complex code, and began to decipher it to find out the reasons for Mathias to eliminate his best agent.\nFollowing the recruitment of &lt;a href=\"Yancey%20Grillsen\"&gt;Yancey Grillsen&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for recruiting more pirates into their ranks, the Uncrowned mobilized to create diversions in order to prevent the SI:7 from being present in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; and staying away from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, while they continue to decipher the letter.\nTo discover the contents of the letter, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; investigated with the Last Shadow on a magical jewel, &lt;a href=\"The%20Raven%27s%20Eye\"&gt;The Raven's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, created by the vrykul &lt;a href=\"Havi\"&gt;Havi&lt;/a&gt;, and which was once used by &lt;a href=\"Ravencrest\"&gt;Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;'s almost perfect espionage team during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of their research, they finally managed to get it from &lt;a href=\"Dantalionax\"&gt;Dantalionax&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow in possession of the Raven's Eye, the Uncrowned used it to decipher the encrypted SI:7 Letter and discovered that Mathias Shaw had been kidnapped following a demon attack led by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; who took his place to manipulate the SI:7 and the Alliance, which explained the murder of Amber Kearnen who knew the truth. The Order reacts in consequence by telling the truth to &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the Alliance from being devoured from within by the Legion, while searching through the Broken Isles to find the Spymaster. They eventually discovered that he was being held captive at &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and called on &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; to create an explosive diversion for the Last Shadow and &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; to save Mathias Shaw from his &lt;a href=\"Vaultwarden%20Umbra\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce free, Mathias Shaw thanked the Uncrowned for their help and announced that he knew about Detheroc's plans to create an open conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, so that the Legion can prevail. The Spymaster then came up with an infiltration plan to eliminate Detheroc, which was accepted by the Council of Shadows. The Champions of the Uncrowned carried out the plan by infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded in revealing Detheroc's true identity before eliminating him, preventing the rise of a conflict between the two factions, and allowing Mathias Shaw to resume his post, now an ally of the Uncrowned.\nFor their many exploits, the Last Shadow obtained the title of Shadowblade from Lord Jorach Ravenholdt, and also the &lt;a href=\"Shadowblade%27s%20Murderous%20Omen\"&gt;Shadowblade's Murderous Omen&lt;/a&gt; after they deal with the &lt;a href=\"Homunculi\"&gt;Homunculi&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; in the Hall of Shadows and in the cities of the Alliance and the Horde.\nFollowing their victory, the Uncrowned joined the other orders, represented by Jorach Ravenholdt, to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. Their agents were present to repel the legion's assault on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and to fight alongside their allies during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. They were also present on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying the Shadowblade to fight the demons and protect the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter the Fourth War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Mathias Shaw mentions in his report that the Uncrowned are still active with Jorach Ravenholdt at their head, and that among them &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; are still active and recognized members of the organization.\nThe Spymaster even took advantage of his cooperation with the Uncrowned to meet and engage the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Narsilla%20Keensight\"&gt;Narsilla Keensight&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed Lancer, who spies on the Horde for SI:7 interests.\nShadowlands.\nThe Uncrowned are present in the rogue section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Veruca%20Darkstream\"&gt;Veruca Darkstream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thega%20Graveblade\"&gt;Thega Graveblade&lt;/a&gt; as rogue trainers.\nMembers.\nCouncil of Shadows.\nThe Council of Shadows are the leaders of the Uncrowned, but the main leader is &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroops.\nThey deploy &lt;a href=\"Gang%20of%20Bandits\"&gt;gangs of bandits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Thieves\"&gt;Defias thieves&lt;/a&gt;, crews of pirates, Uncrowned duelists, and &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Assassin\"&gt;Ravenholdt assassins&lt;/a&gt;."}

They derive power from &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Most common examples being &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, undead are typically mindless, bloodthirsty fiends hostile toward any living thing that comes across their path. But some have managed to retain their memories and be who they were in life.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, they are all soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the armies that serve as the first line of defense in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, and that honor those who seek power and glory in battle. All of them receive a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;' power in order to carry out their duty.\nBackground.\nNecromancy and the creation of undead soldiers were invented by the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; who use undead as a militia force to use in defense of that entire plane, should it come under attack. Somehow, their knowledge came to be known by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, as well as (and, in some cases, through them) various mortals.\nUndead have appeared all throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they were used as a combat tool during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; when the nathrezim used them to scour the remains of Suramar, and once again during &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; animated &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead\"&gt;skeletal warriors&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the essence of those necrolytes was used to power the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; during their creation.\nLater, the studies of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; took an important role and were used heavily in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; resurrecting the majority of the dead denizens, including sapient races and animals, under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. In modern times, the main groups of undead are the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nRacial history.\n&lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, birthplace of necromantic magic, the undead Maldraxxi were unified under an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. They are split into five houses that pledged unending loyalty to the Primus, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;; each with their own specialties to protect the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nA great portion of the human denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; propagated by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. First under the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; influence, they managed to get free thanks to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the weakening of the Lich King in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. After a &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; led by Sylvanas, the undeath survivors proclaimed themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, with Sylvanas Windrunner as their Queen, and vowed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately the Lich King himself.\nThe Forsaken capital, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, is located under the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruins of Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. It is a place of dark, somber colors but it has inns, forges, and businesses that cater not only to the undead but visitors from the Horde, with whom the Forsaken have allied themselves.\nFree will is one of the cornerstones of Forsaken culture, with the great capacity for both good and evil that it entails. However, some undead, especially those who die in combat or under extreme stress and are raised soon after, enter into a violent, frenzied state. Undead in this state are easily manipulated and their rage is often directed at the foes of those who raised them. After the effects wear off, if the risen corpse has not been destroyed, they are given the same ultimatum that other Forsaken are offered: join the Dark Lady or return to the grave.\nEach Forsaken member follows their queen for various reasons: fear, loyalty, and nowhere else to go.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe majority of Darkfallen are &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; that were resurrected in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and in the later years by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself. There are also some resurrected &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; for example the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. As undead, these elves have now blood-red eyes and deathly pale skin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; are a sect of &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampyr&lt;/a&gt; Darkfallen in service to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. They mostly retain the builds of their still-living kin, however, unlike blood elves, their flesh appears necrotic and, though universally pale, ranges from fleshy pinks and red to gray and light green, and they tend to have either white, blond or dark hair while their eyes have white, green, blue or black glows. Some San'layn have clawed fingers and ears more closely resembling those of a bat; in addition, a few have developed wings.\nBiology.\nThere are many different kinds of undead, but they have some common traits, such as deteriorating skin or generally unkempt hair.\nIncorporeal undead are composed of a substance called &lt;a href=\"ectoplasm\"&gt;ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;, which can have different consistencies depending on climate. Powerful undead are sometimes so infused with evil that it coalesces into a greenish goo known as the &lt;a href=\"Ichor%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;ichor of undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Some undead bleed this green liquid when wounded, though some have no blood or liquid running through their bodies at all. The majority of undead are in a &lt;a href=\"mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless state&lt;/a&gt;, without knowing or controlling their bodies but if the body is kept intact, they could potentially avoid this altogether and live forever. The undead normally do not sleep, as it is not necessary for them. There are cases of undead sleeping, especially death knights and Forsaken, but it is seemingly only to rest their bodies. Some undead feel the need to breathe, though they can last at least a dozen days without taking a fresh breath of air, depending on the type of undeath but as they are undead, they don't need air to live. Undead are capable of eating, but they don't need to. They can become drunk, but they do not experience the same pleasure from alcohol as the living do, and the Scourge warned its members that \"Alcohol is simply not the same\". Some undead can smell.\nBeing an undead has advantages such as dismemberment not being enough to be killed. Some can also reattach their limbs and joints, or replace their body parts by harvesting and sewing on the body parts of others, eat other humanoids and undead, and drain the life force of others. If you want to truly kill an undead for sure, you have to burn the remains of a destroyed body. The &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is known to cause intense pain to the undead, but if used with the intention of healing, though very painful, it is effective. &lt;a href=\"Holy%20water\"&gt;Holy water&lt;/a&gt; blessed by the Light has a damaging effect on the undead.\nNature of undeath.\nGreat Dark Beyond.\nIn the physical universe, the souls of the undead (Forsaken, death knights, or ghouls) are imperfectly attached to their bodies; the dark magic that sustains them is a buffer that prevents their souls from properly joining with their bodies. This is why undead feel only faint sensations of pain or discomfort from most physical stimuli, and why the Light is so painful to their existence. The primary exception to this rule are liches, as liches bind their souls to a phylactery and then use the phylactery to generate a physical form; this process is why lich bodies look nothing like their mortal bodies, and also why you have to destroy a lich's phylactery to truly kill them. Undeath also strips certain parts away from every soul.\nDespite all this, there exists at least one account of someone becoming undead through the power of the Light: &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from their affliction, some undead also suffer from an addiction to terrible vices. &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, for example, possess an addiction to inflicting pain. If death knights do not regularly inflict agony upon another creature, they begin to suffer wracking pains that could drive them into a mindless, blood-seeking hysteria. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have a hungering for living flesh and &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; have been known to consume blood.\nGenerally, most enslaved undead are tormented and restless by their subjugation. Some welcome it if it grants them the benefits of eternal life. Many undead who are sentient enough to understand their circumstances appear emotionally dispassionate if not melancholy. The most known emotions that the undead seem to emote are remorse, pity, or rage. Some undead, especially those who die in combat or under extreme stress and are raised soon after, enter into a violent, frenzied state. Undead in this state are easily manipulated and their rage is often directed at the foes of those who raised them.\nBecoming Forsaken is an unpredictable process. The body and mind are certain to change, but it is impossible to know to what extent and how well someone will cope with the process. According to &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, everyone go a little mad when they become Forsaken, and some more than others.\nUndead experience dulled senses such as touch, smell, and taste. Some find that while their rotted tongues can taste very little, they've become accustomed to the textures and sensations of food instead. There are reports that when influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, some Forsaken have slowly experienced a sharpening of their dulled senses, as well as an increase in the flashes of positive emotions that have otherwise become rare since their fall into undeath. The drawback, however, is that they also become disgusted with themselves and are likely to increase attempts at their own self-destruction; for regaining these senses would force the undead to smell their own rotting flesh, taste the decay in their mouths and throats, and even feel the maggots burrowing within their bodies.\nSome of those that freed themselves from the Lich King's grasp are tormented by memories of the unspeakable horrors that they committed as mindless Scourge agents and are driven into madness or consumed by regret, whereas others embrace their new condition and may go on to indulge in their vile vices. Others don't even remember their time as a mindless slave of the Scourge and so bear no emotional trauma from it at all. Thought the person might be traumatized by their experience as an undead, once released their soul will be &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;judged&lt;/a&gt; by the entirety of their existence, and, as such, they might still reach a positive afterlife.\nShadowlands.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; magic, the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the ambitious and contentious are forged into an immortal army charged with the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. It is a place all about &lt;a href=\"Flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh shaping&lt;/a&gt; and resources given to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; to become the best army they can. Someone arriving in Maldraxxus is given a very basic kind of form that they can inhabit and then based on their victories or their losses they get upgrades or downgrades to that body, while masters of the powers of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; turn legions of ambitious souls into relentless immortal armies, and necrotic soldiers are forged by an eternity of war or are made from the bodies taken as spoils of war.\nTypes of undead.\nCorporeal.\nCorporeal undead are average corpses or body parts reanimated by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, or are various body parts stitched together into abominations.\nSkeletal.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20creature\"&gt;Skeletal&lt;/a&gt; undead are skeletons animated by magic.\nIncorporeal.\nIncorporeal undead are ghosts and spirits of the dead.\nIn the RPG.\nIndependent undead.\nIndependent undead are undead who maintain their own free will. Not all undead from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; fall under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Some undead resisted the command of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; or his minions, while others arose through individual circumstances. Although they have no direct ties to the Scourge, such monsters are no less dangerous. Despite being free of the Lich King's influence, some &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; undead still choose to serve the Lich King."}

Former &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s that succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, they were forced to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in his undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. That is until Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, former ranger general of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, broke her fellow undead free. These rebels banded together under her and rebranded themselves the Forsaken, claiming the ruined kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for their own.\nThe undead start in &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-zone located in western &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Their capital was the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;retribution&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; saw the Undercity made uninhabitable canonically, although it is still visitable in-game. In a parallel to when they were alive, the undead race's mount of choice is the &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt; - damned, just like them. &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt; is the foul language of death, but undead also speak &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with their living allies.\nBackground.\nCreation screen description.\n\"Free of the Lich King's grasp, the Forsaken seek to overthrow his rule. Led by the banshee queen Sylvanas, they hunger for vengeance against the Scourge. Humans, too, have become the enemy, relentless in their drive to purge all undead from the land. The Forsaken care little for their allies: to them the Horde is merely a tool that may further their dark schemes.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Trapped in the limbo between life and death, the sinister Undead were reanimated by the cruel Lich King to serve as mindless pawns in his war against the living. Having broken free from his thrall, they now battle to retain their newfound independence and slay those that seek to purge them from Azeroth.\"\nClassic opening cutscene.\n\"Bound to the iron will of the tyrant &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the vast undead armies of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; seek to eradicate all life on Azeroth. Led by the banshee &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a group of renegades broke away from the Scourge, and freed themselves of the Lich King's domination. Known by some as the Forsaken, this group fights a constant battle not only to retain their freedom from the Scourge, but also to slaughter those who would hunt them as monsters. With Sylvanas as their banshee queen, the Forsaken have built a dark stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron\u2019s former capital city. This hidden 'Undercity' forms a sprawling labyrinth that stretches beneath the haunted woods of the Tirisfal Glades. Though the very land is cursed, the zealous humans of the Scarlet Crusade still cling to their scattered holdings, obsessed with eradicating the undead and retaking their homeland. Convinced that the primitive races of the Horde can help them achieve victory over their enemies, the Forsaken have entered an alliance of convenience. Harboring no true loyalty for their new allies, they will go to any lengths to ensure their dark plans come to fruition. As one of the Forsaken, you must eliminate any who pose a threat to the new order \u2013 human, undead, or otherwise.\"\nCataclysm opening cutscene.\n\"Though Lady Sylvanas and her Forsaken finally took vengeance upon their hated enemy, the Lich King, their dark crusade in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; proved costly. Betrayed by their &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary\"&gt;Grand Apothecary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken's devious plague of death was unleashed on both the Alliance and the Horde to calamitous event. Unbeknownst to Sylvanas, Putress and his demonic ally, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, had taken control of the Undercity. As a result, the Forsaken were wrongly blamed for the traitor's atrocities. Though the Undercity was eventually retaken, Sylvanas and her followers still bear the weight of Putress's sins. Mistrusted by the other members of the Horde, the Forsaken must now prove their loyalty to the cause and redeem themselves from their supposed treachery. To this end, Sylvanas has bolstered her defenses within the Tirisfal Glades and readied her undead forces for any contingency. As one of the Forsaken, you must use your cunning and viciousness to slay any who would pose a threat to Sylvanas's rule be they human, undead, or otherwise.\"\nHistory.\nBound to the iron will of the tyrant &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the vast undead armies of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; seek to eradicate all life on Azeroth. Led by the banshee &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, one group of undead broke away from the Scourge in a small period of time when the Lich King lost some of his power, and freed themselves of the Lich King's domination. These renegades call themselves the Forsaken. They fight a constant battle not only to retain their freedom from the Scourge, but also to exterminate those who would hunt them as monsters.\nWith Sylvanas as their banshee queen, the Forsaken have built a dark stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron\u2019s former capital city. This hidden 'Undercity' forms a sprawling labyrinth that stretches beneath the haunted woods of the Tirisfal Glades. From this bastion, the Forsaken wage an unending battle against the Scourge as well as the remaining humans who still seek to reclaim their lands. For though the very land is cursed, the zealous humans of the Scarlet Crusade cling to their scattered holdings, obsessed with eradicating the undead and retaking their once-beautiful homeland.\nConvinced that the primitive races of the Horde can help them achieve victory over their enemies, the Forsaken have entered an alliance of convenience with the savage orcs and the proud tauren. Harboring no true loyalty for their new allies, they will go to any lengths to ensure their dark plans come to fruition. \nAs one of the Forsaken, you must eliminate any who pose a threat to the new order \u2013 be they human, undead, or otherwise.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

As everything was ready, Kel'Thuzad flipped through the book, marvelling with amazement at Medivh's knowledge, musing that the Last Guardian was more powerful than he thought. Tichondrius appeared, sneered that Medivh's power had not been enough to save him from death and ordered the Summoning to commence. Kel'Thuzad began the ritual, leaving Arthas in charge of the defenses.\nDetermined to stop the Scourge, the Kirin Tor and their allies launched a massive assault against the undead base. Arthas was ready for them. His scouts had discovered a stockpile of goblin land mines which he used to bolster his defenses. As the Summoning progressed, the barriers between Azeroth and the Twisting Nether weakened, allowing the Burning Legion to send their demonic Felhounds and Infernals to assist the undead. The forces of the Scourge and the Legion held the wizards and their knights at bay long enough for Kel'Thuzad to finish the Summoning. Finally, Archimonde entered the world. \"Tremble Mortals and despair!\" he bellowed, \"Doom has come to this world!\" The remaining wizards fled at the sight of the Defiler. \nArchimonde congratulated Kel'Thuzad on a job well done. Tichondrius appeared again and welcomed his master. Archimonde's first act was to relieve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; of command and turn the Scourge over to the Dreadlords. Tichondrius was quite pleased by this order. Archimonde declared that before he launched the Legion's invasion, he would make an example of the wizards by obliterating the city of Dalaran. The demons then headed off, leaving Arthas and Kel'Thuzad behind.\nArthas was outraged over this turn of events. \"What happens to us now?!\" he demanded. Kel'Thuzad told him to be patient, as the Lich King had foreseen all this and had more plans for Arthas.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nArchimonde.\n\"The hour of Archimonde's arrival has come!

Originally intended by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to be the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s seat of power, the budding \"Undercity\" was abandoned when Arthas was recalled to aid the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the distant &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. In Arthas's absence, the Dark Lady, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, led the rebel &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to the Undercity, and claimed it for her own. Since taking up residence, the Forsaken worked to complete the Undercity's construction by dredging the twisted maze of catacombs, tombs, and dungeons that Arthas began. The Undercity is much more defensible than the city above it.\nIt was plagued during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Undercity was so named many years before the Forsaken claimed it as their own. Far beneath the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron, the Undercity held the ancient crypts and catacombs of Lordaeron's royalty, as well as the city's dungeons and sewers. Although the Undercity was only intended for prisoners and the dead, the poorest of the Lordaeron people lived within. Now and then the guards would go down and make a sweep of the place in a desperate and ultimately futile attempt to clean it out. When the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; captured &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, they sent him to the Undercity; sometime later he managed to escape and wandered for many years afterwards.\nLegacy of the Damned.\n&lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; stood for centuries, a monument to humanity's might. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; slew his father, King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, in Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; and ransacked the city.\nDuring the Third War, the once-glorious capital of Lordaeron, Capital City, was decimated by a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army under the command of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; continued their campaign against the living throughout the continent, only a small contingent of Arthas\u2019 forces were left behind to carve out a new \u201cUndercity\u201d beneath the ruined capital.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; returned to his ruined kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to rule over his undead subjects, annihilate the last pockets of human resistance, and oust the remaining &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s who were unaware of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. However, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s powers began to wane and demanded Arthas travel to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to defend it from &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Forces&lt;/a&gt;. With the Lich King's control over the undead faltering, one group of undead broke away from the Scourge and freed themselves of the Lich King's domination. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; who plotted with the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Arthas. Sylvanas rallied the free-willed undead and lured Arthas into a trap, but Arthas was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas fled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to defend the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Ascension%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;ascend as the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Dreadlord Insurgents, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Forces\"&gt;Sylvanas' Forces&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; to vie for the lands of Lordaeron in a &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;Plaguelands civil war&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately Sylvanas and her rebel &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; (known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;) emerged victorious and claimed the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruined capital city of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; as their own. Constructing their own bastion, far beneath the wrecked city, the Forsaken vowed to defeat the Scourge and drive Kel'Thuzad and his minions from the land. Over time the Forsaken began to fight a constant battle not only to retain their freedom from the Scourge, but also to exterminate those who would hunt them as monsters.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFar beneath the ruined capital city of Lordaeron, the royal crypts have been turned into a bastion of evil and undeath. Arthas originally intended the Undercity to be the Scourge's seat of power, but the budding city was abandoned when he was recalled to aid the Lich King in distant Northrend. In Arthas' absence, the Dark Lady, Sylvanas Windrunner, led the rebel Forsaken to the Undercity and claimed it for her own. Since taking up residence, the Forsaken have worked to complete the Undercity's construction by dredging out the twisted maze of catacombs, tombs, and dungeons that Arthas began.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhile the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were concentrated on a joint effort at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, an uprising broke out within the Undercity. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and Forsaken rebels led by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; managed to take control of the Undercity, killing several Forsaken and nearly killing the Dark Lady as well. In response the Horde led by Sylvanas Windrunner and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; attacked from the front entrance to reclaim the city. While the Alliance led by &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; attacked from the Sewers to restore Lordaeron to the Alliance. The ensuing battle ultimately killed both Varimathras and Putress, along with their fellow demons and Forsaken rebels.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall sent a legion of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; led by captain &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced Varimathras, with &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Overseer%20%28Undercity%29\"&gt;Kor'kron Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s replacing the &lt;a href=\"Undercity%20Guardian\"&gt;Undercity Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, in order to ensure that the events of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; never occur again.\nSome guardians still remain in the &lt;a href=\"Sewers\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt;; it's unknown if this is an error or not.\nStormrage.\nAfter the death of Arthas, Undercity was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;'s mists and shadowy warriors of nightmares. Sylvanas, half of the Forsaken and all Horde representatives were having nightmares. &lt;a href=\"Sharlindra\"&gt;Sharlindra&lt;/a&gt; and some Forsaken witnessed Sylvanas' murmur and moments later, shadowy figures attacked Sharlindra and her followers - thus the whole Undercity was enveloped by the Nightmare.\nCataclysm.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; was about to begin, the Undercity felt massive quakes. The upper levels of Lordaeron Keep have been re-designed to accommodate flying.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAll the Kor'kron guards left, making only Bragor, now with the title of Hand of Warchief, being there. Under odd circumstances, the body of Overseer Kraggosh is now found in a cage.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Undercity's Apothecarium was infiltrated by the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; who rescued the captive &lt;a href=\"Koltira\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; governed the city in Sylvanas Windrunner's absence. The Desolate Council hosted a remembrance ceremony in the Undercity to honor the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; that died during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Undercity's civilians were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Boys\"&gt;Gallywix's Boys&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Blastmasters\"&gt;Bilgewater Blastmasters&lt;/a&gt; loaded the streets with &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; barrels and explosives as they were tasked. In the meantime, the city was infiltrated by the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20claw\"&gt;druids of the claw&lt;/a&gt; and agents though they were quickly dispatched.\nInstead of losing the battle, Sylvanas ordered the explosives to be activated flooding the upper and lower cities with plague, which kills both the living and the dead, making the capital uninhabitable.\nThe Forsaken civilians that fled to Orgrimmar established camps on top of the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and inside Orgrimmar's streets.\nGeography.\nThe Undercity is an extension of the crypts and dungeons originally beneath Lordaeron's capital city. The Forsaken dredged out complex catacombs and caverns below the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The place is dark, smells of corpses and has an evil feel. Spiders, oozes and other subterranean creatures occupy the distant passages. Rivers of poisonous sludge flow through all avenues of the vast Undercity. The toxic fumes and fetid odors permeating every corner of the stronghold have made it a place almost unbearable for the living members of the Horde. Yet for Sylvanas and her cursed followers, the Undercity has become a much-needed refuge in a world where her kind is still feared and hunted. It is drastically different from any of the other capital cities for the Horde. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which are at the surface and often the sites of multiple festivals, the Undercity is dark, dreary, and cold. The Forsaken, however, are known for holding two festivals, &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Pilgrim's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken chose to manly live below ground, with limited Forsaken activity in the ruins above.\nThe Undercity has many secret routes used by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;the Banshee Queen&lt;/a&gt; to move about the city in secret. &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; suspects that there are a few such passageways kept hidden even from him.\nMap and quarters.\nThe city is made up of roughly symmetrical quarters arranged around a circular center.\nOrb of Translocation.\nSince the release of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", players with the expansion are able to access an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; palace, making it easy for anyone to travel between the two cities without having to go through the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The translocator works both ways. The Undercity orb is located in a newly opened city section west off the main part of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The translocator teleports you to the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Silvermoon%20City%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt cannot be used by the Alliance.\nKing Terenas' tomb.\nAlthough the memorial to &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a stone tomb, it was shown in \"\" that after his death, Terenas was . Furthermore, the urn containing his ashes was used to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown what happened to the King's remains after this point. The memorial was crafted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; humans who once inhabited the old city, who risked everything to ensure that the memory of Lordaeron's last true king would not be forgotten.\nThe throne room.\nWhen you stand in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;, at least in the center of the circle on the floor, with the ambient sound turned all the way up, in the background noises you can hear small clips of &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;. For those who wish to hear this without venturing into the Undercity, the ambient sound file is located at (WoW Directory)\\Data\\Sound\\Ambience\\WMOAmbience\\UnderCityThorneRoom.wav.\nIf you look closely on the floor of the throne room, near the foot of the throne, you can see a small trail of blood that was left by the crown as it rolled onto the floor.\nBy the same token, in the outer hall leading into the throne room, one can hear the celebration of Arthas' return by Lordaeron's citizens. The floor is littered with dead rose petals, the same ones seen showering Arthas during the cutscene in \"Warcraft III\".\nWhen standing by the bell outside of the throne room you can hear it ringing.\nNotable characters.\nFrom her throne in the Royal Quarter, the banshee queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; rules with the support of &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; and the banshee &lt;a href=\"Sharlindra\"&gt;Sharlindra&lt;/a&gt;. Other luminaries include &lt;a href=\"Bethor%20Iceshard\"&gt;Bethor Iceshard&lt;/a&gt;, who is a powerful wizard that heads the joint warlock and mage guilds in the Undercity, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nTo the southeastern &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; you will find the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s capital of Undercity. This maze was originally the crypts and dungeons beneath &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;, but the Forsaken have added to their city with tunnels, caverns, structures and the like.\nThe city is protected by 13 mysterious &lt;a href=\"black%20iron%20golem\"&gt;black iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, metal juggernauts of unknown origin.\nHistory.\nLordaeron's capital city stood for centuries, a monument to humanity's might. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; slew his father &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; and ransacked the city. He planned to use Lordaeron as his capital on this continent and ordered his minions to expand the catacombs beneath the city. Then the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; summoned Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the work was left uncompleted.\nDuring Arthas' exodus, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; broke free of the Lich King's control and took many &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; with her. With &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;' assistance she defeated the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s that controlled the city and set her newly dubbed Forsaken to finish Arthas' job in the dungeons. The Forsaken carved Undercity and now rule the surrounding countryside.\nWarchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Galavosh\"&gt;Ambassador Galavosh&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty shaman, to Undercity to keep an eye on the Forsaken and make sure they are honest about their intention to dismiss their evil tendencies. He is investigating the the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; who are based in the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt;. They mess around with potions, venoms, diseases and other alchemy. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt;, sends many Forsaken out on missions to gather strange objects that must be ingredients for something.\nSylvanas Windrunner, once the elven ranger captain of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, claims to drive the Forsaken to defeat the Scourge and establish their own place on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but what that place may be, and whether or not it includes living beings is not known. Varimathras serves as Sylvanas' lieutenant and closest advisor. Formerly one of Sylvanas' greatest enemies, Varimathras betrayed the Scourge and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and defected to Sylvanas' side. He is in charge of Undercity's defense, and his forces range across Tirisfal, eliminating all those they see as a threat. The dreadlord is tasked with eradicating the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, a fanatical group of humans who seek to destroy all undead.\nGeography.\nUndercity is an extension of the crypts and dungeons originally beneath Lordaeron's capital city. The Forsaken dredged out complex catacombs and caverns. The place is dark, smells like dead people and has an evil feel. &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s and other subterranean creatures occupy the distant passages. You could wander for weeks in Undercity and never see everything.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nThis item is primarily useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year. \nThe item can be created from the ingredient items after the event is over. By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 21 days for the city gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a city gift could be created. It is unknown whether or not the buff will proc based on the item creation or if a separate check requires the event to be in progress, but the response time for the buff to proc during the event suggests that no separate check is used.\nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article. "}

And Daryn is pretty sure that anything of value in those Feralas ruins has already been claimed. However, she's willing to let you do the looking through her library.\nRummaging around the library, you encounter a book, . Just the thing.\nEven though the book appears to have been in the library untouched for years, you remember your manners, and ask before simply absconding with the book.\nDaryn is happy to let you borrow the book... if you first do her a favor. But then, you're an adventurer, you've come to expect this of people. \nHer latest enthusiasm is for the &lt;a href=\"Snapjaw\"&gt;Snapjaw&lt;/a&gt; turtles of &lt;a href=\"the%20Hinterlands\"&gt;the Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gammerita\"&gt;Gammerita&lt;/a&gt; in particular. She can't go herself, but she'd still like to see Gammerita. A gnome in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curgle%20Cranklehop\"&gt;Curgle Cranklehop&lt;/a&gt;, has invented a device that would capture a picture of the turtle. Daryn asks you to take a letter to Curgle, asking for the device, then go to the Hinterlands and take the picture.\nCurgle has a great deal of respect for Daryn, and is happy to loan out the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Snapper%20FX\"&gt;Super Snapper FX&lt;/a&gt;. It's a long way from &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"the%20Hinterlands\"&gt;the Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, and a long way from &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; to shore of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forbidding%20Sea\"&gt;the Forbidding Sea&lt;/a&gt; at the base of &lt;a href=\"the%20Overlook%20Cliffs\"&gt;the Overlook Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou search for a while, and finally locate the giant turtle, Gammerita. No sooner have you activated the Super Snapper than Gammerita turns and charges you. Welcome to the life of a wildlife photographer: never a dull moment.\nHaving dealt with Gammerita, you ponder your return journey to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daryn%20Lightwind\"&gt;Daryn&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, your feet...\nBack in Rut'theran Village, &lt;a href=\"Daryn%20Lightwind\"&gt;Daryn&lt;/a&gt; is happy with the photo, and hands you the book, asking that you take care of it.\nAt least now you have a book to read on the flight back to Feralas... \nTroyas barely skims the book before he finds a useful reference: the &lt;a href=\"Stave%20of%20Equinex\"&gt;Stave of Equinex&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stave of Equinex is, apparently, a key to the unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Equinex%20Monolith\"&gt;Equinex Monolith&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ravenwind\"&gt;Ruins of Ravenwind&lt;/a&gt;. \"All you have to do,\" says Troyas, \"is retrieve the essences of four magic flames, and use them to energize the stave at the monolith.\"\nYep. He leaves out the part where the local harpies object to your very presence, and takes for granted the part where you have to trek through wilderness to get there. And back. You're an adventurer, after all! You should be used to walking by now!\nAs advertised, the flames are there in the ruins. The harpies are a nuisance, but you've dealt with worse. But sure enough, Troyas' research paid off. You combine the essences with the stave, and the monolith opens up. As you pull &lt;a href=\"a%20Sparkling%20Stone\"&gt;a Sparkling Stone&lt;/a&gt; from the a small door in the side of the monolith, you can feel the stave giving up its energy.\nAll that's left is the is to return with the stone to Troyas.\nWhile you've been gone, he has continued reading about the monolith and its contents. The stone is called 'the Morrow Stone', and while he doesn't know what it's good for, but considering its hiding place, it must have been powerful, or important.\nTo you, though, it's a job well done."}

A player can own more than the gold limit by dividing money between his player characters with the mail system, but the amount the player owns cannot be negative.\nGaining money.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", a player character can gain money from looting a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, from an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; as a reward for finishing a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; or by selling items to a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;. A player can also gain money from another player as a gift or as payment.\nLosing money.\nA player can lose money through &lt;a href=\"gold%20sink\"&gt;gold sink&lt;/a&gt;s such as paying for repair, buying items, and sometimes through quests. A player can also lose money to another player by giving money to the other player as payment or as a gift.\nWays of gaining money.\nSince every activity in \"World of Warcraft\" consumes time, the effectiveness of gaining money can be measured by the amount of money gained in a certain time. The amount of profit possible with a certain activity may also depend on the rate of money gained. There is a risk of not making a profit or of losing money depending on the amount spent on an activity. Some activities include:\nThere are other ways of making money, besides those listed here.\nGrinding.\nMany mobs in \"World of Warcraft\" drop money. So by just killing mobs a player character can loot money. items, dropped by these mobs, can be an additional source of money by selling them to a vendor. , , or items that infrequently drop may bring more profit by selling to other players. Grinding may not be an very effectiv way of gaining money since the amount of money dropped by mobs is relatively low depending on their level. The financial risk of grinding is relativ low. &lt;a href=\"Durability%23Repair%20cost\"&gt;Repair cost&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Durability%23Durability%20loss\"&gt;durability loss&lt;/a&gt; for fighting and dying or money for food and drink will lower the profit.\nFarming.\nFarming without a profession.\nFarming without a profession is basically grinding but aiming for a special item of higher value, that may drop from the farmed mob such as a recipe, materials for production profession, or a rare item like a &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Firefly\"&gt;Captured Firefly&lt;/a&gt;. The effectiveness of &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; depend on the drop chance and the value of an item, as well as how fast the player character can kill these mobs, how many are there and how fast they respawn. Profitable mobs may attract many players, especially at prime time, leading to long waiting periods for the mob to spawn and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; fights, which can lower the effectiveness of farming considerably. Internet databases like &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thottbot\"&gt;Thottbot&lt;/a&gt; provide information about the source of an item. While financial risk may still be relatively low, like with grinding the player can loot money from the mob but repair cost for durability loss in fights and by dying or money for food and drink will lower the profit, to make a higher profit the from the farmed items the player must still sell them to other players via the trade channel or &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. Not finding a buyer on the auction house will lower profit because of the auction fee.\nFarming with a profession.\nFarming with a profession is gathering materials via &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Primary%20professions\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt; gathering professions:\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Cloth%20Scavenging\"&gt;Northern Cloth Scavenging&lt;/a&gt; abilitiy for tailors, this profession can to some extent be seen as a gathering profession since it will give the player character an advantage on farming cloth.\nand the secondary profession:\nWhether a player character is able to gather materials with these professions depends on his profession skill and the level of the item. For skinning, the player has to kill the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, so profit may depend on his fighting strength and he may have expenses like with &lt;a href=\"grinding\"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt;. \nProfessions like herbalism and mining need a lot of travel between the herbs or mines. A high traveling or flying speed will raise the effectiveness of the gathering as may special abilities like the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flight%20form\"&gt;flight form&lt;/a&gt;, saving the time to mount up and off. An addon like &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gatherer\"&gt;Gatherer&lt;/a&gt; will provide ingame information of the positions of herbs and mines.\nItems gainted by these professions are obtainable almost exclusively with these professions, so even low level items can glean a proper profit due to the demand for low-level materials in crafting professions.\nQuesting.\nFinishing a quest is usually rewarded with money, experience points and sometimes with items. If the player character is at the maximum level the experience points of many quest will be converted to money. Completing quests can be an effective way of gaining money since the cost are relatively low and predictable, and the reward is guaranteed. But the number of quests in \"World of Warcraft\" is limited. Many quests can be finished only once by an player character. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quest\"&gt;Repeatable quest&lt;/a&gt;s are not rewarded with money, or as daily quests are limited to 25 quests a day for one player character.\nProducing.\nA profession may have other beneficial or entertaining features but to generate an income the profession has to provide items that can be sold with profit. A player character can gain money by obtaining materials, crafting items with one of the primary or secondary production professions and selling those items to another player or an vendor. In \"World of Warcraft\", the materials needed for crafting an item are specified by the recipe, making the cost of production calculable. To raise his production profession skill a player character has to produce may items, needing much materials. In the process of raising the production profession skill many player characters will also craft the same items, creating a surplus. This may lead to material prices even higher than the price for the produced item, make some items unprofitable.\nPrimary production professions are:\nSecondery production profession are:\nProfessions like &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, and Tailoring will provide armor, weapons, and some item enhancements. &lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;Crafted items&lt;/a&gt; are however not the only source for armour and weapons since the will also drop from mobs or are quest rewards thus making it not necessary to buy crafted items. Many crafted items are useful only for a certain range of level. The inability of an player character to use many of these items, determined by class and level, will lower the demand of many items. Finally a couple of crafted items are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; so the cannot be sold to other players. All these factors limit the number of profitable itmes. On the other side due to the guaranteed access, the materials and the recipe given, and the sometimes very powerful characteristics of some crafted items players may desire those items. Items, even if soulbound, of common or higher quality can also be disenchanted providing materials for &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, probably one of the best professions to gain money, mainly provides enchantings for back-, chest-, wrist-, hand, feetarmor, shield and the weapons, augment the stats of those items. The second part of enchanting is the disenchanting of armor or weapons to create Enchanting ingredients needet for those Enchantings.\nA common mistake is to try to gain money maily with the enchantings while disenchanting may provide a much higher profit.\nTransportation.\nA player might gain profit by buying an item from a vendor, transport it and sell it to players who do not know, care for, cannot reach, or do not want to spend the time traveling to the location of the vendor. Common items for these kind of income are profession recipes, secondary profession books, or &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s. Some items like the faction exclusive companions can provide an even higher profit by selling them through the neutral auction house since this is the only way members of the other faction can obtain these items. The finacilal risk is relativ low since most of these items are cheap and more or less constandly wanted by some player characters. A player can also lower the traveling time by placing an alt close to the vendor.\nReselling.\nBuying items with the purpose of selling them for a higher price to a vendor or an other player. The price players are willing to pay for an item can fluctuate considerable over the course of days, weeks, or month. A player might gain a profit by buying items from other players or from the auction house, speculating on a rising of the price in the future. A short term version of this method is, to buy underpriced items and relisting them in the auction house for a higher price. \nAnother method is to speculate on periodical fluctuations of the price over the course of the day or the week due to the playtime cycle of the majority of the players on a server, resulting in periodic changes of supply and demand. The price mostly being high at the begin of the server prime time, with low supply and high demand. With the supply rising, as more and more players will farm, produce and trade items, starting to undercut each other, the price will eventually start to fall. At the ending of the server prime time the demand goes down and the price will fall further, rising again with the next server prime time. While the total price of an item may depend on other factors too, these periodic changes may remain constant since they are based not on reasons within the virtual economy of World of Warcraft but rather on the playing practice of the player majority on a server, a very constant factor, disturbed only to some degree by &lt;a href=\"Event\"&gt;seasonal holidays&lt;/a&gt;.\nA player can also speculate on price changes due to the implementation of new game content like new items, &lt;a href=\"instances\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, or the beginning of a new &lt;a href=\"arena%20season\"&gt;arena season&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can sell items in to other players with the trade window ,the mail and the auctionhouse. Selling items in \"World of Warcraft\" to other player is only possible if the item is not already &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt;.\nSell items to a vendor.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", a vendor will buy almost any, even a soulbound item for a fixed price and in unlimited quantity. A vendor may not be the most profitable buyer but a very reliable, calculable and in many cases the only one.\nSell items to other players.\nUnlike vendors, the amount of money a player character pays for an item in a trade with another player depends solely on decision by these players limited only by the amount of money the buyer owns. Players will most times act with economical reason thus making it possible to apply, with exceptions, business strategies of the \"real world\" to the virtual economy of \"World of Warcraft\".\nOthers.\nOther, in some cases morally questionable, ways of gaining money may include to charge money for a service, loan, scam, to beg other players for money, or gold buying.\nA player can demand money for helping other players, for example, for a time it was a common practice to pay a player character, who owns a &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, to open up &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; for other groups. \nAddOns.\nCollecting and providing many informations about the marketsituation on the server of a player &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20%28AddOn%29\"&gt;Auctioneer (AddOn)&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most important AddOn for making gold.\nThe \"WhoHas\" addon may be helpful if a player uses a bank alt &lt;a href=\"Mule%20%28game%20term%29\"&gt;Mule (game term)&lt;/a&gt;. \"WhoHas modifies every tooltip in the game to show which of your characters have the item in the tooltip, and where. ...\" \nMailaddons like Postal may help to handle high mail traffic better ."}

They cast a debuff called Destabilize with a 5s cast time, with the effect of -50% healing and damage which stacks on multiple applications.

As the cast time of Destabilize is only 5 seconds, both &lt;a href=\"Imprison\"&gt;Imprison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paralyse\"&gt;Paralyse&lt;/a&gt; are extremely effective as they are instant cast, despite their 20 yard range.

There, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; manipulated his energies and kept him bound, using him as a power source from which the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt; could siphon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually drained of his essence and warped into a &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt;, but was defeated. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; used his heart to revitalize the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was also known as the Dark Naaru.\nHistory.\nRight before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reached out to the naaru independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces amassing on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; heard their pleas but the Army's battles with the Legion were costly and ceaseless, so they could not spare soldiers to protect Outland. Instead &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, M'uru, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help the people of Outland and arrived with &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Kael'thas' forces stormed Tempest Keep, the prince sent M'uru back home to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; believing his people could feed upon. Back in the capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; and his wizards were not content with this idea, but others weren't so hesitant and started to research on the naaru, resulting in a way to manipulate its energies at their will. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; had experienced a mass loss of faith in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, but through M'uru the Light could be seized as a force to control without the need for faith. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s were founded with this in mind, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; summoned &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, a former priestess, to induct her as the order's leader. M'uru, now bound beneath the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, was linked with prospective Blood Knights with the aid of the magi. Exposure to M'uru could be testing - the naaru's voice was distorted and reminiscent of shattering glass - and some knights had to overcome physical and emotional pain in order to invoke their powers.\nM'uru's exploitation, though seen as pragmatic by the magi and the Blood Knights (who could otherwise not invoke their powers), did not sit well with everyone. Most of the blood elf populace initially looked down upon the Blood Knights for their abuse of M'uru, and the unproven knights were received coldly. The &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; in particular, as well as &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;their leader&lt;/a&gt;, strongly opposed M'uru's maltreatment and frequently argued against it. The &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;regent lord himself&lt;/a&gt; condemned it on moral grounds but held to the belief that victories and accomplishments could justify the Blood Knights' methods, as well as prove their might in the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. For their part, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; both shared this view, condemning the treatment of M'uru but recognizing the knights' strategic value.\nRegardless, the knights earned their victories and began to thaw out public opinion, becoming a popular group short years later. Little did they know, however, that events had been set in motion far beyond their control, and that M'uru was more tied to the blood elves' own destiny than any of them knew.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nM'uru could be found beneath the Blood Knight &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Farstriders%27%20Square\"&gt;Farstriders' Square&lt;/a&gt;. There, blood elf Magisters could be found binding him, and blood elf paladin players were instructed to drain the naaru (using the then-blood elf racial &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;Mana Tap&lt;/a&gt;) in order to gain new abilities. M'uru also played a role in several other of their class quests.\nAfter his own defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider attacked Silvermoon and stole M'uru, robbing the Blood Knights of their power source. Now located in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, M'uru was sufficiently drained of his energies which caused him to enter a darkened state.\nWithout M'uru, Lady Liadrin was forced to seek out another source of power for the Blood Knights. She spoke with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, asking for forgiveness for M'uru's imprisonment, and renounced her loyalties to the blood elves' twisted prince. A'dal revealed that M'uru's imprisonment was foretold by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;; M'uru willingly accepted his role in the events that unfolded, knowing that it would lead to the elves' redemption and lead them away from the dark fate awaiting Kael'thas and his minions, many of whom were now twisted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin and the Blood Knights pledged to fight alongside the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; in defeating Kael'thas and his demonic master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, the quests involving M'uru were changed. Blood elf paladins would now gather remnants of \"holy energy\" that lingered around the magisters, rather than the previous requirement of draining M'uru directly. The magisters once found draining M'uru now stood dazed, and Astalor assured players that the knights will remain strong in the face of this betrayal.\nM'uru, now used by Kael as something of a guardian, was fought and defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Eclipse\"&gt;Shrine of the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. M'uru transformed into the void god &lt;a href=\"Entropius\"&gt;Entropius&lt;/a&gt; part-way through the encounter. After &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, Velen and Liadrin arrived on the scene to discuss what the future holds. Liadrin was mournful for the harm the knights had caused M'uru, damning the noble being to a dark fate, but Velen, using M'uru's ancient, unblemished heart, reignited the Sunwell with it.\nAftermath.\nThanks to M'uru's essence, the Sunwell's energies are now a mixture of both &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; energy. The Blood Knights now draw their powers directly from the Well, a far more harmonious and less damaging relationship than their previous method of wielding the Light.\nAfter \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", the quests relating to M'uru were removed, and the blood elf paladin trainers' dialogue no longer speaks of manipulating his energies."}
{"id": "148250", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=148250", "title": "M'uru (tactics)", "text": "As of patch 2.4, M'uru is missing from his location beneath the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Farstriders%27%20Square\"&gt;Farstriders' Square&lt;/a&gt;, having been captured by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; curses Kael'thas and his &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt;s for their treachery, commenting that &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; is looking for another source to power the Blood Knights' magic.\nM'uru is located behind &lt;a href=\"Rohendor\"&gt;Rohendor&lt;/a&gt;, the Second Gate and ahead of &lt;a href=\"Archonisus\"&gt;Archonisus&lt;/a&gt;, the Final Gate, placing it as the fifth boss encounter of the instance. M'uru was made accessible at the same time across all servers five weeks (29 April 2008) after the opening of &lt;a href=\"Rohendor\"&gt;Rohendor&lt;/a&gt;, the Second Gate. The removed quest &lt;a href=\"Rohendor%2C%20the%20Second%20Gate\"&gt;Rohendor, the Second Gate&lt;/a&gt; warns that M'uru is now a \"&lt;a href=\"Entropius\"&gt;twisted reflection of its former self&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAbilities.\nM'uru.\nThese spawn 1 Mage and 2 Berserkers at both sides every 60 seconds. That is 6 Humanoid adds every minute. The Humanoid adds spawn from the corridor behind M'uru, and the ramp/doorway from which you enter, running towards the center.\n&lt;a href=\"Void%20Spawn\"&gt;Void Spawn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Void%20Sentinel\"&gt;Void Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; can be snared, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Spawn\"&gt;Void Spawn&lt;/a&gt;s can be feared.\nStrategy.\nRaid Composition.\nM'uru is a very DPS intensive fight, and as such it requires stretching your healing and tanking as much as possible. This includes having about 4 tanks, 6 healers and 15 DPS. It is highly recommended, if not absolutely necessary, to include a Protection Paladin as one of your tanks to pick up the Void Spawns that spawn.\nYou must divide your DPS up into a few sub-groups, that are able to each put out substantial amounts of DPS. Generally you will have 2 groups assigned to killing Humanoid adds, as well as a Warlock group assigned to kill Void Sentinels and Void Spawns.\nPulling M'uru.\nWhen you are ready to pull M'uru, DPS will mount up in the door way and be ready to run in to their positions and burn M'uru as hard as possible before switching to your respective jobs. Humanoid tanks should be ready to pick up their adds on each side from the start, using only one or two attacks to throw up a &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; on the boss.\nCan also use an Eye of Kilrog to engage and quickly reset him, allowing 30 seconds for the raid to setup and position themselves.\nPhase 1.\nWhile your raid group runs in and attacks M'uru, you will be in Phase 1. This phase is a combination of a control fight and a DPS race. Each Humanoid group, which will be comprised of one tank, one healer, and three to four DPS, will be in charge of controlling each add entrance (the doorway and the opposite side of the room, where the ramp down to &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; is blocked off.) A Mage is also highly recommended on each side, to &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; a Berserker or Mage. You will also have a group of AoE, generally Warlocks, to control the Void Sentinels and Spawns. This AoE group is recommended to be comprised of a Protection Warrior or Feral Druid, a Protection Paladin, 3-4 Warlocks and 2 healers (one for each tank). You should also have two raid healers assigned to keep the rest of the raid up.\nHumanoid Adds.\nEach Humanoid Wave consists of two Berserkers and one Mage. When the Humanoid wave enters the room, the tank should pick up all 3 of them while a mage sheeps a Berserker and the tank drags the other two adds slightly away from the sheep so multitarget attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Flurry\"&gt;Blade Flurry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweeping%20Strikes\"&gt;Sweeping Strikes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Multi-Shot\"&gt;Multi-Shot&lt;/a&gt; can occur.\nVoid Sentinels and Void Spawns.\nThe warrior will need to be fast in picking up the Void Sentinels, and the warlocks need to be quick in DPSing the Void Sentinels to allow this mobility.\nWarlocks will have to manage a rotation on the Sentinels and Spawns to ensure that DPS is still active on M'uru, you need to allow the Protection Paladin to gather up two or three sets of spawns before AoEing them down. Warlocks should DPS the Void Sentinels, kill them, allow the Protection Paladin to pick up the adds and while this is occurring DPS M'uru until another Sentinel is ready to be DPSed.\nDarkness.\nYou should assign a Shadow Priest to DPS M'uru full time and Mass Dispel the Dark Fiends when Darkness comes up inside of it, thereby killing them. Be ready to target ones that resist with a single Dispel or call it out so someone else can Dispel/Purge.\nPhase 2.\nAfter M'uru has been slain, he transforms into &lt;a href=\"Entropius\"&gt;Entropius&lt;/a&gt;, a demon-type &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the adds that were alive during the transition should be dead or almost dead as there is 10 seconds before Entropius engages the raid. Entropius has 1,450,000 health and at this point the fight turns into an all-out DPS race before the raid damage from Negative Energy ramps up substantially and overwhelms your healers. This fight also tests the reflexes of all players in the raid and their ability to move on a seconds notice.\nAt level 80.\nAt level 80, like Brutallus before him, M'uru is a trivial encounter due to the fact it was designed to be a gear check and dps race. However, please remember:\nLoot.\nM'uru drops 3 items plus one of the Sin'dorei rings."}
