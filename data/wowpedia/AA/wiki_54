Although its name is taken primarily from the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;'s military campaign into the orcish homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, it also refers to the battles and other major events which took place on both the worlds of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Draenor during this time period.\nHistory.\nForming the Horde of Draenor.\nAs the fires of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; died down, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; took aggressive steps to contain the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat. A number of large internment camps, meant to house the captive orcs, were constructed in southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Guarded by both the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the veteran soldiers of the Alliance, the camps proved to be a great success. Though the captive orcs were tense and anxious to do battle once more, the various camp wardens, based at the old prison-fortress of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, kept the peace and maintained a strong semblance of order.\nHowever, on the hellish world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;orcish army&lt;/a&gt; prepared to strike at the unsuspecting Alliance. Two years after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and his followers went to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the former mentor of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and convinced him to rally the remaining orc clans under his dark banner and restore the Dark Portal. Aided by the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, the old shaman planned to open a number of portals on Draenor that would lead the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to new, unspoiled worlds. &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; (Ner'zhul's loyal follower), &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; (Warlord of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; (Warlord of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;) were the first to hear of Ner'zhul's plan and flocked to his banner. Eventually, Dentarg and Kargath were sent to influence warriors from the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; to join Ner'zhul's Horde.\nBefore Ner'zhul could rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and send his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; through to gather the artifacts required for his grand scheme, he required the knowledge held by an order of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; to complete his preparations. This group of death knights was at that time under the control of &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt;, the renegade ogre-mage of the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;, who was using their necromantic magic for creating a powerful spell.\nNer'zhul sent his forces, led by the Slayer of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, against the Laughing Skull to subjugate the death knights and kill Mogor for his treachery. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who was freed from captivity at the hands of the Laughing Skull clan, Ner'zhul's attack succeeded. Mogor was defeated but somehow survived, and Ner'zhul gained the knowledge to open the Portal. &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt;, a firm believer of Ner'zhul's vision, took command of the remaining Laughing Skull clan. Ner'zhul sent &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hurkan%20Skullsplinter\"&gt;Hurkan Skullsplinter&lt;/a&gt;. Grom slayed Hurkan and appointed &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; to take Hurkan's place of the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; who also joined Ner'zhul's Horde.\nProcuring artifacts.\nTo power his new portals, Ner'zhul needed a number of enchanted artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To procure them, Ner'zhul reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; using the Skull of Gul'dan and sent his ravenous servants charging through it. Nerz'hul's forces began recruiting orcs stranded in Azeroth, notably among them &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; clan. After failing to gain the support of the sons of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;), Gorefiend encountered &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the insane and scheming &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. He offered his own children for assistance in exchange for safe passage to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the Skull of Gul'dan. They agreed and Deathwing helped them prepare for several key battles to steal two artifacts from the Alliance. \nThe new Horde, led by veteran chieftains such as &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, surprised the Alliance defense forces and rampaged through the countryside. Grom and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; led the attack on &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; as a distraction for a team of orcs that were about to steal certain artifacts from Azeroth.\nNer'zhul sent &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; through the Dark Portal to claim three powerful artifacts required for his spell: The &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nGorefiend has sensed a focus of arcane energies within a Castle that has been raised upon the foundations of Stormwind Keep. Ner'zhul believes that this can only be the fabled Book of Medivh. At first, Gorefiend entered the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; only to find the Book of Medivh gone and its guard slain with an &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; blade.\nThe death knight leader then sent one of his lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Ragnok\"&gt;Ragnok&lt;/a&gt;, to accompany &lt;a href=\"Fenris\"&gt;Fenris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt; and their warriors to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Gorefiend also secured the aid of black dragons from Deathwing until they reached the island. Their mission was to locate and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. First they had stolen three boats from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, but were discovered before leaving. A &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; naval armada sent by Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; quickly pursed and threatened to destroy them, but the timely arrival of black dragons had destroyed three Kul Tiras vessels and the rest were forced to retreat at the hopeless situation. This allowed the access of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to travel to the Tomb of Sargeras, Alterac and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Teron Gorefiend made a deal with Alterac king &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; and got the Book of Medivh in exchange for the dragon aspect destroying the Alliance outposts in Alterac. Afterwards, Gorefiend traveled to the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cross%20Island\"&gt;Cross Island&lt;/a&gt; to steal the Eye of Dalaran, where the mages had built heavy fortification. He broke through the shoreline defenses, then he and his &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; broke into the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Vault\"&gt;Arcane Vault&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and stole the Eye. Several of the death knights were killed by &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, joined by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; were unable to prevent the remaining, including their leader, from escaping. They killed &lt;a href=\"Sathera\"&gt;Sathera&lt;/a&gt; and escaped atop the back of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and some of his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUnder Ner'zhul's surgical command, the orcs quickly rounded up all the artifacts that they needed and fled back to the safety of Draenor.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, convinced that the orcs were preparing a new invasion of Azeroth, assembled his most trusted lieutenants. He ordered General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and the archmage, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, to lead an expedition through the Dark Portal to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. Those recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; included veteran heroes of the Alliance such as &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance Invasion of Draenor.\nTuralyon and Khadgar's forces marched into Draenor and repeatedly clashed with Ner'zhul's clans upon the ravaged &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; over the next several months. After fortifying the Alliance Expedition's position on the Hellfire Peninsula where the Portal was located, they proceeded to establish a fleet to attack the surrounding clans. Their first target was to destroy the Orcish shipyards of &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27kur\"&gt;Zeth'kur&lt;/a&gt;. They also founded &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; as their primary base. The Sons of Lothar received erratic shipments of supplies and manpower from their homeworld then, as the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; switched sides several times during the late stages of the Invasion. The Alliance Expedition later raided &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, which was defended by Kargath Bladefist, his Shattered Hand clan, and Dentarg. The citadel was captured by the Alliance and Khadgar was able to slay Dentarg, but Kargath and a few of his orcs got away. Though the Horde headquarters was captured and the bulk of its military might was destroyed while the Alliance had few casualties, the Horde's new warchief Ner'zhul wasn't in Hellfire Citadel as the Alliance Expedition believed. Khadgar discovered from Dentarg that Ner'zhul was planning on using the stolen artifacts to make new portals. While examining the remains of the Hellfire Citadel, the Arch-Wizard has learned not only the location of the Book of Medivh, but also of another artifact integral to safeguarding Azeroth \u2014 the Skull of Gul'dan. Khadgar believes it will be possible to destroy the Portal and permanently seal the rift created by Medivh if he can acquire these artifacts. Thus they decided to split their forces, with Danath and Kurdran continuing the pursuit of Ner'zhul who still had the Book of Medivh and was en route to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, while Khadgar, Turalyon, and Alleria pursued Deathwing who possessed the powerful Skull of Gul'dan.\nDeathwing believed Draenor would be a relatively safe haven for his offspring and secreted away a cache of black dragon eggs there. However, the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; did not take kindly to Deathwing and his black dragons trying to take over their territory and conflict arose between the two races.\n&lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Gronn, eventually met the Alliance expedition heroes \u2014 Khadgar, Turalyon, and Alleria Windrunner \u2014 who were after the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; which Deathwing possessed (he demanded it as payment from Ner'zhul). Seeing as they had a common enemy, the Gronn and the Alliance Expedition heroes formed an alliance to take down Deathwing. Gruul and his ogre minions, along with the heroes, challenged Deathwing from his perch in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 killing his eggs and impaling his lesser black drakes on the mountain spikes. Infuriated by this act, Deathwing landed on top of them and attacked Gruul. Although clearly no match for the mad &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;'s power, Gruul distracted the dragon aspect while &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; cast a simple yet miraculous spell that disassembled some of the adamantium plates that were holding Deathwing's unstable body together, causing excruciating pain and resulting in Deathwing's retreat back to Azeroth. Khadgar took the Skull of Gul'dan and decided to meet with Danath's forces at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, Danath and Kurdran pursued Ner'zhul but Kurdran was struck down and captured by Ner'zhul, who took his men to be holed up in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. Danath and his forces established &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and prepared to besiege the Auchindoun fortress. An &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt; was captured shortly after by Alliance forces, as he had been following the expedition. He promised to guide the Alliance into Auchindoun, where Ner'zhul was hiding. There they encountered one of the last &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nemuraan\"&gt;Nemuraan&lt;/a&gt;. Nemuraan assisted &lt;a href=\"Talthressar\"&gt;Talthressar&lt;/a&gt;, Danath, and &lt;a href=\"Rellian\"&gt;Rellian&lt;/a&gt; by allowing them to use seldom traveled passages, and he invoked the ghosts of dead draenei to assist the Alliance in their ambush against the orcs and their new allies, the &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vorpil\"&gt;Vorpil&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance fought valiantly and rescued Kurdran. Kilrogg Deadeye stayed behind to aid in Ner'zhul's escape and was slain by Danath Trollbane in honorable combat. Ner'zhul and Teron Gorefeind teleported to the Black Temple where Ner'zhul began invoking the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;Spell of Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, seeking out the artifacts needed to seal the rift has given the Horde time to mount a strike against them. A great Orcish armada threatens the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; that the Alliance Expedition have captured, and the armies of the Alliance have been hard-pressed on many fronts. Khadgar and Danath's forces regrouped and razed the orc strongholds that guard the coastline of the Black Temple. Afterwards, the Alliance Expedition pressed their attack by raiding the Black Temple itself. Yet even though Turalyon had slain Teron Gorefiend and scattered the remnant orcish death knights, Khadgar's party was unable to prevent Ner'zhul from opening his portals to other worlds. Unbeknownst to the other orc clans, the Skull of Gul'dan had slowly corrupted Ner'zhul until he became more concerned with his own power and well-being rather than that of the Horde. Feeling the surge of power that came with having control of Draenor's magic, Ner'zhul stopped caring about the welfare of the Horde, and thought only of harnessing his new powers. In his hubris, he ordered his followers through the portals he created, leaving behind the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt;, one of his servitors, protested at Ner'zhul's choice to abandon the rest of the Horde. In response, Ner'zhul blasted him aside; he no longer cared. Inundated with power he previously could only have dreamed of, Ner'zhul's greed overcame him, and whatever vestiges of honor and altruism still remained in him vanished as he and his followers went through the first portal, abandoning the rest of the Orcish Horde to its fate. Obris in his dying breath relinquished the Book of Medivh to Khadgar as a last act of defiance to his traitorous warchief.\nNer'zhul finally opened his portals to other worlds, but he did not foresee the terrible price he would pay. The portals' tremendous energies began to tear the very fabric of Draenor apart. Worse, a multitude of Orcs have laid siege to the Alliance's fortifications at Hellfire. Although the attacking warriors were not well equipped, their sheer numbers threatened to spell the downfall of the Alliance's forces there. Sometime during the war, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; settled on &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;. After Nerz'hul's betrayal, the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; established a truce with the Alliance; which allowed the Alliance to secure the passes of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; unimpeded and take out the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; stronghold in the region.\nAs Turalyon's forces fought desperately to fend off the abandoned orc clans and return home to Azeroth, the world of Draenor began to buckle in upon itself.\nOn Draenor, Turalyon and Khadgar agreed to make the ultimate sacrifice by destroying the Dark Portal from their side. Though it would cost their lives, and the lives of their companions, they knew that it was the only way to ensure Azeroth's survival. Even as orcs attacked the human ranks in a desperate bid for freedom, the Alliance held their ground and protected Khadgar as he used the Skull of Gul'dan and the Book of Medivh to destroy the Dark Portal. For the remaining orcs stranded on Azeroth like Grom Hellscream, there would be no going back.\nNer'zhul and his loyal Shadowmoon clan passed through the largest of the newly created portals, as massive volcanic eruptions began to break Draenor's continents apart. Ner'zhul and his followers however were immediately apprehended by the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of their escape from Draenor. Kil'jaeden turned his captives into monstrosities, with Ner'zhul himself eventually becoming the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. After the Dark Portal's destruction, Khadgar and the remnants of the Alliance Expedition also escaped through one of Ner'zhul's portals. As the burning seas rose up and roiled the shattered landscape, the tortured world was finally consumed in a massive, apocalyptic explosion causing the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; it is today.\nOutland.\nOutland, though the broken remnant of Draenor, was still a surviving world full of resources, people, and open portals for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate. The Burning Legion would once again turn its gaze upon the broken planet to subjugate it, with &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Forces\"&gt;his forces&lt;/a&gt; conquering it and ruling the surviving populace under his tyranny. The remnants of the Alliance Expedition returned to Outland to reclaim their abandoned fortifications, and renamed themselves the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a group dedicated to holding a vigil to staunch demonic influence over Outland and the worlds beyond. A new race called the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; would eventually travel to Outland as well to give its people hope and to spread the salvation of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; during Outland's time of peril.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

The armada posed a serious threat to the stability of the region, as Daelin was a staunch enemy of the Horde, and was determined to destroy the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s before they could create their nation in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; ordered the union of the forces and allies of the Horde to repel the human invaders and prevent their extermination.\nAfter he took over &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; with his troops, the Grand Admiral forced his daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to make a terrible decision: support him in battle against the orcs and betray her newfound allies, or fight her own father to maintain the fragile peace that the Alliance and the Horde had finally attained. In the end, Jaina chose the latter and helped Thrall defeat her crazed father. Unfortunately, Admiral Proudmoore died in battle against &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, before Jaina could reconcile with him or prove that orcs were no longer bloodthirsty monsters.\nThe invasion is chronicled in &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign in \"\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; gathered his people and resolved to find a place for them in the rugged, beautiful lands of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall led his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s into the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; and claimed much of the land, founding &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, named after his heroic father. Its capital city was &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, named for &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the demon curse was ended, the Horde changed from a warlike juggernaut into more of a loose coalition, dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest. After many months, things began to pull together. The orcs were fleshing out Durotar, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; had gone into &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; had settled on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; off the coast.\nAs the Horde built its nations, some of their former allies in the Third War moved farther south. The Alliance refugees and the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, settled in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and established their new nation &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina and Thrall continued to communicate, and their uneasy truce developed into something more permanent. Both leaders declared that they would respect the other's territory and refrain from any acts of aggression.\nThough the Horde and the humans of Theramore Isle maintained peace for years, it did not last. Yet it was not Warchief Thrall or Jaina Proudmoore who reignited war.\nUnbeknownst to Jaina, her father &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Grand Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was leading the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; on an expedition, in order to search for his daughter and the survivors that fled there after &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. A massive Alliance naval armada arrived on the shores of Kalimdor, and unaware of his daughter's nonaggression with the Horde, Daelin discovered the orcs. The fleet immediately launched attacks against the orcs and nearby troll settlements. Admiral Proudmoore had fought in the Second War, and he had even lost his son &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He had no intention of letting the creatures who had nearly destroyed the human kingdoms regain their strength. His goal was nothing less than extermination.\nClashes in Durotar.\nKul Tiras forces ended up driving the local &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s out of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; with their lumber operations and, upon being discovered, reported the Horde presence to the Admiral. Unaware that the forces they encountered did not belong with Jaina, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; troll &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; were forced to cull the thunder lizard population in accordance as destroying the &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; would break their nonaggression pact with the humans. After their task was done, they reported the incident to Warchief Thrall who ordered them to investigate sightings of humans on Durotar coast and confessed that he was unsure as to what Jaina was doing.\nRexxar and his companions discovered that an invasion force was in place and thus hurried to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to report their findings to Thrall. Even as Thrall requested Rexxar and his companions to deal with the humans, Kul Tiras forces launched a devastating attack on an orc outpost leaving &lt;a href=\"Gar%27Thok\"&gt;Gar'Thok&lt;/a&gt; the only known survivor. Upon finding the outpost destroyed the Horde force were able to use the humans' tracks back to the coast and slew them. After reporting to Thrall, the Warchief remarked that he recognized the anchor symbol displayed by the Alliance forces but was unable to place it. Both Thrall and Rohkan recognized that the Kul Tiras fleet would target the Darkspear Trolls, and thus Rexxar and his companions journeyed to the Echo Isles. The Horde rallied under Rexxar and Darkspear &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and evacuated the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; to the mainland.\nReturning to Thrall, Rexxar and the others learned that the human leader had invited Thrall to meet in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; for parlay. Distrustful of the humans, Rexxar convinced Thrall to let him go in his place. Rexxar's hunch was indeed right, as Admiral Proudmoore dispatched assassins disguised as \"emissaries\" from Theramore to lure Thrall into a trap and end his life. During the parlay, the Kul Tiras &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Emissary&lt;/a&gt; recognized that Rexxar was not the Warchief and seemed to be mystified as to why they would think that Jaina would be involved. Before Rexxar could question him, the trap was sprung. Though the group was victorious, the Emissary ominously reported that the Horde had no idea what was coming for them.\nThe Lord Admiral.\nThe ruse failed, and war became inevitable. Thrall suspected that deceit was afoot and prepared a letter for Jaina in the hopes of mending the problem, then sent Rexxar to meet with her on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Island\"&gt;Theramore Island&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar and his party asked &lt;a href=\"Samuro%20%28blademaster%29\"&gt;Samuro&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;, to plant explosives to distract the guards of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; coastal settlement on &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; long enough for Rexxar to slip by. However, Samuro remembered his previous mission to eliminate an enraged &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bloodbeak%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Bloodbeak&lt;/a&gt; who was hiding nearby, and thus had to complete it before going for the humans. Rexxar then met with Jaina, who denied any knowledge of this force and condemned any attack on Thrall. She demanded to see these soldiers for herself.\nRexxar brought Jaina back to the camp only to find it destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar and Jaina fought through the force of snake-people looking for any survivors. After finally defeating the naga, led by the &lt;a href=\"naga%20sea%20witch\"&gt;naga sea witch&lt;/a&gt;es &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Darkscale\"&gt;Lady Darkscale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scilla%20Murkshadow\"&gt;Scilla Murkshadow&lt;/a&gt;, they found a single human &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt; dying who said that the \"Admiral\" would be pleased to see Jaina safe. Rexxar was confused at Jaina's horror but trusted her enough to follow her back to Theramore quickly.\nUnlike her father, Jaina knew that Thrall's Horde was different from its predecessor. She had seen proof of that with her own eyes. She had stood alongside the Horde against the Burning Legion and witnessed the valor and honor of its soldiers. They wanted the same thing she and many of her followers did: an end to the cycle of hatred between the Horde and the Alliance. Upon arriving, however, a fleet of ships arrived and Jaina's father, Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, arrived. The moment he saw Rexxar, he immediately ordered his capture, despite Jaina's pleas. Rexxar and his friends fled the city, fighting through the naval guards, and returned to the Darkspear village informing Vol'jin what had passed. Jaina had tried to convince her father, but he refused to listen.\nAfter making landfall upon Kalimdor's shores, Daelin took over the Theramore-affiliated &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and started building a series of bases such as &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Base\"&gt;port settlement&lt;/a&gt;. While expecting victory, the Grand Admiral still left orders for his remaining &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; fleet to keep attacking the orcs in case he failed to send words within 12 months' time.\nRallying the Horde.\nVol'jin made it out to inform Thrall of the imminent invasion and suggested that Rexxar go and enlist the aid of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes along the mesas of the land of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in the coming battle. Rexxar traveled to Mulgore to meet with &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. When he arrived, Cairne told him to return to Thrall and tell him that he had died of a broken heart. His second, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt;, explained that Cairne's son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, had been kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Khiragg\"&gt;Khiragg&lt;/a&gt;'s band of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s and that Cairne had since grown depressed and lethargic. Rexxar led an expedition to rescue Baine with the help of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spirit walker&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;. Upon returning, Cairne was re-energized and agreed to pledge his people to the Horde and to personally return with Rexxar.\nWhen they returned to the Darkspear village, Vol'jin showed them a tired &lt;a href=\"Crol%27ka\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; who had come from &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; with news that a new warlord had taken over the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and that his cruelty and brutality were leading the ogres to ruin. Vol'jin and Rexxar agreed that this was an excellent opportunity to sway the ogres onto their side. Rexxar traveled to Dustwallow Marsh and found the Stonemaul clan. Though they initially rejected Rexxar because of his mixed blood, he proved himself by running a gauntlet and returning alive. Warlord &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; was impressed and allowed Rexxar to join the clan.\nRexxar used his new position to ask the ogres for assistance. &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; mockingly reminded him that they were no longer friends to the orcs. Rexxar was forced to fight Kor'gall for the leadership of the clan. Kor'gall proved to be a powerful foe, and Rexxar had to rely heavily on his beast friends to defeat him. Finally, Kor'gall fell, and Rexxar assumed the position of &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;. He then led the Stonemaul ogres back to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; where Thrall was assembling the Horde. Thrall named Rexxar &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Champion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; and gave him the honor of leading the Horde against Proudmoore's forces. After a difficult battle, they razed Proudmoore's stronghold and sent the Admiral into a retreat. Yet, Thrall knew that Proudmoore would not stop there.\nSeas of blood.\nWith his companions &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;tauren chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar landed on the outlying island and defeated the Kul Tiras forces who were occupying the island. Having gained the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs quickly put the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to constructing &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt;s, with which they then engaged the Kul Tiras armada. A furious battle on the waves ensued. The Kul Tiras forces used their fortifications and siege weaponry to shell the orc ships as they traded cannon fire with the human fleet. Although they were successful in destroying a good many of the goblin-made ships, Rexxar's forces were eventually able to sink all six of the Kul Tiras battleships, forcing the remains of the fleet into disarrayed retreat. With the blockade broken, Thrall quickly ordered his troops onto waiting transports, and began the invasion of Theramore Isle.\nTime was not on their side. Despite the impassioned urging of his daughter, Jaina, Admiral Proudmoore had taken over Theramore and now had control of both the sea and a defensible city. If given time to fortify his position, he would be able to launch strikes across Kalimdor with impunity. The Horde's armies traveled to Theramore and quietly reached out to Jaina. Thrall asked her to do the impossible: let the Horde into Theramore so they could kill her father. Otherwise, Daelin Proudmoore would extinguish the Horde forevermore.\nBattle in Theramore.\nDevastated by the seemingly impossible choice, Jaina stood aside, asking only that the Horde spare as many of her people as they could.\nThe gathered armies of the Horde, led by Thrall and Rexxar, landed upon Theramore Isle and unleashed their full fury upon the walls of the city. The Horde launched a three-pronged attack: the trolls and ogres attacked from the west, the tauren attacked from the south, and the orcs attacked from the southwest. They met stiff resistance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%27s%20Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore's elite guard&lt;/a&gt;, Theramore's powerful automated defense towers, and Jaina Proudmoore's own forces. The Kul Tiran forces defended the Citadel fiercely, fighting with an intense hatred for the Horde whom they believed to be the same as the one that ravaged their homelands and many warriors on both sides perished. Their counter-attacks overran several Horde landing sites but finally, Rexxar and his companions were able to fight their way through the heavy melee, defeating the Admiral's personal guard before engaging Daelin Proudmoore himself.\nAlthough Proudmoore was a ferociously powerful warrior and sorcerer, he was finally slain in the epic battle with Rexxar's party. Rexxar himself inflicted the mortal blow on Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore. He was no stranger to how blind prejudice and hatred could darken the hearts of good soldiers. He had seen that fate befall many members of the old Horde.\nWith the Admiral's death, Rexxar ordered the rest of the Kul Tiran forces to stand down. Jaina Proudmoore materialized, to mourn over the body of her proud, stubborn father. Rexxar urged Jaina Proudmoore to remember her father for the proud warrior he had been, not for the person he had become.\nAftermath.\nHaving no quarrel with the remaining humans, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; returned to Durotar, leaving Jaina Proudmoore and her isle in peace. Thrall offered Rexxar a champion's welcome at &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which Rexxar refused, he had grown accustomed to hunting alone, and he returned to the wilds, where he felt at peace. However, the half-ogre considered himself as part of the Horde ever after and is at Thrall's service should the Warchief ever call upon the beastmaster's considerable talents again.\nAfter the battle, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to rule over his own people, while &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; spent some time in Durotar teaching the brewmaster ways to the mentor of &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Drohn\"&gt;Brewmaster Drohn&lt;/a&gt; before traveling on.\nMost of the survivors of Daelin's fleet eventually sailed back to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. When the people of Kul Tiras learned of their Lord Admiral's death, they cried out for vengeance, but the other nations of the Alliance were not interested. Ordeals caused by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were more immediate concerns, and the other allied leaders also had little pity for Daelin, who had launched a war of aggression on his own authority. The people of Kul Tiras furiously isolated themselves from the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; but were not angry with all of the Alliance leaders. They instead nursed a bitter hatred only towards Jaina for betraying her family. Later, Daelin's wife, &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, would succeed him as Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Rufus%20Montaine\"&gt;Rufus Montaine&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of the Proudmoore family participated in the event and died. Following the battle, Jaina and Thrall went into the city and found the deceased soldiers, one of them being Rufus who Thrall remembered from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Although Jaina and her loyalists were spared, much of Theramore was left in ruins."}

It is an important part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; and resulted in Gilneas being abandoned by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with conflicts still occurring at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe invasion of Gilneas has multiple phases: the initial ousting of the Gilnean people, the Alliance counterattack, and concluding with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s retreat from &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The first phase of the war was the Forsaken invasion into Gilneas which resulted in most of Gilneas's civilians fleeing to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. The second phase involved the fighting of the coalition forces of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; against the Forsaken and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; is a frequent battleground for the Alliance and the Horde, the fight for Gilneas has so far been an ongoing war.\nCauses of the invasion.\nDue to the events at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are \"in the dog house\" with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde leadership. With the Horde now controlled by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; , Garrosh has ordered to claim Gilneas so the Horde can have a port in southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The motivations of the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; led by were to gather worgen servants, march on &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, and get revenge on . The two groups worked together, with the worgen weakening Gilneas's defenses for the Forsaken.\nChronology.\nThe invasion and the exodus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; started a frontal assault on the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, but the Gilnean troops defending it coupled with the wall's mighty defenses were easily driving the Forsaken back despite all their efforts and daring attacks. Although the Gilneans' defenses held, the Greymane Wall began to deteriorate.\nThe worgen curse and the Wolf Cult.\nMeanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; was ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, which transformed any human into a worgen (a cursed half-wolf, half-man creature) that lost their minds to bloodlust and a desire to tear flesh. The worgen curse was being spread by and his &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to soften the Gilnean defenses from the inside in order to facilitate the invasion once the Forsaken were able to breach the Greymane Wall. The worgen curse was rapidly spreading through Gilneas, and the Wolf Cult's numbers kept growing.\nEventually Alpha Prime led his worgen in an open attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, turning many of its citizens into feral worgen and overrunning the city. While the Gilneans did try to fight off the worgen, they discovered that the numbers of the worgen were too great, and an evacuation of the city was necessary. King ordered the release of the political prisoner &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, a dissenter that led the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against him. After Crowley was released, he became convinced that he and Greymane needed to unite their efforts for the sake of their people. Crowley, understanding that the only shot for the surviving Gilneans to reach the safety of &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt; was for the worgen's attention to be kept on Gilneas City, decided to remain behind with a group of his followers at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a distraction. Crowley's group was eventually surrounded and overrun by the worgen and Crowley became a worgen himself. However, his sacrifice allowed the Gilnean refugees to successfully reach &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;.\n \u2014 the royal alchemist of King \u2014 created a special potion that when drank by a worgen, helped them bring back balance between their human and beast sides; in other words, it returned human consciousness to the cursed worgen. Thus a group of captured worgen were treated and joined the Gilneans just before the Forsaken invasion started.\nThe attack on Duskhaven.\nEven after the Wolf Cult seized Gilneas City, the defenses at the Greymane Wall were holding. However, some weeks after the refugees from Gilneas City fled to Duskhaven, the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; started and shattered the Greymane Wall \u2014 destroying its gates. It also destroyed the reefs that were defending Gilneas from a naval invasion, allowing the Forsaken to invade Gilneas both on the land and from the shore.\nSoon two ships of the Forsaken navy arrived on &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt; and commenced a bombardment. At the same time, the ships started landing; Forsaken footsoldiers and &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s disembarked from their transports and stormed the shore. However, Duskhaven troops and newly-cured worgen met their enemy head-on, and acting under the command of Prince , showed heavy resistance to the Forsaken invaders. , a Gilnean nobleman, led the counter-assault and decided to use the worgen to neutralize the Forsaken ships. He commanded them to capture the catapults that were bombarding Duskhaven and use them to catapult themselves into the ships and slay their captains: and . Lord Godfrey also ordered them to slay the Forsaken commander, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Thyala\"&gt;Dark Ranger Thyala&lt;/a&gt;. But the victory came with a price. The earth, already weakened from the bombardment, began to fragment and collapse as the Cataclysm continued. An evacuation of Duskhaven was put together just in time, before the town was completely consumed and submerged under the sea. The survivors fled to &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt;, and then further inland \u2014 into the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile moving into the Blackwald, two Gilnean stagecoaches were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s (servants of the &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; ) and crashed \u2014 including Prince Liam Greymane's own stagecoach. While Liam and a worgen adventurer rescued the stranded survivors, they also discovered a squadron of Forsaken under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Asther\"&gt;Captain Asther&lt;/a&gt; had also arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20Crash%20Site\"&gt;Stagecoach Crash Site&lt;/a&gt;. Liam Greymane decided to make the Forsaken and the ogres fight each other by ordering the worgen to steal &lt;a href=\"Koroth%27s%20Banner\"&gt;Koroth's Banner&lt;/a&gt; and plant it before the Forsaken. Soon Koroth himself arrived and thinking that the Forsaken stole his favorite banner, furiously attacked them; giving enough time for Liam and the other survivors to escape.\nOrigins of the worgen curse.\nUpon arriving to &lt;a href=\"Stormglen%20Village\"&gt;Stormglen Village&lt;/a&gt;, the Gilnean refugees discovered that the village was completely deserted, and part of it was even overrun by giant spiders. After fighting off the spiders and slaying the broodmother , the worgen decided to enter &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; itself in search for any survivors.\nWithin this dark forest, the Gilneans met the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; led by , who told them of the origins of the Worgen Curse \u2014 that long ago, there was a group of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, who were practicing the ability to shape-shift into a &lt;a href=\"Pack%20form\"&gt;wolf form&lt;/a&gt; and worshiped the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20guardian\"&gt;Ancient guardian&lt;/a&gt;, . However, during an ancient &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic forces, they abandoned the balance and allowed the beast within to consume them; thus becoming the first worgen. Eventually the night elves, led by &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; , were forced to banish them to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to sleep for eternity under a &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; identical to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the wild tree in Blackwald. However, the original worgen were released by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; and eventually started spreading their curse to the Gilneans. They also met \u2014 who had also been transformed into a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, had managed to regain the balance between man and beast \u2014 and he was furthermore curing other feral worgen. Crowley then revealed that the Forsaken were trying to find a special artifact that would bring the worgen under their control: the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, which had been brought in from &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; mere days before. A group of worgen was sent by Crowley to attack ' &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s that held the Scythe at &lt;a href=\"Woods%27%20End%20Cabin\"&gt;Woods' End Cabin&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley's forces were led by , a former follower of Lord Crowley who also became a worgen. While Tobias and his trackers were keeping the dark rangers occupied, another worgen sneaked by and stole the Scythe before it could reach Sylvanas.\nGreymane's worgen, knowing that the alchemy that had returned their minds to them would not last long, drank the waters of Tal'doren, and restored the balance between human and beast. soon arrived and ordered Crowley and his worgen to submit and join the king's army against the Forsaken, to which Crowley refused. However, when Genn Greymane arrived and revealed that he himself has been affected by the worgen curse, Crowley agreed to have his forces join the Gilnean resistance. With the Gilnean worgen united, Greymane proclaimed that he will unite all of his people to end the Forsaken invasion.\nThe unseen fight.\nWhile Greymane left for &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves led by Belysra Starbreeze, alongside Lord Crowley, Gilnean worgen, and the investigator , were confronted by , the Wolf Cult, and their Forsaken allies at Tal'doren. Belysra attempted to seal the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; worgen away beneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, but before she could do so, a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; shot her in the arm. This caused her to drop the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and Alpha Prime signaled for the army of Forsaken to surround them. Alpha Prime took possession of the scythe, but just as he was about to finish Belysra off with it, the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolf&lt;/a&gt; of Belysra's old lover \u2014 \u2014 killed Alpha Prime. With the death of their leader, the Wolf Cult scattered; leaving the Forsaken without their lupine allies and open to attack from the night elves and Gilneans.\nGodfrey's treason.\n was shocked when he discovered that his own king was a worgen, one of the very creatures he had fought against so fiercely. Godfrey, who had always condemned the transformed Gilneans as monsters, created a plan that he believed would save Gilneas. After gaining support from two eastern lords, and , Godfrey captured King Greymane, and held him prisoner at &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Godfrey planned to use Genn to strike a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by turning his king over to them.\nThe worgen, however, planned to free their king with as little bloodshed as possible. The worgen adventurer used &lt;a href=\"Krennan%27s%20Potion%20of%20Stealth\"&gt;Krennan's Potion of Stealth&lt;/a&gt; to stealthily track down and assassinate both of the traitorous eastern lords, leaving Godfrey without his support from them. Godfrey still refused to surrender, however, stating that he would rather die than serve a worgen as his king, and jumped off a cliff; thus committing suicide.\nBattle of Gilneas City.\nWith the dissent from within crushed, sent his loyal supporters to aid in liberating the mining town of &lt;a href=\"Emberstone%20Village\"&gt;Emberstone Village&lt;/a&gt; from Forsaken control. Prince and , the daughter of Lord , led the troops. The two made their headquarters in the livery stables. After freeing the enslaved Gilneans, Liam and Lorna sent their forces to dispatch the Forsaken leader, \u2014 who was known for his unbound ruthlessness \u2014 and later on \u2014 the so-called scientist who carried out inhuman experiments on the villagers too old to work the mines.\nHaving assembled an army composed of every available Gilnean, Genn finally directed the Gilneans in retaking &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. The Gilnean army was divided to attack multiple fronts on Gilneas City. Liam Greymane headed the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Square\"&gt;Merchant Square&lt;/a&gt;, while King Genn Greymane and Lord Crowley handled the assaults on the other districts. This would be known as the Battle of Gilneas City. Before entering Gilneas City and starting the battle for it, Liam made an inspiring speech:\n\"The Forsaken think we're weak, a broken people. They think we'll roll over like a scared dog... how wrong they are. We will fight them in the fields until the last trench collapses and the last cannon is silenced. We will fight them on the streets until the last shot is fired, and when there is no more ammunition, we'll crush their skulls with the stones that pave our city. We will fight them in the alleys until our knuckles are skinned and bloodied, and our rapiers lay on the ground, shattered. And if we find ourselves surrounded and disarmed, wounded, and without hope; we will lift our heads in defiance and spit in their faces. But we will never surrender! FOR GILNEAS!\"\nThe Gilnean forces under the command of started fighting their way through Gilneas City, destroying Forsaken forces positioned there. Soon they were attacked by a large number of &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. The villagers of Emberstone brought artillery cannons, however, which helped in defeating them. After Liam's forces met and united with worgen forces around &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken unleashed upon the Gilneans one of their most powerful creations \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"flesh%20beast\"&gt;flesh beast&lt;/a&gt; known as . However, the worgen took control of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20catapult\"&gt;Forsaken catapult&lt;/a&gt;s and used them to take down Gorerot quickly. Soon Liam and Crowley caught Sylvanas herself at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Court\"&gt;Greymane Court&lt;/a&gt;, while his father came and attacked from the other side. As the tide was turning against Sylvanas, she used her dark powers to stun everyone in the immediate area and aimed a poisoned arrow at Genn Greymane. Liam jumped in front of the bowshot, saving his father from certain doom. As Sylvanas fled the scene, Liam died with the knowledge that the city had been freed from Forsaken control.\nEscape from Gilneas: The endgame.\nLater on, Sylvanas met with , envoy of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; . Sylvanas told him that Gilneas was under control and consented to not use the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt;, as its development had been banned after the incident at the Wrathgate. As the emissary left, however, Sylvanas told to deploy the new plague as planned, despite Garrosh's command.\nAt the dawn of the next day, despite the wishes of Garrosh Hellscream, the Forsaken used their Blight on Gilneas. What the Forsaken didn't know, however, was that the population was already being evacuated through a secret passage to &lt;a href=\"Aderic%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Aderic's Repose&lt;/a&gt; due to and a worgen adventurer's surveillance of Sylvanas's conversation beforehand. While &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; distracted the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; using bombing bats they had recovered, destroying some of their Blight &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s and thinning out the Forsaken ranks, the rest of the Gilnean populace escaped. In the final moments of the evacuation, King Genn and the Crowley family paid their final respects to the deceased Liam Greymane and made a promise to him to liberate Gilneas one day.\nThe night elves, led by the &lt;a href=\"priestess%20of%20the%20moon\"&gt;priestess of the moon&lt;/a&gt; , made good on their promise and brought ships at &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an offer of sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;their lands&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the Forsaken's allies, the Horde, arrived as well. An orcish &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; (similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\") entered the field, preventing the transport ships from taking the Gilneans to safety. Meanwhile, another force of orcish invaders attacked Keel Harbor. While the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s were holding the enemy back, the siege weapons carried by the &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; ships were deployed and met their enemy head-on. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish attack was successfully repelled.\nHowever, the gunship was still a threat to the ships. A &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;-mounted party boarded the gunship to place explosives in the engineering room below deck. As they proceeded, the gunship's captain, , appeared and the party fled on &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s that were roosting on the lower deck. Once the explosives detonated, the gunship's engines became destroyed; causing the destroyed the gunship to crash into the Greymane Wall.\nAftermath.\nGilneas was left in ruins, both by the Forsaken invasion and by the Cataclysm ripping the very land apart. Civilians were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; following the destruction of the Horde gunship, while a large amount of the soldiers and volunteers remained in Gilneas under the leadership of . Crowley's forces formed the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and their mission is to purge the Forsaken from their lands and retake all of Gilneas for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Gilneans settled in Darnassus, the Gilnean people rejoined the Alliance and King journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the political and military capital of the Alliance. With Genn's homeland turned into a war zone and his heir slain; Genn began making plans and coordinating with the Alliance to retake his homeland. Genn now stands near &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; , a sign of the newly reforged friendship and hope that Gilneas will be reborn again.\nThe fight continues.\nThe battles in Silverpine.\nAlthough most of the Gilneans were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, a rather large military organization with the goal of retaking Gilneas and driving the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; out of their lands, remained to combat their foes under the leadership of . The Gilneas Liberation Front forces started operating not only in Gilneas, but also in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; as well, and soon had a few minor victories. Despite their large numbers (as seen throughout the Silverpine Questline, especially in Gilneas), the Gilneas Liberation Front was still incredibly outnumbered by the Forsaken who continued to grow as &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; was decimated and most of its inhabitants turned &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the Gilneas Liberation Front used unorthodox guerrilla warfare and ambush tactics against the Forsaken, which proved very effective.\nSoon after their initial pushes into Silverpine, Darius Crowley formed an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; led by . The Bloodfang pack seemed to be composed of not only Silverpine residents, but Gilneans as well (possibly from &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; or ferals who refused to follow Crowley in Gilneas); all these disparate feral worgen may have banded together to form a single pack following the Forsaken's crusade against the worgen in the aftermath of their invasion of Gilneas. discovered the alliance through her deathstalkers and agents led by &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; who were operating in Silverpine. The Bloodfang worgen started constantly ambushing and destroying Forsaken forces in Silverpine Forest. One of their most successful operations was the attack on three orc &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s, commanded by , that arrived from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to reinforce the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. These ships were full of supplies, weapons, and soldiers and a small band of Bloodfang worgen attacked them while the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Sea%20Dog\"&gt;Orc Sea Dog&lt;/a&gt;s, led by , were too drunk to be able to show any resistance. The ships were destroyed, although many Sea Dogs managed to survive and retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Rear%20Guard\"&gt;Forsaken Rear Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Soon the orcs were brought to order by a Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by , and later took part in the fight for Silverpine Forest.\nThe Forsaken, understanding that this new threat and their unorthodox tactics must be dealt with accordingly, started bolstering their numbers by slaying the Hillsbrad human refugees that have settled in &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and raising them as Forsaken using the new servants of Sylvanas \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lord Crowley and Ivar Bloodfang used these attacks to persuade the humans of Fenris Isle to become worgen. By offering to let the Hillsbrad refugees drink their worgen blood, they would become worgen and thus become immune to the Val'kyr's &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; magic while also gaining the means to exact their revenge. This single act bolstered the worgen numbers greatly, and although a large number of them were slain by artillery fire when they were trying to assault Horde outposts by crossing &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;, it barely made a scratch in their numbers. sent his &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Sea%20Dog\"&gt;Sea Dogs&lt;/a&gt; to fight the swimming to the &lt;a href=\"Decrepit%20Fields\"&gt;Decrepit Fields&lt;/a&gt;. Yet without the adequate alcohol, the Sea Dogs were defeated and mostly slain, along with their &lt;a href=\"Demolisher\"&gt;Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the fighting for Silverpine continued, the Forsaken received word that Crowley and Bloodfang would be meeting in the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas took advantage of this opportunity by sending her best warriors under the command of one of her elite, , to trap and corner the worgen leaders in the mine, which had only one entrance. However, the meeting was in truth a trap. Instead of finding Crowley and Bloodfang, the Forsaken found the entire shaft of the mine rigged with explosives. Cornered, the last thing the doomed Forsaken had seen was Ivar entering, taunting them for falling prey to his trap, followed by the detonation of the explosives as Ivar fled the shaft. An entire squadron of s, as well as Forteski, were slaughtered. A lone &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Horde agent&lt;/a&gt; survived the trap, having been saved by Forteski just before his demise.\nAt the same time, another large group of Forsaken veteran troopers and catapults have been crossing &lt;a href=\"Olsen%27s%20Farthing\"&gt;Olsen's Farthing&lt;/a&gt;, only to meet a brutal ambush by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;; leaving no survivors.\nThe liberation of Gilneas.\nBy this time, the Gilneans had already arrived in Darnassus. King had arrived in Stormwind, asking \u2014 King of Stormwind \u2014 to send the Gilneas Liberation Front aid. With the power-hungry Forsaken decimating the Alliance in the north, the potential of Gilneas as an Alliance foothold, and understanding the plight of their new allies; King Varian needed little convincing to agree. The king's finest soldiers \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were sent to ensure victory in Gilneas.\nLed by , the 7th Legion fleet arrived off the coast of Gilneas, where they discovered a large &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fleet. To clear the way for the bulk of their troops, the 7th Legion used &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s to covertly blow up the Horde's ships. Meanwhile , commander of the Forsaken forces in Gilneas, sent a Horde agent to restore communications between the outposts on the land.\nIt was soon discovered that not only had the Gilneans been assaulting &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt;, but all of the Forsaken outposts in Gilneas had been lost to the Alliance \u2014 including Gilneas City. This major loss was an ill omen for the Forsaken in the war for Gilneas. The Horde agent was sent to see if any of the closest Forsaken outposts, namely &lt;a href=\"Dreadwatch%20Outpost\"&gt;Dreadwatch Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rutsak%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Rutsak's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, were still under their control. It was soon discovered that Dreadwatch was ravaged by the Alliance. Rutsak's Guard too had fallen, with being the lone survivor of his outpost.\nThe Forsaken, having confirmed the loss of Gilneas City to the Alliance, had discovered that the forces that obliterated Dreadwatch and Rutsak's Guard were, in fact, the Gilneas Liberation Front and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It was revealed that a vanguard force of the 7th Legion had infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; using submarines, liberated it from Forsaken control, and made the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Quarter\"&gt;Cathedral Quarter&lt;/a&gt; courtyard their base of operations. After which, they regrouped with the Gilneas Liberation Front and aided them in destroying the Forsaken outposts under the command of . Master Sergeant Pietro Zaren himself engineered the slaughter of all the Forsaken troops at Rutsak's Guard, leaving alive only so that he may be traumatized by their strength. The lone Horde agent was sent to assassinate the Master Sergeant, many of his submariners, and also evaluate the enemy's numbers which the Horde would soon have to face. By using a telescope to observe the enemy forces, the Horde agent discovered that a large Alliance naval force was en route to Gilneas. Meanwhile, Forsaken Forward Command was assaulted by the combined forces of the Gilneas Liberation Front, the Bloodfang pack and the 7th Legion; thus crushing the last true foothold the Forsaken had in Gilneas.\nWith no other options, the Forsaken were driven back into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and Gilneas was at last liberated. However, the Horde adventurers, with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; , and , managed to recover the corpse of \u2014 despite all efforts of the Gilneas Liberation Front to destroy them \u2014 and brought it to Sylvanas. Meanwhile, Belmont's deathstalkers recovered the corpses of two of Godfrey's lieutenants \u2014 and \u2014 so that could resurrect them all as powerful allies against the worgen.\nThe fall of Ambermill.\nNow that Gilneas was secure, the Gilneas Liberation Front and the Bloodfang pack started concentrating their forces at the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; for the grand offensive into Silverpine. Meanwhile, had raised Godfrey, Walden, and Ashbury as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and conscripted them into the Forsaken war machine. After the ritual was complete, Sylvanas \u2014 with the aid of Godfrey \u2014 started preparing her own forces for battle. She ordered the Horde agent who had continued to serve successfully throughout Silverpine to lead an important assault upon &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 one of the last &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; settlements in the lands which (despite the Kirin Tor's stance of neutrality) had made a pact with the Alliance forces.\nOut of the need to survive, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mages of Ambermill and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; (left behind to protect the land for the day when Dalaran would return), made a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to protect themselves from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; who in the past years had attacked the mages and continued to do so in the present. They agreed to fight with the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20army\"&gt;Stormwind army&lt;/a&gt; when the time was right to repel the Forsaken. To protect themselves until then, they phased the entirety of Ambermill's population in a pocket dimension in order to guard themselves until the forthcoming battle. In their absence, the magi left behind numerous s to maintain the grounds of Ambermill while they were gone.\nHowever, the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of \u2014 a former &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; who had been a long-standing member of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; (dating back to their freedom from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;) \u2014 used the &lt;a href=\"Ambermill%20Codex\"&gt;Ambermill Codex&lt;/a&gt; to find the portal to Ambermill's pocket dimension in &lt;a href=\"Beren%27s%20Peril\"&gt;Beren's Peril&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde adventurer entered the portal using a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Archmage%27s%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;Dalaran Archmage's Signet Ring&lt;/a&gt; taken after slaying &lt;a href=\"Relios%20the%20Relic%20Keeper\"&gt;Relios the Relic Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and brought the town back to its original state by overloading the arcane powers of \u2014 who was responsible for maintaining the barrier. At this point, the Forsaken army \u2014 already amassed at the border ready to strike \u2014 invaded Ambermill and slew the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mages, while the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; immediately raised them as new Forsaken.\nThe Alliance counteroffensive.\nFollowing the success in Ambermill, Sylvanas sent , , and the adventurer to southern Silverpine and crush the Alliance counteroffensive by gaining key victories for the Forsaken.\nThe first move was to retake and destroy &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, which had been attacked and taken over by a large number of 7th Legion troops which had decimated almost all of the Forsaken forces occupying it. The group soon found all of the 7th Legion members used in the attack were non-human; a clever tactic as the Val'kyr were unable to raise non-human creatures. Soon after, the Horde agents crushed the Legion forces in the area. Following the destruction of the 7th Legion troops, and the rescue of the surviving Forsaken troops (Although Godfrey slew several troops, claiming they were weak.), the village was set ablaze.\nTheir next move was attacking the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;7th Legion Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the command of \u2014 a &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; 7th Legion commander. The base camp was garrisoned, similarly to that of the Pyrewood forces, by non-human 7th Legion members \u2014 mainly dwarven. The group assassinated and pillaged the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Battle%20Plan\"&gt;7th Legion Battle Plan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a great advantage for the Horde forces.\nMeanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; fleet reached the shores of Gilneas and started landing the bulk of their forces for the assault on Silverpine Forest. The combined force of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; and the Gilneas Liberation Front started the offensive and clashed with the main Forsaken army positioned at the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt;. As the battle went on, Godfrey and his entourage moved to the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; after having gained intel that it was led by no other than \u2014 Darius Crowley's own daughter. It was revealed that unlike most of the Gilnean forces, Lorna had not been turned into a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, making it possible to slay and raise her as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The group set out to capture Lorna, planning to use her as a bargaining chip to force to retreat before the Forsaken were overwhelmed by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccompanied by , her Val'kyr trio, and her most trusted soldier; rode across &lt;a href=\"The%20Battlefront\"&gt;The Battlefront&lt;/a&gt;, which was filled with &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces combating fiercely at every turn. She then met with and at the shattered gates of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, where she offered Crowley a choice: either he surrenders and sounds his forces' immediate retreat into Gilneas, or his daughter would be slain and risen as Forsaken to serve the Banshee Queen forever. Godfrey, Walden, and Ashbury then arrived with the captured Lorna, showing Sylvanas was not bluffing. Unable to allow such a horrifying fate to happen to his daughter, Crowley agreed to retreat back to Gilneas and give up Gilneas City, to which Ivar reacted negatively (calling him a bastard), and made a howl before running away. Lorna was released, and Crowley departed with his daughter as well.\nAs the three fled back to the safety of Gilneas, the Alliance forces following suit, Godfrey did the unthinkable and assassinated as she was proclaiming the Forsaken's victory and was preparing her troops for an assault on Gilneas in order to annihilate the remaining Alliance forces. In shock, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; members had a short duel with Godfrey and his two undead Gilnean comrades (Ashbury and Walden) until they were overpowered and forced to fall back to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Cromush ordered the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to \"fix\" the Banshee Queen, and the three Val'kyr sacrificed their lives to resurrect her. The Dark Lady rose again, furious with rage at Godfrey's betrayal and stating that he would have to pay for his traitorous act; while also losing any doubt that Val'kyr were indeed the future of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. After this, the Banshee Queen returned to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to recover; while the Bloodfang pack and Gilneas Liberation Front fell back to Gilneas.\nAftermath.\nIn the end, the Forsaken ended up losing all major land bases and holdings in Gilneas to the overwhelming Alliance forces. The Alliance also took heavy casualties but they succeeded in reclaiming the mainland of Gilneas and are attempting to maintain their tenuous foothold. This, however, has not stopped the area from being a hot spot for the Horde and Alliance to fight over Gilneas's resources. The Forsaken continue to launch naval assaults on the Gilnean coastline, which is now a fierce back and forth &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. As the Alliance attempts to repulse the Forsaken endeavors to regain a foothold on the land, the Forsaken troops continue to land along the coast, attempting to regain a staging ground for a larger assault to destroy the Alliance in the area.\n, actually a black drakonid, and his &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt; forces secured Gilneas City at some point, though their ultimate status is left unknown after Creed's death. Currently, the city is deserted, with only partially buried ruins remaining.\nBefore the Storm.\nBy the time of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Gilneas was referred to as fallen, with nothing but \"wind, sorrow and ruin\" in the land. When Genn arrived at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the events of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, he told Anduin that both kingdoms were now in ruins, with Gilneas being home to the Forsaken and Stromgarde being overrun with criminals, ogres, and trolls. The book later references the kingdom as completely abandoned; thus leaving its fate &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas%23Status\"&gt;ambiguous&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The goal of the war is to prevent the Legion from securing a foothold on Outland to further their attacks on Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater in the conflict, the Alliance and the Horde also came into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nPreparations for war.\nSince coming to Outland in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had spent the last several years amassing power. He both conquered and enslaved natives of the dead world, and trained an army of &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, all for the purpose of instigating an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s homeworld, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. After Illidan destroyed the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt; and dealt the greatest blow that the Burning Legion had felt in ten thousand years, the Legion was now clearly aware of the threat that Illidan posed and would learn from spies from within the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; that Illidan planned to launch a similar assault on Argus. Seeking to put an end to Illidan, the Betrayer believed that &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; had decided to attack the forces of Azeroth, and lure them into entering Outland. Once within the shattered realm, the Horde and Alliance would begin striking against both the Legion and the Illidari. Kil'jaeden manipulated his enemies into fighting each other, and when they were weakened from the battle he planned to destroy them all.\nRight before the invasion of Outland began, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reached out to the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces amassing on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; heard their pleas but could not spare many forces, occupied as they were fighting the Burning Legion across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. However, a faction of the naaru known as the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, did agree to help. They arrived on Outland in the great dimensional fortress &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew alliances.\nBlood elves join the Horde.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were able to reclaim much of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, coming under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Ranger General Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. When Rommath was sent back to Azeroth, he relayed their beloved prince's message of hope for the blood elves remaining in Quel'Thalas: that one day Kael'thas would return to lead his people to paradise. Rommath had made great progress in teaching the blood elves advanced techniques to manipulate arcane energies. However, new trials appeared on the horizon: the technique of taking magic from external sources resulted in the birth of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;,\" a small offshoot of undead-esque, disorganized magical addicts who were unable to keep their withdrawal in check. Their presence became a reminder to the blood elves of the importance of controlling their magical addiction \u2014 for if they do not, it will control them. Blood elven adventurers went about putting down a number of the small pockets of Wretched lingering in &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their troubles, many of the blood elves were emboldened by Prince Kael'thas' promises and would even seek to journey to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; in order to partake in the paradise Kael'thas had promised them.\nAfter Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider's conquest of Tempest Keep, he captured a naaru named &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; and sent it to Quel'Thalas so that the magic-addicted blood elves could feed upon it. Back in the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; was not content with this idea. After long months of study and experimentation, he and his fellow wizards learned how to manipulate and corrupt the naaru's luminous energies. In the end, the wizards devised a process by which the powers of the Light could be transferred to recipients who had not earned such abilities. Instead of feeding upon the naaru's magic, the blood elves would wield the naaru's Light-given powers themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, formerly a priestess, had recently renounced her vows, for she felt the Light had abandoned her people. She learned of the wizards' achievement and volunteered to be the first to bend the stolen powers to her will. With her decision a new order was born: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. These renegade &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s would be able to harness the sacred powers of the Alliance's noblest heroes, an advantage that enticed &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;High Chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; despite their distaste for the blood knights' methods.\nThe blood elves were caught in the throes of constant combat: with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence emanating from &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; on one hand, and continued raids and attacks coming from the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who maintain their own holdings within the ruins and ziggurats of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; on the other. The former threat was ultimately neutralized, thanks to the combined efforts of the sin'dorei &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, along with support from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Under direction from leaders within the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, this culminated with the eventual battle with and the demise of the Scourge leader, &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, whose head was sent to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt;. Concurrent with &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Anvilward\"&gt;failed negotiations&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;night elven incursions&lt;/a&gt; into Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar began to forge an alliance with the faction his Forsaken allies now belonged to: the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Several ambassadors were sent to and from Silvermoon, and Dar'Khan's death cleared any doubts that the blood elves would be a hindrance to the Horde. With the blood elves' induction into the Horde, the sin'dorei now have the military might to secure their lands and the logistical aid for their pilgrimages to Outland, while the Horde gains the diverse expertise of the blood elves and a guide for Thrall to find the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har orcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenei join the Alliance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; discovered the power of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and successfully seized it. To escape, the draenei came out of hiding and managed to wrestle control of a wing of the keep, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and tried to use it to flee and find aid in retaking their home. Before they could, however, the blood elves managed to sabotage what is essentially the \"engine\" of the draenei's &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Ship\"&gt;transdimensional travel&lt;/a&gt;. The remainder of the Keep lies in Outland in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and is now the home of Prince Kael'thas.\nA month later, a terrible explosion tore open the skies above northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. At that moment, the great ship \"Exodar\", plummeted from the heavens and crashed upon the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Exodar\" crash-landed on a chain of islands, the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, off the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Their arrival on Azeroth wasn't pretty \u2014 they ended up tearing up the landscape over on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst\"&gt;Azuremyst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. While they were, of course, concerned about their fellow survivors, they were just as concerned with what they'd done to the land and the creatures on it. Nevertheless, the noble draenei had succeeded in finding a safe haven and a new home. Eventually they came to discover that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; (known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;) had followed them to Azeroth to murder them, enslave &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, and steal the \"Exodar\". After fending off the blood elven incursions, the draenei rescued an injured &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; who thought the draenei to be their demonic &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; kin.\nInspired by tales of the heroic &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that stood against the might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei have come to enlist aid in retaking their shattered homeland. Dedicated to preserving life and upholding the tenets of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei hope to gather a new coalition of warriors to battle the Burning Legion and put a halt to its horrific &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Armed only with courage and their unshakable faith in the Light, the draenei sought out the Alliance in order to usher them towards the destiny that awaits beyond the skies of Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; had long foreseen the friendship the draenei would have with the noble Alliance and his prophecy came to fruition when his people made the first contact with the residents of &lt;a href=\"Odesyus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Odesyus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they uncovered a conspiracy to harm the Alliance and the draenei involving the Sunfury, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, and their traitorous agents: &lt;a href=\"Engineer%20%22Spark%22%20Overgrind\"&gt;Engineer \"Spark\" Overgrind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt;. After further investigation, it is discovered that the traitor eredar Sironas (who has been hiding among the draenei populace) has been leading a group of blood elves called the &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s in abducting draenei survivors, torturing them until they willingly desire to become man'ari eredar, and also opening &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gate\"&gt;Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt;s to prime Kalimdor for a blood elven invasion. After securing &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei of the \"Exodar\" recognized they would require allies and resources to fend off future threats. &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Paetheus\"&gt;Anchorite Paetheus&lt;/a&gt; had sent draenei adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, the closest Alliance settlement, to propose cooperation in the fight against their common foes. They have also sent &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20Valustraa\"&gt;Emissary Valustraa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20Taluun\"&gt;Emissary Taluun&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to maintain diplomatic ties with their new allies and direct their adventurers to support their allies in their troubled lands. Eventually, the Alliance destroyed the Sun Gate and defeated Sironas and her Sunhawks; which consequently prevented Prince Kael'thas from invading Kalimdor and corrupting the draenei into demons.\nDark Portal Opens.\nPrior to the re-opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched several attacks on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s opened portals to several areas in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the capital cities. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s closed the portals on the Outland side.\n&lt;a href=\"Kazzak%20the%20Supreme\"&gt;Doomlord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; discovered an unknown relic and used its power to re-open the Dark Portal. In his stead, he left fellow &lt;a href=\"doomlord\"&gt;doomlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; to sow discord across the major cities of Azeroth. Several waves of contingents from the Burning Legion attempted to breach the portal from Outland's side, but were kept at bay by the soldiers and mages from &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, supported by reinforcements from the ever-vigilant &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; troops from across Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces under &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Commander%20Relthorn%20Netherwane\"&gt;Watch Commander Relthorn Netherwane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Dar%27toon\"&gt;Warlord Dar'toon&lt;/a&gt; arrived later in the battle and were able to successfully repel the Legion's forces.\nThis part of the war is officially called the Battle for the Dark Portal.\nHellfire Peninsula.\nConjoined invasion of Outland.\nAfter repelling the Legion's forces, Netherwane and Dar'toon dispatched adventurers to aid the troops under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Duron\"&gt;Commander Duron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General%20Orion\"&gt;Lieutenant General Orion&lt;/a&gt; in a conjoined effort to claim the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and establish footholds in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. When the defenders of Azeroth pushed through into Hellfire Peninsula, Kruul joined his forces at the Stair of Destiny to fight them. Unbeknownst to the Azerothian forces, Kruul was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s who distracted him long enough for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to kill him with a blast of fel magic that tore a hole through his torso. Without Kruul to command them the demons fell into disarray, allowing the Alliance and Horde to gain a foothold at the Stair of Destiny. They would never learn that the Illidari had saved them from certain defeat at the hands of Kruul.\nThe Alliance was able to reinforce their already established base at &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 still under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; after two decades \u2014 while the Horde forces under Thrall's trusted advisor &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; established the new settlement of &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Alliance and Horde focused on the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; seeking to escape the violence of Outland fled to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in droves. Meanwhile, the blood elf pilgrims coming into Outland have sought new routes to Horde outposts not patrolled by the Alliance. Both &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Vanura\"&gt;Scout Vanura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Venn%27ren\"&gt;Ranger Captain Venn'ren&lt;/a&gt; sent their agents to clear the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fissure\"&gt;Great Fissure&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stonescythe%20Whelp\"&gt;Stonescythe Whelp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stonescythe%20Alpha\"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt;s so their charges may use the secret pass to safely traverse to their respective destinations.\nSome of the Broken who eluded slavery by the Illidari found sanctuary with the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei have kept their distance from orcs \u2014 even those that were untainted by demonic corruption. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Sedai\"&gt;Vindicator Sedai&lt;/a&gt; believed it was time for the draenei to set their differences aside and negotiate a peace with the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Post\"&gt;Mag'har Post&lt;/a&gt;. Sedai never returned from his quest and when his brother &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Obadei\"&gt;Anchorite Obadei&lt;/a&gt; sent Alliance agents to search for Sedai, they found him murdered. When the Alliance returned to the Temple of Telhamat to tell Obadei Sedai's fate, Obadei and some others believed the Mag'har murdered Sedai in cold blood. The Broken &lt;a href=\"Makuru\"&gt;Makuru&lt;/a&gt;, who saw Sedai as a brother, enlisted Alliance adventurers to kill Mag'har grunts in retaliation. Obadei found out about Makuru's vengeance and rebuked him as it went against Sedai's ideals. Obadei sent the Alliance adventurer responsible for the Mag'har killings to &lt;a href=\"Amaan%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Amaan the Wise&lt;/a&gt; who subsequently sent the adventurer to retrieve 10 &lt;a href=\"Sha%27naar%20Relic\"&gt;Sha'naar Relic&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sha%27naar\"&gt;Ruins of Sha'naar&lt;/a&gt;. Using the relics to create a &lt;a href=\"Seer%27s%20Relic\"&gt;Seer's Relic&lt;/a&gt;, Amaan tasked the adventurer to return to the &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; of Sedai and witness a vision of a likely sequence of events that led to Sedai's death. The adventurer saw a vision that depicted Sedai not murdered by the Mag'har but rather by the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krun%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Krun Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt;. The vision has cast doubt on the righteousness of the adventurer's actions and although the validity of the vision is not absolute, Amaan advised the adventurer to consider remaining open to the possibilities.\nDisruption of the Legion invasion.\nAfter the initial Azerothian victory at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion attempted to retake the Portal in order to cease the flow of troops into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and resume their invasion of Azeroth.\nLegion teleporters set behind the enemy lines provided a constant flow of troops to throw themselves at the Stair of Destiny. A nameless &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Commander\"&gt;Pit Commander&lt;/a&gt; organized an army of &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Siegebreaker\"&gt;Infernal Siegebreaker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Soldier\"&gt;Fel Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20Master\"&gt;Wrath Master&lt;/a&gt;s in an attempt to push back the Azerothian forces. The joint-faction army, inspired by the champions &lt;a href=\"Justinius%20the%20Harbinger\"&gt;Justinius the Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melgromm%20Highmountain\"&gt;Melgromm Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; fought a tireless battle to keep the Portal safe. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Altumus\"&gt;Sergeant Altumus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Shatterskull\"&gt;Sergeant Shatterskull&lt;/a&gt; led the Alliance and Horde in whittling away &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Doom Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. The Legion invasion was finally broken when Alliance and Horde forces under &lt;a href=\"Forward%20Commander%20Kingston\"&gt;Forward Commander Kingston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forward%20Commander%20To%27arch\"&gt;Forward Commander To'arch&lt;/a&gt; later managed to take down the &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;s that were protecting the Legion's front teleporters and proceeded to destroy the portals with decisive air-raids employing technology developed by &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt;.\nBombing raids were carried out on the crucial &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Murketh\"&gt;Murketh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Shaadraz\"&gt;Shaadraz gateways&lt;/a&gt; and the forge camps of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Shelf\"&gt;Abyssal Shelf&lt;/a&gt;. Efforts to disrupt &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; factories at Forge Camps: and were also carried out by Horde and Alliance troops.\nLater on, during the assault on , &lt;a href=\"Warbringer%20Arix%27Amal\"&gt;Warbringer Arix'Amal&lt;/a&gt; was killed and the portal shut down. After translating a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion%20Missive\"&gt;Burning Legion Missive&lt;/a&gt; that was dropped by the fallen Arix'Amal, the Alliance and Horde set out to dispatch &lt;a href=\"terrorfiend\"&gt;terrorfiend&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements at the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Aggonar\"&gt;Pools of Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Force Commander Danath Trollbane and Nazgrel sent heroes from their respective factions to dispatch Kazzak the Supreme's notorious lieutenant \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Arazzius%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Arazzius the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the draenei in the Alliance sought to cleanse the Pools of Aggonar of its corruption while the blood elves of the Horde sought to harness the Pools of Aggonar's fel power and stop the draenei from purifying it. Concerned that the blood elves' magic addiction will lead to ruin, &lt;a href=\"Elsaana\"&gt;Elsaana&lt;/a&gt; sent Alliance adventurers to banish the uncontrolled &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Fields\"&gt;Warp Fields&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the blood elves from consuming their energies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; have also drawn hostile &lt;a href=\"Colossus\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Sky%20Ridge\"&gt;Fallen Sky Ridge&lt;/a&gt; by corrupting them with a giant red crystal which was dropped on the ridge and caused a massive earthquake. Since the red crystal emanated an evil presence, it turned the local colossi mad and hostile. &lt;a href=\"Tola%27thion\"&gt;Tola'thion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; recruited adventurers to kill some of the &lt;a href=\"Raging%20Colossus\"&gt;raging colossi&lt;/a&gt;. After finding &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Crystal%20Shard\"&gt;Crimson Crystal Shard&lt;/a&gt;s on their corpses, Tola'thion sent the crystal samples to &lt;a href=\"Earthbinder%20Galandria%20Nightbreeze\"&gt;Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze&lt;/a&gt; who discovered the crimson crystals were the cause of the colossi's hostile madness. Galandria foiled the blood elves' machinations by sending adventurers to her magic circle and having them use a &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Revitalization\"&gt;Seed of Revitalization&lt;/a&gt;'s nature magic to heal the land around the crimson crystal through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation. Before the hero can complete the ritual however, they were met by &lt;a href=\"Pathaleon%20the%20Calculator%27s%20Image\"&gt;Pathaleon the Calculator's Image&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned &lt;a href=\"Goliathon\"&gt;Goliathon&lt;/a&gt; to halt the hero's efforts. The adventurer was forced to put Goliathon down and Galandria was subsequently furious to learn &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s blood elves were responsible for such reckless desecration of the land.\nThe final nail in the coffin for the Burning Legion's invasion was the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kazzak%20the%20Supreme\"&gt;Kazzak the Supreme&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar against the Fel Horde.\nThe Alliance and Horde have also sent their forces to contend with the new &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; threat. The Horde from &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; and the Sons of Lothar focused their efforts on diminishing the fel orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde, however, were also interested in studying their blood to discover how they've become fel tainted. The Horde collected samples of Bonechewer and &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; fel orc blood to further their investigation, and fueled their &lt;a href=\"Demoniac%20Scryer\"&gt;Demoniac Scryer&lt;/a&gt; with the souls of &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Horde adventurers planted the Demoniac Scryer in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Basin\"&gt;Hellfire Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where it analyzed the findings to conclude that &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; harbored a powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; likened to that of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, and that it was imprisoned and coerced to somehow produce fel orcs. After relaying this information to Nazgrel, Nazgrel sent adventurers to kill &lt;a href=\"Force-Commander%20Gorax\"&gt;Force-Commander Gorax&lt;/a&gt; and then tasked his agents to plant a Horde banner on his corpse. Afterward, the Horde heroes would then challenge the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Kargath\"&gt;Hand of Kargath&lt;/a&gt; and slay him as well.\nThe Alliance and Horde have also been clashing with each other to capture the &lt;a href=\"Overlook\"&gt;Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stadium\"&gt;Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Hill\"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain a staging ground for their assaults on &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The two factions also sent their champions to raid the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt;, steal their supplies, and slay &lt;a href=\"Watchkeeper%20Gargolmar\"&gt;Watchkeeper Gargolmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omor%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Omor the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt;, and the drake-riding &lt;a href=\"Vazruden%20the%20Herald\"&gt;Vazruden the Herald&lt;/a&gt;. From Vazruden's lifeless corpse, the heroes discovered an &lt;a href=\"Ominous%20Letter\"&gt;ominous letter&lt;/a&gt; that proved that the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance and the Horde then sent adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; in order to get fel orc blood samples so that they may study how Illidan was producing fel orcs. After clearing the Blood Furnace of its defenders and slaying &lt;a href=\"The%20Maker\"&gt;The Maker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broggok\"&gt;Broggok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Keli%27dan%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Keli'dan the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;; the Alliance and Horde raiders reported back their findings to their respective factions. Both factions grew concerned with how Illidan was using demonic blood and powerful demons to recruit his Fel Horde army.\nMeanwhile, the Alliance reclaimed insignias of fallen Honor Hold soldiers that the Bleeding Hollow clan were turning into &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Talisman%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;cursed talismans&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Ironridge\"&gt;Corporal Ironridge&lt;/a&gt; tasked Alliance adventurers to venture into &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27Gor\"&gt;Zeth'Gor&lt;/a&gt; and slay &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Morkh\"&gt;Warlord Morkh&lt;/a&gt;. With Morkh dead, the Sons of Lothar displayed &lt;a href=\"Morkh%27s%20Shattered%20Armor\"&gt;Morkh's Shattered Armor&lt;/a&gt; to embolden their soldiers and send a message to the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Alliance adventurers accomplished their mission in &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27Gor\"&gt;Zeth'Gor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Jules\"&gt;Colonel Jules&lt;/a&gt; led the Sons of Lothar in an assault near &lt;a href=\"Gor%27gaz%20Outpost\"&gt;Gor'gaz Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Colonel Jules was stricken with demonic corruption during the battle, however, forcing &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Barada\"&gt;Anchorite Barada&lt;/a&gt; to perform an exorcism on him. Barada's assistant, &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20Klatu\"&gt;Klatu&lt;/a&gt;, aided Barada in preparing for the ritual. Klatu sent Alliance adventurers to Gor'gaz Outpost to avenge Colonel Jules by slaying the Shattered Hand orcs and releasing their &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Spirit\"&gt;fel spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. He also tasked the adventurers with helping him find his &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Prayer%20Beads\"&gt;Draenei Prayer Beads&lt;/a&gt;. Anchorite Barada performed the exorcism successfully, saving Colonel Jule's soul. With the Fel Horde reeling from their constant defeats, the Fel Horde began to make plans to launch an all-out assault on their enemies. Danath Trollbane dispatched Alliance heroes to disrupt their plans by eliminating the Fel Horde commander, &lt;a href=\"Drillmaster%20Zurok\"&gt;Drillmaster Zurok&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Azeroth's champions slew &lt;a href=\"Smith%20Gorlunk\"&gt;Smith Gorlunk&lt;/a&gt;, they worked with their respective factions' blacksmiths to construct the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls%20Key\"&gt;Shattered Halls Key&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the key that opens the gate to the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt;. With the halls open to them, the Alliance and Horde sent adventurers to lay the final blow and take the fel orcs' seat of power. &lt;a href=\"Gunny\"&gt;Gunny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caza%27rez\"&gt;Caza'rez&lt;/a&gt; were fatally wounded by a powerful warlock curse during the assault, and they asked their compatriots to avenge them by slaying many of the Fel Horde's ranks. After the heroes purified Gunny and Caza'rez of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Nethekurse\"&gt;Grand Warlock Nethekurse&lt;/a&gt;'s curses, the heroes went on to slay &lt;a href=\"Warbringer%20O%27mrogg\"&gt;Warbringer O'mrogg&lt;/a&gt; and displayed his &lt;a href=\"O%27mrogg%27s%20Warcloth\"&gt;warcloth&lt;/a&gt; as a token of the Alliance and Horde's military successes. Finally, the adventurers killed &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Warchief Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; and brought &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Kargath%27s%20Fist\"&gt;his fist&lt;/a&gt; to their faction's leadership in order to usher in the end of the Fel Horde's reign of terror. Ultimately, the adventurers delved deeper into &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Magtheridon's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. There they slew the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Channeler\"&gt;Hellfire Channeler&lt;/a&gt;s that were holding the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; captive, and ultimately slew &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; himself. Without Magtheridon's demon blood to taint Outland's orcish population, Illidan could no longer sustain his fel orc army.\nPlight of the Broken.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers aided &lt;a href=\"Naladu\"&gt;Naladu&lt;/a&gt; atone for the betrayal of his tribe by freeing the elders of the &lt;a href=\"Dreghood%20tribe\"&gt;Dreghood tribe&lt;/a&gt; from slavery and slaying their &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; overseer \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Arzeth%20the%20Merciless\"&gt;Arzeth the Merciless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ikan\"&gt;Ikan&lt;/a&gt;, a Broken who found sanctuary with the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt;, recruited Alliance adventurers to slay the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Illidari Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;s oppressing his Dreghood kin.\nDefending against Bloodreaver's army.\nSometime during the Invasion of Outland, &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; sought to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and become the new Lord of Outland and, eventually, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To these ends, Ragnok united a band of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s under his strict rule and bargained with &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; mercenary, in order to gain his help with enslaving &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Nether%20dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; to bolster his forces.\nEventually, he managed to defeat his rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, and took their surviving warriors and nether dragons to strengthen his army. With them, he set out to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. His machinations were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; and a combined &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; army; who defeated his forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Jorad Mace destroyed Ragnok's device which controlled his nether dragons and called on the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to judge Ragnok, blasting apart his chest with a radiant swing of his hammer and sending his disintegrating body tumbling from the back of his nether dragon mount. With their leader dead and losing the nether dragons' support, the Alliance and Horde armies drove off the remains of Ragnok's forces.\nFollowing the battle, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; took the enthralled nether dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of freeing them from their enthrallment.\nDesiccation of Zangarmarsh.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; began to enslave the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to bolster the naga's workforce and further their agenda in Outland. Nearly all of the &lt;a href=\"Wastewalker%20tribe\"&gt;Wastewalker tribe&lt;/a&gt; has been captured and put to work to drain the waters of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to take control of all the waters of Outland, and through them, its people.\nThe Alliance began to militarize the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; ruins such as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei from these ruins sought to reconnect with the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; from other draenei settlements such as the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Feralfen%20tribe\"&gt;Feralfen&lt;/a&gt; Lost Ones in the &lt;a href=\"Boha%27mu%20Ruins\"&gt;Boha'mu Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. While the Feralfen refused to re-assimilate with draenei society, the Kurenai were more receptive to reconciliation. In response to the Alliance's expansion, the Horde has begun creating outposts of its own. In Zangarmarsh, the Horde had established &lt;a href=\"Swamprat%20Post\"&gt;Swamprat Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zabra%27jin\"&gt;Zabra'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from the hostile wildlife, the biggest threats to the Alliance and Horde are the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfen%20tribe\"&gt;Daggerfen tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20tribe\"&gt;Ango'rosh&lt;/a&gt; ogres. The Ango'rosh are encroaching upon &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zabra%27jin\"&gt;Zabra'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ikuti\"&gt;Ikuti&lt;/a&gt; wants their leader, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Gorefist\"&gt;Overlord Gorefist&lt;/a&gt;, dead because he believes that the centerpiece of an ogre tribe is the leader. While &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Denjai\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Denjai&lt;/a&gt; doesn't want only him dead, but his followers as well; he also wants the head of &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Grog%27ak\"&gt;Boss Grog'ak&lt;/a&gt;. Ikuti and Denjai also sent adventurers to cull the Daggerfen Brokens' population since they are the most hostile Broken tribe in the marsh and they can't afford to let them spread their influence over the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s. They also put a bounty on the Daggerfen leader, &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Mummaki\"&gt;Chieftain Mummaki&lt;/a&gt;, for the numerous attacks on the Kurenai and Zabra'jin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; also traveled to Zangarmarsh to study Outland's pockets of life. Ever since the Cenarion Expedition set foot in Zangarmarsh however, the naga have continuously launched lethal attacks against them without warning. &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Hamoot\"&gt;Warden Hamoot&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and had them cull their numbers in retaliation. The Broken &lt;a href=\"Ikeyen\"&gt;Ikeyen&lt;/a&gt; also sent adventurers to kill the &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen%20tribe\"&gt;Umbrafen tribe&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Kataru\"&gt;Kataru&lt;/a&gt; in order to safeguard escaped slaves such as himself.\nEventually, the Cenarion Expedition discovered Zangarmarsh's lakes and marshes have consistently been drying up and began investigating in order to preserve the region's ecosystem. The Cenarion Expedition discovered the naga have been draining the major lakes of Zangarmarsh and sabotaged the nagas' steam pumps that were draining the lakes to prevent further damage to the marsh.\nAided by adventurers, &lt;a href=\"Ysiel%20Windsinger\"&gt;Ysiel Windsinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Jhang\"&gt;Watcher Jhang&lt;/a&gt; led an expedition to investigate the evil machinations of the naga in the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers met &lt;a href=\"Skar%27this\"&gt;Skar'this&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; loyalist and political prisoner of Lady Vashj in the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt;. Skar'this offers to grant the adventurers &lt;a href=\"The%20Mark%20of%20Vashj\"&gt;The Mark of Vashj&lt;/a&gt; which allows entrance into Vashj's lair \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in exchange for helping him restore the Cudgel of Kar'desh. Adventurers slew &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain the elemental signets required to restore the cudgel. With the cudgel restored to him, Skar'this broke free from his bonds and marked the adventurers, giving the heroes access to Vashj's seat of power. The expedition disrupted the nagas' operations and ultimately led to the slaying of Lady Vashj, ending their efforts to drain the waters of Zangarmarsh once and for all.\nSurviving Terokkar.\nThe Sha'tar naaru left their crystalline fortress Tempest Keep behind in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, and were drawn to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; where a small remnant of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; priesthood known as the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; conducted its rites inside a ruined temple. The Aldor quickly regained its strength as word spread that the naaru had returned and reconstruction of Shattrath began. Shattrath City soon became one of the last refuges of Outland and an infirmary for ailing refugees from wars.\nA large regiment of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; had been sent by Illidan Stormrage's ally, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, to lay waste to Shattrath City. As the regiment of blood elves crossed the bridge, the Aldor's exarchs and vindicators lined up to defend the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Then the unexpected happened: the blood elves laid down their weapons in front of the city's defenders. Their leader, a blood elf elder known as &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal\"&gt;Voren'thal&lt;/a&gt;, stormed into the Terrace of Light and demanded to speak to the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. As the naaru approached him, Voren\u2019thal knelt and uttered the following words: \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\"\nThe defection of Voren'thal and his followers was the largest loss ever incurred by Kael'thas' forces. Nor were these just any blood elves. Many of the strongest and brightest amongst Kael'thas' scholars and magisters had been swayed by Voren'thal's influence. The naaru accepted the defectors, who became known as the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;. Despite years of war and hostilities among the Aldor and the Scryers, they both served the Sha'tar and now lived in the same city. Further attacks against Shattrath continued, but the city did not fall, and the Sha'tar under the command of the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt; led a successful incursion into &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; - Illidan's doorstep. The Aldor and Scryers compete for A'dal's favor so that they may be sent to the front of Xi'ri's campaign. The two factions would even recruit adventurers to aid them in increasing their reputation in the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ra%27vaj\"&gt;Commander Ra'vaj&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Sha'tari Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and has been fighting a war against the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; defends against Shattrath's enemies from the skies. The local chapter in Terokkar fought war campaigns against the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Hills\"&gt;Barrier Hills&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;Arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance utilizes &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; to maintain their presence in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde as well via &lt;a href=\"Stonebreaker%20Hold\"&gt;Stonebreaker Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions are focused on fending off the hostile &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firewing\"&gt;Firewing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and remnants of the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bombing of Cenarion Thicket.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wrekt\"&gt;Wrekt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Tuurem\"&gt;Tuurem&lt;/a&gt; had allied with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Firewing\"&gt;Firewing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;. The Broken &lt;a href=\"Empoor\"&gt;Empoor&lt;/a&gt;, a traveling &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;salesman&lt;/a&gt;, delivered the ingredients for a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to Tuurem, where the blood elf and Broken coalition made a prototype mana bomb device. The nefarious coalition sent a Broken suicide bomber to blow up &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; outpost, to test their mana bomb. Only one &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; in the Cenarion Thicket survived, &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Treelos\"&gt;Warden Treelos&lt;/a&gt;. He went mad, though, and was found talking about tea time and how &lt;a href=\"Naphthal%27ar\"&gt;Naphthal'ar&lt;/a&gt; was \"watching\" him. &lt;a href=\"Earthbinder%20Tavgren\"&gt;Earthbinder Tavgren&lt;/a&gt;, a Cenarion &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; returning from a scouting mission, found the Thicket devastated and with all the druids, but Treelos, dead. Tavgren and an adventurer investigated the massacre of Cenarion Thicket and discovered the Firewing blood elves were making mana bombs and using the inhabitants of Tuurem as a smuggling go-between to do it. The adventurer then assaulted &lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;, rescued &lt;a href=\"Isla%20Starmane\"&gt;Isla Starmane&lt;/a&gt; and detonated a mana bomb there, annihilating the bomb manufacturing site and preventing more mana bombs from being used against friendly strongholds.\nReconnecting in Nagrand.\nBefriending the Mag'har and Kurenai.\nAlliance adventurers who aided &lt;a href=\"Ikuti\"&gt;Ikuti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt; were invited by the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the Kurenai's home village in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde, on the other hand, discover the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s when Horde adventurers discovered a Mag'har axe had slain the fel orc assassin they had been hunting. Since the Horde had been mandated to reconnect with the Mag'har by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde used &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolves&lt;/a&gt; to track the owner of the axe to &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Post\"&gt;Mag'har Post&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;The Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; were excited to hear that the son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; leads non-corrupted orcs beyond the Dark Portal and tells the Horde they would welcome them in their home, &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance and Horde traveled to Nagrand to strengthen relations with their long lost kin but found they were beset by their own problems. For the Mag'har, the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist clan&lt;/a&gt; have pushed them out of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Ruins\"&gt;Burning Blade Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Ruins\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres attacked a Mag'har funeral procession, and the &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20tribe\"&gt;Murkblood tribe&lt;/a&gt; have conquered &lt;a href=\"Sunspring%20Post\"&gt;Sunspring Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; had fallen ill and the Mag'har's leader, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, was too despondent to lead his people's defense.\nThe Kurenai also have problems with the same organizations. Ogres have always been fierce enemies of the Kurenai but the Boulderfist ogres have been more aggressive of late and the Murkblood Broken's machinations not only threaten their ecosystem but also threaten the safety of Telaar. To make matters worse, the Murkblood tribe's attack on Sunspring Post has set back peaceful relations between the Kurenai and the Mag'har.\nAdventurers of the Alliance and the Horde proved their worth to their new allies by waging war on their allies' enemies and rescuing allies who were being held captive. They also discovered the reason for the Boulderfist ogres' increased aggression was due to them being displaced by the Warmaul and being forced to wage war out of a need for more food and resources. The adventurers established a peace treaty with the Boulderfist leader, &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for helping him to pit the Warmauls against the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20clan\"&gt;Kil'sorrow clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAltruis' campaign against the Burning Legion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt;, also recruited adventurers in his assault on and . By using the camps' own &lt;a href=\"fel%20cannon\"&gt;fel cannon&lt;/a&gt;s against the camps, the heroes destroyed the Legion outposts and prevented the Legion from advancing on the region.\nThe Throne of the Elements.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; collaborate with the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; of Outland to bring peace to the restless &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Lo%27ap\"&gt;Elementalist Lo'ap&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%20of%20the%20Water\"&gt;Watoosun of the Water&lt;/a&gt;, instructs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the destructive &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Spirit\"&gt;Lake Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s nearby and aids them with securing &lt;a href=\"Incineratus\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt;' blessing. With the fiery essence of Incineratus himself granted to the adventurers, Lo'ap tasked his agents to set fire to &lt;a href=\"Windyreed%20Village\"&gt;Windyreed Village&lt;/a&gt;, whose inhabitants had agitated the water spirits in their efforts to create a marshland in Nagrand. Meanwhile, Watoosun cleansed the water spirits of their corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. Lo'ap sent adventurers to purge &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%27s%20Polluted%20Essence\"&gt;Watoosun's Polluted Essence&lt;/a&gt; and its offspring, the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Surger\"&gt;Lake Surger&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordawg\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; also directs adventurers to kill tainted &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and destroying the one responsible for their corruption: &lt;a href=\"Gurok%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;Gurok the Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Morgh\"&gt;Elementalist Morgh&lt;/a&gt; also sent adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20Putrifier\"&gt;Murkblood Putrifier&lt;/a&gt;s, who have been using &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism to control air spirits.\nHero of the Mag'har.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; discussed with the Horde hero her wish to restore Garrosh Hellscream's confidence as a leader before she passes away since the Mag'har will need his leadership in the coming winter once she is gone. The Horde adventurer went on to aid the Mag'har in discovering why their ancestral spirits were so agitated lately. The Horde champion traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; and found &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that it was trapped in Oshu'gun and as its energies bled away over the centuries, a &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; slowly grew in their place. That void devoured orc souls into a void vortex which the Burning Legion (via the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20clan\"&gt;Kil'sorrow clan&lt;/a&gt;) has appropriated into drawing void minions and conscripting them into their army.\nK'ure directed the Horde hero to speak to &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; in Shattrath City, who knew how to end the cycle and free the orc spirits. A'dal instructed the Horde adventurer to slay &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Crypts\"&gt;Auchenai Crypts&lt;/a&gt; in order to free the captive spirit of &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the naaru ending its void state and is about to be reborn of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Once D'ore has completely regenerated, D'ore explained that the void-light cycle of a naaru is inevitable. The only way to free the darkened &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Orc%20Ancestor\"&gt;ancient orc spirits&lt;/a&gt; is to summon them using a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Mirror%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Soul Mirror (quest item)&lt;/a&gt; and destroy them before they transform into void creatures. After restoring the serenity of the orcs' ancient ancestors, the Horde adventurers reported their success to Greatmother Geyah, who wanted the champion to personally deliver the news of their victories to Garrosh in order to inspire hope in him.\nDue to the Horde adventurer's efforts in aiding the Mag'har where he could not, Garrosh Hellscream doubts himself and suggests that the Horde hero should lead instead of him. Disheartened that the hero's actions have not uplifted Garrosh's spirit, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; nevertheless thanked the adventurer for their efforts and ended up remarking that the adventurer reminded her of her &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, led the stunned adventurer to reveal that her &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;grandson&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Geyah, in her frail state, asked the Horde adventurer to send word to Thrall of her existence so their family could reunite.\nAfter informing Thrall of the situation, he arrived to visit his grandmother. During this time, he showed Garrosh &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;his father's&lt;/a&gt; last battle against &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; causing him to become confident in himself and escape his doubt.\nThe battle for Halaa.\nThe Alliance and Horde also fought over &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; in order to research &lt;a href=\"%3AOshu%27gun%20Crystal%20Powder\"&gt;:Oshu'gun Crystal Powder&lt;/a&gt;, but also to prevent their enemies from using the site and its research to threaten their local base in the region.\nThe Consortium's business ventures.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aeris%20Landing\"&gt;Aeris Landing&lt;/a&gt; also sought the crystal fragments of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; but were ordered by &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt; to hold off on the operation so as not to offend the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the outpost's leader, &lt;a href=\"Gezhe\"&gt;Gezhe&lt;/a&gt;, plans to gain the &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun%20Crystal%20Fragment\"&gt;Oshu'gun Crystal Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s by hiring adventurers to steal them from the criminal &lt;a href=\"Vir%27aani\"&gt;Vir'aani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, who have already begun despoiling Oshu'gun. The Consortium has also been employing adventurers to collect the ivory tusks of the local &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warbeads\"&gt;Obsidian Warbeads&lt;/a&gt; of the ogres; slay the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Voidspawn\"&gt;Voidspawn&lt;/a&gt;; and also assassinate the rogue ethereal &lt;a href=\"Gava%27xi\"&gt;Gava'xi&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlade's Edge Mountains.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde has pushed out the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; ogres to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thunderlord Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance use their magic to grow the town of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanaar\"&gt;Sylvanaar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Living%20Grove\"&gt;Living Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Both bases are wary of each other, and the Horde would send their agents to cull the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Fey%20Drake\"&gt;Fey Drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;Ancient of War&lt;/a&gt; in order to diminish their strength in the region, while the Alliance retaliates by slaying the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Dire%20wolf\"&gt;dire wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberation of the ogre clans.\nDespite the rivalries of the Horde and Alliance, the Bladespire, &lt;a href=\"Boulder%27mok\"&gt;Boulder'mok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20clan\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres posed a more dire threat to their settlements. The Alliance and Horde would send their adventurers to cull their numbers in order to safeguard their bases. The Bloodmaul and Bladespire ogres are also fierce enemies of each other, and the Bloodmaul clan was in danger of being crushed by the Bladespire ogres, and &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;'s sons who back them. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Vuuleen\"&gt;Vindicator Vuuleen&lt;/a&gt; would conspire with Alliance adventurers to plot the death of &lt;a href=\"Gorr%27Dim\"&gt;Gorr'Dim&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and provoke Bloodmaul ogres to attack the Bladespire clan's holdings. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Haephus%20Stonewall\"&gt;Commander Haephus Stonewall&lt;/a&gt; would also send out Alliance agents to slay the Bloodmaul leader &lt;a href=\"Dorgok\"&gt;Dorgok&lt;/a&gt; after receiving reports of an impending Bloodmaul attack on Sylvanaar and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ruuan%20Weald\"&gt;Ruuan Weald&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"T%27chali%20the%20Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;T'chali the Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; would enlist Horde adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Grimnok%20Battleborn\"&gt;Grimnok Battleborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korgaah\"&gt;Korgaah&lt;/a&gt; and curse the Bloodmaul and Bladespire's buildings in order to avenge his death.\nAfter recovering the fallen &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;'s artifacts from the Bladespire ogres, the ancestors of the Thunderlord clan gave the Horde their blessing to inherit Thunderlord Stronghold. Once the artifacts have been returned, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Garm%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Garm Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; advised Horde adventurers to aid &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; in his quest for it is tied to the future safety of the Horde. When Horde adventurers find Rexxar, they discover he is searching for his people the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt;, and relayed Garm Wolfbrother's information about the location of &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt; to him. Rexxar asks the Horde adventurer to speak to his estranged father &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt; on his behalf but Leoroxx has denounced his son since he left &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to follow the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; many years ago. Despite Leoroxx's rejection of him, Rexxar is determined to prove to Leoroxx he is still Mok'Nathal and his son, whether he cares to admit it or not.\nRexxar believes stopping the Bloodmaul ogres from harassing the Mok'Nathal would prove to his father he is worthy. Rexxar sent the Horde adventurer and his hawk &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28hawk%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the Bloodmaul ogres and discovered that the Bloodmaul's hostilities were under the orders of the Sons of Gruul.&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Haephus%20Stonewall\"&gt;Commander Haephus Stonewall&lt;/a&gt; also came to the same conclusion after &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%27s%20Favor\"&gt;Gorgrom's Favor&lt;/a&gt; was found on &lt;a href=\"Dorgok\"&gt;Dorgok&lt;/a&gt;'s person.\nRexxar and Commander Stonewall both send their adventurers to bargain for &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sablemane\"&gt;Baron Sablemane&lt;/a&gt;'s help. Sablemane agreed to help them in exchange for a favor. Sablemane helps craft for Rexxar a &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sablemane%27s%20Poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; which Rexxar used to poison the Bloodmaul ogres of &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20Camp\"&gt;Bloodmaul Camp&lt;/a&gt; while for Alliance adventurers he crafts a &lt;a href=\"Sablemane%27s%20Sleeping%20Powder\"&gt;sleeping powder&lt;/a&gt; which will aid them in the task he has in mind for them. The favor Sablemane demanded of the adventurers was to steal for him &lt;a href=\"Grulloc%27s%20Sack\"&gt;Grulloc's Sack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Grulloc\"&gt;Grulloc&lt;/a&gt;'s home in &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Hollow\"&gt;Cursed Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. With the bargain fulfilled, Sablemane grants the adventurers a &lt;a href=\"Dragonfire%20Trap\"&gt;Dragonfire Trap&lt;/a&gt; which they used to kill &lt;a href=\"Gorgrom%20the%20Dragon-Eater\"&gt;Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater&lt;/a&gt;.\nRexxar and Horde adventurers eventually went to rescue his captured &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leokk\"&gt;Leokk&lt;/a&gt; from the Bladespire ogres outside of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Gruul's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Baron Sablemane has recruited Alliance adventurers in his quest for revenge against the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;. Sablemane and the Alliance assault the Bladespire's toughest warriors, including &lt;a href=\"Fingrom\"&gt;Fingrom&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the adventurers (with Rexxar or Sablemane) have a final showdown with &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;, the master of the Bladespire ogres, at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Circle of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. With Goc slain, Sablemane has satisfied his thirst to avenge the deaths of his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; children, while Rexxar had safeguarded the Mok'Nathal but will continue to adventure in order to become a stronger and worthier Mok'Nathal in his father's eyes.\nNot all ogres in the Blade's Edge Mountains are hostile, however. &lt;a href=\"Mog%27dorg%20the%20Wizened\"&gt;Mog'dorg the Wizened&lt;/a&gt; leads the ogres of &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; in saving the Bloodmaul clan from annihilation and liberating all of ogre-kind from the tyranny of Gruul. Mog'dorg recruited adventurers to assassinate the remaining sons of Gruul. With the sons of Gruul vanquished, their hold over the ogres of Blade's Edge Mountains is broken. The adventurer who liberated the ogres from such tyranny is hailed as their new king/queen. Free of their bondage, Mog'dorg begins to reunify the ogre clans. In the meanwhile, the adventurers were sent to the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; where the enlightened ogres work to defend the mountains from its other threats. The most trusted allies of Ogri'la would be entrusted with &lt;a href=\"Banishing%20Crystal\"&gt;Banishing Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s which would stop demons from resurrecting. With the banishing crystals, adventurers would be sent to clear out the demons of and . The ogres of Ogri'la were also allied with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Skyguard%20Outpost\"&gt;Skyguard Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and they performed bombing runs on the two Burning Legion camps as well for the mutual protection of their coalition.\nFall of the Razaani.\nWhile Horde adventurers proved their worth to the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt; by aiding them in gathering supplies and hunting their most fearsome foes, Alliance adventurers were tasked by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Skyshadow\"&gt;Commander Skyshadow&lt;/a&gt; to investigate what became of the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; expedition that was cast out of Sylvanaar. The Alliance champions soon discovered that the gnomes have established &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt;, and aided the various gnome scientists in conducting their experiments and testing their inventions. The Alliance and Horde also helped their allies safeguard their respective settlements. When the Mok'Nathal and the gnomes discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Razaani\"&gt;Razaani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ethereal\"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Razaan%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Razaan's Landing&lt;/a&gt; were using the souls of their people to power their ethereal technology, they sent their adventurers to retaliate against the ethereals and slay their leader &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Razaan\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Razaan&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers then retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Collection%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Collection of Souls&lt;/a&gt; from Razaan's corpse and freed the captive souls.\nThe wrath of nature.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; had set up the outpost of the &lt;a href=\"Evergrove\"&gt;Evergrove&lt;/a&gt; to heal the &lt;a href=\"Ruuan%20Weald\"&gt;Ruuan Weald&lt;/a&gt; and the other pockets of nature in the mountains from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. &lt;a href=\"Faradrella\"&gt;Faradrella&lt;/a&gt; recruited adventurers to slay the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Corrupter\"&gt;Fel Corrupter&lt;/a&gt;s and the tainted &lt;a href=\"Felsworn\"&gt;Felsworn&lt;/a&gt; creatures spreading the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; corruption in the forest. After recovering and repairing a &lt;a href=\"Felsworn%20Gas%20Mask\"&gt;Felsworn Gas Mask&lt;/a&gt; taken from a fallen Fel Corrupter, &lt;a href=\"Wildlord%20Antelarion\"&gt;Wildlord Antelarion&lt;/a&gt; used the mask to disguise his agent so that they can infiltrate . After which the adventurer manipulated a demon lord into thinking the Legion camp was undergoing a revolt by using the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Communicator\"&gt;Legion Communicator&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged that the camp was undermining the demon lord's authority, the demon lord authorized the disguised adventurer to slay the camp's engineers and attendants and was guided to summon and slay &lt;a href=\"Doomcryer\"&gt;Doomcryer&lt;/a&gt;, who the demon lord suspected of orchestrating the fake revolt. The Cenarion Expedition pressed their advantage by using the Legion's &lt;a href=\"fel%20cannon\"&gt;fel cannon&lt;/a&gt;s to fire nature imbued cannonballs at &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Door\"&gt;Death's Door&lt;/a&gt;'s two warp-gates. Lastly they slew &lt;a href=\"Baelmon%20the%20Hound-Master\"&gt;Baelmon the Hound-Master&lt;/a&gt; whose rituals kept Death's Door's portal functioning.\n&lt;a href=\"Mosswood%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Mosswood the Ancient&lt;/a&gt; also employed adventurers to purge his home, &lt;a href=\"Skald\"&gt;Skald&lt;/a&gt;, of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s who burned down the woods and replant &lt;a href=\"Ironroot%20Seeds\"&gt;Ironroot Seeds&lt;/a&gt; so that nature can flourish there once again. After discovering the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;Arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grishnath\"&gt;Grishnath&lt;/a&gt; have been possessing the &lt;a href=\"Raven%27s%20Wood%20Leafbeard\"&gt;Raven's Wood Leafbeard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Raven%27s%20Wood%20Stonebark\"&gt;stonebark&lt;/a&gt;s with evil &lt;a href=\"Koi-Koi%20Spirit\"&gt;Koi-Koi Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, adventurers aided &lt;a href=\"Treebole\"&gt;Treebole&lt;/a&gt; in exorcising the possessed &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20ancient\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; and protectors of &lt;a href=\"Raven%27s%20Wood\"&gt;Raven's Wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cenarion Expedition has also been having altercations with the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmcult\"&gt;Wyrmcult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Coven\"&gt;Blackwing Coven&lt;/a&gt; who have been despoiling the wildlife and woods of the &lt;a href=\"Ruuan%20Weald\"&gt;Ruuan Weald&lt;/a&gt;. The Cenarion Expedition tried to negotiate a peaceful resolution but the wyrmcultists rebuffed them. &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Warden%20Chawn\"&gt;Tree Warden Chawn&lt;/a&gt; in response sent adventurers to slay the Wyrmcult's &lt;a href=\"Wyrmcult%20Hewer\"&gt;hewer&lt;/a&gt;s. After recovering a &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Note\"&gt;Meeting Note&lt;/a&gt; from one of the fallen hewers, Chawn sent adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmskull%20Tunnel\"&gt;Wyrmskull Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; to bolster the expedition's defenses led by &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Moonshade\"&gt;Watcher Moonshade&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers reported that the wyrmcultists were amassing in the tunnel for an impending attack on the expedition. Moonshade tasked the adventurers to slay the Wyrmcult leader &lt;a href=\"Draaca%20Longtail\"&gt;Draaca Longtail&lt;/a&gt; in order to sow in-fighting among the enemy and hamper their efforts to organize an attack. The adventurer then donned an &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Nuaar\"&gt;Overseer Nuaar&lt;/a&gt; disguise and attended a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Kolphis%20Darkscale\"&gt;Kolphis Darkscale&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed that the wyrmcultists are mounting an all-out attack on the Cenarion Expedition under the orders of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Maxnar%20the%20Ashmaw\"&gt;Maxnar the Ashmaw&lt;/a&gt;. After reporting the news to Tree Warden Chawn, Chawn orders the assassination of the &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; Maxnar to end the Wyrmcult's machinations for good.\nNetherstorm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; destroyed &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and transformed it into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Farahlon was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; constantly ate away at the Netherstorm's borders, and its chaotic magics slowly bled into Outland. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; reached Netherstorm, they captured &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and used its machinery to harness the storm's magic, further compromising the already unstable land. They dismantled parts of Tempest Keep and strategically built five tremendous &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s across the Netherstorm, siphoning mana from the Twisting Nether itself and storing it in &lt;a href=\"Mana%23Manaforges\"&gt;mana cells&lt;/a&gt; for the elves to feed on. Over time, the manaforges weakened the fabric of reality in the Netherstorm, attracting the attention of the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s, who arrived on Outland to ply their trade or pursue their war against the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Kael'thas sent his Sunfury to attack the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the battle ended with the blood elves blowing up the village with a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;. The only survivors were &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;, who Kael'thas cursed to be imprisoned in his &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Tower\"&gt;Violet Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the invasion of Outland, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"B.O.O.M.\"&gt;B.O.O.M.&lt;/a&gt; established &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; in order to finish construction of their &lt;a href=\"X-52%20Nether-Rocket\"&gt;X-52 Nether-Rocket&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; were also sent by &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Kael'thas' activities and have made camp in Area 52.\nCourting the Consortium.\nAfter discovering the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; had a falling out with their &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; trading partners, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; sought to capitalize on their enmity and sway the Consortium to their side. An Aldor/Scryer representative was sent to aid &lt;a href=\"Nether-Stalker%20Khay%27ji\"&gt;Nether-Stalker Khay'ji&lt;/a&gt;, the Consortium representative in &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt;, by: aiding Khay'ji recover an &lt;a href=\"Arklon%20Crystal%20Artifact\"&gt;Arklon Crystal Artifact&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pentatharon\"&gt;Pentatharon&lt;/a&gt;, cull the rogue &lt;a href=\"Zaxxis\"&gt;Zaxxis&lt;/a&gt; organization, and eliminate &lt;a href=\"Warp-Raider%20Nesaad\"&gt;Warp-Raider Nesaad&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the Sunfury has reneged on another purchase of Consortium goods and the representative aided the Consortium recover their stolen &lt;a href=\"Box%20of%20Surveying%20Equipment\"&gt;boxes of surveying equipment&lt;/a&gt; from the blood elves of &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Duro\"&gt;Manaforge Duro&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the adventurer delivered the surveying equipment to an &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt; himself who welcomed the representative to &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt; revealed to the adventurer that he was searching for the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20Crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%27s%20Song\"&gt;Spirit's Song&lt;/a&gt;, since he has heard rumors that it grants god-like powers to its bearer. However, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was also searching for it. Haramad recruited the adventurer to use his &lt;a href=\"Triangulation%20Device\"&gt;Triangulation Device&lt;/a&gt; to triangulate the location of the crystal and report the results to his agents: &lt;a href=\"Dealer%20Hazzin\"&gt;Dealer Hazzin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Trader%20Tuluman\"&gt;Wind Trader Tuluman&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the data revealed the Ata'mal Crystal was on the move and was already uncovered by the Burning Legion. The adventurer hunted down the rogue dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Culuthas\"&gt;Culuthas&lt;/a&gt;, who has broken away from &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;'s command to claim the Ata'mal Crystal for himself. Apparently, upon obtaining the crystal, Culuthas believed himself above the rule of the Burning Legion and killed the demon forces in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Farahlon\"&gt;Ruins of Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with his own minions \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Hound%20of%20Culuthas\"&gt;Hounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Culuthas\"&gt;Eyes&lt;/a&gt; of Culuthas. While agents of the Consortium purged the minions of Culuthas, an adventurer slew Culuthas, reclaimed Spirit's Song, and subsequently returned it to Nexus-Prince Haramad's image. Haramad was so inspired by the adventurer's selflessness, that he personally came to the adventurer's defense when Kael'thas' ambassador \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Solannas\"&gt;Ambassador Solannas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and his two honor guards attacked the adventurer to claim the Ata'mal Crystal. Inspired by the adventurer's nobility, Nexus-Prince Haramad decided to give Spirit's Song to the Sha'tar once Solannas and his guards were dealt with.\nManaforge shutdown.\nWhile the Aldor sent their agents to assault &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20B%27naar\"&gt;Manaforge B'naar&lt;/a&gt;, culling and distracting their Sunfury forces, the Scryers sent their agents to take the &lt;a href=\"B%27naar%20Personnel%20Roster\"&gt;B'naar Personnel Roster&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Arathyn\"&gt;Captain Arathyn&lt;/a&gt;. The Scryers then shut down Manaforge B'naar's operations by slaying the specialists maintaining the manaforge, while the Aldor infiltrated B'naar to transcribe the Sunfury's passwords and security codes for the naaru-made technology found in the Tempest Keep and the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldor and Scryers then used the &lt;a href=\"B%27naar%20Access%20Crystal\"&gt;B'naar Access Crystal&lt;/a&gt; they obtained from &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Theredis\"&gt;Overseer Theredis&lt;/a&gt; to elicit an emergency shutdown of Manaforge B'naar and permanently disable the manaforge's technology.\nScryer agents disguised themselves as Sunfury personnel and infiltrated a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Dawnforge\"&gt;Commander Dawnforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Ardonis\"&gt;Arcanist Ardonis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pathaleon%20the%20Calculator%27s%20Image\"&gt;Pathaleon the Calculator's Image&lt;/a&gt;. From the meeting, the Scryers discovered that &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ultris\"&gt;Manaforge Ultris&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by power overload, &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Duro\"&gt;Manaforge Duro&lt;/a&gt; was under assault by &lt;a href=\"Mana%20wyrm\"&gt;mana creatures&lt;/a&gt;, and the Sunfury were recalling their forces to reinforce Duro. With the Sunfury forces diverted to the other manaforges, the Aldor and Scryers assaulted &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Coruu\"&gt;Manaforge Coruu&lt;/a&gt;, and used the &lt;a href=\"Coruu%20Access%20Crystal\"&gt;Coruu Access Crystal&lt;/a&gt; to shut it down. After the assault on Coruu, the Aldor decided to infiltrate Manaforge Duro and retrieve Sunfury briefings. Afterwards, the Aldor and the Scryers shutdown Manaforge Duro as well.\nFollowing up on a lead from the Sunfury briefings, the Aldor affiliates met up with Aldor agent &lt;a href=\"Kaylaan\"&gt;Kaylaan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tuluman%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Tuluman's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldor found &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; demons aiding the Sunfury in running &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ara\"&gt;Manaforge Ara&lt;/a&gt;, proving Kael'thas was serving the Burning Legion. The Aldor dispatched the demons at Ara, but Kaylaan became disillusioned with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership and resented their collaboration with the Scryers; thus leading Kaylaan to ultimately abandon the Aldor. The Consortium at Tuluman's Landing also undermined the Sunfury presence by hiring mercenaries to dispatch the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Nethermancer\"&gt;Sunfury Nethermancer&lt;/a&gt;s and wresting control of &lt;a href=\"Trelleum%20Mine\"&gt;Trelleum Mine&lt;/a&gt; from them. Meanwhile, the Scryers were busy eliminating the Sunfury stragglers at Manaforge Duro. Eventually, the Scryers met with &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Theledorn\"&gt;Magister Theledorn&lt;/a&gt;, a Sunfury magister wishing to defect to the Scryers in exchange for information. Theledorn told the Scryer agents the demons at Manaforge Ara hold &lt;a href=\"Orders%20From%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;damning evidence&lt;/a&gt; proving Kael'thas' alliance with the Burning Legion which the Scryers could use to gain a considerable political advantage. As suggested, the Scryers then obtained Kael'thas' orders from the demons which &lt;a href=\"Spymaster%20Thalodien\"&gt;Spymaster Thalodien&lt;/a&gt; planned to relay to &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt;. After uncovering the alliance between Kael'thas and the Legion, the Aldor and Scryers finished their assault by shutting down Manaforge Ara.\nDeathblow to the Legion.\nWith the manaforges shut down, the Aldor and Scryers focused their efforts on taking down the Burning Legion commander, &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;. Socrethar is found in an island called &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%27s%20Seat\"&gt;Socrethar's Seat&lt;/a&gt;, which is only accessible by his most trusted lieutenants via teleportation. The Aldor and Scryers raided and in order to obtain the two halves of a teleportation stone from &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Morug\"&gt;Forgemaster Morug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silroth\"&gt;Silroth&lt;/a&gt;. After reassembling the teleportation stone, the Aldor or Scryers met up at where they teleported to Socrethar's Seat and prepared themselves for the final battle with Socrethar. For the Aldors, however, they were met by &lt;a href=\"Kaylaan%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Kaylaan the Lost&lt;/a&gt;, whose hatred for the Scryers had allowed Socrethar to sway him to his side and go against the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldor were forced to fend off their former brother in arms but during the middle of the battle, &lt;a href=\"Ishanah\"&gt;Ishanah&lt;/a&gt; arrived and offers herself as Socrethar's prisoner in exchange for releasing Kaylaan from demonic corruption. Socrethar refused to bargain and slew Ishanah, which persuaded Kaylaan to abandon his vengeance and use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to bring Ishanah back to life. Enraged by Kaylaan's redemption, Socrethar murdered Kaylaan and resolved to kill the heroes himself.\nUltimately, a great battle erupted between the Aldor/Scryer forces and Socrethar which led to the death of Socrethar.\nAssault on Tempest Keep.\nThanks to &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt;'s intelligence, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; learned there were two shards of a key that when combined, will unlock access to &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; satellite. One half was held by the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Splinter\"&gt;Warp Splinter&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Botanica\"&gt;Botanica&lt;/a&gt;, and the other held by &lt;a href=\"Pathaleon%20the%20Calculator\"&gt;Pathaleon the Calculator&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; subsequently fought over the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; since its rich energy deposits and close proximity to &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; made it a valuable staging ground against Kael'thas' stronghold. Eventually, the adventurers breached Tempest Keep's Botanica and Mechanar. Under the telepathic guidance of A'dal, the adventurers eliminated high-profile targets in Tempest Keep that posed a threat to Outland. In the Botanica, A'dal ordered: the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Sarannis\"&gt;Commander Sarannis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Botanist%20Freywinn\"&gt;High Botanist Freywinn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thorngrin%20the%20Tender\"&gt;Thorngrin the Tender&lt;/a&gt;; the culling of the Botanica's twisted specimens and also the acquisition of a frond sample from &lt;a href=\"Laj\"&gt;Laj&lt;/a&gt; for the Sha'tar to study; and lastly to put down the impure &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Splinter\"&gt;Warp Splinter&lt;/a&gt; and obtain its half of the key. In the Mechanar, A'dal tasked the adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Mechano-Lord%20Capacitus\"&gt;Mechano-Lord Capacitus&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently &lt;a href=\"Pathaleon%20the%20Calculator\"&gt;Pathaleon the Calculator&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in order to obtain the remaining half of the Arcatraz key. Lastly, A'dal has ordered the adventurers to recover the naaru artifact, &lt;a href=\"Blinding%20Fury\"&gt;Blinding Fury&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Cache%20of%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Cache of the Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the adventurers recovered the two halves of the Arcatraz key and returned it to A'dal who combined them to form the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Arcatraz\"&gt;Key to the Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers used the Arcatraz key to grant them entrance into the prison satellite but found the prisoners of Arcatraz were undergoing a revolt when they arrived. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; servant, &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Skyriss\"&gt;Harbinger Skyriss&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Mellichar\"&gt;Warden Mellichar&lt;/a&gt; and made him release many of the prisoners. With the prisoners running amok, the heroes of Azeroth raided &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the escape of its dangerous fugitives. A'dal tasked Alliance adventurers to slay the &lt;a href=\"Void%20lord\"&gt;Void lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zereketh%20the%20Unbound\"&gt;Zereketh the Unbound&lt;/a&gt; and the two powerful agents rallying the demons of the Burning Legion, &lt;a href=\"Wrath-Scryer%20Soccothrates\"&gt;Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalliah%20the%20Doomsayer\"&gt;Dalliah the Doomsayer&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, A'dal ordered the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Skyriss\"&gt;Harbinger Skyriss&lt;/a&gt;: the mastermind behind the prison breakout.\nWhen the elemental spirits of Outland revealed that Kael'thas had learned &lt;a href=\"The%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;The Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; spell, the Sha'tar knew that Kael had to be stopped before he used the cipher to collapse Outland. The heroes who completed A'dal's four trials proved themselves worthy of receiving the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tempest%20Key\"&gt;The Tempest Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Tempest Key opened up the entrance to Kael'thas' lair, the army of adventurers stormed the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the heroes breached the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Bridge\"&gt;Tempest Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and faced off against &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elf lieutenants. Ultimately, the heroes of Azeroth slew Kael's lieutenants and severely wounded Kael'thas himself. The adventurers left Kael for dead and presented Kael'thas' &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;Verdant Sphere&lt;/a&gt; to A'dal so that it may unlock the sphere's secrets. As A'dal publicly venerated the champions responsible for Kael'thas' defeat and sang &lt;a href=\"A%27dal%27s%20Song%20of%20Battle\"&gt;A'dal's Song of Battle&lt;/a&gt;, the sphere received an ominous message from Kael'thas \u2014 who was revealed to be still alive. Kael'thas mocked the adventurers for failing to kill him and maniacally threatened that they will all meet their doom during the impending return of his master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe conflict with Illidan.\nWith the Legion threat diffused, the Alliance-Horde entente became less of a united, cohesive force. Both factions, however, turned to the threat of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was the hegemonous power in Outland, ruling from his seat at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis conflict was not conducted as an organized war effort, but rather as a series of smaller-scale conflicts across Outland, against fel orcs, blood elves, demons and naga loyal to Illidan. Only the forces of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; offered any form of organized attack; &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; general under the command of &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; offered to push back Illidan's troops at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; with a joint &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; force.This provided an elaborate distraction for the liberated &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's tireless jailer and &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's once-ally, to enter the Temple.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt;s, proceeded to bring down the high command of Illidan's vast empire, and even Illidan himself, from the inside.\nThe Gods of Zul'Aman.\nSeething with hatred against his ancient enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and spiteful towards his former allies among the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, who chose to ally themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; rallied an army of &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls and sealed power from the Amani animal gods within the strongest of his warriors in pursuit for revenge. As Zul'jin amassed his army in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Nedreck\"&gt;Budd Nedreck&lt;/a&gt; and his disposable crew of treasure hunters attempted to infiltrate Zul'Aman and pillage its riches.\nHowever, the vanguard of Budd's crew never returned and with them lost, so was Budd's map. Budd hired &lt;a href=\"Griftah\"&gt;Griftah&lt;/a&gt; to recruit more adventurers for him so they can do all the dirty work, and in exchange, Budd promised them vast amounts of treasure. Despite the troll disguises given to his original scouts, the scouts Budd sent out to map Zul'Aman were massacred by High Priest &lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt; and the other Amani warriors. Budd sent his new adventurers to slay Nalorakk and recover his map. Afterwards, he sent the adventurers to explore the chambers of &lt;a href=\"Halazzi\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%27alai\"&gt;Jan'alai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon\"&gt;Akil'zon&lt;/a&gt;, which subsequently forced the adventurers to vanquish those Amani warriors as well. Lastly, Budd tasked the adventurers to vanquish &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt;. After accomplishing the task, however, Budd fired his adventurers; presumably to keep all the glory to himself.\nUndeterred, the adventurers pressed on and faced off against Zul'jin. Ultimately, Zul'jin was slain by treasure-seeking adventurers and his army was scattered. The adventurers proudly presented the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Zul%27jin\"&gt;Blood of Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; to Budd as a trophy of their accomplishment. Budd however, belittled the heroes' feat and threw the vial into a burning building; all while taking credit for defeating Zul'jin. Budd's arrogance seemed to have offended the troll gods however, as some mystical force pulled him into the burning building where he was set on fire. Panicked, Budd ran off in flames while trying to appease the troll spirits by blaming the adventurers and proclaiming his love for &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Donna%20Brascoe\"&gt;Donna Brascoe&lt;/a&gt;, a spy of the &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;Shattrath City Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s that infiltrated Budd's gang, ultimately rewarded the adventurers for stopping Zul'jin.\nThe Battle for Quel'Danas.\nThe final stage of the conflict on Outland would transpire outside of Draenor itself, on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, once Illidan's most trusted advisor, had aligned himself and those of his still loyal subjects with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter extracting enormous amounts of arcane energy from &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; via hijacked naaru-technology, Kael'thas was confronted and seemingly defeated at &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The Prince, however, managed to survive, albeit as a &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched mana-hungry fiend&lt;/a&gt;. Using the great amount of energy taken from Outland and the captured naaru, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas triumphantly restored the shattered &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; for the most abominable purpose: the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth.\nA united effort of the Aldor, Scryers and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; order formed the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, which successfully repelled the Burning Legion from &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. With the Legion driven back from the Isle, the proud defenders of Azeroth invaded the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; and at long last killed the &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Sun King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese brave adventurers then turned their attention to stopping Kil'jaeden's summoning into Azeroth. Within the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; was in the process of being completely summoned and only with the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; and the support from the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was he banished from Azeroth.\nRestoration of the Sunwell.\nUsing the spark of the fallen &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei leader &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reignited the Sunwell, explaining:\nThis strongly indicates that the Sunwell has indeed been restored using the energies of M'uru, returning the blood elves' \"fount of power\". The Sunwell's new energies are possibly derived from M'uru's powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; rather than arcane magic.\nFurthermore, with Illidan dead, the Elder Sage &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; swears to fill the halls of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; once again.\nAftermath.\nThe aftermath of the invasion, due to the conflicts primarily staying on Outland, left the politics of Azeroth for the most part unchanged. However, shortly after of this events, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed his throne as King of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; found and appointed the son of his close friend &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; as his advisor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, while on Outland discovered and researched the eggs of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;Netherwing dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, prized tools in Illidan's war machine. At the start of the war, she took some of the eggs back to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; where she cured her flight's patriarch, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, of his insanity. In turn, Malygos would &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;declare war on all magic users&lt;/a&gt; for their rampant misuse of magic over his long exile.\nAnd the battle for Quel'Danas, while primarily an organized battle against the Burning Legion, saw the first organized movement of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces since &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; appeared over the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; subconsciously sent the Scourge there himself to halt the Legion's advance, or an unseen necrolord believing he was doing his what was best for his master is unknown. However, soon after the crisis, the Lich King himself awoke from his long dream and attacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;declared war on the living&lt;/a&gt;, intending to wipe out all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The emissary ordered Valonforth to withdraw the army back home. Captain Luc Valonforth answered to &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; rather than Arthas, and prepared the army for its journey back to Lordaeron. However, Arthas sunk the ships that could return them home, and blamed it on his mercenaries. Valonforth had the mercenaries killed, and looked on as Arthas declared that they would finish what they started here or fall.\nWhen the final battle came, Valonforth fought alongside his Prince and achieved victory.\nHis fate afterwards is unknown.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nLuc Valonforth appears in the flashback quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth%20Shall%20Set%20Us%20Free\"&gt;The Truth Shall Set Us Free&lt;/a&gt;, where he re-enacts the scene involving the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Emissary\"&gt;Alliance Emissary&lt;/a&gt; who ordered the troops of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt; to be recalled to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the rest of the Forgotten, he does not turn into a ghost at the end of the quest - he just vanishes like &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and Arthas, suggesting he did not die there.\nCharacter division.\nIn \"\", most of the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Appearances\"&gt;captain's&lt;/a&gt; lines from \"&lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Reign of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\" were attributed to , but an unnamed captain spoke with the . In a \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, that captain was named Luc Valonforth. , a galley winner, noticed that people might confuse Falric and Valonforth, and pointed out the issue to Medievaldragon of &lt;a href=\"BlizzPlanet\"&gt;BlizzPlanet&lt;/a&gt;. Medievaldragon contacted &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that since she finished writing the book before the release of \"Wrath of the Lich King\", she had not known about the flashback quest involving Valonforth. Medievaldragon contacted the editors and informed them of the possible inconsistency. The editors agreed to include Valonforth in the book to ensure the clear difference between his character and that of Falric, though there is still an unnamed ship's captain in one scene that may or may not be Luc. Thus it was confirmed that the captain from \"Reign of Chaos\" was divided into separate characters, though Falric retains the most lines and appearances and is the only one playable in-game."}

He rides up to Thrall, talks to him, and then starts attacking.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Fiercely loyal to &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Captain Skarloc rose through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt; alongside his friend &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. When Aliden decided to take up operations in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Skarloc stayed with his Lord and mentor. He became Aedelas's most trusted comrade and advisor, earning the title Blackmoore's Spear.\"\nStrategy.\nSkarloc comes with two adds: a Warden (healer) and a Veteran (rogue). These are mobs you have already killed around the Keep, and should be familiar. While tanking Skarloc, kill the healer as soon as possible, preferably stunning every heal he tries to do. After that, take on the warrior, and finish Skarloc after that. Skarloc doesn't hit extremely hard - but he can take a lot of hits, so Counterspell him where possible. He is immune to Curse of Tongues, but the other two can be feared out of the fight. \nFear works particularly well in this fight. There is ample room to fear kite one or both of Skarloc's adds, and the only enemies in range to aggro are mid 20's beasts that are native to the area. A single warlock can easily down Skarloc's healer and keep it from doing anything besides running for the entire fight. Then the warlock can dispense with the warrior add, all the while leaving the other four to focus directly on Skarloc.\n\"Note to above\": Your tank should easily be able to pick up Skarloc and the veteran, usually the one on the left (facing him). If the rest of the group focuses on the Warden, you should be able to down him within a matter of seconds, move to the next add, then down Skarloc.\nAlternative Strategy: Skarloc has a fairly limited range on his heals. If a class is able to OT temporarily (rogue evasion/Cloak of shadows, hunter &amp; warlock pets etc.), pull his adds outside this healing range. By doing this you are able to either kill or CC them both without Skarloc healing or decursing them. Healers should stand between the MT and the DPS group. Once both adds are dealt with, DPS should be able to go all out on Skarloc as the tank would have generated enough threat to hold him.\nHeroic Mode.\nThe tank has to move out of Consecration all the time. Hammer of Justice will make this difficult. In addition, the adds' damage, and Warden's &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt;, are much more dangerous."}

After the events in the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Bilgewater joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and built a new capital in the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;ian region of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. They compete with other goblin organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; over both resources and customers.\nIn the game, the Bilgewater Cartel is a Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; related to the playable &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Bilgewater goblins&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in \"\". It is thus the sixth racial Horde-faction to be added to the game. They have their own quartermaster, rewards, and tabard which in dungeons will boost reputation for every kill.\nHistory.\nOriginally the slaves of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;Isle of Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin race was forced to mine &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; ore out of the volcanic bowels of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s used this potent mineral for their voodoo rituals, but it had an unexpected effect on the slaves who were in constant contact with it: kaja'mite generated a startling new cunning and intelligence in the goblins. Crafting their own powerful artifacts of engineering and alchemy in secret, the goblins soon overthrew their oppressors and claimed Kezan for their homeland. The mines that had been their prison, their slave camp, and the base of their rebellion now became the city of &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;. Weaving through the heart of the island in a dizzying network of tunnels, vaults, and lava tubes, Undermine epitomizes the goblins' complex, unpredictable mindset.\nThe goblins' natural greed soon lifted them to prominence as masters of mercantilism. &lt;a href=\"Trade%20prince\"&gt;Trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s arose during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; as the cleverest goblins learned to take advantage of the strife. Great fortunes were amassed, and the Isle of Kezan became a hub for fleets of goblin trading ships. One of the trade princes agreed to lend his faction's services to the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Horde's defeat, the goblins learned from their colleague's failed example, and soon they realized that their profits could double if they weren't stuck in such a restrictive relationship. By the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, goblins were providing weaponry, vehicles, and devious services to both the Horde and the Alliance.\nGallywix's takeover.\nMany years later, &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; rose through the ranks of the Bilgewater Cartel. Gallywix became the president of what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Street%20Conglomerate\"&gt;Copper Street Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;, an advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Union\"&gt;Tinkers' Union&lt;/a&gt;, a major figure in the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, and the second wealthiest goblin in the Bilgewater Cartel - second only to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Maldy\"&gt;Trade Prince Maldy&lt;/a&gt; himself. With the aid of the moguls of the Bilgewater and from &lt;a href=\"Tek%27zik%20Riddlevox\"&gt;Tek'zik Riddlevox&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the Tinkers' Union, all of whom believed that Maldy had gone soft (he was known to dote over his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Nessa%20Maldy\"&gt;Nessa&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Gallywix had fallen in love with on first sight), Gallywix initiated a hostile takeover of the Bilgewater Cartel. He bought the loyalty of Maldy's staff, and replaced his security with his own mercenaries; he even owned the land on which Maldy's manor (the site of &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;his own villa&lt;/a&gt; many years later) was situated. Though Maldy hoped to re-buy his possessions with the money he gained from trading weapons to the Alliance, Gallywix eliminated that possibility by destroying Maldy's trade fleet. Now in total control, Gallywix exiled Maldy and his daughter from Kezan, and later arranged his (supposedly accidental) death.\nThe Bilgewater Cartel dug really deep into Kezan in order to mine more kaja'mite ore, create Kaja'Cola and please their customers. While digging, they discovered a small vein of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, and Gallywix took its substance and kept it as a secret for years.\nJoining the Horde.\nPrelude.\nThe goblins of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; were all going about their daily lives having recently created a new drink called &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27Cola\"&gt;Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to boost their intelligence. Suddenly, had made an appearance at &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; was drawing close. The goblins not very concerned with the threats continued on with their day. Eventually it was discovered that &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; had begun to erupt and some goblins tried to cash in on the event. Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix of the Bilgewater Cartel charged desperate goblins fleeing for their lives 1 billion &lt;a href=\"Stack%20of%20Macaroons\"&gt;macaroon&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for saving their lives and leading them to safety on his private yacht. Gallywix however, was not true to his word and instead took the money and enslaved all those he saved. Gallywix then looked to start a new trade empire in the distant lands of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; with him being the most powerful goblin on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival on the Lost Isles.\nGallywix and his goblins were discovered by Alliance ships as they were attempting to capture the former &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. The humans then fired at the goblins' ship to prevent any witnesses and after their vessel was sunk, the goblin survivors washed up onto the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The goblin survivors used the remnants of their destroyed vessel as a small base camp and fought off the local wildlife to secure their camp.\nCooperation with the Horde.\nEventually, the goblins discovered an orcish journal revealing orc survivors in the isles. The goblin survivors thought it best to look to the orcs for help and sought out their base camp. The goblins then sent a representative to ask for help from the orcs. The orc survivors agreed to help if the goblins aided them in return. The adventurer had slain all the plants in the orcs' way and impressed the leader of the orc survivors- &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;. Aggra then agreed to assist the goblins find their way off the isles. Much later it was discovered that human agents too had found their way onto the island during their mission to bring &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the goblin &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; defeat the humans and rescues &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pygmy threat.\nThe goblins later decided to go to the larger of the two isles and deployed a &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box\"&gt;Town-In-A-Box&lt;/a&gt; so they could have a &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box%20%28Lost%20Isles%29\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; to rest themselves. The goblins were eventually met with &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;Pygmy&lt;/a&gt; troubles but were able to fight them back. Eventually, the goblins aspired to end the pygmy threat and using many gadgets they managed to destroy the various tribes and found themselves in the center of the isle where they killed the pigmys' turtle god, &lt;a href=\"Volcanoth\"&gt;Volcanoth&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the death of the turtle causes the island volcano to erupt.\nDefeat of the Trade Prince.\nThe goblins met up with the orcs once more to beat back the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for good and being impressed with the goblins' cunning and strength, the orcs agreed to take the fight to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; who enslaved the majority of the goblin survivors with mind control of some type. When Gallywix was finally beaten, he was told by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; that he could live if the Bilgewater Cartel became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Gallywix bitterly accepted and the goblins and orcs parted ways, with Thrall going to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; to heal the world and the goblins going to live in their new home of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; - the capital of the orcs.\nThe cartel's home base was once &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;Isle of Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, but after the natural disasters of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; ousted the goblins from their homeland, the vast majority of its operations are now concentrated in Orgrimmar's &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Slums\"&gt;Goblin Slums&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The Bilgewater Cartel have honored their agreement with Thrall and have used their technological expertise and services to benefit the Horde, though Trade Prince Gallywix has also found ways to make sure his alliance with the Horde increases his coffers.\nLater story.\nA Bilgewater cartel fleet wrecked itself at &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, and all of its survivors became insane.\nDuring the , several Bilgewater Cartel goblins sided with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Crazy%20Sapper\"&gt;sappers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde, goblins were seen in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; assisting the elves with new supplies.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; neared its end, the Horde became divided by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s loyalists, and in this case Gallywix sided with Sylvanas. During the conflict, Varok challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Sometime after this and the death of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the leaders of the Horde discovered that Gallywix had left both Horde and the Bilgewater Cartel.

At least, that's what the brochure says. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; commanders might argue differently, though. It isn't exactly easy to maintain discipline in an otherwise lawless city where every vice you can imagine is available for just a handful of silver and debauchery is half off.\nHistory.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;'s port homes, many of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;'s surviving &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s fled for their lives, joining their new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; comrades and settling in their new home in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The town's origins are often speculated on by non-goblins; Bilgewater Harbor sprang up in record time after the Kezanian refugees' arrival, and its' quintessentially goblin construction has fostered an atmosphere of debauchery and disorder. &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s military has only recently set boots down in Bilgewater, but the harbor's value as a strategic front conflicts with some pushy goblins' desire to turn it into a new version of their &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;ancestral home&lt;/a&gt; (abounding with gambling dens, pleasure houses, and other commercial luxuries). This cultural rift is likely to breed tension in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; sooner rather than later.\nBilgewater Harbor was presumably built on an artificial island in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Bay of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, possibly around the time the Bilgewater goblins were remodeling the entire region of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. It acts as a naval port for the entire Orgrimmar fleet, launching &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s to carry out the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;'s vision for the future of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nThe majority of Bilgewater Harbor inhabitants are &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s who previously appeared in &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The town is roughly divided in half between the military side, where &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Krogg\"&gt;Warlord Krogg&lt;/a&gt; and company send high-level players off to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the civilian side, where vendors, trainers, and some low-level quest givers can be found. Skull and crossbones signs warn those who inadvertently cross from one side to the other. The beach surrounding the port is home to wildlife that includes &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, and more recently, &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;s. The latter particularly enjoy a rock on the southeastern shore but can be found throughout the area. Many ships are docked at the port, one of which - the Hull of the \"Foebreaker\" - shows up as its own subzone on entering, though not considered as such on the zone map.\nWhen Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; launched the attack against the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, he had monsters - &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; - brought from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; by ships. The ships landed in Bilgewater Harbor and Garrosh personally came to observe them.\n&lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Hatchet\"&gt;Admiral Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet set off from the Harbor to &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Torok\"&gt;Warlord Torok&lt;/a&gt; blamed its goblins for giving the fleet alcohol that led to their catastrophic landing in the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;."}

Controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, it housed many important goblin buildings such as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bank%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;First Bank of Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;Gallywix's home&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Kajaro%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Kajaro Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"KTC%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen dragon aspect &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; forced &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; to erupt, forcing the goblins of the Bilgewater to flee the island which led to their wreckage in the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. After the eruption and the evacuation of the surrounding areas, it was reported that the port city was destroyed by the searing lava and tidal waves that followed.\nGeography.\nThe city is divided by walls into four 'districts' surrounding a massive inaccessible factory. The districts are: &lt;a href=\"Swindle%20Street\"&gt;Swindle Street&lt;/a&gt; to the north, an unnamed district to the east that contains &lt;a href=\"Kajaro%20Field\"&gt;Kajaro Field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drudgetown\"&gt;Drudgetown&lt;/a&gt; to the south, and another unnamed district to the west that contains the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bank%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;First Bank of Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, a food court, and some housing. There is also a gas station in the northern part of it, across a large road. The port is flanked by &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;Gallywix's Villa&lt;/a&gt; to the west, and &lt;a href=\"KTC%20Headquarters\"&gt;KTC Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27mine\"&gt;Kaja'mine&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The shore of the port is known as the &lt;a href=\"Slick\"&gt;Slick&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Cataclysm.\nDespite the zone being called &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; in-game, the goblin &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt; is located totally in the Bilgewater Port. Despite its name, the in-game representation of city houses no docks of any kind other than a private one belonging to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; (which is not even connected to the port itself rather to &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;his villa&lt;/a&gt;). Bilgewater Port is mostly inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20Citizen\"&gt;Kezan Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s going about their daily lives.\nIn the RPG.\nBilgewater Port, &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;'s primary port city, is located on a bay on the island's northwest coast. It bustles at all hours, with &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s arriving and departing in perpetuity. Cranes load and unload. Sailors embark and disembark. The docks are noisy and crowded, with visiting races rubbing shoulders with the native &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the goblin merchant sailors who arrive to drop off and/or pick up their goods.\nBilgewater is a port in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, and the only one worth mentioning that exists between the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;eastern continents&lt;/a&gt;; as such, it sees a lot of activity, and races of all types are found here. Bilgewater Port is connected to goblin enterprises all over the world and is linked directly to &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;. A circle of goblins called the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; oversees operations here. Whatever you are looking for, you can \ufb01nd it in here. The waterfront boasts inns, taverns, gambling halls, theaters, pleasure houses and numerous other businesses that cater to sailors and visitors. Deeper in the city, small shops of every kind \ufb01ght for space on the cobblestone streets.\nWhile people come to Bilgewater Port to trade normal items, anyone looking for contraband, especially pricey stuff like magic items and political prisoners, go to Bilgewater's much smaller cousin. The port town of &lt;a href=\"Edj\"&gt;Edj&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite side of the island. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; frequent the taverns of the port city, and it was in Bilgewater Port where &lt;a href=\"Wallace%20Boltscrew\"&gt;Wallace Boltscrew&lt;/a&gt; met her lover &lt;a href=\"Annetta%20Crank\"&gt;Annetta Crank&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was able to work in many things: from game design to producing, manual concept and layout to voice casting, directing and acting to music, and being a member of several strike teams that provide high-level feedback to the development teams. He served as a Vice President of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; and was a Director of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; from 1994 to 2003.\nHe and some colleagues left Blizzard because of frustration at the lack of communication with Vivendi management and a dearth of opportunities for them to participate in deciding Blizzard's destiny.

Each brewer vends three different strengths of brew, but the breweries specialize in a low, medium, or high strength range of brews. Stronger brews are higher level, restore more &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, have stronger &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and have a higher character level requirement to use. Each of three brews available from the Festive Kegs are the same as one of the three brews being vended by the brewer nearest that keg. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; brews are different brews but have equivalent effects. The Barleybrew dwarves' and Drohn's orcs' brews are the weak, low level range. The sample nearest them is the level one sample, the weakest at the Brewfest, and can be sampled by all attendees. Thunderbrew dwarves and T'chali's trolls have mid-range brews. The Gordok Ogres are shared by both factions, and have the strongest, highest level brews.\nNote: The Festive Kegs are neutral and inanimate. You should be able to use the opposing faction's Festive Kegs, if you can get to them. \nYou can fill your mug with any of the three brews. The only way to empty your mug is to drink it (use it). Drinking from your stein and refilling at a different Brewfest Festive Keg switches between brews. \nAnyone can fill their stein from any of the kegs. Since each beer has a minimum level associated with it, but the stein does not, you can drink a brew from your mug that has a higher level requirement than you are, but you will not get the buff. Instead you get a brief \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Hold%20Your%20Brew\"&gt;Can't Hold Your Brew&lt;/a&gt;\" debuff with a 'getting sick' graphic and a message warning you not to drink the big kids' drink. \nNote that the Alliance/Horde brews may be available in neutral cities as well.\nQuotes.\nThis is the flavor text for each brew. Note that the quotes for the 2008 Stein are different than the quotes for the 2007 Stein. \nNotes.\nDark Iron Dwarf invasion.\nYou fill at the same Brewfest Festive Kegs that the Dark Iron Dwarves attack when they invade. If the Dark Iron Dwarves succeed in destroying a Brewfest Festive Keg, you will be unable to fill your mug from that keg until it respawns. The destroyed keg will get a destroyed graphic with a caved in front, then disappear as the Dark Iron Dwarves depart. \nUniqueness.\nThe Blue Brewfest Stein is unique. Since the empty and filled forms are different, uniqueness might not apply, but the mug is soulbound and you only get the quest once in 2008, so you'll only have one anyway. "}

Filling, hence drinking, is free, and the brews are both &lt;a href=\"tipsy\"&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;inebriating&lt;/a&gt;) and provide &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; restoration and a &lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;well fed&lt;/a&gt; buff. \nSource.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; 2007, this item was a quest reward from\nUse.\n&lt;a href=\"Equip\"&gt;Equip&lt;/a&gt;ping an empty Yellow Brewfest Stein, then using a &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Festive%20Keg\"&gt;Brewfest Festive Keg&lt;/a&gt; will convert the stein into a Filled Yellow Brewfest Stein, containing a one charge sample of the beer from the barrel. The filled stein can then be used, drinking from it, which converts the stein back to an empty Yellow Brewfest Stein. The imbiber get the effects of the particular beer that was sampled. The full or empty stein must be equipped to be used. \nVarieties.\nEach of the three Brewfest Festive Kegs contains a different sample brew, so, depending on what barrel the owner fills their stein at, their Brewfest Stein will have a different sample of brew. Each full stein with a different brew is a different item, as is the empty mug. There are two icons, one for the empty stein and one for the full steins. \nEach Brewfest Festive Keg is near to one of the brew vendor tents. Each brewer vends three different strengths of brew, but the breweries specialize in a low, medium, or high strength range of brews. Stronger brews are higher level, restore more &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, have stronger &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and have a higher character level requirement to use. Each of three brews available from the Festive Kegs are the same as one of the three brews being vended by the brewer nearest that keg. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; brews are different brews but have equivalent effects. The Barleybrew dwarves' and Drohn's orcs' brews are the weak, low level range. The sample nearest them is the level one sample, the weakest at the Brewfest, and can be sampled by all attendees. Thunderbrew dwarves and T'chali's trolls have mid-range brews. The Gordok Ogres are shared by both factions, and have the strongest, highest level brews.\nNote: The Festive Kegs are neutral and inanimate. You should be able to use the opposing faction's Festive Kegs, if you can get to them. \nYou can fill your mug with any of the three brews. The only way to empty your mug is to drink it (use it). Drinking from your stein and refilling at a different Brewfest Festive Keg switches between brews. \nAnyone can fill their stein from any of the kegs. Since each beer has a minimum level associated with it, but the stein does not, you can drink a brew from your mug that has a higher level requirement than you are, but you will not get the buff. Instead you get a brief \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Hold%20Your%20Brew\"&gt;Can't Hold Your Brew&lt;/a&gt;\" debuff with a 'getting sick' graphic and a message warning you not to drink the big kids' drink. \nNote that the Alliance/Horde brews may be available in neutral cities as well.\nQuotes.\nThis is the flavor text for each brew. Note that the quotes for the 2007 Stein are different than the quotes for the 2008 Stein. \nNotes.\nHistoric note.\nApparently, this aspect of the Brewfest has changed for 2008, or these statements were misleadingly worded:\nDark Iron Dwarf invasion.\nYou fill at the same Brewfest Festive Kegs that the Dark Iron Dwarves attack when they invade. If the Dark Iron Dwarves succeed in destroying a Brewfest Festive Keg, you will be unable to fill your mug from that keg until it respawns. The destroyed keg will get a destroyed graphic with a caved in front, then disappear as the Dark Iron Dwarves depart. \nUniqueness.\nThe Yellow Brewfest Stein is unique. Since the empty and filled forms are different, uniqueness might not apply, but the mug is soulbound and you only get the quest once in 2007, so you'll only have one anyway. "}

They are also involved in many other illegal activities for their personal interests, such as smuggling, &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt;, kidnapping, &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; trading, and assassinations. Therefore they are feared by travelers and &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s for their cruelty, and are the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;Horde navies&lt;/a&gt; against which they are at war for control of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Many pirates have other synonymous titles, such as freebooters, privateers, corsairs, and raiders.\nDespite their image as free men, seekers of treasure, with a life full of glory and adventure on the high seas, the life of a pirate is actually not so great. They don't have a warm home or even their own bed, they are constantly surrounded by enemies and betrayals, and are hated by the society. In fact, piracy is considered one of the most vile of crimes under &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; law. Those caught and charged with piracy are sentenced to death and publicly executed.\nKnown areas directly under the control of pirates are &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;Bloodsail Hold&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rustberg%20Village\"&gt;Rustberg Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scalawag%20Point\"&gt;Scalawag Point&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn very rare cases, pirate crews may obtain a royal pardon for past crimes if they manage to accomplish a mission of great importance, giving them access to the port of the kingdom.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and his men were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; pirates on their way to help the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. After the naval battle, some of the sailors were captured and Uther uncovered a conspiracy that would reveal that Alterac had betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; fleets patrolled the trade lanes hunting pirates and marauders on the high seas. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s buccaneers raided one another in search of treasure, giving little thought to the risks they would undertake. The choice to create a pair of nimble cutlasses, &lt;a href=\"%3AFate\"&gt;:Fate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AFortune\"&gt;:Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, the sort of weapons favored on the high seas, meant that the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; saw great potential in corrupting pirates to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s cause, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;s crew and later a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; who splintered into the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Fleet\"&gt;Dread Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe island of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;'s location on sea lanes and lack of policing due to the collapse of many of the Alliance's states during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; made it a very attractive location for buccaneers. The abandoned &lt;a href=\"Rustberg%20Village\"&gt;Rustberg Village&lt;/a&gt; was repurposed by a band of pirates into a base from which they would strike at the wealthy trade towns along the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Some pirates also had journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and recruited or impressed various &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; into their crews, tauren who would later call Rustberg home just as their shipmates do.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, the town of &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; is a \"free people's port\", as it has no rules or regulations about what vessels are allowed to dock. Merchants, privateers, mercenaries, and even pirates are welcome. One can get anything they want in Freehold, provided that they pay for it, in gold or steel.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; woke the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, it was the simple greed of the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;' pirates that brought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s shores. The thieves stole artifacts from a vrykul burial ground and disturbed the spirits of the dead; later, the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; tried to lay the spirits to rest by returning the stolen items, but it was too late. These cursed souls were called in from the sea to raid the coasts and take souls to their mistress &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; \"made a deal\" with some pirates to transport &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was that the pirate should help them unless they wanted to be pounded into dust by the yeti leader, so they agreed to give them ships.\nPrior to its &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of protecting the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; merchant ships arriving in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, notably through patrols from Theramore and &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; tasked with tracking down pirate crews at sea.\nDuring the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; pirates were recruited by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. When Garrosh's followers managed to free him, they abandoned the buccaneers who were quickly rounded up and turned over to the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the &lt;a href=\"Bonefleet\"&gt;Bonefleet&lt;/a&gt; appears every year around &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; with the sole objective of destroying all living things on the planet with their undead curse.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, pirates of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; and could be trained into &lt;a href=\"duelist\"&gt;duelist&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA few years after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lord Admiral Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was reported to be in conflict with the pirates in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, on a pirate ship in the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Coast\"&gt;Shrouded Coast&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Return%20of%20the%20Nightsquall\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; are welcomed to sail under the flag of Nightsquall's crew, who aims to build the biggest pirate fleet Azeroth has ever known. The volunteers were invited to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and to plunder its secrets in the name of &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Admiral%20Nightsquall\"&gt;Dread Admiral Nightsquall&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nAs they value their freedom and only follow captains they deem competent, mutinies are common in the piracy community. At the same time, the evidence of a mutiny is enough for a crew captain to accuse and execute the culprits. In a pirate organization made up of several fleets, a captain cannot execute a member of his crew without impunity, as only the leader of the fleet can do it.\nA human ship flying no colors usually meant it is a pirate ship. They may use the fog to hide their arrival and ambush their target more easily. During a boarding, they use harpoons with ropes to hook their ship, and climb aboard to slaughter and capture its occupants. In case of difficulty, the pirates sound the retreat and sometimes throw crates of supplies to the sea in order to cover their escape.\nSome pirates have their own special way of speaking, and sometimes with very pronounced accents, to such an extent that it is difficult or impossible to understand what they are saying. As a pirate's word is of very little value, it is necessary between them to present evidence to prove that they accomplished their mission. It is also difficult if not impossible to negotiate with buccaneers unless you have appropriate clothing, wearing pirate outfits is particularly recommended.\nIn order to expand their ranks or replace their dead comrades, pirate crews employ recruiters, or go as far as kidnapping to force new recruits among them, threatening to kill them if they refuse or try to flee. The captain also seeks to have a clerk with them to ensure the cataloging of their treasures, and if something is missing, the latter will be held responsible in the event of a lack of culprit. In cases of crime or betrayal on board, pirates are notorious for the cruelty of their punishments, this can range from being executed by the captain, to being thrown alive to sharks, or tied up at the top of the mainsail to be devoured by the &lt;a href=\"Vulture\"&gt;buzzards&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a crew has been at sea for a long time, and their supplies are as low as the morale of the occupants on board, the captain brings them back to their hideout or somewhere where they can restock, but above all, to rest and relax in partying over lots of rum for several days. A duel between pirates has nothing to do with honor, only those concerned compete, but all the blows, even the most treacherous, are allowed because only victory counts. When they fight, the buccaneers are shouting joyfully as they gave vent to their bloodlust, pausing in their slaughter only long enough to rifle through the pockets and pouches of the fallen\u2014friend or foe.\nThe buccaneers are known for many things, but hygiene isn't one of them, as most pirate ships carry five or six times as many rats as the other ships. Because most pirates get scurvy and therefore have sore gums, they keep plenty of limes in stock to prevent this disease which has claimed the lives of many pirates.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Colonel Lorena&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt;, pirates on the whole aren\u2019t especially picky about who they attack, as they\u2019ll go after &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Depending on the captain, they can slaughter the entire crew and sink the ship, or leave survivors to continue trading and attack them again in the future.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Handsome%20Terry\"&gt;Handsome Terry&lt;/a&gt;, regular pirates don't appreciate treasures related to art, relics, antiquities, and collector's pieces, for they simply prefer gold and jewels.\nTo keep themselves busy in their spare time, buccaneers sometimes play &lt;a href=\"dice\"&gt;dice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29%23Lore\"&gt;card&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gambler\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; to pass the time.\nPirate organizations.\nAzeroth.\nA list of the pirate organizations on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;:\nAlternate Draenor.\nA list of the pirate organizations on :\nIn the RPG.\nSatisfied to let the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the mortals fight for supremacy of the land, the buccaneer is the unrivaled lord of the seas. A buccaneer dominates the seas and becomes rich off the helpless ships that fall into his traps. Nursing hatred in his heart, the buccaneer shows no mercy or consideration for any. He tyrannizes &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ships alike, gold being the same color to him no matter the race of the victim. The buccaneer is highly skilled in sea combat, including, but not limited to, firearms and sailing. The appearance of a buccaneer &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon can make the most seasoned captain's heart grow cold with panic.\nAlthough any race can become a buccaneer, most are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; being the most notorious. The most successful buccaneers are part of larger organizations; a lone ship of buccaneers is going to do little damage before being set upon by authorities - or larger pirate groups. Some buccaneers are in the employ of more respectable members of society, acting as privateers or doing dirty work against a lord's enemy's fleet; but most work for themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Pirate\"&gt;Pirate&lt;/a&gt;s are feared and hated by the populace, and privateers have a reputation for being almost as bad as those they hunt. The seas are already a treacherous place to be, with the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; among other dangers, and the fear of pirate fleets slows sea travel considerably. The buccaneer is proud of this notoriety, and does much to encourage it.\nIn an adventuring party, the buccaneer is concerned with exploration and plunder, and is useful to have along for any trips across the seas or any dealings with unsavory characters. An evil buccaneer is likely to attempt to take the party's portion of the treasure once the adventure is at an end, or leave them stranded on an island. The typical buccaneer is a soul who believes the world is his oyster, and everyone else is there to either give him things, or be in the way of him having things. Treasure, the freedom of the sea, and more treasure are his only concerns in life.\nAlthough an unsavory lot, buccaneers do revere and respect two things (other than themselves): the sea and her lover, the wind. The buccaneer has likely seen everything that floats or swims. He can identify a ship on the horizon.\nThe buccaneer becomes so obsessed with treasure that his eyes can more easily spot any treasure nearby.\nA buccaneer is ultimately untrustworthy, and untrustworthy people trust no one else. A pirate cannot afford to be naive. Buccaneers are skilled at fighting on the pitching and rolling decks of ships. The life of a pirate also means making sure no one sneaks up on you. When the buccaneer has reached the pinnacle of his swashbuckling skills. He is adept at moving and tumbling around to confuse his opponents and put himself in the best position to strike.\nNotable Buccaneers.\nSouthsea Pirates\nBloodsail Buccaneers\nLords of the Sea\nRelations with other classes.\nThe buccaneer favors &lt;a href=\"Guns\"&gt;firearms&lt;/a&gt; over swords (although he does, of course, use swords and knives frequently), and needs the sure-footedness of sea legs. Buccaneers commonly band together with other buccaneers, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Tinker\"&gt;Tinker&lt;/a&gt;s are welcome on their ships for their usefulness, but &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s are considered useless, as the buccaneer knows all he needs to about the sea. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are considered useful for healing spells, but buccaneers do not tolerate proselytizing. &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; spellcasters are regarded with caution, and can be bargained with if throwing them into the sea proves a bad idea.\nAlthough some buccaneers have used the ingenious &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s that tinkers create, the majority of buccaneers love sailing almost as much as they love their treasure. Their ships are commonly in top shape, and they commonly have a crew of slaves on board to keep the ship watertight and seaworthy. A buccaneer pays for nothing he is not forced to."}

Ages ago, when the port was threatened by &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;, Zem'lan cursed his crew into undead monsters and forced them to serve him for eternity.\nBiography.\nLong ago, Pirate-King Zem'lan was a good &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; crew served him loyally as they sailed under his black flag. Zem'lan claimed to \"own\" the black market, giving him first taste of anything that passed through the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Port of Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, the Port of Zem'lan came under threat from the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;. Zem'lan knew that he did not have enough crews to win a fair fight, but he did not fight fair. Before long, &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Jamboya\"&gt;First Mate Jamboya&lt;/a&gt; discovered a set of dark magical idols among the contraband caches. &lt;a href=\"Witchdoctor%20Yoksa\"&gt;Witchdoctor Yoksa&lt;/a&gt; believed he could perform a powerful ritual with them and tested the idols on a &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;. Zem'lan was apparently greatly pleased by the results and was confident that if the sethrak set foot in his port, he would make them regret it for eternity.\nWhen a group of refugees pleaded with Zem'lan to let them onto his boats to escape the sethrak, he responded by shooting several of them and telling the rest that the only ones who would be allowed on his ships were the ones who could pay him gold. Since none of the refugees had any gold, he told them to get out of his port and die in the dunes where they belonged.\nSome time thereafter, First Mate Jamboya reported to Zem'lan of the approaching sethrak army. Zem'lan vowed that no one would ever take the port from him and told Jamboya to rally the crew to defend the port with their lives. When it became clear that the Faithless were too many, Zem'lan told Jamboya to gather the idols and round up the crew at &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Altar%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;an altar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Isle\"&gt;Golden Isle&lt;/a&gt;, despite Jamboya's protests. Once at the altar, Zem'lan told his crew that they would hold their port forever. He then used the cursed idols to kill First Mate Jamboya and curse him into an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20troll\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, before doing the same to the rest of the crew.\nThe curse corrupted Zem'lan, making him cruel and controlling. He began treating his underlings more like slaves than crewmates, forcing them to fight and die for his gain. They were never allowed to have any treasure for themselves, and they weren't allowed to speak up without punishment. Zem'lan's favorite form of punishment for the crew is hanging them on the yard arm; since they can't feel pain and don't stay dead, his options are limited. Zem'lan doesn't stay in the port with the rest of his crew, instead dwelling on the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Isle\"&gt;Golden Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a forbidden island where he hoards all of the treasure his crew has plundered, so only he can enjoy them. Crewmates that try to take some of Zem'lan's loot for themselves are punished by being turned into mindless &lt;a href=\"goldslave\"&gt;goldslave&lt;/a&gt;s and forced to tend to his treasures for all eternity. Zem'lan keeps a &lt;a href=\"Gong%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;gong&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the isle that any crew member can ring to challenge him to a fight. However, First Mate Jamboya has only ever seen one pirate brave enough to ring it, and it didn't end well for her.\nEventually, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives in the Port of Zem'lan and begins aiding Jamboya \u2014 who is riddled with guilt for his role in the crew's fate and bitter towards Zem'lan's treatment of his underlings \u2014 and several other crew members in committing mutiny against the Pirate-King. The group travels to the Golden Isle to confront Zem'lan directly, and eventually Jamboya and the adventurer ring the challenge gong at the top of the isle to face the Pirate-King. Zem'lan is defeated, but with his dying words he tells Jamboya that he will not stay dead for long. Realizing the truth in Zem'lan's words, Jamboya and his crew head back to the mainland with the adventurer to seek refuge at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Lastwind\"&gt;Camp Lastwind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Once appropriately attired, head down to Booty Bay to join in the fun. There, look for Dread Captain DeMeza and her crew, who have taken over the roof of the Booty Bay &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. By talking to Captain DeMeza, players become an honorary crew member and transform into a &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; of their race and gender for 12 hours. This costume buff may be clicked off but persists through combat, mounting, death, and so on but disappears if shapeshifted. Other highlights of the holiday include:\nAlso known as the authors of the book \"Pirattitude\", which teaches you how to be a pirate, John \"Ol' Chumbucket\" Baur and Mark \"Cap'n Slappy\" Summers."}

However, he can be attacked and killed, though he leaves no corpse and is therefore not lootable, nor is any quest or achievement satisfied by his death. His abilities include summon &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Siegebreaker\"&gt;Infernal Siegebreaker&lt;/a&gt;s and an abnormally (and likely intentionally) powerful &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and stepping on players will cause them to take damage, as well. To be clear, his Rain of Fire will hit a level 80 plate class wearing tanking gear for about 60000 damage.\nPulling the Pit Commander onto the Stair will cause the Alliance and Horde soldiers to attack him, but only if they are not in combat with other demons. It is a solid strategy to aggro him from as far as possible, then run to the Stair, while no other mobs are present, and the Alliance and Horde soldiers will take him down in a matter of seconds. Note that he will not lose aggro on you unless he steps into an Alliance/Horde NPC's AoE attack, so if leading him to one is not possible, run to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; or dump aggro in whatever way is possible.\nWhen killed, the Pit Commander will respawn between &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, then walk up the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; and return to the Stair of Destiny."}

These massive Demons take sadistic pleasure from instilling crazed terror, and then slaughtering their enemies.

He can cast Rain of Fire from a distance to burn up low hit point units. He has Howl of Terror to lower the effectiveness of enemy troops. His Cleaving Attack gives him an edge when wallowing in hordes of enemy troops. His ultimate Dooms an enemy to a fate of unholy servitude to your Pit Lord.\nLike most Neutral heroes, using the Pit Lord is a matter of choosing between his two big spells and then putting spare points in his minor skill. The \"Rain Pit Lord\" uses Rain to soften up enemy troops once or twice and then charges in with Cleaving Attack to finish them off. The \"Howling Pit Lord\" is the first one to enter combat and stays in the front line until he or his enemies die. His Doom ultimate is another tool for players (especially Banshee-using Undead players) to swing a large conflict to your favor from the outset.\nDue to his Cleaving Attack, the Pit Lord will benefit more from attack damage and attack speed items. The game considers Pit Lords as Undead heroes, making them ideal for Undead players but poor for Humans.\nSpells and abilities.\nRain of ire.\nRain of Fire has a damage cap that is invoked when it hits more than 5 targets per wave.\nSimilar to Blizzard, except it also ignites affected units, causing moderate damage over time to them. Additionally, it costs a bit more mana than Blizzard, has a longer cooldown, and in all circumstances will do slightly more damage.\nRain of Fire is an area effect spell. This spell will damage all units including friendly units.\nRain of Fire will hurt your own troops so don't cast it on your own units or on allied units. Be sure to prevent your units from running into the Rain of Fire after your enemy steps out of it. Whenever possible aim Rain of Fire on low hit point units such as ranged units and spellcasters. Try to move the enemy into areas where their retreat is cut off so you can cast Rain of Fire on them. Cast Rain of Fire on any enemy units that can't run away.\nRain of Fire does 50% damage to buildings. Rain of Fire is not that effective against buildings but it can work.\nleaving Attack (Passive).\nNotes: Cleaving Attack ignores armor.\nThis skill benefits more if the map contains many attack damage or speed boosting items, as the damage can stack up very quickly against clusters of units at higher skill levels and has impressive AoE. This doesn't work on air units however.\noom (Ultimate).\nNotes:"}

As the Scourge is planning to use the saronite mined in the other mines in Icecrown to build Malykriss, it is likely (although unconfirmed) that this is the case with the saronite mined in Pit of Saron as well.\nThe events of the dungeon play out in the following quests:\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sveldrek\"&gt;Sveldrek&lt;/a&gt; group of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Pit until being defeated and raised by the Lich King's ally, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, into his servitude.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"For many years, champions among the races of Azeroth have stood against the Lich King only to be slaughtered mercilessly and forced to serve in his army of undead horrors. In his ongoing struggle to stop the Lich King, Tirion Fordring of the Argent Crusade has joined forces with Darion Mograine of the Knights of the Ebon Blade in order to assault Icecrown Citadel with a unified army called the Ashen Verdict.\"\nHeroic at Level 85.\nAs with the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, all trash mobs are soloable by most classes for those farming for &lt;a href=\"Battered%20Hilt\"&gt;Battered Hilt&lt;/a&gt; or gold (about half will drop in excess of one gold). While the first two bosses are in out-of-the-way locations and easily skippable, both must be defeated to open the gauntlet cave leading to the Scourgelord. Some classes should be able to solo them.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nFor a brief time, between the introduction of \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\"'s &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.0.1\"&gt;Patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the pit saw a number of weird bugs. The issues were fixed with the &lt;a href=\"Hotfixes%23July%2024\"&gt;July 24th Hotfix&lt;/a&gt;, but a list containing many of the observed bugs can be found &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Clown%20Fiestas\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

But as profit margins for blacksmiths are already meager at best, some still like to farm for these hard-to-get components. Be aware that many of the mobs suggested are also quest objectives, and are at peak hours hard to get at. All of these are also in contested zones, so keep an eye out for gankers if you are on a PvP server. Remember that an alchemist buddy with transmuting skills can be of great aid when you are looking for essences of different kinds. \nOther Reagents.\nA good place to get Core of Earth and Breath of Wind is across the southern &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Sands\"&gt;Abyssal Sands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"The%20Noxious%20Lair\"&gt;The Noxious Lair&lt;/a&gt; in the west, head east staying north of the &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20Compound\"&gt;Dunemaul Compound&lt;/a&gt; until you are south of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Pillar\"&gt;Broken Pillar&lt;/a&gt;. Then head southeast to the area immediately north of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gaping%20Chasm\"&gt;The Gaping Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. If you criss-cross a bit in said areas you should run into several Land Ragers and Gusting Vortexes on each round.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;Fire Plume Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; is a good spot to farm for &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Heart of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Essence of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, as the elementals there drop both kinds. It's about the only place to get &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Essence of Fire&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, so you should be prepared for some competition.\nProfessions.\nAlchemy.\nAlmost everything used here comes from &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Places%20to%20Farm%23Herbalism\"&gt;See&lt;/a&gt; down this page for things that can be farmed.\nVials of the various kinds are purchased at Alchemy vendors and Trade vendors. There is a vendor for the basic vials in almost every civilized area.\nMining.\nCopper and Tin: &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; is a zone abundantly filled with both metals; tin is mainly found in the east half of the zone, with some concentrations to the northeast by the elite Ogre camp. The rather low number of mobs and their predictable behaviour makes this an excellent zone to farm Copper and Tin or level up your mining skill. This is an Alliance zone, but higher level Horde players can conveniently access it via the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nLongshore in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nHilly terrain in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to mine copper and tin for Horde characters.\nYeti Cave in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; (be careful not to get ganked while in the Yeti Cave on PvP servers).\nIron: Running a loop around the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, or the hills of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;The Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best ways to farm Iron Ore.\nMithril: Running a loop around the northern area of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best ways to farm Mithril Ore. All of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; has been mentioned as a good place to farm Mithril, however, for 80s, the area is so small that the four or five nodes you will find will not have respawned until long after you found the fifth.\nGems are also found from &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;.\nMining.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Mining%20proficiencies\"&gt;Mining proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; page for a list by skill level of what to get and where the popular gathering areas are.\nEngineering.\nRandom parts.\nAfter your Target Dummy is destroyed ALWAYS check the remains. You will find random engineering pieces and possibly the Fused Wiring.\nFishing.\n&lt;a href=\"Raw%20Nightfin%20Snapper\"&gt;Nightfin Snapper&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a nocturnal fish, hence the name.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonescale%20Eel\"&gt;Stonescale Eel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stonescale Eel is Nocturnal.\nHerbalism.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gathereraddon.com/\"&gt;Gatherer add-on&lt;/a&gt; is particularly useful for recording where you've encountered herbs in the wild.\nBloodvine.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodvine\"&gt;Bloodvine&lt;/a&gt; was the rarest herb in the game. It dropped in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; when herbs were harvested by someone with a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Scythe\"&gt;Blood Scythe&lt;/a&gt; in their bags, and sometimes from mobs. It was removed in Patch 4.0.3a.\nBlack Lotus.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Lotus\"&gt;Black Lotus&lt;/a&gt; used to be the most valuable herb in the game found outside of instances, though they are largely supplanted by &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Lotus\"&gt;Frost Lotus&lt;/a&gt; now. Find it in places such as &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. It was required to create &lt;a href=\"flask\"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; consumables until the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. They have a long respawn timer and are often heavily farmed.\nFrost Lotus.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Lotus\"&gt;Frost Lotus&lt;/a&gt; is the currently needed Lotus for Lich King endgame flasks. They have a chance to drop off *any* Lich King Herb, but do so with greater frequency with the higher level herbs, I.E. &lt;a href=\"Lichbloom\"&gt;Lichbloom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adder%27s%20Tongue\"&gt;Adder's Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Talandra%27s%20Rose\"&gt;Talandra's Rose&lt;/a&gt;. Auction prices are relatively stable on most realms between 20-40g per Lotus. Note: They are NOT millable by scribes, so are primarily useful to Alchemists.\nStranglekelp.\n&lt;a href=\"Stranglekelp\"&gt;Stranglekelp&lt;/a&gt; can be reliably farmed in &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, the coast around &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;; and in the waters surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt; on the coast between &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. A few plants have been seen regularly along the coast of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Reef\"&gt;Vile Reef&lt;/a&gt;. Another very reliable place to farm for this herb is all along the coast of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can also get Stranglekelp without being an herbalist, by fishing: small quantities of it turn up regularly in schools of fish and pools of floating wreckage.\nSwiftthistle.\nSwiftthistle is a rareish drop found in &lt;a href=\"Briarthorn\"&gt;Briarthorn&lt;/a&gt; and Mageroyal and a few drops from plant-type creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Shambler\"&gt;Deviate Shambler&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Dew%20Collector\"&gt;Thistleshrub Dew Collector&lt;/a&gt;s in the far southwest of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; near the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildvine.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildvine\"&gt;Wildvine&lt;/a&gt; is a rare drop next to &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Lotus\"&gt;Purple Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlindweed.\n&lt;a href=\"Blindweed\"&gt;Blindweed&lt;/a&gt; is a scarce high level herb that can be found in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Hinterlands\"&gt;The Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. Feralas is an excellent location for farming Blindweed because it has a very high drop rate and it is relatively out of the way.\nGhost Mushroom.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Mushroom\"&gt;Ghost Mushroom&lt;/a&gt; is a scarce mid-level herb (245) that is found in \"many\" caves throughout the upper level zones (level 45+) of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Further, many caves in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; \"do\" contain a few of these herb nodes. They *are* millable by scribes, but due to the relatively scarce nature, they are not a great way of attaining pigment. Primarily used by Alchemists to make &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Dye\"&gt;Ghost Dye&lt;/a&gt; which is needed for pre-BC relative endgame craftable tailoring items.

The disaster caused Marileth to lose his mind, but he held onto his mission of crafting the potion for his margrave.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; sent a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; to search for survivors from the House of Plagues, they found Marileth at his camp in the &lt;a href=\"Blighted%20Scar\"&gt;Blighted Scar&lt;/a&gt;. He mistook the outsider for his apprentice and enlisted them to help him finish his potion, as well as create a &lt;a href=\"Plagueborn%20Slime\"&gt;slime companion&lt;/a&gt; of their own. Marileth then relocated to his laboratory near &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Watch\"&gt;Plague Watch&lt;/a&gt;, where he and his \"pupil\" worked together to concoct the potion. Margrave Stradama\u2014now driven mad and transformed into a monstrous slime being\u2014appeared shortly after, but the potion succeeded in granting her and Marileth a brief moment of lucidity. Marileth was shocked at Stradama's fate, but the margrave told her \"dear Marileth\" that he had to forgive himself and that while she was lost, he had to endure. The margrave disappeared and Marileth promised that he would endure for her sake. Moments later, the effects of the potion wore off and he returned to his mad state, but the act of temporarily clearing Stradama and Marileth's minds awakened the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Rune of Insight&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Blade of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; carried by the Maw Walker. Marileth also mentioned \"feeling strange\", suggesting that, on some level, he retained the memories of the encounter. Upon spotting his \"apprentice\" again, Marileth agreed to help them with their own \"project\"\u2014unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with his pet slimes &lt;a href=\"Kevin\"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plaguey\"&gt;Plaguey&lt;/a&gt;, Marileth helped defend the Seat when it was attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;. After the Seat was opened, he relocated inside with his slimes and allowed &lt;a href=\"Koa\"&gt;Koa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kou\"&gt;Kou&lt;/a&gt;\u2014two &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s rescued from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; by the Maw Walker\u2014to ride around on Plaguey and &lt;a href=\"Bloop%20%28slime%29\"&gt;Bloop&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Sanctum\"&gt;Covenant Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; version of the Seat of the Primus, Marileth and his slimes can be found in the laboratory in the northwestern part of the fortress. The plague deviser volunteered to teach Maw Walkers who joined the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; about the process of &lt;a href=\"soulbinding\"&gt;soulbinding&lt;/a&gt; by binding his soul to theirs. Marileth and &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; later helped defend the Seat by equipping &lt;a href=\"Ragewing\"&gt;Ragewing&lt;/a&gt; with a few \"surprises\" (plague vials and runed spears) which Maw Walkers could throw at the traitorous necrolord forces besieging the Seat. Marileth and Kevin partook in the joint &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and necrolord assault on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarileth participated in &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;:the Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, riding into battle on a &lt;a href=\"Trained%20Flayedwing\"&gt;trained flayedwing&lt;/a&gt;. He considered Ardenweald to be beautiful, but commented that it was suffering from a dire lack of slime. To rectify this, he and the Maw Walkers cleared the skies above the forest by throwing large amounts of slime at the winged &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. The plague deviser and Kevin later also joined the united covenant assault on &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; before returning to the Seat to witness Draka's promotion to margrave.\nSoulbind traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; members can &lt;a href=\"soulbind\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; with Marileth after completing &lt;a href=\"Come%20On%2C%20We%27re%20Simpatico%21\"&gt;Come On, We're Simpatico!&lt;/a&gt;."}

His memories are shattered and twisted.\nFor Uther to move past his pain, to move past his grief, he must experience his past once again.\nBut he does not have to do this alone.\nUsing my soul mirror, we can aid Uther in walking through these memories. He can then come to terms with the emotions they contain. We must help him see past the distortions and understand the truths they hold.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nWe can learn from this.\nCompletion.\nHis memories are twisted and convoluted.\nI am sorry, Uther, but we must continue.\nNotes.\nOn accept:\nInteract with the Soul Mirror in front of Uther to enter a scenario inside the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, set prior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; (though the chapel appears darkened and ruined as it does in modern-day Stratholme, hinting that something isn't right with the memory). Players are in the shoes of Uther, and have access to the following abilities:\nInside the chapel are &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the events of the quest occur, the present-day Uther will sometimes speak offscreen to the kyrian near him in Bastion. Confusingly, both Uther in the past and Uther in the present are named \"Uther the Lightbringer\". In the transcript below, Uther's quotes are marked \"(Past)\" or \"(Present)\" to distinguish between the two.\nStep in the golden circle between Gavinrad and Turalyon and use the bonus ability:\nThis grants the following buff for 33 seconds, stunning Uther in place:\nWith a burst of Maw energy, a sack of &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Grain\"&gt;Suspicious Grain&lt;/a&gt; pops into the corner of the chapel, and sounds of fighting can be heard from outside the chapel. Interact with the grain and Uther gets stunned by \"Fugue State\" for the first of several times in the questline:\nUther is now reliving the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Head to the back of the chapel and open the Chapel Door:\nOutside, in the &lt;a href=\"Elders%27%20Square\"&gt;Elders' Square&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas has started his purge. Hostile &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Knight\"&gt;Lordaeron Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Footman\"&gt;Lordaeron Footmen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Betrayer\"&gt;Silver Hand Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;s are torching the city. Numerous &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Citizen\"&gt;Stratholme Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s are dead, or are interacting with the plagued grain. Kill the hostiles, then run up to the grain crates and use the bonus ability:\nKill ten followers and destroy six plagued grain crates, and Uther's memory jumps back to the onset of the Second War as he enters another Fugue State:\nThe memory then ends automatically, depositing players back in Bastion.

He had hair and features very similar to Nathanos' own, and had hazel eyes.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nAt the age of nine, Stephon lived with his older cousin at the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt;. During one of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s visits to the stead, Stephon came across Nathanos and Sylvanas talking and stared in astonishment at the Ranger-General. Sylvanas asked him if he wanted to be a &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; when he grew up, but Stephon replied that he wanted to become a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos told the boy to leave, but not before Sylvanas gave him a gold coin and told him to keep it until he was old enough to buy his first sword.\nAdulthood.\nAs an adult, Stephon joined the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; as a paladin. He kept the coin that Sylvanas gave him for years, even after &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; fell, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He hoped that Nathanos had somehow survived and often asked about him, but was met only by shrugs and awkward silence. When he began hearing stories of a creature called the \"Blightcaller\" haunting the old Marris Stead and hunting down &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes, Stephon feared that it had murdered Nathanos and he vowed to take its head. He only learned of the fiend's true nature and what had become of his cousin when he overheard two refugees from &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; whisper the being's true name. On that same day, Stephon threw the Ranger-General's coin into a river. For some time, Stephon often patrolled near the Marris Stead, taking down no small number of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Sylvanas, now the Banshee Queen, could have ordered her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s to end his life, but \"never got around to that\".\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Stephon was captured by Sylvanas and brought to a secret chamber in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, where he was tied to an altar. She was about to have her &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; perform a ritual that would reshape and repair Nathanos' rotten, torn body and flesh, but it required a sacrifice of flesh, flesh akin to his own. When Nathanos was brought to the chamber, the cousins briefly exchanged bitter words, and Nathanos realized that part of him was proud that his cousin had fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming a paladin. The Val'kyr that had accompanied the Banshee Queen and her champion to the chamber proceeded to place herself between the human and the undead and began chanting guttural words in an ancient tongue, flashes of blue and gold pulsing from her hands. Nathanos lost his senses for a time, his world exploding in fire and pain. When Blightcaller's wits returned, he found that he had become stronger than before and no longer was decayed and withered. When he looked into a mirror, he noticed that his new face was not entirely his own. He then noticed that the second ritual table was empty save for a bit of ash and oily residue stains. When he later walked through the halls of the Undercity, Nathanos felt a touch of regret.\nRelatives.\nHe may have been related to &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt;."}
