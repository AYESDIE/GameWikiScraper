The fight is quite healing-intensive due to Taint of the Sea and has a kill-mechanic in the form of Corrupted Bellow, making Helya one of the more difficult 5-man bosses. Though the fight ends at 70%, this can be a very long battle for a 5-man due to her massive amount of HP. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"Helya, once queen of the val'kyr, was once at &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s right hand, raising the spirits of vrykul champions to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the final battle for the fate of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. But following Loken's betrayal, she was persuaded to join him and turn upon her master. She now lurks in the shadowy realm beneath the world, plotting her revenge.\"\nOverview.\nAttaching herself to the Naglfar, Helya launches an all-out assault of the vessel from a distance. Defeating Helya's Tentacles wounds her, and after defeating several tentacles, Helya submerges and continues to barrage the Naglfar with her tentacles. After 15 sec, Helya rips the front of the Naglfar in half and combats players directly, periodically retreating to the waves for the remainder of the encounter.\nAbilities.\nIntermission: Submerged.\nAfter several of Helya's tentacles are defeated, Helya submerges under the waves and assaults the Naglfar from below. On subsequent phases Helya periodically submerges.\nStrategy.\nThe fight consists of three phases: Killing Helya's tentacles, an intermission phase where she is submerged and is unhittable for at time, and a second phase where the players attack her directly. Helya's Torrent will deal consistent frost damage to the players throughout the fight unless DPS interrupt the spell. Of more concern to the healer is Taint of the Sea, a dispellable magic debuff that will hurt the target over time, cause a burst that hurts all other players when it fades, and leaves behind a green void zone on-top of the targeted player that explodes after about 5 seconds (simply move out of it). Multiple players will be targeted at once on Heroic and Mythic, so it may be in the group's best interest to dispel the Taints as they come, so that they don't all burst at the same time when their time runs out. \nPhase 1: Attack the Grasping Tentacles on the hull of the ship and the Destructor Tentacles attacking the players. As the Grasping Tentacles have large hitboxes, you may be able to cleave them while fighting the Destructors. Once they are all dead, the intermission phase will begin. Watch the ground for Piercing Tentacles which rise up, hit anyone close-by after a few seconds, and then retreat below the ship. They leave behind holes in the ship which stun you when you step in, so watch your step. \nIntermission: As Helya submerges at 80% HP, more Piercing Tentacles will rise from the ground and try to hit the group. Simply keep moving and continue dodging the green void zones. \nPhase 2: Helya rises, destroys half the arena, and pushes the players back against the ship before attacking the party herself, not summoning any more tentacles. In addition to her previous spells, she now uses Corrupted Bellow, a large frontal cone of shadow damage in-front of her. Due to it's large range and the fact that the arena gets cut in half, players must see where Helya is facing and/or where her hands are in order to see where she is about to fire the spell and move very quickly if she is facing towards them. Speed buffs or instantaneous teleports like &lt;a href=\"Stampeding%20Roar\"&gt;Stampeding Roar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roll%20%28monk%20ability%29\"&gt;Roll (monk ability)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Circle\"&gt;Demonic Circle&lt;/a&gt; are valuable here. Take note of- or mark where the holes created by the Piercing Tentacles in the previous phase are as being stunned while within Corrupted Bellow will kill you. \nLoot.\nThe following items are contained in the &lt;a href=\"Waterlogged%20Cache%20of%20Ancient%20Relics\"&gt;Waterlogged Cache of Ancient Relics&lt;/a&gt; which spawns after defeating Helya."}

Considered the greatest hunter on Azeroth, he led &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%20Safari%20%28group%29\"&gt;safaris&lt;/a&gt; to hunt the wildlife of Azeroth and beyond, and is the author of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;The Green Hills of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;\". He is generally to be found in the wild, camped out with a group of fellow hunters, surrounded by a variety of grizzly trophies collected from the native game of the area. Nesingwary and his cohorts tutor adventurers on the hunting and trapping of wild creatures.\nHemet fought in many battles alongside &lt;a href=\"Ajeck%20Rouack\"&gt;Ajeck Rouack&lt;/a&gt;'s father, and has been described by his servant &lt;a href=\"Barnil%20Stonepot\"&gt;Barnil Stonepot&lt;/a&gt; as a war hero of the Alliance. Nesingwary is the father of &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary%20Jr.\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, who has taken over some of his father's duties in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, in order to allow him to focus on new and even more exotic game in newly discovered lands.\nBy the time of the expedition to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet has retired and now spends his golden years as a cart driver.\nHistory.\nLegends: The Thrill of the Hunt.\nHemet was hired by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; to track down a crazy &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; that was terrorizing the elves. He chased him into &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; where he almost caught him not for the interference of &lt;a href=\"Creedy\"&gt;Creedy&lt;/a&gt;'s hunters. The furbolg escaped but one of the hunters recognized him to be the most famous hunter. They told him they were hunting a fox and Hemet joined them. After they found the animal's tracks, he immediately realized they were not after a fox and left them. He went after the tracks only to be attacked by a large cat, who turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Teleena\"&gt;Teleena&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that her &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; mount, &lt;a href=\"Isis\"&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt;, had been killed by Creedy's group, who were bounty hunters. Isis had just given birth to three cubs which the bounty hunters intended to poach; their markings, which would fade as they got older, made their hides valuable to the unscrupulous that were willing to pay high prices for them.\nOutraged that the bounty hunters would slaughter young animals that had no way or chance to defend themselves, Hemet immediately decided to help Teleena and her three cubs. They successfully escaped Creedy but the cruel hunter was able to shoot Teleena. Hemet took her to a nearby cave and managed to remove the bullet, but she later succumbed to her wound, asking him to take care of the three cubs before she died.\nNesingwary began with constructing traps and fashioned a bow and arrows from the bush for silent takedowns, killing Creedy's hunters one by one. Hemet managed to pull Creedy into a trap and bound him to a tree. The furbolg Hemet had been hunting appeared and he allowed it to kill Creedy before shooting it. Hemet then collected Teleena's body, the cubs, and the furbolg and turned them over to her people.\nHe would once visit &lt;a href=\"The%20Blue%20Recluse\"&gt;The Blue Recluse&lt;/a&gt; and recounted his story to &lt;a href=\"Flint%20Broadshot\"&gt;Flint Broadshot&lt;/a&gt; and his cronies, having learned the true meaning of an honorable kill and the \"thrill of the hunt\". He then claimed the corpse of a tiger the cowardly Flint had trapped before shooting it, leaving &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to bury the animal out in the wild.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, Hemet was in battlefields in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. \nHemet also visited &lt;a href=\"Kravel%20Koalbeard\"&gt;Kravel Koalbeard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; and ordered ammunition from him. He also arrived to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and befriended the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Roon%20Wildmane\"&gt;Roon Wildmane&lt;/a&gt;, spending several days hunting beasts. When he left for Stranglethorn, Roon vowed to invite him back.\nHemet Nesingwary was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Nesingwary's Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and directed young &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to hunt local game. He later left for &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to hunt bigger game. The Stranglethorn Vale quests he used to offer are now given by his son &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary%20Jr.\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary Jr.&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWith the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet Nesingwary saw this as an opportunity to hunt new prey. Hemet traveled to Nagrand where set up camp and welcomed everyone who wished to join the hunt. His choice of target there appeared to be the &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banthar\"&gt;Banthar&lt;/a&gt; is their champion. His ultimate target was &lt;a href=\"Tusker\"&gt;Tusker&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet Nesingwary returned to Azeroth, moving his operations to the &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Nesingwary Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The camp here is basically where his ship ended up after crashing through the river's entrance from the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, thinking the &lt;a href=\"Seabreach%20Flow\"&gt;Seabreach Flow&lt;/a&gt; might be a good river inland and finding too late he was wrong.\nA new organization known as &lt;a href=\"Druids%20for%20the%20Ethical%20and%20Humane%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;D.E.H.T.A.&lt;/a&gt; gives players quests to combat the game hunter's butchery, and even go up against Hemet's hunters.\nHe became respected by the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyhearts\"&gt;Frenzyhearts&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt; orphan &lt;a href=\"Kekek\"&gt;Kekek&lt;/a&gt; wanted to see him during &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;. Hemet advised him to read \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;The Green Hills of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;\" if he wanted to hunt with him.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet and the Nesingwary's Safari moved on to other hunting grounds.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet appeared at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; as one of many well-known characters during the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet and his son made an appearance at &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Safari\"&gt;Nesingwary's Safari&lt;/a&gt; near the south-west of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled here with a small group, having arrived by &lt;a href=\"hot%20air%20balloon\"&gt;hot air balloon&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Killem%27%20Jaro\"&gt;The Killem' Jaro&lt;/a&gt;\" (and \"not\" crashing for a change). After he had valley's wildlife hunted, his son wanted to step out of his father's shadow by hunting his own game hunt. Nevertheless, Hemet had to rescue Junior from the spell of &lt;a href=\"Torjar%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Torjar's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invited Hemet to come in to hunt big game. However, when he got here, they instead told him to hunt the wolves. This made Hemet disappointed, as he wanted to hunt big game, and felt the domesticated wolves weren't worth the effort. He set up a \"&lt;a href=\"Hemet%27s%20Happy%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt;\" in eastern Nagrand, just north of &lt;a href=\"Hallvalor\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt;, and began drinking heavily. If an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; drinks with him, Hemet may sometimes appear in their &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy using &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Lost%20Horn\"&gt;Nesingwary's Lost Horn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, Hemet's pets - &lt;a href=\"Gibby\"&gt;Gibby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kroshik%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;Kroshik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stompy%20%28talbuk%29\"&gt;Stompy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Silkwing%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;silkwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironhide%20Bull%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;ironhide bull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Direhorn%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Condor%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;cypress condor&lt;/a&gt; - will begin a stampede towards the enemy faction's base.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Nesingwary was up to his tricks again, this time hunting big game in central &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.

He would subsequently directed them killing &lt;a href=\"Wildtusk\"&gt;Wildtusk&lt;/a&gt;, in order to put the &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt; bull out of its misery. Sometime later he left the Trek in order to carry his own hunt, only to find himself hunted and captured by &lt;a href=\"Headhunter%20Jo\"&gt;Headhunter Jo&lt;/a&gt;. However rather than the target of Jo's hunt, Nesingwary found himself being used as bait for the adventurers. He barely had time to warn them before Jo attacked, and to his relief, was slain. He subsequently thanked them for freeing him and admitting to being embarrassed by the situation.\nHe also apparently visited &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; as his &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the former grounds of the &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Nesingwary Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, thinking to see if the jungle had fully reclaimed it. However, they were surprised to find tents and Hemet Nesingwary himself. The greatest hunter of Azeroth explained that he'd been passing through and wanted to take a look at Sholazar for a few days. He was jolly about showing us what bits of rotted wood remained of the ship he crashed in here so many years ago, and all of them did a bit of target shooting for fun in the camp.\nDragonflight.\nAt an unknown point in time, Hemet decided to retire. However, after learning about the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to join in for a bit of fun. He was accompanied by his &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary%20Jr.\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;, who was stationed at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Nowhere\"&gt;Camp Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;, while Hemet himself gave caravan rides, which serve as a scenic taxi service, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Wagon\"&gt;wagon&lt;/a&gt;, pulled by &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20%28bruffalon%29\"&gt;Tiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Junior\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nHiro is a Marksmanship Hunter &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nHemet can also be assigned as a &lt;a href=\"bodyguard\"&gt;bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuotes.\nNagrand.\nKeep a sharp eye, &lt;class&gt;.

When he traveled along the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, he noticed some &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s, from which he hid from and let pass, leaving a foul stench behind.\nOn the third day he came across a grand find: massive remains of what seems to have been a boar-like creature. Its skull towered many lengths above him, and each tooth of the beast could dwarf even a dwarf like him. Due to the sheer size of the find, he was lead to believe they were the remains of one of the rumored &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;; he remembered a lecture given by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Archaeologist%20Greywhisker\"&gt;Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker&lt;/a&gt; who mentioned of such a god, which was revered by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. He got interrupted when he heard noises outside his tent, believing it was a &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt; trying to get his apples. He was wrong.\nOn the fourth day it was revealed that he had been captured by quilboars of the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen tribe&lt;/a&gt;, believing they were taking him to the great boar remains of the fallen god. Instead, they skirted the great fossils and headed directly west of the giant skull, across the Gold Road. He was dragged into the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt; and thrown inside a crudely crafted hut, where he was held captive along with a dying &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;. His only possessions at the time was his journal, a pocket watch, and his quill. His last words on this part was that someone was approaching the hut.\nOn the fifth day he found that the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Heralath\"&gt;Heralath&lt;/a&gt; sent to these parts to examine the rumors of the fallen boar god, suffered from grave wounds from the repeated whipping from the quilboars, and was slipping in and out of consciousness. Henrig believed he would perish before a miracle rescue party would brave the treacherous place. The druid told Henrig that he believed the great boar skull was the place where the gear boar god &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; fell battling the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, flattening the land and causing twisted spires of thorns grow where his blood fell. Heralath and the other night elves seek to discover the source of corruption of the Kraul, believing it was a mystery that the foul creatures and malignant thorns scar the land, since Agamaggan was believed to be a pure god. Heralath slipped again into a fitful sleep before Henrig could press him on more information.\nOn the sixth day, Heralath's condition was getting worse, looking as pale as bone, his fever growing worse by the minute. He could only open his eyes once that day, speaking with pained anguish but giving a clear message: if Henrig would to escape his doom in Razorfen Kraul, he would get word to &lt;a href=\"Falfindel%20Waywarder\"&gt;Falfindel Waywarder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; was rousing minions in the southern &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and that her power was growing with each day. While the quilboars were preparing outside for some great military action, he feared that if he didn't attempt his escape soon, he would meet a fate similar to Heralath's. He planned to sneak out when the quilboars left for their next hunt, believing it would be easy since the guards were lazy and often slept through their shifts. Once he was free from Razorfen Kraul, he would head toward the Thousand Needles and then west to Thalanaar at the border to Feralas, seeking the druid Falfindel Waywarder.\nHis journal ends with the realization that what began as an attempt to explore the past of his people had turned into something much larger. The protection of the Alliance was lying in his hands...\nIt is unknown what happened to him after his journal ended, but he was probably killed during his escape, since his corpse can be found below the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift\"&gt;Great Lift&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "189844", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=189844", "title": "Herald Volazj", "text": "Herald Volazj, a &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; champion of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, is the last boss of and is located within the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Temple%20of%20Ahn%27kahet\"&gt;Fallen Temple of Ahn'kahet&lt;/a&gt;. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"Amid the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, many of the kingdom's denizens tunneled underground to escape the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s minions. Yet some of them dug too deep, exposing the tendrils of Yogg-Saron. Roused by this disturbance, the entity has sent one of its most ancient warriors - Herald Volazj - to cull the beleaguered &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s and annihilate anyone foolish enough to threaten the Old God.\"\nStrategy.\nIt is highly recommended to warrior tanks to &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; the Mind Flay. \nInsanity\nBefore Volazj completes its casting, all group members should remove their weapons. This will significantly lower the damage taken during Insanity. Don't forget to re-equip them.\nDamage classes face a &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; to kill their clones quickly so as to aid other members. The kill order should be to first down the healer clone in your party, the damage clones, followed by the tank clone last. Classes with &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; can down all of the clones when they are grouped together. Party clones will not use trinkets or your special abilities. Once out of your Insanity phase, you can assist others. If there is a Death Knight in the group, he will always death grip you to him, so be prepared.\nHealers and tanks can and should use whatever means necessary to focus on &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; while waiting for your party members to dispatch your evil counterparts and end Insanity. It is possible to finish off your own group in some situations with abilities like &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, but your focus should be to stay alive. \nA priest used to be able to &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; and cancel it and it would kill the clones immediately. This little glitch was fixed. \nA reasonably geared Holy &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; healer can also handle Insanity with ease. With the high armor, he can AoE tank all the clones and heal himself with &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt;. By spamming &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Judgment\"&gt;Judgment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;Shield of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally Holy Shock, the clones will be finished quickly.\nIt should not be necessary for &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to change form in preparation for Insanity. For instance, a &lt;a href=\"restoration\"&gt;restoration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; switching from to &lt;a href=\"dire%20bear\"&gt;dire bear&lt;/a&gt; just before the &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to make the fight easier. They may find a very difficult to kill resto bear charging and healing their group members even without having the appropriate talent.\nAn alternative strategy is to de-equip a DPS and send him/her to their death before the tank begins tanking. With one less person in the fight, Insanity becomes much, much easier. The fight is still very manageable with 2 DPS sacrificed as Volazj does not have much health.\nGroup makeup can greatly change the dynamics of the fight. Having almost all ranged DPS classes can add difficulty to the encounter. If you find difficulty as a melee trying to get to the ranged, the pillars along the walls can aid in line of sight gathering the ranged. Keep in mind, the \"clones\" can and probably will walk through the pillars to get to you.\nHeroic.\nFollow the same strategy as normal. When the boss is casting Insanity have everyone quickly unequip their weapon to make the fight easier. If done correctly the damage of the clones will be much lower. Make sure you equip your weapons again after Insanity finishes casting or you will be there for a very long time.\nSometimes it may be better to try with fewer people. The abilities of each clone are based off of each characters' spec. This means a hybrid class that has not spec'd for healing will not heal (such as a feral druid). However, a resto druid will still heal even if they shift into bear or cat form before the Insanity cast finished. Use silence/stun on the healer clone to interrupt him and kill him first.\nMacro to unequip weapons (needs 3 slots empty in rightmost backpack):\n /script ClearCursor() for i = 16, 18 do PickupInventoryItem(i) PutItemInBackpack() end\nAchievement.\nVolazj's quick demise is easiest with a protection warrior tanking the boss. Volazj's mind flay can be Spell Reflected for considerable damage. \nIt is possible to complete the achievement just by nuking the boss and killing the illusions made from \nthe two insanities as quickly as possible. Other tactics include heavy nuke on the boss when he casts the first insanity, bringing him from 66% to 33% before he finishes the cast, he will then start to cast the second insanity and needs to be killed before he finishes the cast or the party will be faced with 10 copies per person (instead of 5). Another viable tactic is to have the healer suicide (preferably just after the first insanity). This will make the second insanity much easier due to having 9 copies less to deal with, however this tactic does require a well geared warrior tank and probably the use of health pots.\nIf a Death Knight summons Army of the Dead during the insanity cast, the army will not phase with the players and instead will continue to attack Volazj, shortening the fight and the time between insanity phases.\nAdditionally, if Volazj is killed before he completes casting insanity, or if he dies during insanity from dots or other damage, he may bug. No loot icon will appear when mousing over his corpse, but he may still be looted by right-clicking. Additionally players will be stuck in their different phases and will not be able to see each other, or possibly the boss. This can be remedied by players either leaving the instance, or logging out, one at a time. After each player loads back in, they will be able to see all of the other players who have done so."}

While some herbs can be used in other trade skills, the vast majority are used for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;. Herbalism also called botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using a plant's seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, or flowers for medicinal purposes, but the game does not stricly adhere to that definition.\nAs with most types of gathering, interacting with an herb will dismount the herbalist. This can be overcome by being a &lt;a href=\"druid%23Shapeshifting\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, using a &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Golem\"&gt;Sky Golem&lt;/a&gt;, or (for herb-gathering only) building the &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stables%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;Stables&lt;/a&gt;.\nHerbalism pointers:\nOfficial overview.\n\"Herbalists carefully harvest the helpful and potent herbs found throughout the world. As they travel, herbalists use their keen senses to seek out the rarest and most precious flora, which can be transformed by other professions' mystic recipes. Herbalists can supply themselves (or their guilds or groups) with an abundant quantity of reagents to aid in their crafting, or they can sell or trade bundles of herbs for a profit.\n\"Herbalists can locate herbs on their map via a keen sense for the growth and placement of flora, and they can harvest them even more easily (by simply right-clicking on an herb). No special tools are required to gather herbs. As you gather a greater number of increasingly obscure herbs, your Herbalism skill will grow. High skill values are required to harvest the choicest herbs.\n\"Herbs grow nearly everywhere in Azeroth, though some areas are more fecund than others. Certain rare herbs appear infrequently, are difficult to find, or both - these will often command high prices and power potent crafting.\"\nTraining in herbalism.\nHerbalism can be learned from &lt;a href=\"herbalism%20trainers\"&gt;herbalism trainers&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the world. Initial training grants the Apprentice level with a potential skill of 75 and allows a few low-level herbs to be gathered. More herbs can be gathered as the herbalist raises their skill level.\nThe following are the required levels and potential skill of each stage of the profession:\nLeveling herbalism.\nHerbalism is primarily leveled up by gathering &lt;a href=\"node\"&gt;herb nodes&lt;/a&gt;. Mousing over an herb node will show a tooltip with the words \"Requires Herbalism,\" color-coded based on whether you can harvest it and how likely you are to get a &lt;a href=\"skill%20up\"&gt;skill up&lt;/a&gt; from it:\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Herbalism%23Skill%20bonuses\"&gt;skill bonuses&lt;/a&gt; can make the skill-up colors behave a little oddly. While the chance to gain a skill point from an herb depends on your base skill and does not change, the color coding goes by \"total\" skill, which causes herbs to appear to \"gray out\" faster than normal. Thus, with skill bonuses, it's possible to gain a skill point from an herb that seems to be gray.\nSkill points can also be gained by completing &lt;a href=\"Herbs%20for%20Healing\"&gt;Herbs for Healing&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkill bonuses.\nSkill bonuses can be used to temporarily increase herbalism skill, which allows an herbalist to gather herbs at a lower skill level than required.\nHerbalism uses &amp; perks.\nHerbs are the primary materials for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;. Though inscription's &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt; changes put a dent in herb demand, alchemy still manages to keep herbalism useful; because &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing guilds need &lt;a href=\"flask\"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;s every week, &lt;a href=\"max%20level\"&gt;max level&lt;/a&gt; herbs are generally very expensive.\nCertain herbs have additional uses:\nRare herbs.\nSince certain herbs cannot be easily &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farmed&lt;/a&gt;, their prices and availability on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; tend to be highly unpredictable. This makes herbalism a valuable skill when looking to obtain them.\nThese herbs can only be found inside of other herbs' &lt;a href=\"node\"&gt;node&lt;/a&gt;s:\nThese herbs simply have nodes that don't spawn often:\nExperience.\nGathering herbs can grant &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, providing herbalists a small boost while they level. Experience gained from herb-gathering is increased by &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; and other experience gain buffs.\nHerbalism-related items.\nHerb bags.\nAn &lt;a href=\"herb%20bag\"&gt;herb bag&lt;/a&gt; is a special type of bag that can carry only herbs (as well as a handful of &lt;a href=\"Herb%20Bag%23Other%20items\"&gt;other related items&lt;/a&gt;), but is usually much larger than the average similar-level bag.\nElemental ingredients.\nHerb gathering is an excellent source for &lt;a href=\"elemental%20ingredient\"&gt;elemental ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s connected with life:\nBuffs &amp; consumables.\nCertain herbs give the herbalist a temporary &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; when gathered:"}

In fact, heresy is any belief, practice, &lt;a href=\"blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, act, or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs, traditions, or customs in a society, in particular the accepted beliefs of a religious &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresent among all the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;s, and societies, those accused of being heretics by their actions and beliefs are denigrated or treated as pariahs by their people, and subsequently rejected, exiled, or eliminated. This is mainly the case in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt;, but it is also applied in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, and most certainly in the other &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;cosmic planes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;inquisitors&lt;/a&gt; are mainly responsible for tracking down the heretics in order to arrest and interrogate them, by torture if necessary. Some extremist organizations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, devote themselves to their eradication, going so far as to throw them into &lt;a href=\"cage\"&gt;cage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;s where they are treated like animals, before being cruelly executed.\nThird War.\nYears before the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; began to preach his heretical \"religion\" through Lordaeron, promising immortality, power, and an ideal society free of all the burdens. Many were those who consequently forsook the Light, willingly selling their soul to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and joined the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of wretched and heretical fallen &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s appeared. They once counted as the most devout amongst the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. But, after years of constant war and suffering, they had lost their sense of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Now, they existed only to spread their frustration and negativity to their fellow men and women.\nThey appeared as a category of &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s and counted &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Fallen Priests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deceiver%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Deceivers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heretic%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Heretics&lt;/a&gt; among their ranks. They were modeled after the &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Acolytes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Heretics of the Holy Light include the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. These are religious groups that altered the holy light philosophy and splintered from the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf the two splinter factions of the Church of the Holy Light \u2014 the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade \u2014 the Argent Dawn is by far more palatable to the Church. Still, both technically go against the church's established teachings to blaze new paths.\nThe Argent Dawn believes the church\u2019s old methods of dealing with evil no longer suffice. Evil constantly changes and refines its methods, and good must likewise change. The Scarlet Crusade takes this notion one huge step forward. The crusade rationalizes that evil has no restraints on its tactics, and neither should good if it expects to triumph. While both groups go against the teachings of the Church of the Holy Light, the church takes no direct action against them. This lack of activity on the church's part derives from its unique structure. While it is the dominant faith among &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the Holy Light is not a religion so much as it is a philosophy. The \"church\" is a network of the faithful that exists to bring worshipers together and provide new members with guidance. Adherents to the path of the Holy Light don't attend services once a week or build edifices to celebrate their philosophy (with a few exceptions). Plus, the Church of the Holy Light \u2014 and its adherents \u2014 have larger problems to worry about.\nIn addition, while their doctrine might be radical, none can deny that the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade accomplish what they set out to do. The Argent Dawn has become the preeminent enemy of evil in some areas, and the Scarlet Crusade deals blow after vicious blow to the Scourge. While their methods may be questionable (particularly in the case of the Scarlet Crusade), their accomplishments dissuade most faithful of the Holy Light from interfering.\nDomains: Priests of the Holy Light who serve the Scarlet Crusade can gain access to the Crusader, Healing and War domains (but not Protection).\nSpeculation.\nThe Heretics that could be found in \"\" on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; right after the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; may have represented &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; members."}

Huln carried the Eagle Spear, Spear of the Wild Gods, now mostly known as &lt;a href=\"Talonclaw\"&gt;Talonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, upon which were carved markings that described the history of the weapon and the feats of its previous owners. Huln and his tauren played a crucial role in several battles during the war, and for his bravery, Huln and his people received a blessing from the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, so that they would always have the demigod's favor: the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Eche%27ro\"&gt;Horns of Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing his death, Huln was sent to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where he became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;a new and mysterious enemy&lt;/a&gt; came to the world, Huln united the warring &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; tribes under the banner of his own &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. He was asked by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, the future version of the dragon Korialstrasz, to aid the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; in their war against the Legion. After Huln's life was saved by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, he promised to carve his name on his spear, which would cause Jarod to be honored for generations of Huln's line. Huln fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, but Omen became gravely wounded and poisoned by fel energy. Just before he succumbed to corruption Omen blessed Talonclaw, which had previously been blessed by &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; during the time of Huln's ancestors.\nHuln won much of his glory during a battle in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Huln rescued &lt;a href=\"Unng%20Ak\"&gt;Unng Ak&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and found a &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt; favored by &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Eche%27ro\"&gt;Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt; who would be his companion and mount forever after. He received a blessing from &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, so that his people would forever have the demigod's favor, granting them the Horns of Eche'ro: their moose-like antlers. He protected &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; while the druid summoned &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s to the battlefield, and aided his friend Jarod in defeating &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final battle for the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, Huln fought a &lt;a href=\"doomlord\"&gt;doomlord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Xyburn\"&gt;Xyburn&lt;/a&gt;, who had made it his personal mission to eradicate the tauren race. When Huln was seemingly beaten, he struck Xyburn in the left eye. Before he could slay the doomlord, Xyburn and all the other demons were sucked back into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; due to the efforts of Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had worked together to close the Legion's portal with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Xyburn vowed revenge on Huln, all tauren, and the weapon that had taken his sight.\nAfter the War of the Ancients, Huln returned to his homeland and it was renamed &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in his honor. But for Huln, the war did not end at the Well of Eternity. With the Legion defeated, he focused on the monster that got away: the newly-christened &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. He confronted the Destroyer at &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt; and, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Igrul%20the%20Scalebane\"&gt;Igrul the Scalebane&lt;/a&gt;, retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; from within. Huln decided that while it was not powerful enough to kill Deathwing, the artifact could at least be used to banish the dragon. Huln and an uprising of Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; slaves battled the Earth Warder, and Huln banished Deathwing from the land, sending him to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, Huln used the Hammer of Khaz'goroth to purify one of Deathwing's eggs, and it hatched into an uncorrupted black whelp named &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s sought to claim &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. Their campaign was led by &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;. Huln Highmountain gathered heroes from among the tribes, and fought against Uul'gyneth's servants, the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the forces of shadow were too great to overcome. So Huln devised another plan. Wards were placed to lock away the Old Gods' influence. Though the general survived, Uul'gyneth's essence was trapped.\nHuln placed a ward at &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt; to protect the mountain from the servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAt the end of his life, Huln Highmountain bequeathed Talonclaw to his successor and went to join his ancestors. Legend has it that &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; herself appeared to carry the spirit of the great chieftain into the sky.\nLegacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; are descended from Huln and the other tauren who fought in the War of the Ancients. Huln's descendants helped the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf hunter organization, by leading them to the site in Highmountain where they would build &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. His spear, &lt;a href=\"Talonclaw\"&gt;Talonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, is a sacred artifact to the tauren in the region.\nHuln is today considered the greatest tauren to have ever walked Highmountain. The whelp he rescued from Neltharion's Vault, Ebyssian, has continued to watch over the tauren hero's descendants for ten thousand years under the guise of &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;, only revealing his true identity to the High Chieftains upon their ascension ceremony.\nShadowlands.\nWhen Huln died, his spirit was taken to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, an afterlife for those connected to the forces of nature. In time, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; and became known as the Horned Hunter. \nHe was assigned by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt; to cull the &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s, and in the midst of his mission was approached by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, who sought his aid in finding former &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Huln was quick to agree, on the condition that the Maw Walker help in completing his mission. As the pair struck out against the devourers, they discovered &lt;a href=\"Voras\"&gt;Voras&lt;/a&gt;, the Realm Eater. After a failed ambush attempt on Voras' life, Huln and his ally retreated to &lt;a href=\"Root-Home\"&gt;Root-Home&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that Voras was content to roam the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Stand\"&gt;Elder Stand&lt;/a&gt;, Huln determined that they needed a way to lure it to them. As part of his gambit for the fight, he sent his ally to &lt;a href=\"Gormhive\"&gt;Gormhive&lt;/a&gt; in order to gather expended wildseeds and &lt;a href=\"Bulging%20Digestive%20Sac\"&gt;Bulging Digestive Sac&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"gorm\"&gt;gorm&lt;/a&gt; within.\nKnowing that they would be successful, Huln moved on ahead to prepare the hunting ground, and was soon joined by the Maw Walker. Remarking that hunting is a battle of wills, with life or death in the balance for them all, Huln set up the bait to lure Voras from the Elder Strand. After the pair successfully killed Voras, Huln declared that Voras was no easy prey, even for the Wild Hunt. With his quarry slain and duties fulfilled, he remarked that the &lt;a href=\"tirnenn\"&gt;tirnenn&lt;/a&gt; were more than capable of defending their home from the lesser devourers. He then departed to report the mission's success to Lord Herne. With his task accomplished, Huln fulfilled his end of the bargain by seeking out the Night Warriors of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. He personally considered this venture a true challenge and vowed to not rest until he found them.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt; was killed and the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; beaten back, Huln was present within the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s court celebrating their victory.\nChains of Domination.\nAs a result of the covenants working more closely together, Huln's hunt for other Night Warriors of Elune found greater success and gave him leads on two of their whereabouts. Thus he sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to sent the Maw Walker to him in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. Side by side, the pair investigated the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Sepulcher of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered the Night Warrior within the tower: &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to assist them in mission to save Tyrande after her current mission had been completed. While Khaliiq received aid from the Maw Walker in her mission, Huln departed to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; in order to discover the next Night Warrior.\nHuln's quest took him to &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Keep\"&gt;Dominance Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Stoneborn\"&gt;Stoneborn&lt;/a&gt;, and delivered to &lt;a href=\"The%20Stonewright\"&gt;The Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;. The Stonewright having been enraged by the return of the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; had come under impression that Huln was one of them and was threatening to throw him into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; when the Maw Walker, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cudgelface\"&gt;Cudgelface&lt;/a&gt; entered the scene. After a brief fight, the Stonewright regained her composure and revealed that she was in the fact the Night Warrior that Huln had been looking for. In the aftermath, Huln was let go and the Stonewright had agreed to aid them in saving Tyrande.\nAfter Tyrande was successfully saved from the Night Warriors power, Huln came to reside near &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Vesperbloom\"&gt;Watcher Vesperbloom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Command%20Table\"&gt;Command Table&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Winter%27s%20Sigil\"&gt;Winter's Sigil&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Highmountain Tauren characters get additional gossip options\""}

Recent discoveries have shown that humans are descended from the barbaric half-giant &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Born \"weak\" and \"deformed\" as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, they had to be exterminated to keep the vrykul race pure, but not all vrykul could bear to kill their children, and they took them away to a land far away from Northrend, in the northern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly humans were primarily a scattered and tribal people for several millennia, until the rising strength of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire forced their strategic unification. Thus the nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; was formed, along with its capital, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;. After several centuries of peace, however, the increasingly prosperous and independent city-states of Arathor split into separate &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to the far south. Strom itself was renamed &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and remained significantly powerful.\nBut disaster struck when the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; appeared on Azeroth, reducing Stormwind to ruins during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The city's survivors, including the young prince, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, fled to Lordaeron, where the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;seven kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; resolved to unify once again in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Joined together, they succeeded in defeating the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Tensions grew among the kingdoms, however, as the costs for maintaining the Alliance rose much higher than originally anticipated. Unwilling to pay the taxes, the leaders of Gilneas and Stromgarde chose to withdraw their kingdoms following the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFurther disaster came when the kingdom of Lordaeron was decimated by a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;mysterious plague&lt;/a&gt; that killed thousands of humans and converted them into undead servants of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Even Lordaeron's prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and journey to Northrend, where he merged with his master. For the next five years, the Lich King remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;armies&lt;/a&gt;. But unleashing the plague of undeath was merely preparation for an invasion by the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which had long sought to destroy all life on Azeroth. When the Legion struck, humans banded together with other races and secured a costly victory during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the fall of Lordaeron, the kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful force in the now multiracial Alliance. Led by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded his father &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; at the head of the Alliance, the people of Stormwind hold fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defend their settlements and their families.\nThough humans are among the younger races on Azeroth, they have faced many challenges with fortitude and resilience. Their continued ability to adapt and rebuild has made them a vital force in an ever-changing world.\nHistory.\nAt the dawn.\nThe humans are descendants of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"seed%20race\"&gt;seed race&lt;/a&gt; who worshiped their creators, the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, as gods. Around 15,000 years ago, the vrykul of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; believed that their gods had \"abandoned\" them, and a certain time after that, some of their children were born \"weak and ugly.\" &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; ordered all such children to be killed: the punishment for not doing so was that the child's parents would be executed alongside them. &lt;a href=\"Skadi%20the%20Ruthless\"&gt;Skadi the Ruthless&lt;/a&gt;, in a true act of depravity, earned his title by relentlessly hunting down such families. Despite the risks however, not all parents obeyed this order and instead hid their children to grow up far away from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Legends say it was &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Keepers, who brought the humans to their new home, though the vrykul actually sent their offspring there because it was the location of Tyr's tomb. Regardless, his legend and symbol would haunt and inspire the humans forever after.\nThe young race of humans struggled to survive using the limited supplies provided to them by their vrykul parents, who had abandoned them. They occasionally took to gathering around a fire whilst trying to read from scrolls telling of ancient heroes and leaders \u2013 tales from the civilization that had cast these creatures out. One of these scrolls spoke of a great leader, a paragon of order and justice, who sacrificed his right hand in a fight against an unfathomable evil. Although it was within this hero's power to fix his hand after the fighting had ended, the hero instead chose to replace it with a closed fist made of the purest silver. In this way, the hero impressed upon those who followed him that true order and justice can only be accomplished through personal sacrifice. This hero, who slipped into memory long ago, went by the name of Tyr.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; sometimes captured these nascent humans and used them as slave labor.\n&lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; theorized that humans and possibly even some Zandalari may have sided with the pandaren in the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;pandaren rebellion&lt;/a&gt; 12,000 years ago.\nEarly societies.\nEventually, humans started gathering and forming &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, occupying the lands that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the northern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Among the known tribes were the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;followers of Lordain&lt;/a&gt;, each with their own culture. Not yet accustomed to the divine &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; or the potency of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, they had primitive belief systems that incorporated simple nature &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, practicing crude forms of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism.\nAs the last vrykul of the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; died of old age, they started adding humans to their ranks.\nThe rise and fall of the Arathor Empire.\nHumans joined the forefront of Azerothian history during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; 2,800 years ago. Concerned that the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s were becoming too great a threat, the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi tribe&lt;/a&gt; of humans embarked on a campaign to conquer its rivals through combat and politics. By offering equality and peace to the people they conquered, the Arathi were able to form a powerful nation, &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; was built, and the humans in the area that would later become &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to its protection.\nThe &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, were in open war with the trolls. On the verge of defeat, they sent ambassadors to Strom to plead for assistance from the human king, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for support, the elves agreed to instruct &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One Hundred&lt;/a&gt; humans in the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the high elves, humans learned magic and waged a bitter war against the trolls that once spanned the entire length of the Eastern Kingdoms. Eventually, humanity won against the trolls and they lived in peace for several centuries. However, the increasingly prosperous and independent city-states of Arathor later declared their independence; splitting into separate &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to the far south. Strom itself was renamed &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and remained a significantly powerful kingdom.\nIn time, the kingdoms gradually developed rivalries, as before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the human kingdoms of Lordaeron faced challenges and obstacles from each other as the games of politics played out. Decades before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, while Azeroth enjoyed a time of relative peace, villages squabbled with villages, and kingdoms spied on kingdoms. In the Eastern Kingdoms, humans engaged in rigorous trade with dwarves, gnomes, and high elves. Some nations, like Lordaeron, acted as regional leaders and trendsetters, mediating disagreements between smaller kingdoms and used their strong militaries to impose order over the land. Still, others focused their resources on defending themselves from old rivals.\nAmong the history books in &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, some mentioned references of genocides, assassinations, and massacres between humans of the seven kingdoms, using claims of nobility, heritage, and honor to justify their conflicts. Among these battles, there were military conflicts between the nations of Alterac and Stromgarde, as the proximity of the two and the apparent ambiguity of their mountain borders had led to several wars and skirmishes. On more than one occasion, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; led the armies of Stromgarde into battle against the honorable &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac.\nThe Alliance of Lordaeron.\nMillennia later, disaster struck when the orcish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; appeared on Azeroth, reducing Stormwind to ruins during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; between orcs and humans. The city's survivors, including the young prince, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, fled to Lordaeron, where the leaders of the seven kingdoms resolved to unify once again in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Joined together, they succeeded in defeating the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nTensions grew among the kingdoms, however, as the costs for maintaining the Alliance rose much higher than originally anticipated. Unwilling to pay the taxes, the leaders of Gilneas and Stromgarde chose to withdraw their kingdoms following the &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20Splinters\"&gt;Alliance splintering&lt;/a&gt; in consequence of the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, most contemporary human and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; mages bowed to the sovereignty of Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. Further disaster came when the kingdom of Lordaeron was decimated by a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;mysterious plague&lt;/a&gt; that killed thousands of humans and converted them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; servants of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Even Lordaeron's prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and direct the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to eradicate humanity in his kingdom. Eventually, Arthas journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where he merged with his master. For the next five years, the Lich King remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;armies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remnants of the Alliance in Lordaeron banded together to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; in order to retake their lost lands from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance resistance managed to retake &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. However, Garithos' harsh bigoted leadership forced the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; to desert his army and sometime later, the Alliance resistance was mind controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance resistance was freed from the dreadlords' influence by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; (later known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;) and together, they worked to take down the last dreadlord warlord, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, and retake the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of leaving Lordaeron as Sylvanas promised however, Sylvanas betrayed Garithos and had him and his men killed; thereby taking the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for herself.\nPost Third War.\nWith the recent invasion of the Burning Legion, which left the northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in ruins, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; now stands as the strongest bastion of human civilization. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; since then has been reorganized and gained new allies in the following years, with the humans of Stormwind standing resolute in their charge to maintain the honor and might of humanity. Following the heroic examples of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;, the knights and warriors of Stormwind are considered to be among the fiercest and most courageous warriors in the land.\nDespite the devastating losses of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, humanity still prospered in most of the remaining human kingdoms. Even in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, which took the brunt of the devastation, still had pockets of humanity fighting to reclaim their lost lands back. However, some of these humans entered into a conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, who humanity found abominable and unsavory. Many humans see undead as offensive to their way of life, while others still suspected them of being agents of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. It did not help matters that the Forsaken joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a long time enemy of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and that human zealots in Lordaeron such as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; became obsessed with eradicating the undead and retaking their once-beautiful homeland.\nThe humans' primary threat now other than the Scourge is the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, who are continuing their attempts to expand south from &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;. However, the human presence in the region remained strong with the remnants of Lordaeron and Stromgarde, causing the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; area to be one of Azeroth's major battlefields. Despite all of this, humans continue to be vigilant, and have banded closer together and with the Alliance as a whole.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron, under the command of Lord Commander &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and Highlord &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who wielded the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to retake the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Though they found some success, after Highlord Mograine fell to the Scourge, the holy order began to change. They rebranded themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and became more fanatical in their methods of destroying all undead, as well as despising all non-human races. Other paladins, disgusted with the Scarlet Crusaders' zealotry, formed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which took a less extreme approach and accepted members from all of Azeroth's races into their ranks.\nOne day, King Varian Wrynn went missing while on route to a secret diplomatic meeting. During the absence of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was crowned king, though the actual power remained in Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s hands until either Varian was returned or Anduin reached the age of ascension. The Kingdom of Stormwind was kept in a state of chaos and political unrest due to corruption created by Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, and (to a lesser extent) &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;- who all fall under the protection and leadership of Stormwind- had to rely more heavily on their own local militia to fend off local threats while Stormwind's leadership was in disarray.\nUnder the watchful leadership of the young mage &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; that fled the destruction of Lordaeron joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat the demon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and banish the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the expedition established a new home in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, which became a prominent member of the Alliance and kept close ties with Stormwind. Lady Jaina Proudmoore hopes to lead &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to a prosperous future and aid in reuniting the distant human kingdoms once more. The merchant nation of Kul Tiras left the Alliance after their demands to avenge Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s death were going unheeded. The people of Kul Tiras furiously isolated themselves from the rest of the Alliance, but were not angry with all of the Alliance leaders. They instead nursed a bitter hatred only towards Jaina Proudmoore for betraying her family and allowing the Horde to cut down her father. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, with its powerful mages, retained some control over Hillsbrad and Silverpine Forest but mostly isolated themselves behind a vast, magical dome around the heart of their city. In addition, there is the human enclave in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. After the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has also established themselves in the contested land and are fighting for the resources of &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;. The remnants of Stromgarde rejoined the Alliance in order to rid its kingdom of interlopers and restore the kingdom to its former glory. It was rumored the once-allied kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; was still flourishing and populated with humans, but no word has been heard of them for years. They too have isolated themselves from the world after they barricaded themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nHuman forces from Stormwind and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; worked to repel a surprise &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; from the recently re-opened &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; alongside the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. After the combined forces of Azeroth pressed on through the Dark Portal and into the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance forces were surprised to find the tattered remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, still standing vigil years after the portal closed and their presumed deaths. Based in their decades-old fortress of &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, these survivors were joined by the armies of Stormwind and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Among these remnants was the heroic human, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, who grieved heavily when he heard of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;fate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and swore to someday return to restore his native &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; to its former glory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWith the freeing of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; from the grasp of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; by the heroic efforts of many Alliance heroes, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was returned to his rightful throne and restored order to his lands. Today, King Wrynn oversees Stormwind with support from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. The newly found peace humanity had found would not last long. Shortly after the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; was halted at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, an old and familiar human threat emerged. Spreading its horrific plague once again through contaminated grain, the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, led by the tyrant &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, returned its sights to humanity, planting infected crates in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and letting it be shipped throughout Azeroth. This renewed &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; culminated in attacks on the human villages of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually, in a daring attack on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; itself. The time to avenge the fallen human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had arrived.\nKnowing that the threat of the Scourge was as real as it was in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the human leaders &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; led an assault against the frozen &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; of the Scourge. Alliance &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; attacked the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; from Borean Tundra and Howling Fjord, eventually carving a path to Angrathar the Wrath Gate and crippling the Scourge necropolis of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. Tragedy struck in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; however. As the Alliance commander, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, taunted the traitor &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, a group of militant &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; appeared overhead, led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, and launched barrels of Forsaken &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; on the assembled Alliance and Horde armies, resulting in the apparent death of Bolvar Fordragon and the painful deaths of hundreds of humans.\nEnraged over this apparent betrayal, Varian Wrynn sent Jaina Proudmoore to elicit an explanation from the Horde. In a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina learned of an uprising in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Horde presence had been expelled by a group of rogue Forsaken led by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and the rogue Grand Apothecary Putress. Seeing an opportunity to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance and to bring Putress to justice, Varian Wrynn launched a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;full assault&lt;/a&gt; on the Undercity. Alliance forces battled to the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt; and beheaded Putress. However, at the same time, Varian Wrynn, in grief over the loss of Bolvar Fordragon, enraged by proof of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s sinister schemes, and the status of the once glorious capital of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, lashed out at Thrall and exchanged blows with him before being teleported back to Stormwind by Jaina Proudmoore.\nMeanwhile, Tirion Fordring and Rhonin established their own presences in Northrend, with the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; fighting the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. Rhonin and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; established a presence in &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, levitating the entire city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to fight in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina Proudmoore, seeking to confront her former lover &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, led her own assault on Icecrown Citadel through the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Argent Crusade breached &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and, along with its &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, took the fight to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; itself, and after a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;long battle&lt;/a&gt;, managed to shatter &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and kill Arthas. Humans, after losing so much to the Scourge, stood triumphant against the Lich King.\nHowever, as Arthas died, the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; appeared and warned Tirion that although Arthas is dead, someone must take on the role of Lich King, to keep the undead throngs left behind in check. As Tirion contemplated taking the role on himself, he was interrupted by the heavily deformed and thought dead &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, who had in fact been taken prisoner by the Lich King after the Battle of Angrathar. At Bolvar's insistence, Tirion Fordring crowned Bolvar Fordragon the new Lich King. As Bolvar's voice changed into that of the Lich King, he warned Tirion and his allies to leave, and to never return.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough the proud humans of Stormwind led the Alliance to victory over the dreaded Lich King, the immense cost of the Northrend campaign proved to be unexpected. Some humans in Stormwind have been taxed to the point of bankruptcy. Many found themselves out of work and without homes, particularly after the bold attack on Stormwind City by the corrupted Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. These throngs of homeless congregated to Westfall, where they would contribute to the resurgence of a new &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, the human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, isolated since the Third War by the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, was suddenly thrust into the wider world of Azeroth when the terrible &lt;a href=\"shattering\"&gt;cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that sundered the world shattered their thought to be impenetrable wall. To add to this grief, the kingdom suffered from a mysterious curse shortly after sealing themselves off, that turned normal humans into ferocious and feral &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt;. This, combined with an unexpected &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; by the Forsaken, forced the humans of Gilneas back into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argent Crusade has resumed its work in eradicating the now weakened &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence in Lordaeron, taking control of most of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and working alongside their &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; allies to retake the land from the undead. The humans of the Alliance, thanks to manipulations from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the ambitions of the new Horde warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, are now involved in a renewed conflict with their perennial enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Humans are currently stationed most prominently in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, striking at the heartland of the Horde, and in Gilneas, where the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; fights to retake Lordaeron from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt; scenario, which leads the game into \"\", &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, outraged at this matter, completely devote themselves into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. During the conflict, the ancient continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was discovered. As Alliance and Horde raced to claim the riches of the new land for themselves, their presence awakened ancient evils \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the course of the war, it was discovered that Warchief Hellscream had dabbled in harnessing the sha to fuel his war machine. The discovery of the complicity of some members of the Sunreavers led to the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, in which the magocracy realigned itself with the Alliance. Through the &lt;a href=\"Trials%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Trials of the High King&lt;/a&gt;, Varian Wrynn cemented the hold of humanity over the Alliance, strengthening the ties between its races while the Horde under Garrosh Hellscream splintered in &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and dissent. When Hellscream in his reckless drive unearthed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; and befouled the sacred &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance led an attack together with the Horde rebels to bring the Warchief to justice. Recognizing that some members of the Horde had preserved their honor, Varian spared the Horde from dismantling.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWhen Garrosh Hellscream escaped his sentence with the aid of the renegade &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, he fled into an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; on Draenor. Bringing the orcs new technologies, he was instrumental in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which soon spilled through the Dark Portal and laid waste to &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wizard &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; would return to lead the operations of both Alliance and Horde against the Iron Horde. Stormwind would send their own heroes through the Dark Portal to keep Azeroth safe from another orcish invasion, after &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; had convinced Varian of the necessity by &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20War\"&gt;detailing the strengths&lt;/a&gt; of the warlords leading the Iron Horde. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; established a &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, but was backstabbed by his subordinate &lt;a href=\"Ephial\"&gt;Ephial&lt;/a&gt;. Another base was constructed at &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, from which conflict against the Horde over the possession of artifacts was waged.\nHumans, along with the rest of the Alliance, aided the free people of Draenor in resisting the Iron Horde and managed to defeat and his demonic masters before they could corrupt this Draenor as they had the one in the prime timeline. However, the danger for Azeroth was not averted.\nLegion.\nAfter his failure on Draenor, Gul'dan was brought into present-day Azeroth and continued his plan to unleash the Burning Legion again. Hunted by Khadgar, he reached the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, where he unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; and created a large portal that allowed the Legion to launch its largest invasion of Azeroth since the War of the Ancients. Khadgar flew to Stormwind to deliver warnings and mobilize Azeroth's defenders again.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, humanity would lose two of its greatest heroes: Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was taken captive and eventually perished, and Varian Wrynn was executed by Gul'dan while defending the retreat of his forces after the Horde had pulled back their forces after many losses. Anduin Wrynn was crowned as the new &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; and forced to lead the Alliance into war. Meanwhile, Dalaran again assumed neutrality due to Khadgar's urgings, causing Jaina to leave the Council of Six in disgust. Anduin would eventually travel to &lt;a href=\"Wrynnfall\"&gt;Wrynnfall&lt;/a&gt; to reflect upon his new role, where he took up his father's blade.\nThe Legion's forces were not confined to the battlefield. A demonic infiltrator, the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, had impersonated &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and taken control of the and used it to incite Anduin against the Horde. Cultists from Duskwood known as the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; attempted to strike against Stormwind's authority. Against these threats rose different &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s that kept these threats contained. The combined efforts of these groups lead to the final defeat of the Legion and the imprisonment of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Titan\"&gt;Dark Titan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a final act of spite, Sargeras had plunged his sword into &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. As Anduin Wrynn held a memorial speech at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the SI:7 informed him of Horde activity near the wound and of a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;strange metal&lt;/a&gt; that had emerged from the ground.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn response to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance retaliated against the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The two conflicts have reignited the war between the Alliance and Horde, as they &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;battled for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; proliferating from their dying world.\nAfter discovering the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was planning to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; into their ranks, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; knew it would need new allies to match the Horde's strength. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; proposed she head a diplomatic mission to recruit her estranged homeland, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, back into the Alliance. Kul Tiras' powerful navy would be a formidable asset to the Alliance that could even the playing field, but the Alliance needed to prove its worth to Kul Tiras' ruling houses before it gains the maritime nation's allegiance. Kul Tiras has degenerated severely in contemporary times; it is plagued with crime, piracy, corruption, a missing &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drust%20incursion\"&gt;Drust incursion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; radicalization of the &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s, a burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, and to compound further their problems, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had recently raided &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt; and invaded &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reconciling the estranged &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore family&lt;/a&gt; and stabilizing Kul Tiras' troubled territories, the Alliance had once again regained the Kul Tirans' trust and unified the maritime nation. &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; secretly plotted to usurp &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s rule over the island kingdom, but her attempt was ultimately thwarted by Alliance adventurers. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s success in foiling &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;'s coup d'\u00e9tat and recovering Kul Tiras' missing fleet had also restored faith in Proudmoore leadership and she was subsequently named &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; for her accomplishments. Faced with the threat of the Horde, Kul Tiras rejoined the Alliance. The Kul Tirans then retaliated against the Horde by joining the Alliance during their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;invasion of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe western region of &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; becomes a &lt;a href=\"warfront\"&gt;warfront&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as they &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;fight over Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman nations.\nHumanity has generally been controlled by seven powerful kingdoms, each with their own sphere of influence. All seven city-states were descended from the ancient nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, however, a series of devastating wars have plagued humanity, resulting in the end of several kingdoms and the creation of a new one, &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the only human state in Kalimdor.\nAfter the end of the Third War, Alliance forces under Jaina Proudmoore sailed to southeastern Kalimdor. They founded a stronghold called Theramore, a small, walled city on a rocky isle east of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby mainland fall under human control and border &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs' new homeland, to the north. Humans and orcs maintained a tentative peace along their borders, but clashes were common.\nLordaeron still boasted several human settlements even after the Third War, but it has diminished to a fraction of the size and power that it once was. Hillsbrad and a few settlements in Silverpine Forest once held out, as did a sizeable Scarlet Crusade presence. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; however, the Forsaken has conquered most of these remaining settlements, and the Scarlets have fallen into decline. The humans in the neutral &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; - many of whom originated from the former Lordaeron nation - have solidified their presence in the recovering Plaguelands. The Kingdoms of Alterac and Stromgarde are still in ruins, but both have different factions of humans trying to reclaim their respective kingdoms. Meanwhile, only a fraction of the Gilnean population are considered humans as most others are afflicted with the Worgen Curse, or otherwise permanently killed or raised as Forsaken. The status of humans in Kul Tiras is yet to be seen.\nStormwind, in the southern continent of Azeroth, suffered in the First and Second Wars but remained relatively untouched in the Third. Stormwind has been rebuilt and stands larger and better defended than before. Though the Scourge did not make itself felt in Stormwind, the kingdom faces its own enemies, both from without and within. Nevertheless, currently, Stormwind is humanity's strongest nation and a symbol of reclamation and renewal.\nAbout human populations living outside of the Seven Kingdoms:\nAppearance.\nHumans come from many backgrounds and show great physical variety among all the races. Humans' skin ranges from dark to light and may have tones of other colors. Their eyes are blue, brown, green, gray, or hazel. Human hair is brown, black, blond, or red. Men often grow short beards and women commonly wear their hair long. Female humans are on average 5'8\" tall while males usually reach a height of about 6'1\", however, some males do reach heights of 6'6\".\nThe physique of humans is more muscular and sturdy than of elves, but much more slender than that of dwarves. The color and hue of human skin vary, ranging from a fair pink, to tanned, to a very dark brown. Hair becomes gray or white with sickness or age. Human eyes have been known to glow like those of the naturally magical elves if he or she is wielding powerful magic.\nCulture.\nHumans seem to be a naturally proud and ambitious race. The humans of Azeroth have a very strong sense of triumphalism and have been known to be arrogant, overzealous, or vainglorious. Humans have also regularly displayed noble and altruistic attitudes and actions. These qualities have led to human society producing notable heroic and villainous figures in recent history.\nMost humans take comfort in having an orderly and just society. This is derived from their tales of a great leader named &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. The story of Tyr slipped into memory long ago, when the young race of humans struggled to survive using the limited supplies provided to them by the &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt; who had abandoned them. They occasionally took to gathering around a fire whilst trying to read from scrolls telling of ancient heroes and leaders \u2013 tales from the civilization that had cast these creatures out. One of these scrolls spoke of a great leader, a paragon of order and justice, who sacrificed his right hand in a fight against an unfathomable evil. Although it was within this hero's power to fix his hand after the fighting had ended, the hero instead chose to replace it with a closed fist made of the purest silver. In this way, the hero impressed upon those who followed him that true order and justice can only be accomplished through personal sacrifice.\nUpon experiencing the world through the eyes of the human &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20Wine\"&gt;memory wine&lt;/a&gt; draught, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was shocked at how relatively weak and fragile human bodies are compared to those of trolls. He reflected that humans know death can come quickly, yet they fight, explore, and show courage nonetheless, as if mortality is such a well-known companion that they can embrace it easily. He also noted that many humans have steel in them that allow them to recover from deep injures and fight hard against death.\nHumans prefer to live in villages, towns, and cities. Few humans understand the reverence of nature the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; possess, and the most rural or rugged lifestyle a human has shown to possess is that of a farmer, bandit, or soldier. Human cities are extremely large, bustling, and lively. Outside city walls, in the countryside, the human &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;ry provides basic resources to the rest of the kingdom; the peasant farms, mines, and chops wood. In the city, merchants trade goods while craftsmen practice and perform their trades and businessmen provide services. At the top of the social hierarchy are the nobility, who sit within their &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s, making important political decisions on the running of the kingdom.\nDespite the desire for order that generally exists among humans, some groups do deviate from this cultural trait and possess no loyalties toward their established political leaders. This is especially true in times of uncertainty for humans. Before the Third War, there were humans in the Northern lands of Lordaeron that were swayed into joining the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Banditry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Pirates\"&gt;sea piracy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; amongst humans has been on the rise recently.\nHumans have a relatively short lifespan, less than the majority of the other races on Azeroth. Around the age 12, they reach the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Age of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, often accompanied by a celebration.\nHumans are also experienced and skilled sailors, with the nation of Kul Tiras being the greatest naval power of Azeroth, only rivaled by the Zandalari Empire, while both Stormwind and the now defunct kingdom of Lordaeron having their own powerful fleets. Also many pirates in Azeroth are humans. \nThe human state of Stormwind is the leader of the Alliance. Formerly it was the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, until its destruction at the hands of the Undead Scourge. Stormwind is the largest remaining bastion of human population and strength in Azeroth.\nHumans are seen to be filled with unchecked passion and ambition. Their desire for power and knowledge has allowed for some of the greatest &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s to be human. The deep inner fire and emotions that brew within them have allowed many humans to master the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; in ways unimaginable, leading the humans to establish the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; as well as what are regarded as the most pious orders ever seen on Azeroth.\nLike most other races, humans considered &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s as &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;pariahs&lt;/a&gt;. As they must operate in the shadows of polite society, they practice their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; within hidden enclaves, so that they can escape the prejudice of the public. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Lamb\"&gt;Slaughtered Lamb&lt;/a&gt;'s basement and catacombs notably serve as host to the warlock community of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. They also do not hesitate to assassinate those who would try to reveal their hiding place and activities to the public.\nRelations.\nEven more than sheer tenacity, the human race's true strength lies in its willingness and ability to look past its own interests, see others' point of view, and seek diplomatic solutions. This has enabled the humans to form lasting alliances with other races.\nHumans and the Alliance.\nHumans began the Alliance, and it could not exist without them. \nHumans' closest and most natural allies are the dwarves of Ironforge with who they have had a good relationship ever since the days of the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Both have long shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling. The alliance between human nations and Ironforge was deepened during the Second War when the Alliance of Lordaeron liberated the dwarves from the Old Horde, which prompted the dwarves to express that they owed a debt that could never be repaid and to pledge their unwavering allegiance to the alliance, with them strengthening the Alliance with their forces and technological inventions. This bond only strengthened since the dwarves' latest discoveries have energized their archaeological efforts.\nHumans also have a friendly bond with the Wildhammer Dwarves ever since the Second War, having saved them from the Orcs which prompted the grateful dwarves to join the Alliance of Lordaeron and constantly support their allies with their gryphon riders.\nWhile they tend to find the gnomes strange, humans also greatly respect gnomish technological prowess as well as the gnomes' steadfast loyalty to the Alliance. Many humans have even come to lend their aid to the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;gnomes&lt;/a&gt; in their continuing fight for &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Elves are a source of mystery and frustration - especially the exotic night elves, with whom they are allied. Despite this, humans respect the night elves' endeavors to restore and preserve the natural beauty of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; especially the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to restore the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to their original states. Humans respect the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s mastery and reverence of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. As with the night elves, humans also respect their continuing defiance of their common enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Humans are still wary of &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; because of their savage and brutal reputation but recognize them as allies and treat them with the same respect as any other ally.\nRelations with the Horde.\nHumans first came in contact with the orcs during the First War, when the orcish Horde invaded Azeroth and attacked the kingdom of Stormwind, eventually destroying it and creating a great enmity and feud between humans and orcs that continues today. While the Old Horde has been defeated and has changed its ways, with several human leaders having made peace or even befriended orcs such as Jaina Proudmoore, the great majority of humanity still have a strong distrust of and grudge against orcs for the atrocities they committed toward them. Humans have also an old enmity with trolls due to the many wars the two races have had with each other ever since the birth of the Arathor Empire, people of Stromgarde in particular have a strong feud with the Amani Trolls. \nInteracial relationships.\nHumans have been known to rarely intermarry with other races, most notably with high elves. The first &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, was a &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;. The human paladin &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; married the elven ranger &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, producing one son, &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, was the husband of Alleria's sister &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; and together had twin boys, &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt;. Less famously, a human woman now named &lt;a href=\"Tamara%20Wobblesprocket\"&gt;Tamara Wobblesprocket&lt;/a&gt; married a gnome.\nFaith.\nHumans revere the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, who became a central part of all civilized human society, as their primary &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; and a staple of worship, respect, and honor. The &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; is the religious institution at the head of this predominant human religion, and plays a significant role in all human societies.\nIts members are dedicated to create a world of honor and justice, striving to aid others and be good in all actions. By embodying the tenets of their religion, the Church's skilled clergy can wield &lt;a href=\"holy%20magic\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt; called the Light.\nThrough the centuries, the Church constructed &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s, shrines, and &lt;a href=\"Church\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt; in the far-flung human lands as places of &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;worship&lt;/a&gt;, with a hierarchy of religious leaders to oversee its devoted followers. These monuments stand in their cities, where their priests preside over followers, they heal and restore in times of peace, soothe the weary, protect in times of war, and crusade against what they consider evil.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Humans have an order of holy warriors, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, who follow the Holy Light and crush evil and chaotic beings in its name. As the martial branch of the Church, they seek to be an example of the Light's teachings as well as enforce the laws, protecting the weak and vanquishing the evil.\nBefore Arathor and the rise of the Holy Light, the ancient human tribes had primitive nature-based religions with some common ties to &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, though they were not druids themselves. Today, only the &lt;a href=\"harvest-witch\"&gt;harvest-witch&lt;/a&gt;es of Gilneas remain of this old religion, as Gilneas's relative isolation from the other kingdoms has kept it going. The powerful and unyielding &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallion%20Bridle\"&gt;white stallion&lt;/a&gt; features heavily in the myths of ancient human tribes.\nMost people on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; look to the seas for guidance the same way others look to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt; have a much deeper connection with the water. They worship the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;. Like Gilneas, Kul Tiras also has druids.\nLanguage.\nHumans speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nHumans have several wise sayings:\nThey also have the following nursery rhymes:\nA very old lullaby sung to children goes as follows:\nMagic and technology.\nHumans can be some of the most highly skilled and adaptable magic-users. Any list of the most powerful mages in history will be dominated by humans. Their mastery of these arts are rivaled on Azeroth perhaps only by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Humans are most known for their &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; magic. These magics are used to heal and create in times of peace, and to harm and destroy in times of war.\nHumans have a relatively good understanding of science and technology. However, this understanding does not come close to that of their dwarven and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; allies. The efforts of human engineers are laughable when compared to those of the dwarves' and gnomes'. These races have provided their advanced artillery, metalworking, and engineering skills to the Alliance during times of war. These are considerable benefits, including the creation and operation of powered &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; is a gnome-built mechanical wonder that serves as a speedy underground transportation device between Ironforge and Stormwind.\nThe kingdom of Gilneas in particular has become strongly industrialised and technologically advanced under the impulsive of its previous king Archibald Greymane, with the the kingdom having many factories, and Gilnean forces heavily use firearms such as cannons, riffles, and guns more than any other human nation. \nEven so, humans are a young race, and thus highly versatile, mastering the arts of combat, craftsmanship, and magic with stunning efficiency. Humans can become master craftsmen and have adopted simple yet effective tools of wars such as the &lt;a href=\"Human%20cannon\"&gt;Human cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Battering%20ram\"&gt;Battering ram&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20tower\"&gt;Siege tower&lt;/a&gt;s to their arsenal.\nHumans have a great deal of respect for both the dwarves and gnomes for these accomplishments and are eternally grateful for their contributions to the Alliance. Humans, for the most part, do not seem to be particularly aware of nor concerned about the harms the advancement of civilization and technology (as well as the use of arcane magic) may bring upon nature and the world. However, humans respect the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and their desire to preserve their sacred forests and lands in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman architecture is less pleasing to the eye than elven architecture, utilizing straight angles and simple materials such as wood, stone, and mortar. However, human structures are much more resistant to damage than elven or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; structures. Human structures are not nearly as strong as dwarven structures or as advanced as gnomish architecture, but they are much easier to build, and human forts and towns can be built relatively quickly. Human &lt;a href=\"Peasant\"&gt;Peasant&lt;/a&gt;s have been the architects of much of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s fortifications throughout the course of the Alliance's history. They've been known to be quite efficient in building and construction when they organize themselves to collaborate on a singular task. Because of these skilled craftsmen, Alliance bases can be expanded in a relatively short amount of time.\nWarfare.\nThe armies of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; are a force to be reckoned with. Well-trained &lt;a href=\"footmen\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; march to battle in &lt;a href=\"plate%20armor\"&gt;plate armor&lt;/a&gt; with kite shields and broadswords, while courageous &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s covered in heavy plate mail ride headlong into battle atop of their powerful equine steeds, wielding mighty lances and swords. Behind the humans come their allies: cunning elven &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s and dwarven &lt;a href=\"Rifleman\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt; provide ranged support, human and gnomish (and in the past, though there are still some left, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s blast their enemies with magic and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s use their divine magic to heal and aid wounded allies. Perhaps the most fearsome foe to evil and the enemies of humankind on the battlefield are the mighty &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, considered by many to be the champions of the human Alliance. These fearsome knights bring justice to their enemies and aid to their allies with a combination of healing and aura magics and mastery with giant warhammers and massive runeblades.\nHuman bases are very difficult to penetrate. The walls of their strongholds are tall and tough, and from their &lt;a href=\"Scout%20tower\"&gt;watchtowers&lt;/a&gt; they can see enemies approach from far away, attacking them with siege weapons and archers while they advance. Behind the walls, an enemy would expect to meet ranks of dismounted knights and footmen. During the Second War, the Horde lost many of its warriors laying siege to Capital City, many of them killed by the city's &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e and archers.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nHumans are among the oldest races on Azeroth, and their valor, optimism, and versatility have led them to build some of the world's greatest kingdoms, dominating the continents of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"life%20spans\"&gt;life spans&lt;/a&gt; generally shorter than the other races, humans strive all the harder to achieve great heights in empire building, exploration, and magical study. Their aggressive and inquisitive nature led the human nations to become active and influential in the world. Such was the case prior to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' original invasion through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Human kingdoms suffered greatly in the three wars against forces of the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion's&lt;/a&gt; creating, &lt;a href=\"The%20Horde\"&gt;The Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the first two, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge\"&gt;The Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the third. \nMany humans fell in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind battered yet unbowed survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the sorceress &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. This group settled on the wild continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a former human homeland, is decimated - a battlefield for &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and other creatures. The few humans who remain in Lordaeron struggle to keep their small settlements free of the villainy that boils around them. Stormwind, the first to feel the orcs' rage, fares better and is the most powerful human nation remaining. Still, Stormwind is far from safe, and enemies persistently attack it. \nHumans value virtue, honor, and courage, though, like all races, they also pursue power and wealth. Humans have spent generations battling dark forces and have lost some of their greatest kingdoms to them. This loss embitters humans, and they have a view of diplomacy that does not favor negotiations. Aided by belief in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, humans have fought hard and endured much during the wars against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Despite all their tragedies, humans show hardiness and bravery and are thoroughly committed to building strong societies, reinforcing their kingdoms, and reclaiming their nations. Years of war have tempered human resolve, tempering them and giving them a determined nature.\nHistory.\nBetween the finding of magic from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; (approximately 14,000-10,000 years ago) humans that were called humans (and not &lt;a href=\"Azotha\"&gt;Azotha&lt;/a&gt; or vrykul) appeared. They were nearly as savage as their foes among the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and both groups wandered the land battling each other while trying to plant the seeds of their cultures. The trolls actively hunted these humans. These nascent humans saw the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; as shadowy figures with god-like powers. Centuries before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the bear &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;, befriended many generations of humans and &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; and were beloved in return.\nWhen the night elves fought the demons during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; in their lands, the humans and trolls retreated deep into the wild. Groups of endangered humans or night elves were guided away from the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; disguised in mortal form.\nAfter the Sundering, the human tribes teetered for thousands of years on the brink of extinction as their numbers were winnowed by an increased struggle for resources. They persevered, exploring the continents in search of game, wood, and refuge. These years were nearly the race's last, as it eked out sustenance from the ashes and the aftermath of the destruction until the Sun returned. The surviving tribes of humans sent out intrepid bands to explore the reborn world and to find their long-lost brethren. Slowly, trade routes were established across the revitalized world. These early humans may have had access to divine spells through worship of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; or early cults that would become the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThey are old at about 55 years of age, and at 70 years they are venerable, with a maximum age between 72\u2013110 years. Because of this, humanity strives to make the most out of what it has and to build legacies. This has led to the formation of different nations and orders across many lands and to the forging of alliances not only between each other, but with other races, and seeking to do whatever is necessary to protect and secure their nations so future generations can live peacefully and safely.\nHumans and the Horde.\nHumans and orcs joined forces to face the Burning Legion several years ago, but friction again returned once they dispatched the demonic threat. Although the Alliance and Horde leaders bear a healthy respect for each other, old racial hatreds are commonplace. Humans also look upon tauren with suspicion, due to the ties tauren have established with orcs. Humans dislike and distrust jungle trolls and, to an even greater extent, Forsaken.\nLanguages.\nThey may know many other languages, however, as they deal with many different creatures.\nNames.\nHuman parents grant a child its given name at birth, while its family name has a long history and usually speaks something of its bearer's ancestry. Some humans change their family names to emphasize their own accomplishments."}

Humanoids include most socially apt creatures that show some form of self-awareness and intelligence. It should be noted that humanoids encompass both humans and beings that are roughly similar to humans. This does not mean that all humanoids are related to humans.\nPlayers and NPCs of playable races are classified as humanoids. The playable undead race (&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;) count as humanoids in \"World of Warcraft\" in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat, which allows them to be subject to spells and effects that they otherwise would not be subject to as an undead. This also prevents them from being affected by items that give +attack power to undead and prevents them from being subject to abilities like &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt;. This is for gameplay purposes, and only in World of Warcraft, according to published lore in other sources, they are affected the same way as any other undead.\nIn the RPG.\nHumanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They are usually small to medium in size. Some humanoids are monstrous humanoids. Monstrous humanoids are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or animal-like features. They often have magical abilities as well."}

He can be found as the first boss of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underbog\"&gt;The Underbog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has been tending a very special plant, known as the &lt;a href=\"Underspore\"&gt;Underspore&lt;/a&gt;, to perfection for millennia.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Unlike his ally, &lt;a href=\"Quagmirran\"&gt;Quagmirran&lt;/a&gt;, the great fungal giant Hungarfen has thus far eluded enslavement by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, he remains aggressive to all outsiders who tread into the deepest caverns of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. Oblivious to the naga's machinations in other parts of the region, Hungarfen spends much of his time tending the Underspore, an ancient plant said to be his most prized possession.\"\nSide Note.\nOpening the Underspore frond will not aggro Hungarfen, through when you finished opening it he will. This means that stealth running to it is possible.\nStrategies.\nAll party members must keep an eye out for Underbog Mushrooms and move away from them, including the tank!!! For the first 80% this is a basic tank and spank fight, With the exception that the tank must move Hungarfen around to avoid the Underbog Mushrooms. The Mushrooms will spawn through out the fight, make sure to stay alert and move when one is near you. The easiest way to find and move away from the mushrooms is to use the V key-binding to display health bars. You'll often see the health bar of the mushroom before you see the mushroom itself and can move away. This is especially helpful for the tank who may not be able to see mushrooms spawning behind Hungarfen's legs.\nWhen he hits 20% he will begin using Foul Spores. ALL party members, including the tank, should move away from Hungarfen so no one takes damage from the AoE, and he doesn't heal himself. (He heals based on the damage he does to nearby party members, so back off and burn) Burn him down as fast as possible, at roughly 10% or after a certain time, he releases from Foul Spores. Usually runs right to the tank, just continue to avoid the Underbog Mushrooms until he is dead.\nNOTE: The two Bog Giants aren't linked to Hungarfen, but one giant will aggro the other when pulled. Be prepared to a double tank or off-tank. You can also treat one of them the same as Drakkisath in UBRS, where a hunter or frost mage kites one of the Bog Giants away from the party (jumping off the cliff forces the giant to take the long road to follow you). They move very slowly and are easy to kite as long as you produce enough aggro at the beginning with a fireball/distracting shot to compensate for healing on the first one. After the first giant is killed either use iceblock or feign death to have him go back to the group. A weak group can simply wipe on the second giant and come back to kill him alone, as the first giant does not respawn.\nHeroic.\nOn heroic mode, he hits the tank for around 2,200 per melee attack. The Mushrooms also spawn at an increased rate in bursts, sometimes at a rate of 1 per second for around 15 seconds, then slowing down to the normal mushroom spawn rate. Turning on enemy nameplates can assist you in spotting them, as the nameplate will show up long before the mushroom becomes visible. The Foul Spores portion is identical to normal mode.\nTo avoid all the mushrooms, it is a good idea that ranged DPS and healer stays close to each other, slowly moving in a circle around the boss.\nThat way, you will continuously move into areas clear of mushrooms.\nThe Bog Giant pull is very tough on heroic mode. Either kite one away or maximize DPS to eliminate one before the stacking \"grow\" buff (15% damage increase, stackable, reapplies around once every 20 seconds) grows unmanageable. Kiting works similarly to normal mode, but the kiter must gain enough threat to ensure that the kited giant does not switch aggro to the healer, who will be generating more threat from larger heals.\nThe Bog Giants are immune to all forms of Crowd Control and Snares (ice trap, etc).\nIt is apparently possible to clear a few of the elite fish in the water. The kiter then can jump in the water and the giant will wait a while, 'looking' at the puller before it comes back.\nThe major difficulty is getting enough aggro on the puller since the heals *WILL* pull the aggro off the kiter unless he/she reapplies it.\nAnother method: Have your tank kite Hungarfen down the ramp, and into the already cleared area, constantly moving him, causing the mushrooms to spawn as you go. This leaves a trail of useless mushrooms, allowing you to concentrate solely on Hungarfen without truly having to worry about mushroom explosions. Keep him moving, and you should have very little trouble downing this boss.\n[THoL]\nAlternative method for dealing with the Bog Giant guardians to Hungarfen. If you have a hunter in your party have them place their pet next to the water in front of the ramp up to Hungarfen. Properly positioned at max range, the hunter can misdirect one of the Bog Giants to the pet, buying the rest of the group an extra 15 seconds or so to nuke the other Bog Giant. The pet will die in 2 or 3 hits max, unless healer wants to try and heal it as well but to be honest they are better concentrating on the tank. When the pet is dead the Bog Giant makes its way back up to the party so keep your eyes open for the raid mark or better still have track giants active so that you can see it coming. After that the boss fight is relatively straight forward, just make sure everyone circles in the same direction otherwise you'll be running into the mushrooms spawned at the feet of the people moving in the opposite direction.

With drought afflicting the Shadowlands, it is no surprise that the hungriest and most dangerous of the devourers is drawn to the abundant store of anima here in the depths of Castle Nathria.\"\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires 2 tanks, but can be done with more with alternate strategies. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; effects can be used immediately. The Hungering Destroyer should be tanked at the far edge of the room, as the raid will need to move far away from the boss quickly during the Consume cast. Melee DPS and Ranged DPS/Healers should be stacked loosely in 2 groups behind the boss, prepared to move mechanics out of the raid or stack up at a moment's notice.\nTanks: Tanks should swap regularly and quickly because of the boss' Growing Hunger stacks. Each consecutive melee attack against a tank will give the boss a stacking 8% damage buff that resets when the boss hits a new target. With regular taunting, this buff should never go above 7 stacks. In addition, the boss will regularly strike tanks with Overwhelm, which hits very hard and should be ready to mitigate it. Being hit by Overwhelm while the boss has high Growing Hunger stacks can very easily kill a tank. In emergencies, a DPS can taunt the boss to get rid of the Growing Hunger stacks, though this ideally should never happen.\nGeneral abiliites: The boss will regularly hit the raid with Desolate, dealing unavoidable raid-wide damage which needs to be healed through. Once he reaches 0% energy, he will also cast Consume, a 6-second cast where the boss will leech health from all nearby players while a suction effect pulls them towards him. This damage/leech is reduced by distance, so the players must be ready to run to the other side of the room when the boss is about to cast this ability.\nThe most notable ability of this encounter is the Gluttonous Miasma. This will debuff several players with a circle around them. If another player is within the circle, their health will be leeched into the debuffed player. However, since the debuff blocks all other healing done and slowly ticks damage onto the player, this leech is the only way to survive. You generally want at least 2, ideally 3, players in the circle to ensure the debuffed player's health is topped up so that they can survive the Desolate, Expunge, and Consume casts.\nThe Expunge ability will create circles around all raid members that will explode and deal damage to anyone else in the radius. Simply spread out to avoid it. Note that the size of the circle increases based on the amount of missing health the player has, meaning that healers should ideally top the raid up prior to this cast. DPS and healers should also stay away from the tanks, as the constant damage pressure they are under will likely result in very large circles.\nLast to note is the Volatile Ejection. This ability marks several players, causing them to grow large and blue, and after a few seconds, fires a beam at their location which strikes them and everyone in-front and behind them. As the raid should be directly behind the boss, the sides of the raid should be clear at all times to allow those targeted by Ejection to move out to the side to safely drop the beam. If a beam is not successfully dealt with, everyone who is struck will have a debuff that increases the damage they take by Volatile Ejection by 500%, which will kill without an immunity. While the beam will never target a player who was previously targeted, if the targeted player accidentally hits other players, \"those\" players can potentially be targeted next and killed by the beam. The raid must be paying attention to ensure this ability is dealt with properly, as one stray beam into the raid can potentially spell a wipe if multiple healers happen to be targeted next.\nSo long as the healers are well-geared and the raid has a thorough understanding of the fight's movement mechanics, this fight can be won relatively easily.\nHeroic: On Heroic, the only major change is that Expunge now drops orbs that explode and deal a burst of damage to the player that touches them. This is meant to act as a soft enrage timer, as without immunities the room will become too crowded and the raid won't have enough room to deal with mechanics. However, so long as the DPS is good and the raid once again understands the positioning requirements, the raid should be able to finish the boss before the room becomes a problem. Should the room become too full, a hunter's &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Turtle\"&gt;Aspect of the Turtle&lt;/a&gt; can be used to help clear, though this typically only a temporary solution if the DPS players damage is not high enough.\nAlternate Strategy: Some raids have found that Heroic progression is easier if they bring 4 tanks and 4 healers instead. Since the boss' enrage timer is quite generous, less DPS is typically not a problem. Two tanks will deal with the boss as normal. The third tank uses their large health pool to give HP to those afflicted by the Gluttonous Miasma, helping the healers a great deal. The fourth tank runs around the room after Expunge and gets rid of all the orbs, effectively nullifying Heroic mode's most stressful mechanic."}

Hunters can even call &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Beast\"&gt;wild beasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Murder%20of%20Crows\"&gt;flocks of birds&lt;/a&gt; to assail their enemies, and in times of great need can summon a &lt;a href=\"Stampede%20%28hunter%20talent%29\"&gt;Stampede (hunter talent)&lt;/a&gt; of faithful friends to their aid. Hunters do not use their pets only to deal ferocious damage to their foes, but can also draw strength and healing from their bond, regaining focus and inspiring their companions to surprising new heights. The powerful and intelligent animals commanded by hunters are themselves capable of a huge range of skilful and breath-taking moves, with each type of pet boasting its own selection of &lt;a href=\"pet%20abilities\"&gt;special abilities&lt;/a&gt;. Hunters are also capable of using their connection to the &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; of various animals to empower themselves and their allies, augmenting their abilities according to the needs of the situation.\nHunters start wearing &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; and advance to &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt; later on. They use &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt; and cunning to stay out of reach of melee attackers, commanding their pets to attack while they launch devastating volleys from afar. Hunters are at a disadvantage when their foes close in, and may use an array of traps and &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s to slow and disorient attackers who threaten to draw too close for comfort. Hunters can also send their pets to taunt and distract enemies, overwhelming targets with a snarling attacker that demands their full attention, leaving them too busy to notice the deadly shot being &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;carefully aimed&lt;/a&gt; at them. \nHunters expend &lt;a href=\"focus\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; for their most powerful abilities, while many others have no cost. Focus is capped at 100 (120 for &lt;a href=\"%23Beast%20Mastery\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; hunters) and regenerates slowly, but can also be regained through the use of numerous abilities. Hunter pets also use focus to fuel their most powerful attacks.\nThe hunter is a &lt;a href=\"pure%20class\"&gt;pure&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; class, meaning that all its &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s focus primarily on dealing damage. However, each type of hunter has its own strengths and priorities: &lt;a href=\"%23Beast%20Mastery\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; hunters are masters of the wild boasting a powerful synergy with their companions, bringing numerous enhancements to both their own and their pets' abilities; &lt;a href=\"%23Marksmanship\"&gt;Marksmanship&lt;/a&gt; hunters are skilled sharpshooters, focusing on defeating opponents through unique and additionally empowered ranged attacks; &lt;a href=\"%23Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; hunters are adaptive rangers who can engage enemies effectively at any distance, most effectively when up close.\nHunters are perhaps the most involved companion class of all. Hunters can track, tame, name and train a huge range of animals throughout the world, with a number of special rare beasts existing solely for hunters to discover, hidden from the eyes of any other class. Hunters will rarely find themselves fighting alone, and can count on the presence of their trusty companions at their side. The combination of hunters' powerful ranged damage capabilities and their pets' aggro management makes hunters an excellent soloing class, essentially a two-man team capable of tackling enemies far beyond the abilities of many other classes. A potent damage dealer with enviable abilities in &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, the hunter is a class that is easy to learn, but difficult to master.\nClass overview.\nGame guide.\n\"From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. As masters of their environment, hunters are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies. These expert marksmen drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow, crossbow or rifle. With the ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, hunters can unleash a flurry of blows against anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into close combat with them.\"\n\"The art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\" Hunters know the uncharted places of the world. Gifted with a deep empathy for all life, they have an uncanny knack for befriending wild animals and taming them as pets. In addition, hunters can use their finely honed senses to become master trackers. Wherever hunters go, they fight back the ravages of sickness, exploitation, and industrialization. \"\nClassic guide.\n\"Drawn by the call of the wild, Hunters are survival experts whose skills are aided by their finesse with ranged weapons and kinship with fierce beasts.\"\nBackground.\nThe hunter is one of the oldest classes in history. They represent a deep connection between man and beast, and the hunters of \"Warcraft\" are not merely individuals who track animals and slay them for food, but custodians of balance. They understand the natural circle of life and death, and the part they must play in maintaining it not simply as researchers, but as active participants. The \"Hunt\" is venerated, and the prey they choose to stalk is given as much respect as the predators hunters choose to learn from and embody. All hunters create lifelong friendships with animal companions, who are also often their best and only friends, if the stereotype of the reclusive huntsman is to be believed.\nHunters come in all shapes, forms, sizes and specialties, but in \"World of Warcraft\" most hunters specialize to be marksmen (however, not all hunters choose the Marksmanship specialization). Hunters are a curious mix of mysticism and rough wilderness know-how. They can learn to mystically align themselves with the aspects of various animals to assist them: the tenacity of a &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;, the sharp eyes of an &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;, and the swiftness of a &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;cheetah&lt;/a&gt;; they gift themselves with a higher resistance against the dangers of the most important thing of all in the rites of a hunter \u2014 the very Wilds he and his prey live in. Hunters also derive a system of hand-to-hand combat inspired by the attacks and counterattacks of various animals, and use magically empowered &lt;a href=\"hunter%20trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;s to maim and snare their prey. They have various shots imbued with magic or explosives to &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, handicap and &lt;a href=\"Scatter%20Shot\"&gt;disorient&lt;/a&gt; their targets. They can even hold their breath and slow their heartbeat to a highly infrequent, inconsequential tap to give their pursuers &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;the impression that they are dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hunter is the choice of life for those who reject societies that oppress the natural role as prey and hunter, and also reject the druidic stance that we should be healers and observers rather than active participants in the \"Great Hunt\". They follow a life of reverence for nature complimenting their tradition and willingness to use man-made tools. We are all tool-using creatures after all, and it is only natural to use that advantage afforded by nature to be better hunters. There are however also those hunters who prefer a more direct approach to tracking and hunting.\nHunters are relentless in their pursuit of prey, whether they\u2019re after beasts with more cunning than wit, dangerous monsters, or monstrous people\u2014the deadliest quarry of all. But beyond their skills as survivalists, they\u2019re students of what they hunt, observing abilities and tactics and using that knowledge to make themselves more dangerous and unpredictable foes.\nRaces.\nThe hunter class can be played by all available races. \nRacial abilities.\nThese are some relevant racial traits to hunters: \nOther racial attributes can also be useful, but may not be specifically relevant to hunters as a class. As always, research into all the &lt;a href=\"racial%20traits\"&gt;racial traits&lt;/a&gt; of each race will make a player's decision better informed.\nAbilities.\nRanged fighting.\nRanged fighting requires a choice between a gun, bow, or a crossbow. When starting, this will depend on your &lt;a href=\"Races\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; are given guns, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; start with crossbows, and the other races get bows. Later on, you can train to use the ranged weapons that aren't inherent to your race. In general, &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt; are relatively slow, but hit harder and are favored for increasing burst damage, while guns are relatively fast and good for steady grinding. Bows have moderate attack speed and are favored for sustained DPS. Initially, weapon speed will be inconsequential since the only available abilities consist of Auto-Shot and various instant casts. Guns can be crafted by &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s, but there are no craftable bows or crossbows, so most ranged upgrades will come from &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; drops and &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; rewards. There are also a small amount of crafted weapons other than guns.\nStings and venoms.\nHunters have stings and venoms, which are specialized debuffs they can apply to targets to help them address specific situations. Most stings are &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Talents\"&gt;PvP Talents&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Scorpid%20Sting\"&gt;Scorpid Sting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Viper%20Sting\"&gt;Viper Sting&lt;/a&gt;, and offer utility. Survival hunters have access to &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt; as a base ability, which deals Nature damage over time to enemies.\nShots.\nHunters also make heavy use of special shots to supplement their DPS and provide utility to their groups. The bulk of a hunter's damage and utility will come from the use of these shots. \nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%205.1.0\"&gt;patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, any shot, be it auto or cast-time, can be fired on the move, without any penalty. However, prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0\"&gt;Patch 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, the hunter could not move or fire their Auto Shot if they were casting another spell at the same time. The Auto Shot swing timer was still counting, but would not fire over another shot. This was called \"clipping Auto Shot\" and would greatly reduce DPS. This mechanic was at first countered with &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Fox\"&gt;Aspect of the Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and later removed entirely. \nIn the past, weapon speed was often critical to maximizing DPS output, but the standardization of weapon speeds and disuse of shot rotations means that hunters should now simply use the weapon with the best DPS and stats, regardless of speed. Previously, due to clipping consideration, weapon speed was crucial to maximizing DPS with shot rotation, and a hunter would aim to choose a ranged weapon of an appropriate speed (2.7 for beast masters, 3-3.1 for survivalists and marksmen) to fit neatly between the cooldowns of their more powerful abilities. These days, however, all weapons have the same speed, and since shot rotations are not used, speed is no longer important.\nMelee combat.\nSurvival Hunters revolve completely around close-range combat, abandoning a bow, crossbow, or gun in favor of a melee weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"Polearm\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Axe\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt;. Survival Hunters fight in the thick of melee combat alongside their animal pet, tearing bleeding wounds in their foes and laying traps beneath their feet. The hunter emulates animals in some of their attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Raptor%20Strike\"&gt;Raptor Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mongoose%20Bite\"&gt;Mongoose Bite.&lt;/a&gt;\nBy coordinating their efforts, the hunter and the beast execute &lt;a href=\"Flanking%20Strike\"&gt;deft flanking strikes&lt;/a&gt;, dealing high damage while the other has the enemy's attention. The hunter is also unique among melee classes in that they have access to a plethora of ranged utility. Many of their abilities include throwing attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Wildfire%20Bomb\"&gt;Wildfire Bomb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harpoon\"&gt;Harpoon&lt;/a&gt;, and they throw their traps from range like the other two Hunter specs. This means that a Survival Hunter is dangerous from range, and even more dangerous up close.\nCombat pets.\nPets are the most important tools in the hands of a hunter. They serve as &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;-management, additional &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s. The pet is essential to all specs, dealing anywhere from 10% of total damage for a marksman to 50% for a beast master. Formerly, pets had anemic damage potential and weak AI that often made them more of a danger to a raid than an asset. But improved AI - pets now always attack from the back of a monster - and an innate 90% damage avoidance has made this no longer a concern.\nMany beast-type mobs can be tamed, and each offer a set of unique active skills (there are special abilities just for wolves, just for cats, etc). In addition, certain pet types are tanking-oriented (such as bears and turtles), and others are DPS-oriented (such as cats and owls). Combined with the diversity of armor, stamina and resistance buffs, pets are allowed a great deal of customization. Many hunters have dedicated pets for specific instances, PvP, tanking, and so on.\nHunters start with a pet at level 1 and can &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;Tame Beast&lt;/a&gt; pets at level 10. They are able to control the pet through various &lt;a href=\"Pet%20Commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. Although hunters can have only one active pet at a time, they have immediate access to 4 additional pets using &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet&lt;/a&gt; and they can house up to 20 pets in the &lt;a href=\"Stables\"&gt;stable&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to regular animals, a number of special targets have been introduced into the game world specifically for hunters to track and tame. These beasts present a &lt;a href=\"Taming%20Challenge\"&gt;Taming Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and require special tactics to ready them for taming, much like the original epic bow quest in &lt;a href=\"Vanilla\"&gt;Vanilla World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. While some of these are simply hard to find (and even harder to tame), those introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" are fully invisible beasts, able to be revealed only by hunters using &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt;, who must first find them by seeking out their subtle and elusive tracks. See &lt;a href=\"Taming%20Challenge\"&gt;Taming Challenge&lt;/a&gt; for a list.\nTraps.\nHunters have access to a unique mechanic - traps. Traps exist in two main types; &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt;, which freezes an enemy in place, and &lt;a href=\"Tar%20Trap\"&gt;Tar Trap&lt;/a&gt;, which lays an oil slick upon the ground.\nThrough talents, more Traps can be accessed: Hi-Explosive Trap deals light Fire damage and knocks enemies away; for Survival Hunters, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Trap\"&gt;Steel Trap&lt;/a&gt; roots an enemy in place and deals heavy damage over time.\nAspects.\nAmongst many different aspects, two main variants remained in game.\nDamage increasing Aspects:\nSpeed increasing Aspects:\nUtility Aspects:\nand\nTracking.\nHunters are the only class that can &lt;a href=\"tracking\"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; any type of creature individually, or simultaneously over the minimap.\nSpecializations.\nBeast Mastery.\n A master of the wild who can tame a wide variety of beasts to assist &lt;him/her&gt; in combat.\nWhile all hunters value the assistance of their animal companions, Beast Mastery hunters have the closest bonds of all with their pets. Beast Mastery (BM) hunters place far more importance on the pet, dealing an increased amount of damage through the addition of numerous active and passive abilities, as well as through their &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt; . The pets of BM hunters deal more damage, regenerate focus more quickly, can use their special attacks more often and benefit from bonus crits, splash damage and haste procs. BM hunters and their pets have the most focus of any hunters, with their animal bond contributing &lt;a href=\"Invigoration\"&gt;Invigoration&lt;/a&gt; to both parties. BM hunters are also the only hunters sufficiently attuned to the animal kingdom to be capable of taming &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to gain some of the most impressive and exciting pets in the game.\n\"Among the most gifted hunters, there are those who have from birth felt a profound bond with the creatures of the wild. These beast masters are drawn to the perilous primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. Primitive landscape becomes home. Ferocious predator becomes kin. Whether in the thrill of the hunt or the heat of battle, beast masters call forth a litany of vicious animals to overwhelm prey and gnaw at their enemies\u2019 will.\"\nMarksmanship.\n A master archer or sharpshooter who excels in bringing down enemies from afar.\nMasters of ranged weaponry, Marksmanship hunters focus on honing their skills with the gun or bow. The standard hunter's repertoire of shots is significantly improved for Marksmanship hunters, with new types of shots and additional effects added to others. The powerful Marksmanship abilities &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20Shot\"&gt;Chimaera Shot&lt;/a&gt; are augmented along with &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Shot\"&gt;Steady Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Multi-Shot\"&gt;Multi-Shot&lt;/a&gt; to build to a devastating synergy of ranged attacks, dealing swift and explosive damage while granting &lt;a href=\"disorient\"&gt;disorient&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt;s and even self-healing. Marksmanship hunters' potent damage output is increased by their &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt; , increasing their damage, range, and critical strike damage when they stand still for 3 seconds.\n\"Marksmen, too, shroud themselves in the perils of the untamed wilds, perfecting the use of weapons that are deadliest from great range. They\u2019ve maintained little interest, however, in gaining the loyalty of the many beasts inhabiting these crude landscapes. Instead, the marksman blends into the surrounding environment, surveying behavior of all manner of predator and gleaning deadly methods for stalking their own prey. A sniper in hiding, the marksman unleashes arrows and bullets with deadly precision, exposing the weakness in whoever\u2014or whatever\u2014passes through their crosshairs.\"\nSurvival.\n A rugged tracker who favors using animal venom, explosives and traps as deadly weapons.\nSurvival Hunters focus on the chaos of melee combat, fighting fang and claw alongside a loyal friend. Through peerless mastery of a spear, Survival Hunters are able to subsist in environments where others would fail, wielding only a blade and a pet. They slip traps under enemy's feet in melee combat, and use their weapon to tear bleeding holes in their enemies. Together, the Survivalist and the pet coordinate their attacks to flank the foe while one has their attention. With powerful &lt;a href=\"Mongoose%20Bite\"&gt;Mongoose Bites&lt;/a&gt;, Survival Hunters ramp their damage up to terrifying numbers, which are only strengthened further by their mastery, .\n\"While all hunters feel a calling to the wild, some serve as a reflection of its brutality. To them, the hunt is defined by unrelenting ferocity, where survival means facing one\u2019s enemy eye-to-eye . . . and is always accompanied by merciless bloodshed. Weapons of great range are abandoned for instruments of close-quarters combat. Survival hunters are instinctive and crafty on the prowl, employing loyal beasts and laying deceptive traps to see their enemies undone. For these hunters know that to truly understand what it means to survive, one must first become familiar with the cruel face of death.\"\nPet specializations.\nEach &lt;a href=\"pet%20family\"&gt;pet family&lt;/a&gt; comes with a default specialization. Each specialization deals the same amount of damage, but grants the Hunter different utility depending on the specialization.\nCunning.\n Guileful creatures capable of skillfully mitigating lethal blows dealt to themselves and their allies.\nCunning pets are focused on mobility. They have a constant passive called Pathfinder, which grants the Hunter and pet 8% increased Movement Speed, and they come with the active ability &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Call\"&gt;Master's Call&lt;/a&gt;, which liberates a target of all roots and slows, and makes them immune to roots and slows for a short period.\nFerocity.\n Driven by a frenzied persistence to pursue prey, these beasts stop at nothing to achieve victory; even death is temporary for these predators.\nFerocity pets are focused on consistent damage. They don't deal more DPS themselves than Cunning or Tenacity pets, but they grant the Hunter access to &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Rage\"&gt;Primal Rage&lt;/a&gt;, a Bloodlust/Heroism ability that grants all members of the party or raid 30% increased Attack Speed for 40 seconds. They also have the passive Predator's Thirst, which grants the Hunter and Pet 10% Leech, causing them to heal for 10% of all damage they deal.\nTenacity.\n Stalwart and veteran defenders who unquestionably place their thick hides and protective exteriors in harm's way for their allies.\nTenacity pets increase the pair's durability. They sport the passive Endurance Training, which grants Hunter and Pet 5% increased maximum Health. They also come with the active ability &lt;a href=\"Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest%20%28hunter%20talent%29\"&gt;Survival of the Fittest (hunter talent)&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces damage taken by the Hunter and Pet by 20% for 6 seconds.\nGear.\nArmor.\nHunters can initially only wear &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, but at level 40 are able to equip &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;, with the level 50 &lt;a href=\"Mail%20Specialization%20%28hunter%29\"&gt;Mail Specialization (hunter)&lt;/a&gt; rewarding them for doing so. See &lt;a href=\"hunter%20sets\"&gt;hunter sets&lt;/a&gt; for a list of hunter armor sets.\nDuring the early beta days of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", hunters could wear &lt;a href=\"Shield%23Bucklers\"&gt;bucklers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapons.\nHunters can use &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s. Usable melee weapons are &lt;a href=\"Polearm\"&gt;Polearms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Staff\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt;; they can also wield &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Axe\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagger\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fist%20weapon\"&gt;Fist Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, but cannot use one-handed variants with abilities and only benefit from weapons with Agility, most commonly found on Polearms and Staves. Marksmanship and Beast Mastery Hunters shun melee weapons, and are useless when they have them equipped. Survival Hunters embrace melee weapons and shun ranged ones instead.\nUpon reaching level 20, hunters can learn the &lt;a href=\"Dual%20wield\"&gt;Dual Wield&lt;/a&gt; skill. This allows them to wield two one-handed weapons at the same time. This is a legacy ability from days when Dual Wielding was a viable trait for Hunters. They retain the ability, but Survival is focused entirely on two-handed Polearms and Staves.\nBefore \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", hunters could equip melee weapons at the same time as their ranged weapons. Polearms were generally considered the best melee weapon for hunters, due to disinterest from other classes, slow attack speed, and stats that could be utilized for ranged abilities. Also, polearms tended to have stats for hunters, like Agility, where two-handed swords or axes mostly have Strength. The slow attack speed ensured that the few swings the hunter may have to make maximized the damage possible for each swing. Another factor was looks, as the melee weapon was the only weapon that would regularly show on the hunter, while the ranged weapon would only show up while in use. Prior to \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", hunters were able to wield &lt;a href=\"thrown\"&gt;thrown&lt;/a&gt; items, and in the &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; even had &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s.\nToday, unless you're Survival, there is no reason for hunters to roll on melee weapons available for their level. However, there is a wide variety of older content from earlier expansions that a hunter can solo for other purposes: the prime example would be &lt;a href=\"Hydrocane\"&gt;Hydrocane&lt;/a&gt; for water breathing. This can then be &lt;a href=\"transmogrified\"&gt;transmogrified&lt;/a&gt; to any two-handed weapon such as an old hunter polearm, or a two-handed sword or axe, like &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl%20%28item%29\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. If one does Dual Wield, this opens up &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt; possibilities such as matching daggers, two &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale-Encrusted%20Longblade\"&gt;Dragonscale-Encrusted Longblade&lt;/a&gt;, or fist weapon sets.\nAttribute conversions.\nIn modern \"World of Warcraft\", most attributes are affected by &lt;a href=\"Diminishing%20Returns\"&gt;Diminishing Returns&lt;/a&gt;, making it impossible to assign absolute values to each attribute. The general priority of importance however, can be assumed below.\nEnd-game expectations.\nGeneral.\nA hunter's primary responsibility in nearly all raid encounters is to sustainably generate high DPS. Hunters should be using &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; on the main tank (unless told otherwise) at the start of the fight, ensuring that the main tank gets the initial aggro of the pull and the boss doesn't one-shot one of the melee standing close by. They will also need to monitor their focus usage and regen using &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Shot\"&gt;Steady Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Shot\"&gt;Barbed Shot&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Command\"&gt;Kill Command&lt;/a&gt;, depending on their Spec or talent usage. \nYour primary role is to deal DPS, as much as possible. In order to do this, make sure all your gear is enchanted and gemmed accordingly to your Spec, make sure you have your pet out, and that it's not on passive (If you aren't using &lt;a href=\"Lone%20Wolf\"&gt;Lone Wolf&lt;/a&gt;), make sure you choose the talents that bring you the most DPS. Make sure you have a flask/double elixir on and make sure you use a Potion (Agility is optimal) 1-2 seconds before the pull. This will give you the option to use another potion during the fight, preferably when your DPS cooldowns come back off cooldown. Also note that you can negate some boss abilities completely with &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Turtle\"&gt;Aspect of the Turtle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disengage\"&gt;Disengage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;. In order to know what abilities you can avoid or negate, you will have to experiment yourself during the encounters themselves, or ask on one of the many forums for WoW!\nFocus Management.\nThe most important thing that many new or returning hunters miss is Focus Management. You start off at 100 focus (120 for BM), your &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Shot\"&gt;Steady Shot&lt;/a&gt;, Barbed Shot, or &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Command\"&gt;Kill Command&lt;/a&gt; regenerate focus when casted, and the majority of other spells cost Focus to be used. \nIf a big and important spell is coming off cooldown in the next ~3 seconds, you have to \"pool\" your focus above the spells cost to make sure you can cast it INSTANTLY when it comes off cooldown. If you have too much focus, use so called \"focus dump\" abilities to get rid of excess focus, such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Shot\"&gt;Cobra Shot&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Raptor%20Strike\"&gt;Raptor Strike&lt;/a&gt;. Try to never be focus capped (Spam too much Focus Generators) and never miss an important ability because your focus was low. \nIf you have trouble with focus management, try taking talents that shore up your weaknesses. If you end up Focus capping too often, take talents that spend your Focus. If you end up without enough Focus to use abilities, take talents that boost Focus regeneration. As with everything else, focus management takes time and practice, and it's an essential part of the class since implemented in the Cataclysm Expansion and every hunter worth his spear should know how to do it properly!\nTrapping in Raids and Dungeons.\nYou will almost never be asked to trap during raids, but you might be asked during 5man groups and heroics. Trapping is a form of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis is typically done by using &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; at the target to control a single target, or &lt;a href=\"Tar%20Trap\"&gt;Tar Trap&lt;/a&gt; to control a group. During raid encounters that feature lots of adds, or additional enemies, Tar Trap can be used to slow their approach and give your ranged allies and yourself more time to damage them before they reach their targets. If you play Survival and opt into the &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Trap\"&gt;Steel Trap&lt;/a&gt; talent, it should be used on cooldown as a DPS ability. Using an @cursor macro to make traps instantly cast at your cursor makes the ability much more fluid to use. An example of this macro, for Steel Trap (it functions with any traps, just replaced 'Steel Trap' for one of the others), is as follows:\n/cast [@cursor] Steel Trap\nKiting.\nIn some cases you will be asked to &lt;a href=\"Kite\"&gt;Kite&lt;/a&gt; one or more creatures that either cannot or should not be killed during a specific encounter, allowing the rest of the raid to focus on other needs in order defeat the objective. Kiting is a skill that is best accomplished by hunters (even melee Hunters!), because they are intrinsically designed to be good kiters. If there is just one enemy, use &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt; to slow them down. If you're kiting a pack of mobs, consider using &lt;a href=\"Tar%20Trap\"&gt;Tar Trap&lt;/a&gt; to slow them all down. If the target is vulnerable to stuns or roots, abilities like &lt;a href=\"Intimidation\"&gt;Intimidation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Shot\"&gt;Binding Shot&lt;/a&gt; can be lifesavers. If they get close to you, &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disengage\"&gt;Disengage&lt;/a&gt; can make some distance, and if they reach you, &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Turtle\"&gt;Aspect of the Turtle&lt;/a&gt; will keep you from being damaged. Consider using a Cunning-specialized pet, granting you the bonus Movement Speed offered by their Pathfinder passive. Certain pets, such as a &lt;a href=\"Crocolisk\"&gt;Crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;, also have access to targeted slows. If you're playing as the melee-Survival Hunter, using &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Eagle\"&gt;Aspect of the Eagle&lt;/a&gt; to boost your range will allow you to keep your DPS up on the target, even while at range. If it's not available, you can use &lt;a href=\"Harpoon\"&gt;Harpoon&lt;/a&gt; to root the target, strike them with a melee ability or two, and then run out to kiting range again. If, for any reason, you need to lose aggro and cease kiting, use &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; to make the target stop following you. Kiting, for most hunters, is the hardest skill to learn, yet is considered by many to be the most important skill.\nPvP.\nHunters wishing to participate in end-game PvP will find any of the specializations help them towards their goals of massive player destruction!\nThe Beast Mastery Hunters can employ their powerful pets to damage and hound enemies even when the Hunter is safe beyond range or behind cover. Abilities that summon additional beasts, such as Dire Beast, can end up overwhelming enemies with many targets. This often causes players to panic, and attempt to run, use AoE-focused CC on the pets, or use preventative defensive cooldowns. This specialization requires masterful management of your pet's movement: you don't want to get ambushed only to find your pet is busy gnawing on a Druid you sent it after 30 seconds ago, unable to assist you.\nMarksmanship Hunters benefit from having some of the highest range, and highest burst, of any class. Take advantage of the superior range granted by to dance just out of range of enemy abilities, or assault them from atop hills or towers where they cannot immediately reach you. Always enter an encounter with a full Focus-bar, so that you have plenty of Focus to spend on your high-damage &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Survival Hunter is the most versatile of the specs, able to dish out damage from any range. They can mix it up with melee classes, and also take down enemy ranged casters. Pet management is important, although not as important as Beast Mastery: the Hunter relies on their pet for Focus regeneration, and you need it close by to use your most damaging abilities. While a melee spec, ranged combat is still a large focus, and learning to properly kite while using your ranged &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt;, Wildfire Bomb, and &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Command\"&gt;Kill Command&lt;/a&gt; are essential lessons to learn.\nSome skills are universal, no matter the specialization. Using &lt;a href=\"Tar%20Trap\"&gt;Tar Trap&lt;/a&gt; to slow enemies in chokepoints can be a valuable asset to your PvP team. Your &lt;a href=\"Tracking\"&gt;Tracking&lt;/a&gt; abilities get much more use here than in PvE, and you can smell characters attempting to hide in ambush around walls and either enter prepared or find a different route. Hunters particularly excel at finding stealthed enemies. Your &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt; is an important tool for revealing enemy stealthed &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt;, or even enemy Hunters. Remember to keep &lt;a href=\"Track%20Hidden\"&gt;Track Hidden&lt;/a&gt; active at all times so you can spot stealthed enemies your allies might miss. If you know the enemy has a Hunter or Feral Druid that can track you, using &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Chameleon\"&gt;Aspect of the Chameleon&lt;/a&gt; will grant you the element of surprise.\nHunters excel at taking out soft targets like &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s from a distance, and should do so before moving on to hard targets such as &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, though if a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; is observed, it is the hunter who is best equipped to track and expose the rogue by marking him with &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter's pets can also break an unseen rogue's stealth if he is close and you order to follow them and attack.\nIn the RPG.\nThe hunter is a stalker in the wilds, living on his knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle. He is deeply in tune with nature, and some of its mightiest beasts are his allies. Of Azeroth's many creatures, few can resist the hunter's call, and fewer can survive his fury. Hunters are as varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to find their prey and bring it down. They come from any race (players are restricted to twelve races, see below), though certain races naturally excel at the hunter's profession. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic allies. &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;Elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s are not alone in their mastery of the wilderness. While an elven ranger prefers the bow, the hunter would rather get up close. A hunter is skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost. Orcs of the Horde first learned the ways of the hunter from forest trolls on Lordaeron and tauren have been masters of the hunt since the dawn of the world. Like the shamans of the Horde, hunters call upon the spirits of the land, wind, and fire to aid them in their hunts and tasks. Their spells focus on the elements and the land.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Various homes are situated among the jagged rocks of the foreshore; the residents constantly provoked by its wildlife. The chill, howling winds from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; buffet this remote settlement.\nBackground.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; swept through &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the residents of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, seeking shelter within &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, found the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; closed to them. Purchasing a ship called the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20Wolf\"&gt;Sea Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\", many of the residents set sail for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to escape the undead.\nUnfortunately, a storm blew their ship off course. They sailed aimlessly through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; for several weeks before another storm caused them to shipwreck on the shores of a &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;mysterious island&lt;/a&gt;, near the ancient fortress of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Since their ship was unsalvageable, and the land plentiful, they built the village of Bradensbrook and settled down.\nThe town recently fell into peril as Mayor Heathrow's daughter went missing and undead spirits arose, terrorizing the residents. The town would endure and manages to fend off the undead in the area.\nDespite their success, it would be short-lived as the Legion launches an attack. The first would come in the form of &lt;a href=\"Imp%20Mother%20Gothol\"&gt;Imp Mother Gothol&lt;/a&gt;, where she would set the land as her personal &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; breeding ground. Thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, they would send her back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Nanosh%20the%20Slicer\"&gt;Nanosh the Slicer&lt;/a&gt; would also attack the village. With an army of Black Rook Assassins at his side, he was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. The third Legion attack came during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Val%27sharah\"&gt;Assault on Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than attacking them directly, the Legion placed cups of demon blood inside their village. Anyone who drank it would be driven mad and mind-controlled by the demons. Heroes manage to free the citizens and drive the Legion back.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled to Brandensbrook while seeking his sister Maiev's whereabouts. Although he was initially met with considerable mistrust from &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Heathrow\"&gt;Mayor Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;, he was able to gradually earn the villagers' trust after helping them fight off his former kin.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and as of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Mevris%20Ghostdancer\"&gt;Mevris Ghostdancer&lt;/a&gt;, have engaged in active trade with Bradensbrook, sending and receiving supplies from each other via ships.\nPlaces.\nThe entire settlement of Bradensbrook consists of many different residencies scattered along the coast."}

A noted dwarven historian and veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Brann is an active member of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, following closely in the footsteps of his brother Muradin, one of the founding members of the League. One of the greatest explorers to ever wander the lands of Azeroth, Brann is recognized and welcomed across the known world. The warm, courageous dwarf has made friends and acquaintances in nearly every charted land - and presumably those uncharted as well.\nHe has spent many years mapping out the remote corners and hidden nooks of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; for his beloved Explorers' Guild, which he helped to found. With the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Brann was one of the first dwarves to tread the unknown paths of the ancients. From the frigid mountains of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to the depths of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, wherever ancient mysteries call, he will follow.\nBiography.\nBrann Bronzbebeard went to an &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; school and used to copy &lt;a href=\"Hilda%20Hornswaggle\"&gt;Hilda Hornswaggle&lt;/a&gt;'s notes.\nSecond War.\nBrann is a formidable warrior. During the Second War, he fought in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Siege of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and afterwards Brann and his brother Muradin were sent by their elder brother, King Magni, to accompany the Alliance army led by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; as they made their way through Khaz Modan to Blackrock Spire. After Lothar's death, the two followed his lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, in the battle that resulted in the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld exploration.\n\"For more info see &lt;a href=\"Brann%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Brann's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Brann's world exploration was mostly described in RPG books (as seen below under the More travels section) which are now non-canon.\"\nWhen Magni founded the Explorers' League, some time before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Brann began a journey of discovery to explore the world at the behest of his brother Magni and the Explorers' League to map out the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually he also mapped out &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his journey, the celebrated adventurer made his way through the regions of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; before filing his last report from the misty jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and then he went missing. According to his last correspondence, Brann had just uncovered the ruins of an ancient city hidden deep within Stranglethorn when he was beset upon by a band of savage jungle troll headhunters. Presumably, Brann evaded capture, but the only real clue pertaining to his whereabouts came in the form of a vague final sentence: \"I resolved to head east\u2026\" Brann apparently was fine, however, and had just explored &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, before he continued his journey in the Eastern Kingdoms heading north. \nWith his new pet &lt;a href=\"ape\"&gt;ape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glibb\"&gt;Glibb&lt;/a&gt;, Brann went back to the southwestern-most wastes of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the rumors - the discovery of &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s - as well as learn about the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; from members of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. He then set up camp with an expedition in southern Silithus in order to find a way past the Scarab Wall, which he had been to before but had never found a way in. He discovered a silithid tunnel leading into the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. Most of his expedition had been killed, but he escaped, leaving Glibb behind, and continued writing notes for his school book. By that time, the Bronze Dragonflight had helped a group of adventurers reconstruct the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, and the gates of Ahn'Qiraj had been opened. Adventurers had just begun to travel into the city in order to defeat C'Thun before he could emerge to devastate Azeroth.\nMonths before the Year 25, Brann disappeared and it was known that he was headed towards the continent of Northrend to investigate his brother Muradin's death. Unknown to the Guild, he had finally made it to Northrend safely.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBrann is heavily involved in an Alliance quest chain that starts in &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Frost dwarves in &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. The first quest is given by &lt;a href=\"Archaeologist%20Andorin\"&gt;Archaeologist Andorin&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"On%20Brann%27s%20Trail\"&gt;On Brann's Trail&lt;/a&gt;. Upon series of tasks he is reunited with his brother, Muradin.\nBrann also appears inside the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan city in &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. He is involved in the escort quest in the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt;. Brann does not appear to have any qualms as to who comes to his aid while he is in Ulduar, as both Alliance and Horde are able to interact with him. \nIf you complete the achievement &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20Explorer\"&gt;Northrend Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, the players will receive a letter from Brann Bronzebeard congratulating them for doing so. In that letter Brann also attaches the .\nUlduar.\nBrann appeared in the Secrets of Ulduar trailer. Brann led an army of troops and tanks into Ulduar in an effort to discover its secrets, but was driven out by &lt;a href=\"Kologarn\"&gt;Kologarn&lt;/a&gt; as the only survivor of his expedition. Making his way to Dalaran to deliver his report to &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Brann kept referring to a malevolent \"presence\" he felt within Ulduar, the presence of the unchained &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. He says of Yogg-Saron: \"Prisoner? Ha. With it's bindings shattered, it's influence unchecked, it's gonna come after us, and then \"we'll\" be the prisoners.\"\nBrann leads a second assault against &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of player characters and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. He can be heard communicating with players over the radio during the push towards &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Leviathan\"&gt;Flame Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating Flame Leviathan, he can be found deeper inside Ulduar, within the &lt;a href=\"Archivum\"&gt;Archivum&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; and taking &lt;a href=\"Reply-Code%20Alpha\"&gt;Reply-Code Alpha&lt;/a&gt; from him, Brann can briefly be seen in Dalaran as Rhonin transmits the code from the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Unrest.\nAs earthquakes begin to occur across the planet, Brann found some ancient, unusual tablets in Ulduar. The Explorers' League's preliminary reports stated that they may be able to help with understanding the situation. Brann was so sure that the tablets would point in the right direction, he completed plans to ship them to Magni in Ironforge.\nAs he waited for the tablets to arrive, Magni called a meeting of the Alliance leadership, including &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, to gather in &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Magni explained the potential of the tablets to the other leaders, and conveyed his confidence in Brann's certainty.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nAfter Magni's death, Brann and Muradin were nowhere to be found as gryphons were sent after them but without success. Both were to take Magni's crown. However, &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; appeared in Ironforge outranking them because she was the legitimate heir.\nCataclysm.\nIn his continued search for Titan lore, Brann can be found in the newly-opened region of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen his lazy butt finally kicks in the &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones%20and%20the%20Temple%20of%20Uldum\"&gt;Harrison Jones and the Temple of Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, he wants to go to the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Cradle of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s arrive there in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Coffer%20of%20Promise\"&gt;The Coffer of Promise&lt;/a&gt;, he's got what he was looking for and finishes up going to &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; to wrap things up there.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBrann makes an appearance at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, home base of the &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Lorewalkers&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe functions as an archaeology trainer and sells other useful items in exchange for a &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Artifact\"&gt;Restored Artifact&lt;/a&gt; or five.\nLandfall.\nBrann led an expedition to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mogujia\"&gt;Mogujia&lt;/a&gt;. There, with the help of the Alliance heroes, he found a sha touched claw which he brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; for further study. The Sha energy however, escaped containment and contaminated some of the Alliance footmen. Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance Champion set off to cleanse those contaminated from the Sha's influence. Brann is seen in the Shrine of Seven Stars summit, where the Alliance dignitaries and allies discuss the pros and cons of using &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; power. Though he doesn't like the look of the Sha, he acquiesced that it doesn't hurt to study it. It was ultimately voted to ban its use. After the Alliance discovered that Garrosh is looking for the Divine Bell, Brann accompanied &lt;a href=\"Sarannha%20Skyglaive\"&gt;Sarannha Skyglaive&lt;/a&gt; and her expedition to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Korune\"&gt;Ruins of Korune&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the beginning of the Burning Legion's invasion, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; messaged Brann that Magni, having been petrified from the using the Ulduar tablets four years previously, had reawakened. Claiming to have information about how to defeat the Legion and mentioning &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Brann sought out &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the player at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with Magni at Ulduar and find out what he knows, although Brann admits he's not sure if Magni is crazy, or even his oldest brother at all.\nAfter rescuing Magni from Legion agents trying to probe his mind, Brann and the others are led to the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Planetarium\"&gt;Celestial Planetarium&lt;/a&gt; and learn that Azeroth is a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; who has chosen the transformed Magni as her speaker. Magni informs Brann and Khadgar that the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; are needed to seal the portal at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and as Khadgar leaves for &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to learn their location, Brann stays behind to catch up with Magni.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Brann has introduced &lt;a href=\"Grif%20Wildheart\"&gt;Grif Wildheart&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Prustaga\"&gt;Prustaga&lt;/a&gt;. Brann visits various &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; camps across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to work with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s interested in &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegionfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; contacted Magni and told him about a lost titan vault near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, though as Magni would explain to Brann she did not do so in words but rather in \"feelings\". Magni felt that this mission from Azeroth had something to do with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, so he and Brann traveled to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to contact them. Magni, Brann, the High Priest, and &lt;a href=\"Betild%20Deepanvil\"&gt;Betild Deepanvil&lt;/a&gt; took a &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; to an area of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; northeast of the Maelstrom, where they discovered the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Observatory\"&gt;Primordial Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. After identifying Magni as the Speaker, &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20WH12-B4NG\"&gt;Caretaker WH12-B4NG&lt;/a&gt; revealed to the four of them that the vault holds three &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s: creatures that were long ago infused with the Light by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to help the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watchers&lt;/a&gt; by speeding them to sites of corruption. Magni realized that finding the seekers was the reason Azeroth directed him to the vault.\nOne of the three seekers had been affected by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, prompting WH12-B4NG to initiate the vault's sanitation protocol. After the guardians of the vault were fought off and WH12-B4NG powered down. Magni realized that Azeroth knew the High Priest would protect the seekers from the Void that would have overtaken the vault before long, and that was why she had contacted him. Magni, Brann, Betild, and the High Priest returned to Netherlight Temple with the seekers.\nBefore the Storm.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to examine &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBrann can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. He later travels to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Victory\"&gt;Fort Victory&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to get the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s to ally with the Alliance against the Horde. The attempt is a failure.\nBrann is the Alliance's companion through the &lt;a href=\"Underrot\"&gt;Underrot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, ending in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nBrann helps dwarves who are level 120 and Exalted with Ironforge to reforge the armor of &lt;a href=\"Aegrim%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Aegrim Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, earning their &lt;a href=\"heritage%20armor\"&gt;heritage armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagni and Brann later traveled to Uldir to bring &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; so that she could analyze Azeroth and find a way to heal her. However, it would take \"77 cycles\" for MOTHER's analysis to finish and so Magni told the adventurer he'd contact them then.\nHe makes an appearance at the &lt;a href=\"Maker%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Maker's Ascent&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20Uldum\"&gt;Assault in Uldum&lt;/a&gt; along with several other members of the league.\nExploring Azeroth.\nBrann and his brothers made the trip to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to check on the state of the land and their old allies.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nBrann and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.

He is one of the greatest explorers, anthropologists, archaeologists, taxonomists, linguists, etc., to ever wander the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. At different times during his journey, he has traveled with companions including his trusty gryphon, &lt;a href=\"Gryphadin\"&gt;Gryphadin&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguages.\n\"There are more than a dozen major languages in Azeroth, and there's little excuse for every explorer not to have at least a passing fluency in all of them.\"\nDuring the First War, Brann learned a bit of &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; in order to help question prisoners of war. By the end of the Second War, he considered himself conversational in the orc tongue.\nSecond War.\nDuring the war he had the chance to directly work with Lothar, and once spoke to him about his battle with Medivh. Their knowledge of the terrain and their skill in battle proved invaluable.\nMore travels.\nWhile in Northrend, he mapped the continent out and befriended or carefully researched the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt;, and others. \nWhile in Northrend, Brann used a document and Scourge artifacts he had bought in Gadgetzan, which allowed him passage into the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Monolith\"&gt;Sundered Monolith&lt;/a&gt;, a city still held by the living &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. He was able to befriend a few surviving nerubians, and learned much about their history. After his journey, he sent his second report (which he titled \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\") back to his brother and the Explorers' Guild.\nAfter his initial journey he continued his travels around the world, returning to areas he had previously explored, in order to interview members of various races of the world for a history book for school rooms he was considering writing. He put together some of his notes and working drafts concerning the history and culture of each of the Alliance and Horde races, as well as those of furbolgs, Wildhammer dwarves, forest trolls, ogres, and other &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; races. He later sent these notes and drafts, including articles on the history and current state of affairs of the Horde and Alliance and other independent organizations (which can be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Alliance Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Factions\"&gt;Dark Factions&lt;/a&gt;\"), to Ironforge. Around that time, he began to hear rumors of the Twilight's Hammer waiting for C'Thun to rise behind the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; in the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his research for the schoolbook, he thought of possibly heading to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; after he finished the book.\nBooks.\nAlong his journeys around the world he has chronicled his adventures and accumulated knowledge in five known volumes so far: his &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Brann\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;, two books known as \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\", and notes for a book he is writing which could be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Alliance Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Factions\"&gt;Dark Factions&lt;/a&gt;\", which he sent to his brother Magni Bronzebeard and the Explorers' League at various times during his journey.\nOnce he finished his journey, he sent his first major report (which he titled &lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;).\nHe sent a letter to King Magni in &lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;, in which Brann writes,\n\"What I found is ferociously interesting but disconcerting for our plans. The orcs, tauren and trolls of the Horde are \ufb01rmly established on Kalimdor and (boil my beard) they could be staunch allies against the Scourge and the Burning Legion. They certainly have every reason to hate the demons and the undead. Yet instead of working with them, the Alliance forces on Kalimdor (and the rest of the world, for that matter) squabble with the Horde over petty con\ufb02icts, mostly for tradition's sake. I say \"squabble,\" but the situation is escalating toward outright war again, my friends. I can't think of anything the Scourge and the Legion would like better than to watch the mortal races chop each other to bits so they can inherit whatever's left when we're done. We need diplomacy and handshakes, Magni, not swords and guns.\"\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"\" adventure for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", Brann appears as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%23In%20Hearthstone\"&gt;titular league&lt;/a&gt;. He accompanies the player through &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, the second wing of the adventure, in search of the second piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Staff of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating all three encounters of the wing \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Scarvash\"&gt;Chieftain Scarvash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 awards Brann as . His flavor text reads: \"\"Contains 75% more fiber than his brother &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;!\"\"\nIn the adventure, he is shown to have a mechanical pet parrot named &lt;a href=\"Ginny\"&gt;Ginny&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; notes that Brann loves . Brann claims to have sifted through &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; dung for months in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Steel%20Sentinel\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrann reappears alongside the rest of the League of Explorers in the \"\" to save &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; from the League of E.V.I.L.. In this incarnation, he has learned to tame and ride &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s and appears as the legendary hunter card . His flavor text reads: \"Brann's new dino-taming hobby is going well\u2014his pet can already make him sit, stand, and roll over!\"\nSpeculation.\nIt can be speculated that he has a kind of relationship to &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones%20and%20the%20Temple%20of%20Uldum\"&gt;Harrison Jones and the Temple of Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, Brann calls Harrison \"Junior\". (This continues the Easter egg of the character of Harrison Jones being a reference to the popular film series \"Indiana Jones\"; Brann would assume the role of Sean Connery's character in this instance)."}

They are the primary &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s at most tauren settlements. The first trials tauren player characters undergo are those to become a tauren brave.\nBackground.\nThe use of 'Brave' appears to be a long-standing tradition, as it is also used by the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, though the latter instead use the name warbrave. In fact, it appears that the position of brave was an established part of shu'halo culture even before they were driven from their homelands by the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, as the \"&lt;a href=\"Hatred%20of%20the%20Centaur\"&gt;Hatred of the Centaur&lt;/a&gt;\" myth describes how the early tauren's braves and hunters were unable to fend off the invading centaur. The braves are equipped with the armor crafted by &lt;a href=\"Mosarn\"&gt;Mosarn&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentices.\nBecoming a tauren brave involves overcoming several trials to test mind, body, and spirit. The exact nature of the rites has changed with time, but the meaning behind them has remained the same. Tauren brave initiates of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; start their training at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-\"\" the rites were referred to as the Rites of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt;, which was comprised the following three:\nFollowing this, the Rites of the Earthmother were complete. Honorable status must be upheld by continuing to do deeds of worth.\nPost-\"Cataclysm\" the rites have changed slightly, though they are still referred to as the Rites of the Earthmother. Notably, the rites are fulfilled in a much more makeshift fashion due to the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Red Cloud Mesa and the treachery of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The current path:\nBraves fulfill their rites to enter adulthood at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt;, listening for the wisdom and blessings of their ancestors on the winds. On their backs, they carry a unique pair of massive wooden &lt;a href=\"tauren%20totem\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;. When a brave falls in battle, a member their family - blood or chosen - rises and makes their mark on the totem, adding a new life to the story.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, tauren warbraves were on the move from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champions were sent to hold them at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown braves.\nThe following is a list of braves known by name:\nTypes.\nBraves are the primary guards at several settlements:\nQuotes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, Braves offer directions to various locations.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;:What are you looking for?"}

Keeshan&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded the military unit on the field, and &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Colonel Troteman&lt;/a&gt;, who served as the commanding officer for the entire regiment.\nHistory.\nThe Bravo Company operated in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, waging war on the invading &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt;. The entire regiment was eventually overpowered by an orc assault and most of its members were killed. Those who survived served as prisoners of war for five years. Only &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; managed to escape to &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, which the townspeople treated him with contempt for his military service. For a while, Keeshan became disillusioned with his hometown and lost the will to fight.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20storyline\"&gt;Redridge Mountains storyline&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was recruited into the Bravo Company and under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Colonel Troteman&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to reignite Keeshan's will to fight by recovering the belongings Keeshan lost and helping reassemble Keeshan's old battalion, the Bravo Company. It has been discovered that all members of Bravo Company were alive but captured by Blackrock orcs and needed rescue.\nAfter having his belongings returned to him and his friends in the Bravo Company reunited with him, Keeshan regains the will to fight. Keeshan leads Bravo Company in an assault on &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;, freeing the prisoners of war located there and then decimating it in an explosion which turns it into a crater.\nBravo Company then discovered from the POWs that the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Galardell%20Valley\"&gt;Galardell Valley&lt;/a&gt; are being controlled by a powerful magus in the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to its entrance from &lt;a href=\"General%20Fangore\"&gt;General Fangore&lt;/a&gt;, Bravo Company confront &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magus%20Doane\"&gt;Grand Magus Doane&lt;/a&gt;, who alludes to &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the mastermind behind the invasion that Doane alludes to before teleporting away.\nThe Bravo Company later assault &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch\"&gt;Stonewatch&lt;/a&gt;, the stronghold of the Blackrock orcs, which culminates in a battle against a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle all the members of Bravo Company are killed except for the adventurer, Troteman, and Keeshan, who jumps onto the dying dragon's back. Darkblaze flies over &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;, and after some struggle, both of them fall into the lake's waters. Both Keeshan and Darkblaze were presumed to have died in the fight, and several of Keeshan's belongings are later recovered by Lakeshire's townspeople. Colonel Troteman states that &lt;a href=\"Jorgensen\"&gt;Jorgensen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Messner\"&gt;Messner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krakauer\"&gt;Krakauer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danforth\"&gt;Danforth&lt;/a&gt; will receive a proper burial.\nIt is later revealed that Keeshan survived the encounter and played a role in defeating the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, there's no mention of the organization, and is presumably no longer active."}

Someone arriving in Maldraxxus is given a very basic kind of form that they can inhabit and then based on their victories or their losses they get upgrades or downgrades to that body, the little scrawny leftover abominations are an example for those that just didn't work out, whereas someone like &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; who was successful working their way up the ladders very quickly they are in the position where they could start making some choices and are given some latitude in order to decide their form and start shaping their flesh their way, if someone doesn't prove themself then those choices dissipate pretty quickly.\nHistory.\nMaldraxxus is the birthplace of necromantic magic and home to the forces that were called upon by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Maldraxxi were unified under an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. The most tactical and long-thinking of the Eternal Ones, he was a master strategist who was nearly unbeatable on the field of battle and was notorious for always thinking far ahead of everyone else. The Primus embodied the five traits of the ideal Maldraxxi soldier, traits he also instilled into the five houses: ambition, might, insight, guile, and the relentless pursuit of victory. In addition to his military might, he was also known as a legendary weaponsmith. The one rule the Primus impressed upon the houses was that the rivalry that existed between his five houses must never overshadow their duty to defend the realms of Death at any cost.\nThe Maldraxxi are split into five houses, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;; each with their own specialties. These houses pledged unending loyalty to the Primus, but began to waver from his vision as protectors of the Shadowlands after his disappearance. This led to the destruction of the House of Eyes and Plagues by the House of Rituals and Constructs. In the absence of the Primus, the leaders of the three remaining houses now ruthlessly fight one another to claim the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; and the position of commanding the armies of Maldraxxus. Before he disappeared, the Primus left behind cryptic messages and prophecies concerning the coming of one who would embody the might of Maldraxxus and save the realm from itself.\nThe House of Rituals and House of Constructs were the first to expose their betrayal by invading &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, to the horror of Margrave Krexus. Margrave Krexus was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;, who had also aligned with these traitors and claimed the title of Margrave for himself, and it is revealed both that Margrave Akarek and the House of Eyes as well as Margrave Stradama and the House of Plagues fell because of the House of Rituals. It is revealed the civil war had been orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; as Baron of Rituals, working with &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; to help &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, who betrays Margrave Sin'dane and claims power.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; and his forces help the Necrolords defeat Kel'Thuzad, as well as take back the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;:Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt; he had been promised by Denathrius and given by &lt;a href=\"the%20Tithelord\"&gt;the Tithelord&lt;/a&gt; with which he could've subjugated all &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; and altered the fabric of the Shadowlands itself.\nThe remaining Maldraxxi loyal to the purpose of Maldraxxus and the leadership of the Primus took base in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;; Margrave Sin'dane has allied herself with them after Kel'Thuzad's attempted betrayal. Margrave Vyraz retains control of the House of the Chosen and House of Constructs territory, with many members of the House of Rituals remaining loyal to Kel'Thuzad.\nThe Maldraxxi defectors later joined with the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, with only the liches allowed to enter &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and all other Maldraxxi forbidden from entering. Those who questioned Vyraz were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Body%20Banks\"&gt;Body Banks&lt;/a&gt; for asking too many questions. Vyraz promised the defectors chaos and destruction, and has been spending a lot of time with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. As the Primus's sigil was brought to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;, he regained his memory and form, and was revealed to be the Primus. In a surprise assault on Desmotaeron Draka killed Vyraz inside of &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\n\"Do not assume the strength of which I speak is based on physical might alone. The talents of the Margraves who govern the Houses of Maldraxxus are a testament to that.\"\nThe Houses of Maldraxxus are the five divisions of the &lt;a href=\"Undying%20Army\"&gt;Undying Army&lt;/a&gt;. A soul is selected for a House by its Margrave in the midst of combat upon arrival, with the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; serving as the tie-breaker. Each House has a specific approach to training and development corresponding to the nature and role of their forces.\nHowever, many aspects of Maldraxxus by necessity require collaboration, such as all &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropoli&lt;/a&gt; requiring a lich to fly, a construct to serve as the mechanic, and an aranakk to navigate, or how both fleshcrafting of the constructs and soul manipulation of the liches is needed in the creation of abomination, or how the slimes of the plagues would create the poisons of the eyes.\nAll Necrolords receive a portion of the Primus' power in order to carry out their duty of defending the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; from external forces. The defectors among the Maldraxxi following Kel'Thuzad and Vyraz serve &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormer Margraves:\nForms.\nAs stated, the Maldraxxi take various forms and shapes to fit and suit their roles. From the imposing gladiators to the stealthy aranakk, some are also able to choose largely unique shapes.\nSkeletons.\nIn Maldraxxus, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, also called animates, appear to be the most common form of undead within the realm of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, seen in all five houses. They serve a multitude of roles amongst the Maldraxxi; from serving as mages, warriors, craftsmen, and fodder. They are shown to be capable of being summoned by some of the greater Maldraxxi necromancers in great numbers, though they should not be underestimated. Quite a few skeletons serve in high positions, such as &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;, who was apprenticed by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nUnlike traditional skeletons, these warriors have flesh that still sticks to their frames like sinew and come in a uniform style that appears to be unique to the Maldraxxi.\nNecromancers.\nA form typically adopted by spellcasters and researchers; the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s of Maldraxxus draw reminiscent claim to the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es and mortal necromancers of Azeroth. Adorned in flowing robes with magnificent crystals and dark hoods, these undead typically fall into the employ of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; as eponymous necromancers, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; as those who piece together the various abominations that give the house its name and, before its destruction, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt; as researchers such as &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this, necromancers could be found in the employ of the Chosen and Eyes, though in lesser numbers. Some of these necromancers also seem to take on the path of the warrior, fighting with blades or riding atop massive beasts. Necromancers experiment on the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the ambitious and contentious, reforming only the greatest into undead soldiers who protect the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nGladiators.\nThe most powerful warriors and champions become gladiators within the ranks of the House of the Chosen. These peerless battlefield tacticians tirelessly train with a variety of rune-forged weapons and are unmatched in martial combat. They are much more stocky than their ossein skeleton companions; garbed in anything from simple small clothes to full sets of imposing boneplate armor. They are, as stated, almost exclusively in service to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;; seen as the hallmark warriors of the house. Peerless battlefield tacticians, gladiators are unmatched in martial combat and train with a variety of rune-forged weapons.\nThe gladiators make their appearance predominantly in the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; as part of the forces of Baroness Draka and Baron Mograine, though they also make up the treasonous host of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;, who usurped the House of the Chosen from Krexus after slaying him.\nScientists.\nA form very reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the scientists of Maldraxxus are a semi-common form of undead that specialize in scientific pursuits. These mad surgeons typically give their employ to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and the now-fallen House of Plagues. They are typically accompanied either by vicious abominations and beasts of flesh, or plague-formed monstrosities as a result. Most carry backpacks with containers of plague upon their back, as well as numerous vials and potions from their unstable concoctions. Most unsettlingly, their heads are typically wrenched open; containing domes of what seem to be plague fluid or their exposed brains.\nLiches.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, liches are scheming skeletal sorcerers who use &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their potent magic and practice their craft primarily in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; had been manipulated by her new Baron, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn was in service to &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, causing a civil war within Maldraxxus and helping an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiches are virtually identical to their Azerothian counterparts, including possessing a phylactery that allows them to reincarnate as long as it is not destroyed. They have been found working for houses outside of the House of Rituals, such as the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbominations.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, the corpses of the slain are brought to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, where the finest pieces of flesh and bone are skillfully assembled into a new form. These reanimated monstrosities are given a new purpose in a body that is greater than the sum of its once separate parts. Constructs have formed the backbone of Maldraxxi armies in more wars than anyone can count. A well-constructed body can turn any &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; into a potent frontline weapon. These abominations are far more advanced than those of the Scourge, being fully sealed, sometimes possessing extra mouths, and, most notably, being capable of far greater intelligence. Indeed the leader of the House of Constructs is an abomination, Margrave Gharmal, with intelligence fully suited to match its station.\nUnlike Azerothian abominations, Maldraxxi abominations come in all shapes and sizes, with some resembling &lt;a href=\"Plague%20eruptor\"&gt;Plague eruptor&lt;/a&gt;s, while others resemble &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of these abominations have been found working for houses outside of the House of Constructs, such as &lt;a href=\"Ansid%20the%20Mechanic\"&gt;Ansid the Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, who works as a member of the House of Eyes.\nAranakk.\nThe &lt;a href=\"aranakk\"&gt;aranakk&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; belonging primarily to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. They once served as the house's master &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s, but with their &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; lying in ruins, they now find themselves bannerless nomads. However, they still retain their sense of purpose and are willing to share their secrets for a price. A &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; historian speculated that the aranakk were created long ago specifically for their purpose to be spies for Maldraxxus.\nSome Aranakk have been found outside of the House of Eyes, with a number of them working for the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;. Under &lt;a href=\"Thread%20Mistress%20Leeda\"&gt;Thread Mistress Leeda&lt;/a&gt;, they appear to be providing the silk used for stitchwork that the house uses.\nBoneguards.\n&lt;a href=\"Boneguard\"&gt;Boneguard&lt;/a&gt;s are a type of powerful, skeletal Maldraxxi construct. Summoning one of these beings requires a large amount of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. Successfully summoning one and defeating it is the test of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; for the ritualist's mantle.\nBoneguards appear most dangerously as an ascended form of another soul, as seen with &lt;a href=\"Mortanis\"&gt;Mortanis&lt;/a&gt; who transforms himself from a necromancer into a boneguard, and with &lt;a href=\"Thanikos\"&gt;Thanikos&lt;/a&gt;; who is forcibly changed from a &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; into a boneguard as &lt;a href=\"Thanikos%20Spinerender\"&gt;Thanikos Spinerender&lt;/a&gt;. In the latter case, Thanikos was capable of being controlled by another Maldraxxi. Some are considered elder spirits of Maldraxxus itself, like &lt;a href=\"Carcaeus\"&gt;Carcaeus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoneguards appear to be the precursors to the similar-looking &lt;a href=\"bone%20wraith\"&gt;bone wraith&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul-rotted fleshes.\nSoul-rotted fleshes in Maldraxxus are amalgamations of countless fallen warriors, these monolithic guardians make the earth beneath them tremble with every step they take during their patrols. Should outsiders be foolish enough to invade Maldraxxus, they will find themselves cowering in fear before these behemoths.\n&lt;a href=\"Champion%20Bloodrot\"&gt;Champion Bloodrot&lt;/a&gt; is a soul-rotted flesh champion that takes part in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; with other contestants.\nThe fact that soul-rotted fleshes are amalgamations of many fallen warriors makes them similar to abominations.\nUnique.\nNot all Maldraxxi share a template. Some have managed to craft for themselves unique bodies. Some notable characters &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; took forms that resemble what they looked like in life. Vashj was given the opportunity to return to a night elf form, but opted instead for a take on her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; appearance, preferring the way people treated her when she was a naga over a handmaiden. The margraves, &lt;a href=\"Krexus\"&gt;Krexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sin%27dane\"&gt;Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gharmal\"&gt;Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akarek\"&gt;Akarek&lt;/a&gt; all have unique variants of the most iconic form their own house uses.\n&lt;a href=\"Mordretha%2C%20the%20Endless%20Empress\"&gt;Mordretha, the Endless Empress&lt;/a&gt; has a skeletal naga form.\nIn the explosion that destroyed the House of Plagues &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Stradama\"&gt;Margrave Stradama&lt;/a&gt; was transformed into a monstrous new form, while others in the explosion have become mindless &lt;a href=\"slime%20giant\"&gt;slime giant&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Scrapper%20Minoire\"&gt;Scrapper Minoire&lt;/a&gt; a lich melts into a form of an &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Neena\"&gt;Neena&lt;/a&gt; a former worgen requested a construct form in a shape of a &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, something that her Margrave didn't want to give her.\n&lt;a href=\"Beckoned%20Wraith\"&gt;Beckoned Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"War%20Wraith\"&gt;War Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s in Bastion also appear to be types of Maldraxxi.\n&lt;a href=\"Micromancer%27s%20Mystical%20Cowl\"&gt;Micromancer&lt;/a&gt; from Maldraxxus has the appearance of a gnome skeleton with a necromancer headgear and staff.\nNotable.\nIn addition to the current leadership or prominent members of the armies of Maldraxxus, in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Trench\"&gt;Iron Trench&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Faded%20Epitaph\"&gt;Faded Epitaph&lt;/a&gt;s are placed to memorialize fallen Necrolord heroes.\nOther creatures.\nCreatures that can be formed from fallen Maldraxxi:\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Newcomer\"&gt;Dead Newcomer&lt;/a&gt;s could be an indication that forms given to new souls that arrive in Maldraxxus are skeletons.\nAs Maldraxxus is home to the forces that were called upon by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; this could mean that the undead of the Scourge and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; could be considered forms of Maldraxxi."}

Here she calls on &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; to assist her in their efforts to stir the once noble shal'dorei to action against the tyranny of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the destructive occupation of the Legion.\nLy'leth is cunning and brave, and seizes any significant opportunity when it arises in an attempt to aid the resistance from within &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s inner circle. She remembers that the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; are both noble and brave and seeks to remind those under the oppression of their ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; heritage of standing defiantly against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their House and rank, House Lunastre intentionally chose to live on the other side of the city, away from the majority of their peers in the nobility. Ly'leth continues to do so after her father's death as she finds the nobles' general attitude distasteful. While this is not the case for every noble house, it highlights Ly'leth's true nobility.\nLy'leth sees herself as continuing the legacy of her late father &lt;a href=\"Ran%27thos%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ran'thos&lt;/a&gt;, in contrast to her sibling &lt;a href=\"Anarys%20Lunastre\"&gt;Anarys&lt;/a&gt;, who is loyal to Elisande. The divide between the two is great: Anarys sees Ly'leth as a traitor who endangers everything her father worked for, while Ly'leth believes Anarys does not realize what he truly died for.\nHistory.\nResistance.\nLy'leth Lunastre lived as a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Lunastre\"&gt;House Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; aristocracy prior to the end of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s 10,000 year-long isolation following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ran%27thos%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ran'thos&lt;/a&gt; and sister to &lt;a href=\"Anarys%20Lunastre\"&gt;Anarys&lt;/a&gt;, Ly'leth was a well-known socialite among the ruling class, often organizing large parties and remaining a fashionable member of the nobility, though she did not share their often haughty and arrogant attitudes.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Suramar City and the nightborne people, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, chose to make an alliance with the demons to preserve her nation. Though an attempt was made to depose Elisande in a coup led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; occurred, it would ultimately fail, with Thalyssra barely escaping the city with her life.\nWhile many nightborne supported the Grand Magistrix and her decision (especially within the nobility), many others felt she had made a terrible mistake. Lady Ly'leth, now head of House Lunastre, stood firmly albeit not openly against Elisande's demonic pact when it was made, viewing the Legion as a major threat to the nightborne civilization. Ly'leth also held no love for Elisande herself, in whose service her father had recently died under questionable circumstances. Despite these misgivings, Ly'leth was powerless to act following the failed coup and the demons' occupation.\nWhen First Arcanist Thalyssra began a fledgling resistance faction from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; outside the city, she sent &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a trusted ally&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;, a spell-fencer, in Suramar City with the goal of finding more sympathizers within the city. Silgryn would ultimately arrange for Thalyssra's agent to make contact with Ly'leth during one of her masquerade parties. Upon their first meeting, Ly'leth was engaged in a heated argument with her sibling Anarys, who remained steadfastly loyal to Elisande. With her new ally's help, Ly'leth was able to detain her sibling, after which she crafted &lt;a href=\"Masquerade\"&gt;an illusion spell&lt;/a&gt; that disguised the adventurer as Anarys, allowing them to traverse the city in disguise while also not alerting anyone to the real Anarys's disappearance.\nLy'leth subsequently proved to be a vital ally to the Nightfallen resistance, using her family's formidable connections and influence to oversee many of their most important operations throughout Suramar City, though she took great care to keep this association a secret. She would aid the resistance in organizing covert the distribution of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; among the starving citizens of the common districts, by helping them make contact with the tavern owner and merchant &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, and later the vintner &lt;a href=\"Margaux\"&gt;Margaux&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, Ly'leth would also be the one to mastermind an infiltration of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of assassinating the Grand Magistrix during a ball; she herself provided the transport for the rebel agents by boat. Though the plot failed to kill Elisande herself, it did result in the deaths of a number of key supporters, most notably &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough a member of a very prominent noble family, Ly'leth had shown little interest in political maneuvering throughout her life. Despite this, she agreed to run for a newly-available position on Elisande's inner council, and in this capacity provide vital information to the rebellion. She quickly set about securing the support of the other nightborne noble houses with the aid of an agent of Thalyssra. Although a close ally of Ly'leth and House Lunastre, &lt;a href=\"Aurore\"&gt;Lady Aurore&lt;/a&gt; of House Astravar found herself and her family intimidated by &lt;a href=\"Coryn\"&gt;Coryn Stelleris&lt;/a&gt;, who also sought the position of advisor. Ly'leth's agents would ultimately rescue &lt;a href=\"Ailen\"&gt;Ailen Astravar&lt;/a&gt; from his Stelleris captors, and in doing so win Aurore's vote.\nAt the same time, Ly'leth also carried out a plot to have the rival nobleman &lt;a href=\"Ruven%20Duskmere\"&gt;Ruven Duskmere&lt;/a&gt; killed, while framing his murder on Coryn Stelleris. The scheme was a great success, effectively turning House Duskmere and House Stelleris against one another. Following this, Ly'leth found herself with the required support to win her bid. She attended the ceremony bestowing the title in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; herself present. In the middle of the event, however, Coryn Stelleris suddenly confronted Ly'leth, accusing her of treachery and challenging her to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27ashar\"&gt;Tal'ashar&lt;/a&gt;, an honor duel to the death.\nLy'leth would nominate her champion to fight in her place, and they would ultimately emerge victorious against Coryn atop the Sanctum of Order. With her position now secured, Ly'leth ascended to her new rank of magisterial advisor, and was relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nLy'leth continued to direct resistance operations within the city in secret, especially those throughout the Noble District aimed at the &lt;a href=\"felborne\"&gt;felborne&lt;/a&gt; and loyalist aristocrats. She also ordered the assassination of several loyalist lieutenants to consolidate the power of the Nightfallen position within the city.\nInsurrection.\nNow in a high-ranking position within the palace, Ly'leth quickly began to relay sensitive information to the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; leaders in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, using a magical image of herself to deliver the messages. When &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt; goes missing after the massacre at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, it is Ly'leth who managed to find a lead on him and requested Thalyssra to meet her at her &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; immediately. There, she conveyed the dire news that Vanthir was set to be made an example of to the populace, and the rebels quickly moved to rescue him.\nAfter weeks of sending regular updates to Shal'Aran, the rebels abruptly lost contact with Ly'leth. Unbeknownst to them, the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; had established a secretive specialized scrying post on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Terrace of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, from which they could monitor and intercept magical messages being sent from the Nighthold. Ly'leth's subsequent messages never got through, though they contained an important warning: Elisande and &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt; (the new First Arcanist) had been working on a new time spell that threatened to stop the Nightfallen invasion in its tracks. Now aware of her treachery, the Grand Magistrix's forces seized and imprisoned Ly'leth deep within the palace.\nAfter the rebels' march on the Nighthold was halted by Elisande's time spell, Thalyssra and her allies sought answers by attempting to find Ly'leth's missing messages. They quickly discovered and raided the Duskwatch listening post, and learned what she had intended to convey. Though Ly'leth's warning came too late, she did provide vital information on an alternate entrance to the Nighthold &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Depths\"&gt;underneath&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;. With this knowledge, the rebels immediately went about infiltrating the palace via this new opening.\nAs the Nightfallen champions began their second attack on the Nighthold, Ly'leth remained in a cage near the &lt;a href=\"Captain%27s%20Quarters\"&gt;Captain's Quarters&lt;/a&gt; in the upper reaches. Though she spitefully insisted to her jailer, &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt;, that her allies would soon rescue her, the latter merely laughed in Ly'leth's face. The champions would, however, succeed in defeating Aluriel as they battled further through the palace, and eventually liberated Ly'leth herself from her prison. She then rejoined the other rebel leaders gathering in the main plaza in preparation before the final push to secure the Nighthold.\nNew alliances.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s demise and the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, Ly'leth and the other &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; to establish a new regime over the city. Under Thalyssra's leadership, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; would go on to &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;join&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; following the Legion's final defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Ly'leth would remain in the Nighthold and meet new nightborne &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; preparing to venture out into the world for the first time.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nLy'leth was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nSuramar storyline.\nQuite a view, isn't it?\nCourt of Stars.\nIt should fool the gibbering, wine-soaked guests, but a keen eye could see through it.

She appeared in various places on &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; and also briefly in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;.

After being freed by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;order hall leader&lt;/a&gt;, Lyana said she was there on a mission to slay the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azoran\"&gt;Azoran&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, as she was flying over the northern side of Felsoul Hold's crater during her infiltration, she was shot down from her &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt; and captured. It seems she was merely accompanying a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; in their hunt for &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis&lt;/a&gt;, while she had her own task to do.\nShe revealed that Azoran planned to use the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; in Felsoul Hold known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Lightbreaker\"&gt;Lightbreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" to destroy &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. To stop him, she needed her &lt;a href=\"warglaive\"&gt;warglaive&lt;/a&gt;s that were lost during her fall from the sky. Weakened from her imprisonment, she asked the order leader to retrieve them for her. She also asked them to gather fresh fel-infused flesh from felfire basilisks nearby.\nThe order hall leader was then asked to place the fel flesh at &lt;a href=\"Grimwing%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Grimwing the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;'s altar. Grimwing was a formidable demon and the strongest of the felbats of Felsoul Hold. Once slain, the order leader brought her head to Lyana, who was forcefully interrogating a &lt;a href=\"wyrmtongue\"&gt;wyrmtongue&lt;/a&gt; servant of Azoran. The demon had information that would lead to those in charge, however he was much more afraid of his master than he was of Lyana. As such, she asked the order leader to retrieve Legion emblems, that the most powerful Legion soldiers always carry, in order to show them to the wyrmtongue to scare him. The order leader was also asked to free from their cages those that the Legion would sacrifice to power their soul engines.\nBefore the proof of his powerful kin's demise, the wyrmtongue revealed that there was a portal leading to the \"Lightbreaker\". However, it was locked to those without the keys. The first key shard was held by the &lt;a href=\"ered%27ruin\"&gt;ered'ruin&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Vorgos\"&gt;Vorgos&lt;/a&gt;, residing within the Fel Breach at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt;. The other half of the key was held by &lt;a href=\"Kozak%20the%20Afflictor\"&gt;Kozak the Afflictor&lt;/a&gt;, a demon &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt; who could be found in the prison quarters known as the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Eclipse\"&gt;Halls of the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; in the lower portion of Felsoul Hold.\nThe shards retrieved, they were locked into position next to the deactivated portal. Swirling &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy collected around the shards, filling the room with an ominous, dark presence. The dark writhing of fel energy surrounded the order leader as it collected near the portal. The portal opened, and the path to Azoran was clear. Lyana warned the order leader that they wouldn't have much time before the Legion was made aware of their presence on the ship: when the alarm would be raised, countless Legion forces would attempt to board the ship through this very portal. Lyana vowed to guard the portal from enemy reinforcements until the order leader returned.\nThe order leader thus boarded the \"Lightbreaker\" and killed the surprised Azoran.

She is encountered in the area that once housed the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Hall\"&gt;Crimson Hall&lt;/a&gt; within Icecrown by &lt;a href=\"Mage%23Fire\"&gt;fire mages&lt;/a&gt; seeking to claim the legendary sword.\nBiography.\nLyandra is a distant relative of the deceased &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the last king of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Though she bore the Sunstrider name, in truth her branch of the family held no claim to the throne. After the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Lyandra became obsessed with finding the royal elven runeblade &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; to claim it for her own and validate her claim to the Sunstrider throne, despite &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; telling her that it was a fool's errand. By the year 32 &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas had apparently not heard from Lyandra for several years.\nLyandra eventually discovered that after Felo'melorn was lost by Kael'thas, it had been taken to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and that it resided there still. She made her way through the empty, labyrinthine halls of the citadel until she found the blade mounted upon a dais at the end of a dismal passage. Just as she reached out to claim the sword, however, the door slammed shut behind her, trapping her within. Before long, Lyandra was raised as an undead minion of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who entrusted the blade to her to aid in battle against the Burning Legion.\nWhen the Legion returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas Sunreaver decided to begin his own search for the location of the blade. He saw a vision of Lyandra with Felo'melorn in hand, surrounded by land covered in ice and with Icecrown Citadel looming behind her. Thus, Aethas contacted &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that assisting in recovering the blade would convince the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to allow him re-entry into &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Modera, in turn, contacted a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who thereafter journeyed into Icecrown Citadel, fighting their way past the minions of the Scourge and finally confronting and defeating Lyandra with Aethas' aid. After Lyandra's death, Aethas commented that \"An inglorious stain upon the Sunstrider name has been cleansed.\""}

It leads to &lt;a href=\"the%20Iron%20Hall\"&gt;the Iron Hall&lt;/a&gt; past a magically sealed door. A lyceum is a place of learning, so this is presumably where the dark irons come to hear speeches or lectures from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Senate\"&gt;senators&lt;/a&gt; and their emperor.\nThis room is filled with vast numbers of non-elite, low hp dwarves, linked in groups of 10 or so. These dwarves are on a fast respawn cycle, with a number of patrols wandering through the area. On the far side, the doors to the Iron Hall stand locked and unpickable. Two braziers flank the doors, each guarded by a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;. Two flamekeepers are within the room at any one time, with about 8 possible spawn points spread around the room. \nTo enter the Iron hall, you must loot two torches from two &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Flame%20Keeper\"&gt;Shadowforge Flame Keeper&lt;/a&gt; (one torch per dwarf), and use it to light the two braziers. These are five minute duration, unique, BoP items, that are consumed on use. Once both braziers are lit, the doors open, and the NPCs of the Lyceum stop respawning.\nThe key to this room is to stay together and keep moving, to avoid undue aggro and the (approx) 30 second respawns. Even low level aoe is very useful here, such as a paladin's consecration. Have loot set to free for all, to make torch looting easier.\nSome parties will send a single rogue or druid to kill each flamekeeper and loot the torches, while the rest of the group works their way to the braziers. This is risky because if the stealth class aggroes extra mobs, they will often die, leaving four players to do the work of five. The risk is not worth the lack of reward.\nA better tactic is for the party to stay together, staying to the right wall, until they reach the right brazier on the other side of the room. Rogues are useful here: be on the lookout for the patrols, ready to distract them. There is a safe area on the braziers' platform where approximately lvl 55+ players are safe from the constant respawns and patrols, where the party can rest. From here they work around to the left brazier, where there is a similar safe spot. You may also want to make a macro with /target Shadowforge Flame Keeper to help find the flame keepers.\nAt this point you will have covered nearly half the spawns of the flamekeepers, and will have otherwise located them."}

{"id": "15155", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15155", "title": "Great Dark Beyond", "text": "The Great Dark Beyond, also known as the Great Dark, Great Beyond, Dark Beyond, or cosmos, is described as the physical universe, an infinite realm composed of innumerable &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; civilizations. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is found in it, and it is merely one of the countless worlds drifting through the Great Dark. Its counterpart is the astral plane called the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It was built and shaped by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe physical universe is governed by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, while the forces of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; hold sway over every living thing in it. Pure &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; dwell in a realm outside the borders of reality, but shades of their presence can be found in the Great Dark. The &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s serve as the basic buildings blocks of all matter in the physical universe. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s traveled through the Great Dark Beyond searching for others of their kind.\nIt is essentially the name given to outer space in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nBefore life began and before even the universe existed, there was only the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The Light existed as a boundless sea of living energy, swelling across all of existence, unfettered by time and space. Yet as the ever-shifting sea expanded, pockets of cold nothingness appeared. From these spaces, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; coalesced. The Void quickly grew and began to move against the Light, and before long, the mounting tension between the two forces ignited a series of explosions that ruptured the very fabric of creation, giving birth to the physical universe.\nThe energies released from the clashing of Light and Void raged across the nascent cosmos, forming countless primordial worlds. For long epochs, the ever-expanding Great Dark Beyond broiled in a maelstrom of fire and magic. Shards of Light were flung throughout reality, suffusing worlds with the spark of life. Various types of energies came to be (such as death).\nThe most unstable energies coalesced into the astral dimension known as the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Light and Void collided and bled together at the edges of this realm, throwing it into turmoil. Although the Twisting Nether existed outside the borders of the physical universe, its volatile energies would occasionally tear through the veil of the Great Dark, flooding into reality and warping creation.\nGreat Dark Beyond vs. Twisting Nether.\nThe Twisting Nether is the astral plane between worlds. It is a chaotic and magical environment that overlaps with the Great Dark Beyond, yet is normally imperceptible to mortals.\nThe roles of both have not been clearly confirmed yet. For example, in the novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; explained to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were denizens and rulers of the Great Dark, and referred to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; as a gateway that bridged two nodes residing in the Twisting Nether. Later Warcraft material consistently referred to demons dwelling in the Twisting Nether. However, if the information Medivh gave the young Khadgar is to be considered accurate, then the Twisting Nether could be an alternate dimension or a \"hyperspace\" of sorts where the conventional laws of physics, time, and space do not apply, and thus allows for instantaneous intergalactic travel.\n&lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, in at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, referred to the Great Dark in much the way later sources established the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, so we can assume it was an error or a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;. The usage of &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; and Great Dark was more ambiguous in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt; than in later games. Though Aegwynn claimed to be responsible for defending &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from forces in the Great Dark, later sources clearly established that her duties dealt with the Nether.\nIt is possible that Aegwynn chose to use Great Dark instead of specifying the Twisting Nether because her duties extended to defending Azeroth against harmful entities that are not solely restricted to the Twisting Nether. Indeed, it is chillingly possible that there are forces in the Great Dark that rival the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and are yet unknown to the powers that vie for Azeroth.\nArgus.\n&lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; was said to be located on the brink between the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the Great Dark. Some &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; say that Argus is the mightiest world in all of the Great Dark. Despite this, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Thousand%20Years%20of%20War\"&gt;A Thousand Years of War&lt;/a&gt;\" later stated that Argus is fully shrouded by the Twisting Nether.\n&lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements%23The%20Skull%20of%20the%20Man%27ari\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt; confirms that Argus was in the Great Dark before Sargeras came. As there is the fact that time passes differently in the Nether, the statements in the novel and the audiodrama confirm that Argus moved from the Great Dark to the Nether over time.\nOutland.\nOutland has been said to be located in the Twisting Nether and the Great Dark Beyond.\nUnits of measure.\nThe physical universe is governed by a set of conventional laws of physics and space, with &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; being a construct of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Order%20and%20Disorder\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen debates on cosmology began on Azeroth, scholars quickly tumbled to an obvious question: where does it end? If Azeroth is surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and separated from other material worlds by the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, what lies beyond the boundaries of the Nether? The result eventually agreed upon, as much a philosophical placeholder as an answer, is the Great Dark Beyond. Neither black nor white, hot nor cold, living nor dead, with a beginning hard to define on the chaotic fringe of the Nether and an end impossible to define: the Beyond is all that is unknowable about the cosmos. Were part of it to be journeyed or defined, it would become its own plane \u2014 leaving the Beyond on its horizon, eternal and all encompassing."}

The ancient artifact had long lain hidden in the earth, before Gul'dan's magic led him to it. The orcish Horde then began to excavate the portal, removing the earth surrounding it to reveal the still-upright gate. The origins of the gate prior to its discovery by Gul'dan are unknown, although he was almost certainly guided to it by a fel-corrupted . It was Medivh who taught Gul'dan about the gate, making the invasion of Azeroth possible.\nThe excavation site was so vast that the entire could have fit within only its smallest fraction, and all could have run shoulder to shoulder through the gate itself. The two hooded figures set each side of the gate were each the height of one hundred orcs. The portal's left column was left attached to an outcrop of the massive excavation site, although the rest of the structure stood unsupported. Despite not being built by orcish hands, the structure was cluttered with scaffolds and lifts to ferry the many orcs working on the portal. In order to power the opening of the portal, many cages containing draenei prisoners were placed around the structure, including some children. \nThe Dark Portal was first opened by a fel-possessed Medivh, who would not remember his actions in the event until much later, with the assistance of from the Draenor side. The exact involvement of Medivh is unclear, but likely involved the correct incantation to make the opening of the portal possible, responsible for the green glow that appeared around the frame prior to the opening of the portal itself. For his part, Gul'dan served to provide fuel for the portal's magic - namely the life energy of a huge number of imprisoned draenei, killed in seconds by the warlock's fel magic. As the draenei's life was drained agonisingly away, blue-white swirls of energy could be seen to funnel toward Gul'dan, who after a moment basking in its power, directed it toward the portal, causing it explode into a pulsating, emerald green, which quickly blurred into the colours of the sky and trees above the other side of the portal.\nThe Azeroth-side of the Dark Portal was first created as a temporary gateway without frame, set horizontally into the marshy earth of the . The opening of the temporary portal caused the immediate area to be destroyed, and nearby trees to topple into it. The portal lasted only a number of minutes, during which time the 's warband passed through it into Azeroth; after this it vanished, leaving a barren area where it had been.\nTravelling through the portal was a strange, weightless journey through a dark tunnel, with the destination at first only a pin-prick of light at its end. The travellers span and wheeled past each other, strange currents pulling at them, as objects from both sides met in the dark expanse. The sounds of the worlds at each end were muffled, with blinding blasts of light punctuating the darkness. 's journey triggered the premature delivery of her child, , more than a month in advance; he was stillborn.\nA stone portal mirroring that on Draenor was later built by the orcs who had arrived through the temporary one, with the intention of bringing the rest of the Horde through to Azeroth. The figures on each side were intended to depict Gul'dan's \"benefactor\", in fact the hooded Medivh. The portal and its statues were built fairly crudely out of rocks found in the surrounding area, but still bore a striking resemblance to the Draenor-side gate, no doubt due to Gul'dan's directions.\nA possessed Medivh later spoke the incantation to open the finished portal, but was killed before it could become permanent, although many orcs did pass through. The dying Guardian, freed from his corruption, then used his dying breath to open a temporary portal between the Black Morass and a location just outside Stormwind city, for the human army and prisoners to pass through, but was only able to keep it open for a few minutes before expiring.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the Great Gate are currently unclear, as is how and why it became buried beneath the sands of Draenor. It was clearly familiar to the possessed Medivh, and was also known to the , as shown by ' response to . Khadgar read of the gate, including a prophetic depiction of the orcs climbing out of the temporary portal in the Black Morass, in a tome stolen from , which he was guided to by the ancient entity . A scribbled note on the margin of that page bore the cryptic message \"From light comes darkness, and from darkness, light. Ask Alodi.\", and her response to the term \"dark portal\" (see below) strongly indicates a familiarity with the gate.\nName.\nThe portal is termed the \"Great Gate\" by , apparently translating from &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, since the same name is used by the other orcs in their own tongue. It is often referred to more generically as a portal or gate. \nWhile exploring the tome he stole from Karazhan, Khadgar reads the phrase \"a 'great gate'\" in relation to the portal. However, when he confronts the Kirin Tor he refers to the gate as \"the Dark Portal\". When Antonidas repeats the term beside Alodi, saying \"For you to mention it in the same breath as the dark portal is too much to be mere-\", the ancient cubic artifact opens, seemingly awoken or unlocked by the portal's mention. Khadgar's use of the term suggests that the name was mentioned in the stolen tome, while Alodi's response could show a specific familiarity with the name, although the entity was certainly intelligent enough to understand what the term referred to without having previously heard it."}

Off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the island-prison of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; is another point of contention between the two main power, who are constantly fighting for control. In an unspecified location on the Great Sea lies &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;, which hosts the mysterious and slightly sinister &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; on the first week of every month.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; are found between the Maelstrom and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;; they are part of the remains of the former central lands of ancient Kalimdor around the former night elven city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and they became the entrance point for the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; were major scenarios during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, and around this time &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; itself became a battlefield between the two main forces and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Other locations on the Great Sea, such as the &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%27Abim\"&gt;Tel'Abim&lt;/a&gt;, are largely unexplored, but may await travelers in the future. &lt;a href=\"Third%20Fleet%20shipwrecks\"&gt;Third Fleet shipwrecks&lt;/a&gt; are also found on the bottom of the Great Sea."}
