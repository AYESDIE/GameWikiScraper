The father of three daughters, Bolten has seemingly promised his realm to one of their husbands should they be pleased to take up the mantle. Yet when Bolten leaves on a campaign, his nephew- &lt;a href=\"Morelan%20Vanyst\"&gt;Morelan Vanyst&lt;/a&gt;- is always left as regent. When the hidden continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was discovered, Bolten assisted the Alliance in the region.

Upon Varian's return, Bolvar was named the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt; sent to take the battle to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. After the treachery of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar was thought to have been killed by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was saved and reanimated by the flames of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s but charred beyond recognition.\nBolvar's body was altered by the dragons' flame, and was taken by the Scourge into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where he was tortured by &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to bend him to his will. However, the noble spirit of Bolvar resisted the Scourge lord's depravations. After the death of Arthas, Bolvar demanded that &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; place the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; on his bald, ashen head and turn him into the next Lich King to contain the threat of the Scourge. This imprisoned Bolvar within the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; once more. After the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Icecrown Citadel to defeat Bolvar and destroy the Helm of Domination, ending his tenure as the Jailer of the Damned and opening the path to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAs a boy, Bolvar was impressing his &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; mentors with his determination and noble spirit. &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras&lt;/a&gt; heard of this feat.\nThird War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; hit &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar sent his daughter &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, who he called \"my shining star\", to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to be raised away from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Taelia would be accepted as a ward of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and raised by the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, who was hand-picked by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; himself. Bolvar regularly sent Taelia letters while they were separated. It is not certain exactly how many details &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; knew of this, but he did know Bolvar wrote to his child and of the nickname.\nRegent of Stormwind.\nAfter King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; went missing under suspicious circumstances while en route to a diplomatic summit to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray. Young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind, at the behest of the royal councilor, &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. Highlord Bolvar Fordragon acted as Regent Lord of Stormwind or the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin. When &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; gave warnings of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20orc\"&gt;Blackrock orc&lt;/a&gt;s allying with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar was debilitated from sending Stormwind's thinly spread troops to aid &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; without proof. Bolvar sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to Lady Prestor, who knew much of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lady Prestor thought very little of Magistrate Solomon's claims and advised against providing the military aid. Though Bolvar respected Lady Prestor's stance, he could not let Solomon's plight go unheeded and thought of a compromise to appease all parties: Bolvar deputized the Alliance adventurer and empowered them to solve Solomon's problems.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; found evidence of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; being involved in King Varian's disappearance and had a powerful ally in Stormwind, she sent the evidence to Bolvar. With their newfound patronage and apparent role in the king's disappearance, Bolvar saw no choice but to plan a renewed offensive against the Defias. While Bolvar sought to pursue the Defias and their backers until King Varian's return, Lady Prestor tried to belittle the issue as just baseless speculation and a waste of Stormwind's resources.\nMarshal &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; apparently had warned Bolvar of Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery but Bolvar would not act against her without proof. Despite Bolvar's good intentions he unwillingly became Onyxia's pawn, his mind and body being held captive after she physically put the &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20the%20Dragon%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Dragon's Eye&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; around Bolvar's neck, in order to make him more compliant and susceptible to her influence than the rest of the kingdom leadership. The medallion also gave him glimpses into the dragon's own mind.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar was still acting on Anduin Wrynn's behalf and quickly came to an unprecedented agreement with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions would combine the might of their armies, as the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to strike back against the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, which later led to an Alliance counterattack, as Bolvar Fordragon recruited Alliance heroes who raided &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, facing all the twisted abominations inside the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;archlich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon was seen in the welcome parade in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, escorting the recently found and returned King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, he noticed a change in King Varian whenever he was around Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. King Varian that returned became more frivolous, uninterested in matters of state, and deferred to Lady Katrana's judgments on rulings that would have in the past, offended the king's sense of honor. Changes that even the young Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; noticed as well. Although these changes are new in the returned Varian, it was clear that the returned king still harbored an undeniable love for his son. Under Prince Anduin's insistence, Bolvar investigated the circumstances of King Varian's abduction. Aside from his investigation, Bolvar also had to keep Prince Anduin safe and tried to keep the kingdom and the Alliance from falling apart from Lady Katrana's harmful advice.\nOne day, in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was on a visit and was discussing war plans against the orcs and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; with King \"Varian\" and Bolvar Fordragon. However, Varian Wrynn was counseled by Lady Katrana Prestor to not send troops to help the dwarves fight against the dark irons, who have recently taken &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. King Magni left disappointed in Varian's subservience to Lady Prestor's wishes and his dishonorable demeanor. Bolvar tried to keep relations with King Magni amicable by explaining to him that he could not understand how Thandol Span had fallen as he thought he had ordered a contingent of reinforcements to the area. It was only until Lady Katrana chimed in that she revealed that she had rescinded his orders.\nThe Highlord continued to watch over Prince Anduin until Marshal Windsor returned to the keep with another King Varian named \"Lo'Gosh\". Marshal Windsor revealed Lady Katrana to be the broodmother &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. With Onyxia's ruse uncovered, several Stormwind Guards transformed into &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; to defend their matriarch; leading to a fight in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin, who heard the commotion, ran off to investigate the ruckus. Highlord Bolvar followed in pursuit and joined the battle to secure the keep. During the battle, the Dragon's Eye was broken, freeing Bolvar for good from Onyxia's grasp. The heroes of the Alliance managed to secure the keep but unfortunately, Onyxia got away with Prince Anduin as a hostage. The two King Varians, whom Bolvar noticed had certain parts of the original King Varian's personality, left Bolvar in charge of Stormwind while they led an army to slay Onyxia and rescue the prince.\nUsing the blood of &lt;a href=\"General%20Drakkisath\"&gt;General Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance heroes transformed the broken pendant into the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and used it to bypass the powerful wards protecting &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt; and slay her. Afterward, the amulet was returned to Stormwind, where it was locked away by Bolvar in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent anyone else from using its manipulating magic.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s return, Bolvar aided in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; against a surprise &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge attack&lt;/a&gt;. As the attack had sent both factions into a righteous fury, Varian mobilized the Alliance armies and commanded Bolvar Fordragon to eliminate the Scourge. The army under his control was dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, and upon reaching Northrend, it established a beachhead on the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; started out under the command of Bolvar, until he left to command the siege at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"General%20Arlos\"&gt;General Arlos&lt;/a&gt; replaced him at the head of the town.\nAt some point during the war, Bolvar established &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, from where he led a first crushing assault against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the Lich King sent &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and Bolvar later assisted the adventurers in defeating the lich and undead ground commander &lt;a href=\"Thel%27zan%20the%20Duskbringer\"&gt;Thel'zan the Duskbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; called upon the Alliance and the Horde to aid them against &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spell-Weaver&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar was not inclined to accept the idea of diverting resources from the conflict against the Lich King. Eventually, he accepted because it was necessary, and members of the Alliance were sent to put an end to the threat.\nAfter Malygos' death, the Horde and the Alliance refocused on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where Bolvar and &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;, waged separate campaigns against the Scourge, pushing the undead armies farther back into the Dragonblight. Both commanders quickly realized that a victory for one faction was a victory for all against the Lich King, and when one side attacked the undead, the other would \"coincidentally\" order their own forces to draw the Scourge's attention on another front. A grudging mutual respect formed between Bolvar and Dranosh, and their subtle attempts to coordinate attacks were remarkably effective. Though their efforts took the Horde and the Alliance in different directions, they eventually met at Angrathar.\nOnce the Wrath Gate was secured, neither Bolvar nor Dranosh would allow the other to claim all the glory, and both sides eventually gathered on the field of battle to attack the Scourge's defenses. Slowly, Bolvar and Dranosh cleaved their way to the foot of Angrathar, where they confronted the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself. During the encounter, in which Dranosh fell to &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, a plague explosion rang out among the Alliance and Horde army, and out came &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;. He announced to the Scourge leader that the Forsaken had neither forgotten nor forgiven him, and a number of catapults moved behind him and launched an unprovoked attack on both Alliance and Horde forces as well as the Scourge. Bolvar ordered his troops to fall back, but was brought down by the gas. As he gasped his last breaths, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza%20the%20Life-Binder\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt; and her red dragons arrived and breathed cleansing flames across the battlefield, searing away the poison from the air and the plagued flesh from the bodies, leaving only charred remains.\nWhen the smoke cleared, Bolvar's body was missing, while his shield was later recovered by Alliance adventurers at the behest of Alexstrasza and returned to King Varian Wrynn.. Consequently, the Forsaken attack was considered by the Alliance to be outright treachery on the part of the Horde, giving King Varian\u2014who had considered Bolvar a brother\u2014a reason to purge the Horde from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged, Varian led Alliance forces in a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to bring Putress to justice. At the time, it was thought that Bolvar died of the plague or in the fire, but his fate was far more difficult, and a lesser man could not have withstood it.\nFall of the Lich King.\nAs the forces of the Horde and Alliance made their way into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Bolvar had been captured by the Scourge, having been saved by the flames of the red dragonflight which had also horrifically charred him beyond recognition. After being recovered by the Scourge, he was &lt;a href=\"Immolated%20Champion\"&gt;tortured mercilessly&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Lich King's extensive efforts to corrupt him, Bolvar refused to yield.\nWhen Tirion Fordring and his champions faced the Lich King atop Icecrown Citadel, they discovered the disfigured Bolvar Fordragon, suspended by chains above the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nJailer of the Damned.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King, was slain, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; warned that an uncontrolled Scourge would be all the more dangerous. For the good of Azeroth, \"there must always be a Lich King.\" Somebody would have to take Arthas's place. &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; took up the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, the crown of the Lich King, preparing to do it himself. As he did so, Bolvar intervened, calling from his seat upon the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, his body warped by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s fire and his mind scarred, he could never walk among the living as he once did. As a last act of service to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar asked that Tirion place the Helm of Domination on his head. As the self-appointed \"Jailer of the Damned,\" Bolvar sought to keep the Scourge under control for the sake of Azeroth. As Bolvar encased himself and the Frozen Throne once again in ice, he warned Tirion that no one could know what happened. Bolvar instructed Tirion to tell the world that the Lich King was dead \u2014 and that Bolvar Fordragon died with him.\nAs the armies of the Horde and the Alliance withdrew from Northrend, assuming that the undead were no longer a threat since the death of the Lich King, Bolvar Fordragon was struggling to maintain control over the endless ranks of undead. The Lich King had directed them to make war upon the living, and it was difficult for him to quell their aggression. Bolvar fought to maintain his sanity, he had been a mighty paladin all his adult life, but the moment he had donned the Helm of Domination, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; had abandoned him. His new necromantic powers warred with his sense of justice and righteousness, and it took nearly all his strength to keep the undead contained, including the remaining Val'kyr until they were freed by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; also continued to operate independently in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, while pockets of the Scourge managed to break free of his control, following the Lich King's old directives to attack anyone on their path.\nBoth of these cases were a result of Bolvar struggling to control his new powers. The incident with Sylvanas, in particular, made him realize how dangerous the power of the undead was should they fall into the wrong hands, and he resolved to not only contain the Scourge but also guard against any intruders from the outside world who would try to steal their power for themselves.\nThe only thing that Bolvar's daughter &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; was told about her father's fate was that he gave his life to defeat the Lich King. Bolvar thought about Taelia and her mother every day that he sat on the Frozen Throne.\nWarlords of Draenor.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to find something that would allow the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the secrets of the Frozen Throne.\nLegion.\nSeveral years before the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyandra%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Lyandra Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Icecrown to locate &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; and was killed by the remaining Scourge within the citadel. When a mage adventurer arrives on request of &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; to locate Lyandra and Felo'melorn, Bolvar states that the mage can try to take the sword, but if they fail they too will join the Scourge.\nThe Lich King and the Knights of the Ebon Blade came to an agreement: the death knights would serve as the arm for his vengeance against the Legion, and in return, he would keep the Scourge contained in Northrend and help the death knights locate powerful weapons to combat the demonic invasion. Bolvar directed death knights to &lt;a href=\"%3AApocalypse\"&gt;:Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3AMaw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;:Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, but was heavily involved in the &lt;a href=\"%3ABlades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;:Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Calling a champion of the death knights to Icecrown, he had the champion gather the shards of Frostmourne, defeat tortured souls that had remained within the shards and reforge them into two new blades. As one final test, the champion had to enter the blades and quell the darkness inside. Within the shards of Frostmourne, echoes of Ner'zhul and Arthas could be found with Ner'zhul tempting Arthas to take up Frostmourne.\nAs each of the three &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s were obtained, Bolvar brought the death knights to the Frozen Throne and bestowed his blessing upon them. Under Bolvar's orders, the Ebon Blade were to follow the artifact wielders' orders as if they were his own.\nThe Lich King exclaimed that the greatest heroes of Azeroth had gathered to face the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, heroes that stood alone against that threat would not save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for salvation would come at a price that the living could not pay. He thought of planning to recreate the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; for their own to stand against the Legion. The first among them was &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen general of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Followed by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; upon the cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; in the fallen kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, for his prowess strength in battle was without rival and shall be even more powerful in undeath. Then &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to his knowledge was a priest whose personal tragedy forged an intense connection with the Light and her zealous power of will is necessary to strengthen the bond of the Four. Yet, there was one who needed to be appointed for the crucial role: someone to lead. Without a leader, there would be no unity among the Four. The Deathlord, Darion, and the three horsemen traveled to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to recover the body of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; who had &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore%20%28quest%29\"&gt;recently fell in action&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"We%20Meet%20at%20Light%27s%20Hope\"&gt;brought to the tomb underneath the chapel&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, they failed and with Darion's sacrifice he opened a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; back to . The Lich King has decided that the fate of the deeds of his &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition for he has sacrificed more for the Ebon Blade than any other. The Four Horsemen were assembled with Darion leading them.\nLegionfall.\nThe Deathlord returned to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to claim &lt;a href=\"%3ARimefang%27s%20Harness\"&gt;:Rimefang's Harness&lt;/a&gt;, but the Lich King explained that invading vrykul were trying to use it to bind &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s to their will. He ordered the Deathlord to slay them in his name.\nAtop of &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, he tells the Deathlord that the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; showed him many things that he could not comprehend. In a vision, he saw thousands of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; marching to the far reaches of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in search of a great power. Every time he reached out through the cold tendrils of endless ice, he sensed nothing. He then tells the Deathlord to go to the end reaches of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to be shown of what he saw. Once there, he described it as the undead swarming across an icy shelf, seeking a prize coveted by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;: the bones of a dragon most ancient, and powerful beyond reckoning. Yet all that remains here is the sea, and he doesn't sense any trace of undead in the area. Curious, he told the Deathlord to go seek out the dragons that reside at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trizormu\"&gt;Trizormu&lt;/a&gt;. After strangulating the dragon, &lt;a href=\"Tariolstrasz\"&gt;Tariolstrasz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; hurls the Deathlord out of Wyrmrest. The Lich King then says that dragonflight knows something, for they kept secrets within the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. He proclaimed to the Deathlord either spare the dragons, or slay them. If you do kill them all, he mentions to you that you are empty inside just like him.\nThe red dragon named &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;Kyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; fell doing battle with \"a great corruption\" on an &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Glacier\"&gt;iceberg to the north&lt;/a&gt;. The Lich King tells the Deathlord to find it and consume this life essence, blight it, and raise it into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. He comments when the Deathlord arrives at the Lost Glacier that their supplies have likely frozen. Interestingly enough, he senses feral undead buried in the ice and declares it is time to test the Deathlord's will. He warns that should the Deathlord fail to survive that he shall claim Acherus as his own, though while Arthas may &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Ebon%20Hold\"&gt;have sought revenge on the citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar has other plans. Upon arriving at &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kyranastrasz' Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the Deathlord approached the corpse of the ancient dragon on the hilltop and . They then raised it and claimed it as their own.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the late Warchief of the Horde, sought to find out who had told him on his deathbed to name &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; the new warchief. He had come to believe it was not the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; that did so but in fact something darker and stronger. Vol'jin, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, and a Horde adventurer traveled to the Frozen Throne to confront the Lich King about it. The Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Furthermore, the Lich King informed Vol'jin that he had been altered more than he realized and that as neither undead nor damned he did not belong in the Frozen Throne. The Lich King sent &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s after them, forcing them to flee.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar had the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; acquire fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and following its completion raised a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights as his champions. He formally told these death knights that it was their burden and privilege to defend Azeroth while being forced to endure the scorn of the ignorant. He then ordered them to speak with &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and use his death gate to travel to the land of the living in order to choose their destiny.\nWe Ride Forth.\nBelieving that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would seek to become the Lich King, Bolvar employed a daring gambit. He deceived the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; into thinking that he had fallen under the dark powers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; so that when Sylvanas inevitably confronted him, the horsemen would arrive soon after and finish off the winner. When Darion prematurely attempted to kill him, Bolvar forcibly controlled the former's body and made him return to , while taunting him about requiring his fellow horsemen. As he anticipated, Darion rallied his fellow horsemen for battle, while he was confronted by Sylvanas. Unbeknownst to Bolvar, the horsemen were able to use their connection with him to witness him fighting Sylvanas, and subsequently learn about his gambit.\nShadowlands.\nDespite tapping into the Helm's power and attempting to use abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Remorseless%20Winter\"&gt;Remorseless Winter&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; spikes to destroy Sylvanas during their confrontation, neither Bolvar nor the Scourge forces he had slowly gathered to Icecrown were enough to stop her. After winning the battle, Sylvanas took the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, causing Bolvar to remark that it would be her prison as he assumed she intended to don it and become the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;lord of the Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. However, Sylvanas countered that the world itself was a prison and split the helm in two\u2014thereby piercing the veil between Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;\u2014after which she declared that she would set everyone free. Sylvanas' actions have brought about a series of events that threaten to upset the cosmic balance between &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;; however, Bolvar believes that the denizens of the Shadowlands are the key to restoring this balance.\nFollowing his defeat, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; brought Bolvar to . Bolvar's daughter Taelia learned that he was still alive and that he had, until now, been the Lich King. Though angry that no one had told her, she vowed to join her father's side.\nAfter the rift between the Shadowlands and Azeroth was opened, members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were called to Icecrown Citadel. Aboard the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, they and &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Lord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; went atop the Citadel where the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon, were waiting. The Highlord explained how dire the situation was and directed the adventurers to use the shattered fragments of the Helm of Domination to conjure a portal into the forbidden depths of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Bolvar later managed to travel to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Darion and other Ebon Blade death knights.\nTaelia later reunited with Bolvar in Oribos and pleaded for him to use the Helm to seek out his old ward Anduin as well as their other allies, who had been captured by Sylvanas within the Maw. Despite his initial reluctance, as such attempts seemed to be costly and dangerous, Bolvar was eventually moved by his daughter's repeated pleas, and he agreed to honor the request of his \"Shining Star\". He subsequently was deeply troubled by the vision he expressed, though declared that they must not give up hope.\nBolvar personally directed the efforts to rescue the captured leaders from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and had &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s turn to &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; for aid. After they returned with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar remarked on their bravery but warned that it was only the beginning. He then implored them to return to Torghast in order to discover information in regards to the whereabouts of the others. After they returned with &lt;a href=\"Soul-Touched%20Key\"&gt;Soul-Touched Key&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar remarked that the presence was familiar, and believed that the holder of the key may have been involved in the capture of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. After concluding his research, he confirmed that Jaina was being held within the tower, and then had them rescue souls and acquire objects from &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Ve%27ken\"&gt;Ve'ken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Ve%27nott\"&gt;Ve'nott&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain information for the search for Jaina.\nWith all the information in hand, he had pinpointed Jaina's location and sent his allies to rescue her. With Jaina safely in Oribos, Bolvar turned his attention to Thrall and Anduin. Thus, he sought to discover if the other captives had seen their whereabouts. Though heartened to learn that Thrall still lived, he feared for Anduin and declared that \"Darkness hungers for his soul.\" He then directed the rescue of Thrall; however, he warned that each time he gazed into Torghast, he sensed malevolent eyes staring back. Despite the growing risk, he knew that they could not relent.\nThough Baine, Jaina, and Thrall had been liberated, Bolvar was of the opinion that the Jailer holding any hero of Azeroth meant he had power over all of them. Thus, he sought clues to Anduin's location, and though they found signs of Anduin's presence, they did not find Anduin himself. Fearing that they could spend a lifetime searching the tower's endless corridors to no avail, Bolvar knew the best chance to find Anduin was to peer into Torghast with the helm once more. After discovering that Sylvanas and the Jailer intended to turn Anduin into a weapon, Bolvar warned that they must be careful in their rescue efforts, as the Jailer may discard Anduin if he believed his prize was in jeopardy.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of the Jailer, Bolvar felt a darkness calling to him within Torghast. By focusing his mind, Bolvar was able to learn that a new mourneblade was being forged within the tower. Though Calia was worried over the effects that peering within Torghast would have on him, Bolvar declared that they must know the truth. He and his allies thus learned that the Jailer had decided that, regardless of Anduin's choice, he would be turned to their side, a task left to Sylvanas. Though the vision ended on an ambiguous note as to whether Sylvanas would respect Anduin's refusal or forcefully convert him, Bolvar declared it dire news, thus suggesting that Bolvar felt Sylvanas would turn Anduin by force.\nAs Bolvar told his allies that the link was severed, the Jailer, through the Helm of Domination, attempted to turn Bolvar into his service. While Jaina and the Maw Walker were able to severe the connection, the Jailer revealed that the Lich King was always meant to herald his coming, and declared Bolvar and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;predecessors&lt;/a&gt; were failures for their defiance of him. After thanking his allies, Bolvar agreed with Jaina's assessment the Jailer would use their knowledge of Anduin's fate against them. Though Baine called for an outright attack on Torghast to rescue Anduin, Bolvar agreed with Thrall's and Jaina's decision to hold back and rally the covenants. He thus implored the Maw Walker to continue their efforts and declared that when the time came, they would claim victory.\nChains of Domination.\nAfter the Archon was attacked and her sigil stolen by the Jailer via the dominated Anduin, Bolvar called upon the Maw Walker to inform them of what had occurred. In response Bolvar joined the covenant leaders ( &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;the Arbiter's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;chambers&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting Bolvar and the other leaders vowed to stand as one and defend the Jailer's next target: &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the covenants rallied together to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Ardenweald\"&gt;defend&lt;/a&gt; Ardenweald from Sylvanas and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar joined the assault and ordered &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to defend &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in his absence. During the battle the Winter Queen deceived Sylvanas into thinking that her sigil was with her, when in reality she had placed it within the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. However, Bolvar and Jaina discovered that this deception ultimately failed as the mind-controlled Anduin claimed the sigil. After returning to Oribos, Bolvar declared that they must launch a counter-attack before the Mawsworn could strike again. Agreeing with his proposal, &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; declared that they must open a gateway to the Maw, and to that end directed the Maw Walker with returning to the Maw and discovering a second waystone in order to establish the connection.\nAfter the Maw Walker successfully connected &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; to Oribos, Bolvar and the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance\"&gt;Death's Advance&lt;/a&gt; entered and established themselves at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. Bolvar then directed the Maw Walker with collecting information from the scouts and heeding the call of their allies, in order to see no stone is left unturned and no ally of the Jailer left alive.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; was driven out of the Maw by the Maw Walker and &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, they reported directly to Bolvar. Though he found this knowledge good, he was troubled upon learning that &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; were working together within &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to Bolvar's concern, an angered Draka swore to slay him and avenge &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt;, causing Bolvar to remark his eagerness at seeing the Maldraxxi forces in action. He then directed the Maw Walker, with aiding the convents in attacking the Maw.\nDuring their travels within Korthia the Maw Walker encountered two &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kin%27tessa\"&gt;Kin'tessa&lt;/a&gt; who deceived the Maw Walker into leading her to &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Kalo\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Kalo&lt;/a&gt; by appearing as &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20Kah-Than\"&gt;Caretaker Kah-Than&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azodius\"&gt;Azodius&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to kill the Maw Walker. Though Kin'tessa was successfully able to bring the Fatescribe to the Jailer, the Maw Walker killed Azodius and brought &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Azodius\"&gt;his head&lt;/a&gt; to Bolvar. Bolvar was unsettled and confused to learn that agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; such as the Nathrezim were within Korthia and working for the Jailer. After remarking on how the dreadlords were masters of infiltration and illusion, Bolvar declared that their forces must remain vigilant and warned the Maw Walker to stay alert, as the nathrezim could be anywhere.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; and the Maw Walker recovered the Sigil of the Primus, they turned to Bolvar to see if he could recognize the magic bound within it. To Bolvar's surprise, he recognized the magic as coming from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and thus implored the Maw Walker to bring the sigil to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;. The following sequence of events restored the Runecarver's shattered memories, restoring to him his identity as the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, and led to a brief battle with Zovaal and the Mawsworn that ultimately ended with Zovaal claiming the Primus' sigil. After the Primus ventured to Korthia, Bolvar turned to him to set their course against the Jailer and was informed that Zovaal must be faced within &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;his sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, but that a wise strategist always prepares contingencies. Thus Bolvar further informed that should the mortals fail to stop the Jailer, then the covenants must remember its purpose, find its future, and forge new sigils that could be used to pursue Zovaal, should the assault fail. Bolvar was then ordered to send words to his allies within Oribos, that they must defend the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;'s sigil at all cost.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Thenios\"&gt;Thenios&lt;/a&gt; confided to Bolvar his belief that &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; may never heal due to missing a fragment of his soul, as a result &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; killing him, Bolvar revealed that he had seen visions of where such vessels were kept. Furthermore, Bolvar warned that retrieving it will prove perilous, as the Jailer kept his treasures well guarded. To that end, Thenios turned to the Maw Walker for aid, which started the series of events that ended with Uther restored and the Kyrian sigil being restored.\nHaving taken the Primus' words to heart, Bolvar called upon the Maw Walker and their allies to invade the Sanctum of Domination, defeat Sylvanas Windrunner, and save Anduin Wrynn. When they did so, Bolvar joined them in the conflict. Despite defeating the likes of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nine\"&gt;The Nine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was able to stall them long enough for the Jailer to absorb the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; into his being. Bolvar was then briefly controlled by Zovaal through the use of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic before he was released after Sylvanas, who realized that the Jailer never intended to not to break the system of Death and give everyone free will as she had believed, but to forge a new reality where all would be forced to serve him, attacked him. In response, Zovaal reunited Sylvanas with the missing fragment of her soul before leaving with the mind-controlled Anduin, and thus allowing Bolvar and his allies to imprison Sylvanas. \nIn the aftermath, Bolvar lamented that the Jailer had succeeded, still had Anduin by his side, and prayed that the now captive Sylvanas had the knowledge that could give them the edge in stopping the Jailer.\nEternity's End.\nUther the Lightbringer later examined Sylvanas' soul and found that it was divided and that she could not wake up while it remained that way. Jaina, Thrall, and Baine argued that it was best if she stayed that way, but Bolvar reminded them that she was the only one who could tell them about the Jailer's plan and how to save Anduin.\nJourney to Zereth Mortis.\nWhen the time came to follow the Jailer to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus opened a portal for a Maw Walker so they could go through, find a foothold, and allow the covenant forces to follow. Although the portal was disabled by a Mawsworn attack, the Maw Walker managed to reopen a connection between Zereth Mortis and Oribos, allowing Bolvar and the others to come through to &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; brokers, where they could begin the work of stopping the Jailer and saving Anduin. Bolvar sent Ebon Blade scouts to survey the realm, and ordered Darion to lead covenant forces against the Mawsworn at the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the Maw Walker spied on them from the east. They discovered that the Mawsworn were &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;dominating&lt;/a&gt; the realm's &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; to open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and that nathrezim had infiltrated the Ebon Blade's ranks. Bolvar sent the Maw Walker to find out why covenant reinforcements he'd sent hadn't reached Darion, which turned out to be the work of the disguised nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, who stalled the Maw Walker long enough for the Jailer to use the Forge of Afterlives to enter the Sepulcher and take Anduin with him. Bolvar wasn't discouraged and told the Maw Walker to focus on more immediate problems while they looked for another way into the Sepulcher.\nUther later came to Haven to deliver the news that Sylvanas had awoken. The highlord argued that it was too risky to trust the banshee, but Uther claimed that he'd make sure Sylvanas didn't betray them again. Either way, Bolvar's more immediate priority was to enter the Sepulcher. The Enlightened &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ara\"&gt;Elder Ara&lt;/a&gt; agreed to help by taking the Maw Walker on a pilgrimage. Once she'd done so and the way into the structure was opened, Bolvar met up with Jaina, Uther, and Sylvanas at its entrance to discuss their course of action. Sylvanas stated that they needed to find a way to resist the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat him, and that Anduin might be the key. After Uther convinced Jaina to cooperate, the four headed into the Sepulcher together.\nThe Crown of Wills.\nThe heroes managed to free Anduin and bring him back to Haven, but he didn't know how to counteract the Jailer's Domination. Bolvar asked &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; to bring the intact half of the Helm of Domination to Haven, and the Primus suggested that they should experiment with it to find a way of resisting Domination. Bolvar and Taelia disliked the idea considering all the damage the helm had done, but Bolvar believed it was worth the risk. After the Maw Walker tested that the helm still worked on Darion, Bolvar sent them to seek out &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Eru\"&gt;Elder Eru&lt;/a&gt;, an Enlightened he'd heard about, so she could tell them about how to use the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Eru revealed that he language could offer resistance to Domination and that complex phrases from it were stored in vaults in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus knews this wouldn't be enough, however, and worked on finding something more while sending Bolvar, Taelia, Darion, and the Maw walker to the Sands with the intact half of the helm.\nDarion stayed behind at the &lt;a href=\"Deserted%20Overlook\"&gt;Deserted Overlook&lt;/a&gt; while the Fordragons and the hero fought through the Mawsworn occupying the area to reach the vaults and infuse the phrases into the helm. As the trio fought, father and daughter bonded, with Taelia telling Bolvar about how she'd been taught by &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; in his absence. She also asked if he'd ever thought about her and her mother during his time as the Lich King, and he replied \"Every day\". Once the phrases were gathered and imbued in the helm, the Primus asked the group to go to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, where memories could be drawn out and expunged and where those who had suffered from Domination in the past could infuse the memories of what had allowed them to resist into the shards of the helm. Bolvar went first, gazing into his memories of the burning agony he'd suffered at the Wrathgate before infusing his resistance into the shards, all while Taelia cheered him on. Afterward, Bolvar told the Maw Walker that he felt lighter and that he hoped Taelia would remember what she saw: that he was not some lone figure locked away, but someone who does what is necessary for the good of all. Although it wasn't easy, all of the shards were eventually infused. Bolvar and the others brought the helm pieces to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; in Torghast to give them to the Primus, who used the language and the memories to reforge the Helm of Domination into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument allowing them all to become resistant to Domination. The Primus then stored the Crown away until it was needed and told the heroes to focus on the Jailer's defeat.\nBolvar and Taelia returned to Haven, where they exchanged words in private. Taelia reflected that she didn't know what she wanted to start asking of her father, and that things had been much simpler when she thought he was simply a dead hero. She told him that if she'd known of his true fate, she would have sought him out in Icecrown, but Bolvar insisted that this was why she hadn't been allowed to know: to keep her and the rest of Azeroth safe. Taelia retorted that this hadn't just been Bolvar's own sacrifice, but a sacrifice by everyone who loved him as well. Bolvar replied \"I know\", and told his daughter that he hoped she could one day forgive him for the pain he had caused her.\nThe Jailer's fall.\nSome time later, the Maw Walker and Pelagos started helping the &lt;a href=\"Automa%23Oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt; create a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to replace the one the Jailer destroyed. Bolvar asked the Maw Walker to keep him apprised of any developments. In the end, it was Pelagos himself who became the new Arbiter, allowing him to stop the flow of souls to the Maw. Bolvar commented that this was only one step toward restoring balance to the Shadowlands and that they needed to continue strengthening their position in Zereth Mortis and drive out the Mawsworn. Along with Uther, Jaina, and Sylvanas, Bolvar returned to the Sepulcher of the First Ones with the Maw Walkers to pursue the Jailer to the innermost section, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Design\"&gt;Grand Design&lt;/a&gt;, where the resistance granted by the Crown of Wills allowed the Maw Walkers to defeat the Jailer at last.\nAfterward, the only thing that remained before balance could be restored to the Shadowlands was to bring Sylvanas to the Arbiter so she could be judged for her past crimes. Bolvar traveled to the Crucible to give the Crown of Wills to Pelagos and observe the trial alongside Taelia, while the Maw Walker went to meet up with Uther so they could escort Sylvanas to the Crucible together. After the trial, Bolvar and Darion discussed how the Ebon Blade needed to continue keeping the rampant Scourge on Azeroth in check. Bolvar suggested that he could return to Icecrown to prevent the citadel from falling into the wrong hands, but Darion disagreed, saying that the Ebon Blade would protect the fortress and that Taelia needed her father.\nSometime later, Bolvar was approached by Taelia, who admitted that while she would never agree with his choice to hide the truth that he was still alive, she understand why he did so, and that he didn't mean to hurt her. Bolvar remarked that, at the time, he believed that he would be trapped forever as the Jailer of the Damned, holding the Scourge, and dared not hope for anything more. She then revealed that when the helm was broken, with his freedom came the fear, the fear that the daughter he loved with all his heart would behold him, and see only a monster. Taelia was then quick to reassure him that she only saw the hero he was and the father he could be, if he was willing. Bolvar subsequently promised that he wouldn't waste this second chance.\nQuests.\nZereth Mortis.\nLater:\nLater:\nLater:\nStart:\nEnd:\nQuotes.\nAfter suffering betrayal at the doorstep of his nemesis, a brave paladin was reborn in the searing heat of enchanted dragon flames.

While he does his best to look after &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s interests, he seems to have fallen under the charm of the alluring &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, much like many others in the kingdom. By deferring to her judgment, he has allowed for some crucial gaps in the defenses of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;-controlled territory.\nLady Katrana Prestor and Lord Bolvar Fordragon serve as the king's main advisors, and they pretty much call the shots. Bolvar is a good man, and a damn good fighter. The thing is, he is not one to insult the judgment of an \"educated\" lady like Katrana Prestor. That is a problem, because it seems like her advice is pretty much the exact opposite of anything a logical person with half a brain would come up with. For whatever reason she has managed to keep both King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Lord Bolvar following her directions, and some of them are clearly nonsense.\nBolvar leads his troops well, and he is a great boon to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces when he is out in the field. He is one of the few who is aware that the true king of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, is probably alive\u2014and missing. This is one of the justifications for keeping most of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind's army&lt;/a&gt; centralized; Katrana has convinced Bolvar that the boy King, Anduin, will be the next target of whoever captured or killed the real King on his diplomatic mission. It is suspected that Varian was captured because his trip to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; signified an effort to make peace with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of forces wish the fighting between the Alliance and the Horde to continue.\nIn his RPG art, Bolvar is seen with the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; symbol, hinting he might come from that kingdom.\nIn the TCG.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon is featured in the &lt;a href=\"TCG\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt; set &lt;a href=\"Servants%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Servants of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;.

Like Grenades and Mortars, bombs typically have a secondary effect (&lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt;) as well as damage. They cannot be used while moving. When bombs are &lt;a href=\"use\"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt;d, a green targetting symbol appears on the ground that can be moved around. The targeting symbol becomes a red 'no' symbol when moved out of range. After acquiring a valid target, click to throw the bomb.

Notoriously fragile, the shock of launch sometimes causes the aced bomb to shatter and splash over the crew attempting to fire it.\nBeehive bomb.\nA beehive bomb is a cubic, wooden framework surrounding a thin shell of waxed clay filled with gunpowder and iron caltrops. A timed fuse lit just before the bomb is launched at its target ignites the beehive bomb, causing an explosion that hurls the sharp clatrop \"bees\" at targets in all directions.\nBoomshell.\nTinkers oftenf fret when they discover much gunpowder is loaded into a boomshell. Boomshells are so large that they often have wheels and handles attached to their shells to allow them to be asily maneuvered into place. The detonation of the gunpowder on impact not only does massive damage to whatever it strikes, but deafens any creature within its splash.\nGas bomb.\nA gas bomb is created by loading a clay container with powdered lime, rotten eggs, and a sickening brew of other ingredients that explode in a foul-smelling cloud upon impact. like acid bombs, the shell of gas bombs are known to shatter while being launched, sending siege weapon crews fleeing from their own weapon.\nSunstone.\nSunstones were created to cheaply incapacitate as many opponents as possible. The thick clay shell of a sunstone usually survives impact, only burst seconds later when its times fuse ignites a charge of gunpowder and a large amount of phosphorus that burns so brightly that all within its splash radius are blinded."}

{"id": "108555", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=108555", "title": "Bombardier", "text": "Bombardiers are another form of &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s. The name is also used to designate soldiers having the responsibility to drop &lt;a href=\"explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; weapons from a flying mount or vehicle, such as a &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes the bombardier himself is able to fly, such in the case of the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nA bombardier is a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20class\"&gt;hybrid class&lt;/a&gt; containing abilities of the &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;/demolitionist, and &lt;a href=\"mortar%20team\"&gt;mortar team&lt;/a&gt;s. The bombardier is the highest practitioner of the art of things that go boom. Meticulous planners with a frenzied need to blow things up, most bombardiers are a haphazard mixture of forward-thinker and absent-minded tinker. A bombardier learns the fine art of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; sapping. He is capable of sapping a wooden structure with &lt;a href=\"explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt;s. Using tips from dwarven demolitionists and mortar teams, the bombardier learns to sap stone or metal. He is able to reduce the hardness of wood, stone, and metal structures for the purpose of blowing them up.\nHe can learn the art of making a bomb travel further with the ability to make the bombs bounce. It triples the range of the explosives the bombardier throws. Bombardiers are experts at assessing critical timing, especially when setting up explosive devices, nothing distracts them from setting a delay. An expert bombardier can precisely time grenades and other thrown or fired explosive device without delay, down to a specific initiative number in the initiative sequence. A master bombardier can apply his knowledge of architecture and engineering to position or aim the explosives to increase the damage of a placed and planned explosion.\nGrenade throwing and bomb chucking are the bombardier's favorite sports. While the more clumsy bombardiers discover quickly that throwing well is crucial, talented grenade throwers usually find a way to put a spin on a toss for interesting effects. The bombardier can lob bombs ignoring low cover and targeting beyond it. Expert bombardiers can perfect a spiraling seeker toss. Using the bomb's own spin as a way to direct the explosive device, the bombardier can ignore any type of cover except for total cover.\nAs a bombardier perfects his skill with explosives, he can upgrade an explosives device. With upgrades, he can double the explosive force of bombs or grenades without increasing the size or weight of the device. An expert bombardier is capable of spending time upgrading an explosive device, and can maximize the construction of the bomb so that it always does the maximum amount of damage possible.\nThe master bombardier will sometimes remain close enough to an explosive to supervise a precise detonation. He has to watch the explosives very closely before they go off. This action will typically kill the bombardier, but sometimes the bombardier escapes unscathed."}

Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks. Just don't let them shoot you down, too!\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nYou take out their stacks of fel cannonballs yet?\nCompletion.\nWell, well, well, I guess you had it in you after all. Good work. Maybe Old Man Keller was wrong about you after all.\n&lt;Sky Sergeant Vanderlip smirks.&gt;\nNotes.\nThe single most important thing to do, when preparing for this quest, is have the bombs available easily. Whether you do this by having a bag open, or use a hotkey, or use an action bar slot makes little difference.\nThe bombs for this operate much like any ground-targetted AoE device - like grenades, like dynamite, like the bombs used in Nagrand PvP, like the bombs used in &lt;a href=\"Fires%20Over%20Skettis\"&gt;Fires Over Skettis&lt;/a&gt;. You click on the item, then move the \"do this on\" cursor over the ground. If you are too far away, you will get the red \"circle-and-slash\" image where your cursor is. If you are close enough, you will get a green cursor that displays the targeting radius. Click again to fire your bomb at that location.\nAs you approach the Forge Camps while mounted (on a flying mount), the Fel Cannons will start tracking on you, and after a second or two, start to fire a set of fel fireballs in your general direction. Generally, at least one will be close enough to your line of travel that you will need to maneuver. If you are struck, you are dismounted and pushed in the direction the cannonball was travelling. You also take a couple thousand points of damage over several seconds from the fires. You may be able to use a slowfall method (parachute cloak, spell, etc.) to prevent some of the damage.\nA typical tactic:\nThis both changes your flight path (to avoid the fireball that would intercept you) and increases range between you and the cannons. If you do get shot down, though, your distance above the ground is greater, and thus the potential damage is greater. But it does give you better odds of not getting shot down.\nIt has been mentioned that approaching a little bit above the cannons helps in avoiding the incoming fireballs. Also, you can hear the cannons fire. When you hear them fire, you know it's time to shift your position.\nNote that if you are not mounted, you will not be fired upon. If you are mounted, even if you are still on the ground, you will be fired upon. This provides a second successful tactic.\nIt is worth noting that the speed of the elite mounts is such that dodging the cannon fire is very much easier than on the slower flying mounts.\nAlso, while the bombs have a fairly short range, you can start to change direction\u2014and even move out of the 'normal' cast range for them\u2014as soon as the cast bar appears. This is very helpful if you are on a 60% speed mount.\nHelpful macro.\nThe following macro can make the quest easier to coordinate from a user standpoint - it adds \"using\" the skyguard bombs to your attack button, so if you have the bombs, you can hit your attack button (generally #1) to throw the bombs while flying. The macro will not interfere with normal attacking, even if you have the bombs in your inventory. You can also add additional items to the macro - it will only use the ones that you have. Other similar quest items are the \"Arcane Disruptor\" from Culling of Stratholme, and the \"Skyguard Blasting Charges\" from the Skettis Egg-bombing daily."}

The bomb section seems to be held by a separate robotic section with a claw, but the two parts may be connected beyond that.

It could also be speculated that the Lich King (or Arthas Menethil) could have been inspired by the tales of bards or folklore in Lordaeron and/or Azeroth about these constructs, and chose to create or perfect it himself.\nThe more likely origin of these creatures is the boneguards of Maldraxxus within the Shadowlands, with multiple entities drawing inspiration from glimpses of these constructs."}

{"id": "214457", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=214457", "title": "Rock borer", "text": "Rock borers are rare worm-like beasts that dwell underground in dry, rocky areas.\nIn the RPG.\nThey dig narrow, barely noticeable lairs and lurk near natural caves and passageways, bursting forth when they sense any sort of motion passing by their hiding place. As a result, they almost always attack with surprise.\nRock borers are normally slow moving, patient creatures, except when disturbed or when hunting. They are stationary for over 90% of their lives, generally moving only to mate or to seek a new place to lurk in wait for food. Only when exceptionally hungry do they actively hunt. A starving rock borer attacks anything that moves.\nA typical rock borer is 20 to 25 feet long, about a foot in diameter, and weighs about 400 pounds. Rock borers almost never stretch out to their full length, instead coiling their hind end (or leaving it in the ground) and raising the forward portion of their body up in the shape of an \"S\". This, and their thinness, makes them look smaller than they actually are, allowing them to sometimes surprise opponents with their exceptional reach.\nRock borers prefer to lie in wait for prey to pass by before bursting from their holes. While lurking, they are almost impossible to detect, although (depending on the terrain and lighting) an explorer might identify their presence by the small, largely refilled tunnels they leave behind when burrowing. Once out of their holes, or if encountered while on the move, rock borers try to back into corners where their superior reach gives them the advantage. If hard pressed, they retreat by burrowing.\nRock borers lurking in groups within individual burrows can\u2019t communicate with each other, keeping their holes some distance apart. Thus, an attack typically commences with no more than one or two of the nearest borers bursting forth to attack passersby. In the following round or two, the remaining borers may join the fight, having been alerted by the sudden onslaught of their fellows.\nA rock borer can use its burrow speed even through the hardest of natural stone, since its acid softens the stone momentarily as the borer passes through."}

They can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nRock Flayers are one of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s indigenous species. Many careless wanderers have been killed by the primitive humanoids who roam the slopes and peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in murderous packs. Though they primarily hunt smaller mountain animals, they are not afraid of stalking potential prey that is much bigger than they are. There are accounts of packs of rock flayers taking down even mighty &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; that had wandered into the rock flayers' territory. Their vicious blade scythes and climbing claws are so sharp they can even cut through sheer rock, enabling the rock flayers to climb the most difficult overhangs with ease. Even for a predatory species, they are extremely fast and very aggressive. In addition to their homeland in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Blade's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, rock flayers can be found in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe young are hatched from eggs, however, it's unknown if only the matriarch lays the eggs or if any females are allowed.\nThe rock flayers seem to contain a gland that allows them to control &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s at least allow them to work together. It's possible the rock flayers could see them as pets, or share some kind of other relationship with them.\nA brash &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; once tried to enslave rockflayer younglings as his personal soldiers. Pieces of him are still scattered across &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern anthropologists had hoped would reveal the origin of the rock flayer. They were disappointed, as only &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Flayer%20Island\"&gt;Rock Flayer Island&lt;/a&gt; displayed any rock flayers.\nAppearance.\nFlayers have six limbs: two pairs of arms and one pair of legs. One pair of arms is notably bigger than the other, which is closer to the body than the bigger ones. Flayers have no hands, but rather long, scythe-like claws that it uses for defense and scaling rock. Rock flayers also have long tails that end in scorpion-like stingers. Adult flayers are distinguishable from younger ones by their size and horn-like growths on their backs and shoulders. Adults also have bigger arms and claws than the younger ones. In areas where crystal growth is abundant, the flayers have developed the peculiar growth of crystalline shards from their backs and shoulders.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Youngling\"&gt;Flayer Youngling&lt;/a&gt;s can be captured in pet battles on the border between &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although the timer for the boots is rather short, any slowfall affect will continue your forward speed until you land. Using these mechanics together a player can use the Rocket Boots Xtreme to great effect. An example of the uses of this tactic is using the rocket boots and Parachute Cloak (or, other slowfall item) in Warsong Gulch. Players can cap the flag and then run towards the graveyard where the ledge is. Once there the player can jump over the entire battle to their own side in seconds.\nAs of patch 2.4, using the boots while carrying the flag will cause the flag to drop. Using the boots and then picking the flag back UP hasn't been confirmed to work, but might very well do so.\nRocket Boots Xtreme also deal a nominal amount of damage after the effect runs out, so using them at the proper time can be used as a CC breaker for an ability like Polymorph (instead of the more traditional \"run real fast\" idea).\nTrivia.\nThe buff you gain from using the boots (Rocket boots engaged!: Ludicrous Speed!) references a scene from the Star Wars parody Spaceballs."}

Rocketspark periodically unleashes a Missile Barrage, damaging all players. If Borka's Mad Dash strikes Rocketspark at that time, it will disrupt his Missile Barrage.\nStrategy.\nPauli will use his jetpack to zoom around the battlefield firing rockets while Borka attacks directly. After a while Pauli will stand atop some boxes and fire a missile barrage. Stay spread out to avoid excessive damage. Following the barrage Pauli will fall down and be temporarily stunned, taking extra damage. At this point, dps should switch from Borka to Pauli. DPS should focus on Borka until Pauli is stunned. Borka's Slam attack is an AOE attack that interrupts spells. In addition, Borka uses Mad Dash on a random player which should be avoided. If Pauli dies first, Borka will gain an increase in damage and attack speed. The party should be ready to use cooldowns to endure the damage and burn Borka down.\nQuotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Not putting up a fight, Uther resumes his march.\"\n\"Anduin climbs the stairs to &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt;, where the court awaits.\"\n\"Anduin speaks with restrained rage.\"\n\"With Anduin's emphasis on \"key\", the Archon realizes something, baring her teeth and drawing her spear in the same moment.\"\n\"Anduin's voice begins to change...\"\n\"The four paragons draw their weapons on Anduin and run in to engage.\"\n\"Anduin summons Kingsmourne, tip down, and smashes it into the ground. The shockwave knocks back the paragons, binding them with chains. The statue behind the Archon shatters, while she shields her face with her left hand for a moment before recovering. A look of shock crosses the Archon's face as Anduin, now looking very much like Arthas Menethil in &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; form \u2014 with silver hair and glowing blue eyes \u2014 leaps out of the black smoke at her. Mid-jump, his armor changes color from his traditional gold to the blue-and-grey of the Mawsworn.\"\n\"Though the Archon draws her hands in an attempt to block, Anduin runs her through with Kingsmourne. On her back, the sword draws the crest of her power from the Archon, the sigil of the kyrian. Anduin's eye glow fades for a moment as he seems to recover control of his mind, horrified at his actions, but the runes of his armor light up and appear to reinforce the Jailer's will. He pulls out the sword, looks up at what's left of the statue, and turns to walk away.\"\n\"Later, back in the Maw, the camera looks up at Torghast, as the Jailer speaks off-screen.\"\n\"On a platform outside Torghast, Anduin walks up to the Jailer, with Sylvanas looking on. He presents the sword to the Jailer, revealing the sigil of the kyrian.\"\n\"Sylvanas stares at Anduin, an inscrutable look on her face, before breaking and looking up at the Jailer.\"\n\"The camera tilts up, following two large chains embedded into a large landmass floating above: &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOn complete:"}

Arthas reveals that his powers have continued to wane and that he must reach Northrend before all is lost. When Arthas enters the throne room, he finds Balnazzar, Detheroc, and Varimathras waiting. The doors slam shut and a horde of ghouls attack him. As Arthas fends off his attackers, Balnazzar gloats that the Dreadlords have taken control of most of the Undead and that Arthas' reign will soon be cut short. Kel'Thuzad tells Arthas that they must flee the city. Arthas agrees to regroup with Kel'Thuzad in the wilderness.\nArthas finishes off the remaining ghouls and breaks out of the throne room. He moves through the city, gathering any warriors still loyal to him, while fending off patrols of hostile undead. The Dreadlords not only control most of the undead in the city, but they also command a number of &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"golems\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt;. Although his powers and forces are diminished, Arthas battles past the rebels using his fighting skills and knowledge of the city's layout. Arthas raids an armory and takes control of two Meat Wagons, which he uses to knock out enemy towers. He also recovers some useful magical artifacts and gold coins along the way.\nArthas and his followers finally reach the main city gates, where they find a large rebel host waiting. Among the rebels is a huge Abomination named Bloodfeast. Arthas' forces manage to destroy these rebels, including Bloodfeast. Arthas then breaks down the city gates and exits.\nAs Arthas tries to leave the city, he is intercepted by four rebel Abominations. Suddenly some &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s appear, possess two of the Abominations, and kill the others. Arthas thanks the banshees and asks where their mistress &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; is. The banshees reply that she sent them to escort Arthas across the river. They'll then take refuge in the wilderness. \nThis chapter ultimately ends with the Dreadlord Insurgents led by Balnazzar, Detheroc, and Varimathras taking control of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", it is stated that Arthas ran through the city's palace, not the city itself. Also, the meeting with the shade is expanded. \nIn ', it is revealed that it is during this encounter that Arthas sees Sylvanas again in her physical body, returned after reclaiming it from an iron coffin in &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nThe King's Exit.\n\"With the Dreadlords' forces closing in, Arthas must make a quick retreat from the city.\"\nOptional Quests.\nMeat Wagon Surprise.\n\"The towers are proving quite difficult to get through without heavy casualties.

Although a good &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Tomul's most notable trait is her keen eyesight, which makes her an excellent scout for &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt;. She is the first centaur encountered by players in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains%20storyline\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains storyline&lt;/a&gt;, but she is irritable and resents having to serve as the two-foots' \"keeper\". Tomul also oversees &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hunt\"&gt;Grand Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s, and can be seen alongside &lt;a href=\"Trainer%20Frodrum\"&gt;Trainer Frodrum&lt;/a&gt; and racks of &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Equipment\"&gt;Hunting Equipment&lt;/a&gt; wherever the event is currently taking place.\nBiography.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the Ohn'ahran Plains to make contact with the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Tomul intercepted them near the border. She was not impressed by the fact that the adventurers were on a mission from the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and made them prove their worth by helping her hunting party kill a &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Proto-Dragon\"&gt;Blazing Proto-Dragon&lt;/a&gt; before bringing them to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Timberstep%20Outpost\"&gt;Timberstep Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where she introduced them to &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; just as the Shikaar were preparing to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt;. Tomul took point when the Shikaar caravan left and had the outsiders pull their weight by helping to hunt game at the caravan's first stop on the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Steppe\"&gt;Wanderer's Steppe&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn arrival to Maruukai, Tomul hoped to avoid the antagonistic &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, a hope that Sansok Khan immediately squashed by asking Tomul to introduce the outsiders to the Nokhud's doorkeeper, &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Bahir\"&gt;Guard Bahir&lt;/a&gt;. When the Nokhud revealed their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and betrayed the other clans, Tomul was unsurprised and sent the adventurers to kill Guard Bahir.\nLater, Tomul was one of the scouts sent by &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to search for &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; after the latter was captured by the Primalists. Shortly after, she returned to Maruukai to tell Sarest and the khans that a Nokhud warband led by &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;. Sarest went to the Horn to confront Balakar personally took, and took Tomul, the adventurers, and the &lt;a href=\"khansguard\"&gt;khansguard&lt;/a&gt; with her. On arrival, she told Tomul and the guards to stay behind outside the village while she headed inside with the adventurers. After Balakar blew the Horn, Tomul sought out the Khanam Matra to ask what had happened. Sarest ordered her to return to Maruukai and tell the khans to begin marching toward the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to join the green dragons against the Primalists."}

Ideal to watch over positions, they are unarmed, but they can later be upgraded to become &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSecond War.\nScout towers were tall, sturdy structures constructed to guard the borders of many settlements. From these sites, the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; could spot enemy troops from high above, making it difficult for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to launch surprise attacks. Their presence in the wildlands assured the swift deployment of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armies to meet any orc incursion. These towers could be outfitted with either deadly bolts that could pierce targets on land, sea, and air, or with great &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; that while powerful, couldn't attack threats from above.\nThird War.\nScout towers may be constructed at almost any location to provide continuous on-site observation. The towers are also the first necessary step in human town defense. These structures may later be upgraded to &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;cannon towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was a common tactic of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to build their towers behind some &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Tower\"&gt;Ivory Tower&lt;/a&gt;s were also usable during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nScout towers are very common in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and can be found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. While many towers, especially the ones in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, have been abandoned or destroyed, there are still quite a few that remain intact.\nIronically, the tower built between &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; was built to symbolize the bond of friendship and brotherhood between the two cities."}

During the course of the Highmountain questline, the Bloodtotem reveal that most of them have allied with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, at which point they consume the blood of demons, become &lt;a href=\"felsworn\"&gt;felsworn&lt;/a&gt; and known as the Feltotem, while others remained Bloodtotem. Even after Torok's death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;a class leader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted Feltotem continue their operations in &lt;a href=\"Feltotem\"&gt;Feltotem&lt;/a&gt; on the west coast of Highmountain.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, survivors of the Bloodtotem tribe who didn't choose to join the Legion settled at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe first chieftain of all the Highmountain tribes was a Bloodtotem, and therefore the tribe has long felt that they would make the best leaders due to their strength. This has caused a long-standing rivalry between them and the &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt;, as well as causing the Bloodtotem to become more reclusive and unwelcoming to outsiders.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halla%20Blurblades\"&gt;Halla Blurblades&lt;/a&gt; met &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Headcloud\"&gt;Chief Headcloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morg%20Strongcurrent\"&gt;Morg Strongcurrent&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; asked the tribes to unite against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, Blurblades refused to fight beside Chief Headcloud and his &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and it was mutual. In the end, Morg Strongcurrent managed to convince them to put aside their pride, in order to protect their tribes and children from the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and together they united to fight the invaders.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodtotem tribe was enraged that the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; and symbol of the united tribes, was prophecized to be given to an outsider if &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; were to survive. This anger was further exacerbated when the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;, stole the hammer in his own ploy to prevent these events, declaring war on the tauren. This would lead most of the Bloodtotem to secretly accept the Legion's gifts in exchange for their allegiance.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Riverbend\"&gt;Riverbend&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction at the hands of the drogbar, the player is sent to parley with the Bloodtotem alongside a &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; emissary named &lt;a href=\"Oakin%20Ironbull\"&gt;Oakin Ironbull&lt;/a&gt;, with the objective of unifying the Highmountain tribes. Upon arriving in &lt;a href=\"Cliff%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Cliff's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, the player is informed that the Bloodtotem have gone on the offensive on a &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;nearby drogbar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, capturing some of their number, even though the tribe appears to be more peaceful than their brethren in the south. The captured chieftain of the drogbar, &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt;, tells the player that he has a feeling that the Bloodtotem intend to soon do great harm to Highmountain. He directs them towards the northern part of Cliff's Edge, where three tauren are laying dead around a table, upon which rests a cup of &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt;. A Warmonger suddenly rushes forward and knocks the player back, saying that it is none of the adventurer's business.\nAfter clearing the nearby &lt;a href=\"Witchwood\"&gt;Witchwood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; and slaying their &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Wood\"&gt;matriarch&lt;/a&gt;, the player and Oakin are allowed an audience with the Bloodtotem chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Torok%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Torok&lt;/a&gt;, who then sends them into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Blood%20Trial\"&gt;Cave of the Blood Trial&lt;/a&gt; to complete the rite of passage. Upon arriving, however, a demonic portal opens and &lt;a href=\"Marakhan\"&gt;Marakhan&lt;/a&gt; emerges, killing Oakin and attacking the player, at which point the Bloodtotem in the cave transformed into the Feltotem. After slaying Marakhan, the captive Navarrogg says that the player and the drogbar will need to work together to defeat the Feltotem, after which he transports himself and the player to a &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;hidden refuge&lt;/a&gt; to recover.\nThe Feltotems started breeding &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Hell%20hound\"&gt;hounds&lt;/a&gt; to serve as guardians and using them to attack &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; troops. They also kidnapped allies of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;. There's seems to be an alliance between the Feltotems and the &lt;a href=\"Crawliac\"&gt;Crawliac&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20the%20Hag\"&gt;Dawn the Hag&lt;/a&gt; was seen leading the armies of Feltotems. They also poisoned the waterways of Highmountain with their dreadful rituals, sickening the wildlife. The Feltotem incursion allowed Legion's &lt;a href=\"wyrmtongue\"&gt;wyrmtongue&lt;/a&gt;s to scavenge Highmountain tauren graves.\nAfter killing many of the Feltotem, Navarrogg and the class leader assault &lt;a href=\"Torok%27s%20Bluff\"&gt;Torok's Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and eventually succeed in killing Torok himself. Navarrogg then returns to his home, the &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20Grotto\"&gt;Stonedark Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, before heading south to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; to declare the Stonedark's allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the Bloodtotem's stead.\nThe Feltotem continue to serve the Legion on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spirit walker&lt;/a&gt;s of the tribe turned to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and are raising fallen &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers on the &lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Cliffs\"&gt;Screaming Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; outside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, survivors of the Bloodtotem tribe who didn't choose to join the Legion settled at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; and were seemingly admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of the Highmountain Tribes as &lt;a href=\"Se%27tah%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Se'tah Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt; is found in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThey are far more aggressive, xenophobic, and cruel than the other tribes, with most members consisting of &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. They rarely allow outsiders in their lands, apparently killing anyone not from &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; who enters their territory. Even asking them to give an outsider an audience is a danger.\nThe Bloodtotem totem animal is a fierce creature with a wide grin, bulging eyes, and an upturned snout. Their totem can be found outside the exit of the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Path of Earth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;, implying that they represent the element of earth.\nThe Bloodtotem are likely to kill both outsiders they view as weak and ones that they view as stronger than themselves, and so the challenge comes in finding a way to make them think that you are useful. The &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane tribe&lt;/a&gt; provides the Bloodtotem with food as the latter's hunting grounds can no longer sustain the tribe's needs, but the Bloodtotem still look down on the Rivermane and consider them to be pathetic.\nBy tradition, all Bloodtotem and distinguished guests must go through a trial of blood in the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Blood%20Trial\"&gt;Cave of the Blood Trial&lt;/a&gt;. The challenger first needs to show proof of their deeds, after which they are to defeat a &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20Warmonger\"&gt;Warmonger&lt;/a&gt; in single combat, then perform sacrifice at an altar deep in the cavern.\nFeltotem tauren resemble Highmountain tauren to a degree, but possess a dark coloration to their bodies, and a number of fel-green bony growths, most notably across their hands, similar to those seen in &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Their antlers are more outgrown and exaggerated than the mortal tauren of the region, and both their antlers and hooves burn with fel fire. They possess glowing green eyes and a fel flame on the ends of their tails."}

It also drops randomly from enemies in Zul'Gurub.\nNotes.\nHow to farm Bloodvine: Most herbs in Zul'Gurub are located next to a group of NPC's, and because of this they are quite hard to get without a proper group/raid. However, Bloodvine can easily be farmed by two rogues. One rogue would pull the mobs away from the herb while the other picks it. This takes time, mainly because of the cooldown on the rogue's vanish ability.\nIn ZG there are 2 (yes only 2) herb nodes which have only 2 humanoids guarding them. The 1st is the hut directly to the left right after you enter, the second is the hut to the right after the second bridge, in front of Snake boss room. They do not always spawn, if they do not just reset the instance (described later). If a herb IS up in these location, its as simple as a sap and a blind to be able to pick the herb and possibly receive a Bloodvine in this manner.\nTo reset ZG: Head towards the door, make sure you are not the leader, promoting someone else if necessary. Leave party and zone out. Reinvite the person that was in your raid and zone in with yourself as leader. Just be sure you are not the leader when you leave raid to reset."}

Grif also appears to know &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, Grif defended Kharanos.\nAfterward, Grif and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; began working on locating artifacts on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, with legends pointing to a weapon called &lt;a href=\"%3ATitanstrike\"&gt;:Titanstrike&lt;/a&gt;. Brann also introduced Grif to &lt;a href=\"Prustaga\"&gt;Prustaga&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Grif met with &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; and visited the &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Menagerie\"&gt;Magical Menagerie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; where he spoke with &lt;a href=\"Tassia%20Whisperglen\"&gt;Tassia Whisperglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrif later joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and is seen speaking with &lt;a href=\"Courier%20Larkspur\"&gt;Courier Larkspur&lt;/a&gt;. He helped a hunter &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; retrieve Titanstrike. With his animal companions, the two hunters traveled from Dalaran to &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; where the dwarf reunited with Prustaga. As they explored the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt;, defeating ghosts and disabling traps, with the assistance of an &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Mimiron\"&gt;Image of Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; they killed &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Volund\"&gt;Warlord Volund&lt;/a&gt; and found Titanstrike. As they were about to retrieve it, Prustaga betrayed them and took a portal to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, materializing in the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Imagination\"&gt;Spark of Imagination&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the information, the hunters were transported to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; where they battled and killed Prustaga and reclaimed Titanstrike's blast. Both &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; mistake him for Brann Bronzebeard, which greatly annoys him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Grif and his companions traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Inventor%27s%20Library\"&gt;Inventor's Library&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and met with Mimiron once again in order to save Hati's spirit. Grif and Theodore defended the &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Mimiron\"&gt;Image of Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; from projections when they were trying to locate Hati's essence. They found it in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. Grif and Theodore arrived there only to find Thorim incapacitated and the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Hati%20%28Storm%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Essence of Hati&lt;/a&gt; by corpses of enemy &lt;a href=\"Raging%20Stormrider\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderous%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;proto-dragons&lt;/a&gt;. They fought against the essence and once defeated, absorbed into &lt;a href=\"%3AThunderspark\"&gt;:Thunderspark&lt;/a&gt;, which freed Thorim. Grif told the titan watcher the plan to restore Hati, and Thorim immediately teleported to . The dwarf followed suit and tried to reason with the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Hati%20%28Silithus%29\"&gt;Essence of Hati&lt;/a&gt;, but it instead latched onto Grif. Thorim suddenly appeared and used &lt;a href=\"Krolmir%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;'s power against the essence, releasing the dwarf. After absorbing this essence too, Grif returned to the Spark of Imagination in Ulduar where he witnessed &lt;a href=\"Hati\"&gt;Hati&lt;/a&gt;'s resurrection. Afterward, Grif resolved to return to the wilds.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nBefore beginning a hunt, it is wise to ask someone what you are looking for before you begin looking for it.\nI kinnae help ye with trainin'.

Surrounded on all sides by extremely steep cliffs, the valley was accidentally discovered when a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarvish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt; was blown off course during an unexpected storm. Expeditions have been sent overland to explore the valley, but the foreboding crags and horrific ice storms that sweep over the area have claimed the lives of many who would chart this remote place."}
