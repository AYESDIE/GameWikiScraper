If there are no valid targets for Death Plague to jump to, the afflicted player dies. When a player gets Death Plague, he or she should move to another player to ensure that Death plague will spread. If the only targets in range have the recently infected debuff, the disease will dissipate. Infecting as few players as possible is beneficial, as it ensures that there will always be valid targets for Death Plague. It is worth noting that the Death Plague can not be taken off by any means, other than falling off, and also kills the player through any form of invincibility (&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, etc...). The plague also might have a tendency to persist after battle in some glitchy occasions, slowly picking off the raid until everyone has zoned out.\nOne general strategy for dealing with the Death Plague is for the ranged dps and healers stand in a circle around the Rotting Frost Giant (or in a semi-circle from him if tanked against a wall). This way when one person gets affected by the plague, they can just move to the person to their left and pass it off. When the next person gets it, they too can move to the left, rotating around the circle. While this does work initially, the boss will continually send out plagues, causing some issues depending on where in the circle it is.\nA second strategy is to separate in to small groups (2-3) spaced far enough apart to avoid spreading the plague further. With this, the number of people hit by the first jump are limited, and a second jump is avoided. The size of the groups limits how much raid healing must be done.\nRewards.\nReputation (&lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;): 250\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "134695", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=134695", "title": "Ancestral worship", "text": "Ancestor worship is one of the faiths in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and one of the main tenets of &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; (along with &lt;a href=\"animism\"&gt;animism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spirit%20guidance\"&gt;spirit guidance&lt;/a&gt;) practiced in the world. \nAncestor worship entails more than a simple veneration of the dead. While almost all races respect and memorialize their ancestors in some way, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; believe that their forebears possess powers that their living offspring can channel. A tauren does not merely remember her ancestors; she speaks to them and draws power from them. A tauren\u2019s ancestors watch over her and sometimes guide her through visitations and dreams.\nAll tauren learn rituals and chants designed to connect them to their ancestors. A tauren shaman, however, can call on tribal spirits to infuse him with wisdom and strength. Although tauren society is no longer nomadic, their rituals and traditions developed long ago, and thus were heavily influenced by the nomadic way of life that the tauren followed up until recently, when they joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and\nmade &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; their home. For example, when the tauren were nomadic, they could not always visit the graves of their ancestors when they wished to show honor. Many rituals require a tauren to carve wooden figures and then burn these carvings with fragrant grasses and herbs to honor his ancestors. Tauren now have a permanent home in Mulgore, but since marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; keep them away from many areas, they still cannot visit the graves of their ancestors. Thus, they have no reason to change these rituals.\nOrcs leave more concrete reminders of their ancestors. They carve memorials to the fallen dead and place stones around permanent campsites. Nomadic orcs and tauren both conduct group rituals; these rituals involve storytelling, chanting and feasting that lasts all night. Orc death rituals vary in form, but most possess common traits. Any orcs present when an orc dies roar as loudly as possible, to alert the deceased\u2019s ancestors that they must come and escort a new spirit to the spirit world. If an orc falls in battle, his companions wait until after the battle ends to roar. This prevents the death roar from being lost in the sounds of battle. Orcs value honor. Should an orc die with an unfulfilled duty, his close friends and relatives take it upon themselves to complete the duty and allow the fallen orc\u2019s spirit to enter the afterlife without a blemish. The deceased\u2019s closest friend or relative sometimes takes one of the corpse\u2019s fangs as a memento and a token to use in shaman rituals to summon a particular spirit. During group rituals to honor the dead, orcs adorn their tribal costumes or weapons with the fangs of their fallen friends and family. Tauren prefer to bury their dead, but after the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, more tribes are cremating their dead to avoid the possibility of undeath. \nA shaman who practices ancestor worship can gain access to the Ancestor domain.\nTauren ancestral carvings.\nWhen a tauren plans a ritual to honor his ancestors, he carves a number of wooden idols to burn during the ritual. Each tauren\u2019s choice of carvings reflects his values and history, making each set of carvings highly personalized. However, certain themes repeat over time, and most tauren understand the following symbols. Miniature wooden tauren represent a person\u2019s ancestors.

The higher rank corresponding to Grand Anchorite.\nThey take care of the sick and wounded, while seniors are responsible for training aspiring anchorites. Dedicated to the cause of the Light and their priesthood, they organize ceremonies and sermons, teaching the ways of the Light while sharing their knowledge and wisdom with those who need help. Some of them decide to travel in order to spread their faith, to teach to the races of the Alliance and learn from them, but also to give their aid and fight the evil through &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Others may join the ranks of the Alliance armies, where they protect and heal their comrades on the battlefields.\nBackground.\nAfter being introduced to the Light by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei society centered around the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Blessed with Light-given knowledge and power, as well as the blessing called the &lt;a href=\"%3AGift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;:Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; that was bestowed upon them to signify their new connection the Light, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals, deeply affected by their words.\nAs a result, many draenei serve the Light as anchorites, or either as &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, the most common profession choices for them. Unlike other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races with the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, draenei has their own religious institutions, among them, they have explicit priesthoods such as the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order of draenei priests and priestesses once led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, calling themselves the \"keepers of the Light\" and in charge with the safeguarding of the draenei holy sites and altars, now led by &lt;a href=\"Ishanah\"&gt;High Priestess Ishanah&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", they are based in the &lt;a href=\"Anchorites%27%20Sanctum\"&gt;Anchorites' Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt;, where they train new generations of anchorites. Some of them also joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the primary military and police force of the Exodar, considered elite among the draenei.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, many anchorites followed Velen and joined the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; in order to fight the Burning Legion among all the priesthood of Azeroth. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, they were present to defend the capital, while most of them were inside Velen 's protective shield, healing the wounded. Some of them were present during the Battle for the Netherlight Temple to repel &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic forces, but also aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, draenei's most elite anchorites followed the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" to wage war on the Burning Legion. They were then infused with the essence of the Holy Light and became &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; in order to heal, protect, and fight against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s for thousands of years. In the alternative &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, anchorites joined the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; and served &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, they were also infused with the essence of the Holy Light. Among them, was Lightforged and now performs sermons to convert &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s to their cause.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, draenei and Lightforged anchorites were present among the forces of the Alliance, spreading their faith and the justice of the Light, while fighting the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and those who threaten Azeroth."}

{"id": "272646", "revid": "46594776", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=272646", "title": "Ancient", "text": "Ancients are giant, sentient demigod-like trees that serve as protectors of nature. They were among the first creatures of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the first guardians of its life.\nDescription.\nThe simple power of age and wisdom pouring from these truly magnificent beings can make one feel small and awestruck when standing next to them. Ancients are all connected to one another and can sense disturbances to the world from deep within their roots. Their memories are as long and winding as their branches. A piece of their strength sometimes stays behind when ancients fall.\nMost of the time, they are rooted deep into the ground, and look just like normal trees to the inattentive eye. Animals or other protectors of nature can nest in their branches, such as &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; can also act in unison to strengthen the ancients.\nAble to live for thousands of years, the lifespan of an ancient makes those of night elves look very short. As such, they see time differently from the mortal races, and often times, years are seen as akin to seconds. For example, though &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt; had known of &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt;'s death during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when he met up again with her father &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, just before the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he gave his condolences as if the incident had only just happened.\nThe acorn of an ancient looks like any other acorn but, in reality, is much rarer, much more powerful, and magical. It holds all the knowledge of its tree, and all the knowledge of the tree's parent tree, and so on back to their origins. Some &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s may grow to become &lt;a href=\"ancient%20protector\"&gt;ancient protector&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20life\"&gt;Trees of life&lt;/a&gt; can also become &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Ages\"&gt;trees of ages&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;trees of eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenor ancients.\nAncients also existed on . There once was a grove of ancients in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, its name forgotten. &lt;a href=\"Mosswood%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Mosswood the Ancient&lt;/a&gt; is one of the last of these ancients.\nBackground.\nThird War.\nDuring the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the ancients were one of the many forces of nature to rise against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The mighty protectors fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s, and others. The ancients suffered heavy losses during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, with many, especially the varieties that were never in great supply to begin with, returning to the forests to hopefully spread their seeds and replenish their numbers undisturbed.\nFollowing the Third War, the Ancients remained allies with the night elves, having presence in their holdings.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nAs extremely old beings, the disturbance in the timeways caused by the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; affected the ancients in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. Though they did not know the cause of their troubles, their memories started to blend, or fade, and became confusing. They gave Thrall an acorn, to be planted in a place where it seemed right for it to grow. He planted it in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; as a gift to the emotionally shattered &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. The Life-Binder's tears caused plants, flowers, and other signs of verdant life to \"appear ten thousand times more swiftly than it should have happened\". This blossoming of new life chastened the Dragonqueen enough that she was finally able to reunite with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the other Dragon Aspects.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, many ancients joined the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt; and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA group of ancients lives in the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Wilds\"&gt;Verdant Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; have been using their &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt; magic to transform &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; ancients into rotting nightmares.\nIn the RPG.\nThe mighty tree has a massive face shaped in its trunk, with wise, deep-set eyes. It moves with gigantic root-like feet, and two great branches end in huge bark-skinned hands.\nAncients are intelligent, tree-like guardians and lorekeepers allied with the night elves. In times of peace, many night elf healers, druids of the wild, and priests study under the ancients' tutelage. In times of war, the ancients stand alongside their night elf allies and fight just as fiercely. They are staunch defenders of the Moonglade of Mount Hyjal and other sacred places.\nAncients are some of the most important creatures in night elf society. They resemble sentient trees, but their wisdom and insight are almost unparalleled. Many of them are thousands of years old. They assist their night elf allies with guidance, education (particularly in the druidic arts), and protection \u2014 they are large and powerful, and are protectors of the forest. They are large enough to carry night elves, and some are so enormous that a few night elves make their homes in them.\nMost ancients resemble deciduous trees that live in temperate climates, such as oaks and maples. A few evergreen ancients also exist. No reliable reports of tropical ancients have yet surfaced, but the night elves claim that they can exist \u2014 and if a colony of night elves moves to the tropics and brings along the appropriate druidic magic, tropical ancients may indeed grace Azeroth's surface.\nAncients speak &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. A few also speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Their voices sound like ancient trees creaking in the wind. They can be &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20wild\"&gt;druids of the wild&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncients are traditionally friends of night elves and good-hearted, but the recent Third War makes them suspicious of non-night elves. They give outsiders a chance to prove their good intentions; but if roused to anger ancients are implacable foes. Some ancients patrol their territories, but most spend their time standing still, virtually indistinguishable from normal trees. An ancient may watch intruders, perhaps moving in secret to dog their path. If the outsiders do nothing to harm the forest or nature's balance, the ancient leaves them alone. If the outsiders appear to share the same ideals as the ancient (destroying corrupted creatures or protecting trees from other intruders, for example), the ancient reveals itself and lends assistance. If outsiders abuse the land, the ancient rumbles to a fury and attacks with mighty swings of its arms.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The object appears sporadically at a variety of locations throughout the zone.\nInteracting with the object will cause it to despawn, and the player to gain the buff. If the player is killed, the buff will be lost and the object will respawn, allowing it to be claimed by another player for the remaining duration.\nTips.\nWithout doubt the single most powerful buff in Ashran.\nThe power granted by this buff is huge, in many ways reminiscent of multi-boxing, granting the character the power of three, and the health of two. The one downside of this is the striking visual above the character's head, serving to highlight them to all other players. The buff is very similar to a relatively advanced Orb of Power in &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt;, except that rather than increasing damage taken, it effectively decreases it.\nObtaining the buff takes several seconds and can be interrupted by attacks, making it tricky to pick up in the middle of a battle. If you have the buff and are about to die, run back toward your own team, and try to die well behind the front lines, where one of your faction can pick it up without getting interrupted by the opposition. \nIf you see opposing players gathered round the object interrupt them as quickly as possible. This is in many ways similar to preventing the opponent from capping a flag in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, although ideally you'll want to fight them off until you or your teammates can claim it for yourselves.\nIt's usually worth trying to remove enemy players with this buff as quickly as possible, before they are able to make their way through your team. However, with the buff's increased health, this is often not the easiest task. A little communication to concentrate fire on the Artifact-holder is often very useful, but consider carefully where it will drop."}

About the only AE worth dispelling is the 200FR debuff as that can greatly increase the damage taken from his fire AE. This mob goes down very fast and we don't bother with them too much anymore since they don't respawn once Magmadar is dead.\nYou should have another tank (with FR) ready to tank the dog. Since some of its abilities (like the fear and stun) cause the tank to temporarily lose aggro, it might wander into the clothies area, and bake them.\nWhen we get an Ancient Core Hound add, we move quickly to reach it before it gets to the camp. You do not want a Core Hound in camp casting an AE stun or confusion when already engaged with another mob. Two healers is sufficient to keep a tank up on one of these. \nSpecial Note for Ranged DPS: If you have points in any talents that increase the maximum range of your spells or attacks you may be able to avoid the AoE debuff. After the MT has established aggro, simply back up as far away from the hound as you can. Be careful doing this. If the MT is afflicted with Ancient Despair, the hound will run straight for you.\nReward.\nReputation: 20 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; until the end of Honored.\nLoot: Ancient Core Hounds have a low chance to drop a &lt;a href=\"BoE\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt; item.\nSkinnable for &lt;a href=\"Core%20Leather\"&gt;Core Leather&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Rugged%20Leather\"&gt;Rugged Leather&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally &lt;a href=\"Rugged%20Hide\"&gt;Rugged Hide&lt;/a&gt;. Like normal skinning, the corpse must be looted in order to skin it. (310 Skinning skill req'd.) Many guilds assign one skinner to skin all core hounds and send the leather to the guild bank. This often leads to the Raid Leader or Assigned Skinner reminding the raid to \"Loot the Dog!\"\nAs a hunter pet.\nHunters with the 31 talent point &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; can tame these as exotic beasts, though it is not without difficulty. They hit hard enough that constant heals on the hunter are necessary, which runs the risk of breaking &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;Tame Beast&lt;/a&gt; if the healer pulls aggro. The best method is to have the hunter build up a decent aggro lead before attempting to tame it, with the healer only healing when necessary and minimizing overhealing as much as possible. Bringing along an additional hunter or two to use &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; helps as well."}

When you search the mast five level 45 Treasure Hunting Pirates appear. If you flee, they will guard the mast for a short period of time. You should, in fact, do this the moment you finish inspecting the mast, as they will spread out, making it possible to take them on one by one. The key to the chest drops from one of them.\nSecond Opinion and other notes (perspective L46 Mage): Potion of water-walking or similar will make getting there much quicker. The surrounding mobs are L48-L50, and quite dense but can be cleared long enough if this is done economically. The mix of pirates may be variable, two L45 and three L44 seemed most common. If you start running the second you trigger the spawn you will avoid any initial aggro/not be in combat, however, contrary to the above experience they remain quite tightly clustered and all aggro as a group. They revert to this behavior after being kited also. The 'nearest' graveyard is Southmoon Ruins and thanks to the intervening mountain chain a run back will take 8-10 mins. This seems to be longer than the reset/despawn timer, so a kamikaze reduction of their numbers is unlikely to be fruitful. At L45/6 (when you might typically get this quest) classes that aren't strong against groups will find this a tall order to solo. You might also consider that the rewards may be quite nugatory.\nHaving &lt;a href=\"Cuergo%27s%20Key\"&gt;Cuergo's Key&lt;/a&gt; on your keyring will prevent you from searching any &lt;a href=\"Inconspicuous%20Landmark\"&gt;Inconspicuous Landmark&lt;/a&gt;, so if you manage to loot the key from one of the pirates but fail to open the chest before it despawns you will have to open your keyring, throw away the key and start over.\nGains.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:"}

{"id": "565188", "revid": "3400701", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=565188", "title": "Culling of Stratholme", "text": "The Culling of Stratholme is the first major event of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, signalling the first act in &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s descent into madness and evil, the suspending of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; from service and the destruction of the second most important city of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt; reached Stratholme in infected shipments of grain, most likely from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. The populace, unaware of the plague, baked and consumed the infected grain. The &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; was silently overseeing the operation.\nAs the population of the city started to fall ill, its citizenry started to be agitated. Some &lt;a href=\"Agitated%20Stratholme%20Citizen\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; started harassing food vendors and grain suppliers, while &lt;a href=\"Agitated%20Stratholme%20Resident\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; were trying to get into the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; to speak to &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Barthilas\"&gt;Magistrate Barthilas&lt;/a&gt; for leadership. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s forces arrived outside the walls of the city, the first thing they did was inspect the grain shipments in order to detect traces of the plague. As it turned out, they had arrived too late and the city had already been infected, even though its residents didn't know how dire their situation was.\nArthas, who had only just learned that the plague spread by grain, tried to inform &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; of the discovery but quickly realized that the townspeople had consumed the infected grain and ordered the whole town to be destroyed and its inhabitants killed. Uther was shocked by the order and refused to follow it, not wanting to kill his fellow countrymen. For his \"defiance\", Arthas suspended the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and dismissed Uther, calling upon anyone loyal to the nation to help him in purging the town. Uther and his men left, with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; leaving quickly afterwards.\nThe battle.\nAs Arthas began the massacre, Mal'Ganis appeared and began \"collecting\" those civilians who had already been transformed into mindless zombies, gloating that soon the people of Lordaeron would belong to the Scourge. Arthas refused to let that happen and quickened his slaughter of the populace. The two sides proceeded to ravage the city building by building in a macabre race for the lives of the townsfolk. Some citizens were killed in their sleep, others were killed after their zombification, and others were executed while still human and trying to flee. The &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Eris%20Havenfire\"&gt;Eris Havenfire&lt;/a&gt; tried to lead &lt;a href=\"Plagued%20Peasant\"&gt;sick peasants&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, but all were cut down by the Scourge as they left the city walls. Other civilians tried to fight back. Many also took their own lives, opting to hurl themselves into the myriad flames of the smoldering city rather than become one of the Scourge.\nFinally, when most of the city was in ruins and its inhabitants either dead or converted, Arthas and Mal'Ganis confronted each other face to face. Arthas demanded that Mal'Ganis fight him here and now. Mal'Ganis, however, told Arthas to gather his forces and come to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Mal'Ganis then teleported away, leaving Arthas vowing to hunt Mal'Ganis \"to the ends of the earth.\"\nThe city's population was almost completely massacred by the purge, leaving a few survivors who were fortunate enough not to be killed by either side to handle the aftermath of the battle. Uther and Jaina had returned to assess the situation and were appalled by the atrocities that Arthas had committed. Jaina was met by Medivh, who told her Arthas would only die if he went to Northrend. The prophet then told Jaina, as he had told everyone else, that she must travel west to Kalimdor, a request she answered to.\nAftermath.\nAfter Stratholme was purged, some former paladins, now called &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, committed the same heinous act in many other cities across Lordaeron. After years of constant war and suffering, some &lt;a href=\"Heretics\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; also lost their sense of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany who fell rose again, and the city was later taken under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. After the end of the war, when Arthas was called back to Northrend, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; overlord &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; established Stratholme as his capital and positioned his floating fortress, the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, above the ruined city."}

At the end of the instance, players fight and defeat the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"The Culling\" featured Arthas in a mission to rid the city of Stratholme of its infected inhabitants before they were reanimated as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. The only things in his way were the dreadlord Mal'Ganis and Uther and his men...\n\"Old Stratholme\" \u2014 as stated by &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Kaplan\"&gt;Tigole&lt;/a&gt; at the gaming convention in Leipzig, Germany in August 2007 \u2014 will be set during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Culling%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;\", the sixth mission of the human campaign in \"\". Prince Arthas arrives outside of Stratholme, realizing that the people have been infected by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas orders &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; to purge the town. Uther utterly refuses, so Arthas disbands the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. He then takes it upon himself to burn down the city and kill everyone in it, to prevent the citizens from becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The purging of Stratholme is one of the first acts in Arthas' descent into madness and evil, setting him down the path of becoming the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and later the Lich King himself.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Deep within the Caverns of Time, the brooding dragon Nozdormu has awakened. Since the world was young, the bronze dragonflight has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of time is upheld.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the party zones in they will see what appears to be an underground dig site. Further up the stairs, they will find &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;, who asks them to use to identify the crates with plagued grain so that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; will arrive and \"purge\" the city. If you have already done this dungeon before you can ask &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; to teleport you to the action, beginning at killing the waves of undead.\nOnce the party has found the five crates of plague grain, Arthas will arrive at the scene, together with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;. After reenacting the starting scene from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Culling%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;\", Arthas orders you to get inside and start purging the city.\nArthas and his group of loyal Alliance troops will stand and guard the exit gate while 10 waves of undead go through the city. After 5 waves have been killed, &lt;a href=\"Meathook\"&gt;Meathook&lt;/a&gt; will appear. After another 5 waves, &lt;a href=\"Salramm%20the%20Fleshcrafter\"&gt;Salramm the Fleshcrafter&lt;/a&gt; spawns. Unlike Black Morass's event, this instance's event will not reset fully if the party wipes.\nAfter the undead threat has been dealt with in this part of Stratholme, the party along with Arthas will start running through the city to get to Mal'Ganis. But on the way there, in the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has a surprise waiting for him. In the disguise of ordinary humans, they will try to stop Arthas in his tracks and manipulate the timeline. While Arthas merely believes that the infinite dragonflight is just an ally of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, he will later find the real mastermind behind the dragonflight invasion is &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Epoch\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Epoch&lt;/a&gt;. After dealing with him, the group moves on through a secret backdoor.\nNow back in the streets of Stratholme, Arthas finds that the undead invasion has started as the streets are littered with undead ghouls, crypt fiends, abominations, and necromancers. After battling through the groups of undead minions, the group arrives at &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Square\"&gt;the only part of Stratholme not infected&lt;/a&gt; and finds the boss of the instance \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Mal'Ganis has fled from the site, Arthas will thank the group for assisting him in purging the city and spawns a chest with rewards.\nIf Arthas dies after you meet him in Market Square, he will reset to the last place you spoke with him. If he dies during the gauntlet after the rest break, best to wipe and reset.\nAchievements.\nOn Heroic mode, there is an optional objective to clear the instance up to (but not including) Mal'Ganis, and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Corruptor\"&gt;Infinite Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; within 25 minutes called . The timer begins at the end of the introductory storyline after entering Stratholme. Chain-pulling is a complete necessity throughout the instance in order to succeed in this achievement. For mana users, there is a 60-second delay before the sixth wave of Scourge spawn (to loot &lt;a href=\"Meathook\"&gt;Meathook&lt;/a&gt;) and there are short periods of delay between adds in the town hall. These will be the only opportunities for mana users to drink water during the instance, but because combat breaks often, mana users can consume &lt;a href=\"Runic%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Runic Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;s fairly consistently. At the current &lt;a href=\"level%20cap\"&gt;level cap&lt;/a&gt;, however, this is a free and easy mount to get, even solo.\nWhen you reach the streets behind the Town Hall, do not wait for Arthas to initiate combat or feel that you have to go at his pace. Instead, speak to Arthas to have him join you, then dictate the pace yourself by having the tank chain pulling two or three sets of elites at a time. As soon as all of the street adds are cleared and if you have sufficient time remaining, do not speak to Arthas to begin the fight with Mal'Ganis. Instead, run down the path and take the first two left turns available, to find &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Corruptor\"&gt;Infinite Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. Aggroing the boss is not enough to stop the timer; if the timer expires while you fight the Infinite Corruptor, it will flee from the combat.\nAnother achievement in heroic mode is , killing 100 &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Zombie\"&gt;Risen Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s within one minute. Due to the layout of the instance, it will be necessary to pull at least 15 zombies from the far side of the town hall in order to complete the achievement. See the &lt;a href=\"Zombiefest%21\"&gt;Zombiefest!&lt;/a&gt; article for detailed tactics.\nQuests.\nThere are two dungeon quests involving the instance. Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, there were daily quests for both normal and heroic modes of the instance that have since been removed.\nNotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; appear with dialogue from \"\", but Arthas' lines have been re-recorded by his new voice actor.\n&lt;a href=\"Championing\"&gt;Championing&lt;/a&gt; in this instance awards approximately 510 reputation (as a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind_human%23Racial_Traits\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and all &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player characters will be randomly transformed into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s by the bronze dragonflight for this instance, as most of the aforementioned races were either unknown or hostile to the Eastern Kingdoms at the time of the Culling. Bizarrely, this extends to &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; player characters, who would have been &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; (several of whom are even present during the instance) during this time period, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; player characters, whose nation would have still been part of the Alliance during this time period. &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; player characters are transformed back into their human forms with their customization options intact. \nThe inspiration for this specific piece of the storyline may come from the \"Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Dungeon Master's Guide\" where, in discussing changing character alignment, a paladin coming across a disease-ridden village and burning it down to prevent the spread of the illness is presented as an example of a seriously evil (and alignment-changing) act.\nSome human NPCs were named in honor of those that worked with the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011699/\"&gt;Customer Support Forum&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "73130", "revid": "54189905", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=73130", "title": "Cult of Forgotten Shadows", "text": "The Cult of Forgotten Shadows (or Cult of the Forgotten Shadow), a group considered &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al by most, believes that &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt; practitioners are just as vital to the survival of life and reality (which they call \"the Shadow\") as wielders of the Light. The cult preaches balance, mandating that &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s must never forget the dangers of falling too deep into the dark energies they manipulate, for it is often too hard to find one's way back to the Shadow from the deep reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounded by &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who discovered the work of &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt;, the cult spread across Lordaeron after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, recruiting many followers of all races over several years. However, the cult eventually collapsed for unknown reasons shortly before the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, before being reborn under the leadership of Natalie Seline, who returned from the Void, in order to fight against the Burning Legion alongside the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; and the other priesthood of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt;, a bishop of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, began to delve into workings of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who had poured through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and desecrated their hallowed dead. While at first this was done in order to provide &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the knowledge it needed to fight against such dark magic, the bishop's studies over the years became increasingly obsessed with finding out why such dark energies existed at all, and why she began to see the ebb and flow of such energies in the world around her. She began preaching about the necessity of balance between &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, but after her death, her books were locked away in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s vaults in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cult was created through the (re)discovery of the teachings of bishop Natalie Seline by &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s in Lordaeron after the capture and refurbishing of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. They teach that one must first know the light before one can know the dark. Shadow priests generally do not practice openly, and not all members are Forsaken, although they formed the cult.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Cult of Forgotten Shadows spread its faith through the undead lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, its dark clerics and shadow priests being present in all settlements of the Forsaken, and mostly in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Within the last few years, the number of non-Forsaken (and non-Horde) members within the cult has grown sharply, making the Cult open to members of all factions.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, priests of the cult were present to support the Horde, such as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cleric%20Malod\"&gt;Dark Cleric Malod&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, where he tended to the &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Grunt%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Injured Grunts&lt;/a&gt;, regularly reporting the situation of the wounded to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General%20Orion\"&gt;Lieutenant General Orion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, priest trainers of the cult sent their apprentices to meet &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cleric%20Cecille\"&gt;Dark Cleric Cecille&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. As a representative of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows, she takes care of sending promising priests on missions, notably to fight the enemies of the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and prevent the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, by burning the books that they distribute, in order to prevent them from recruiting more into their ranks. She also takes care of sending them at &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to obtain unique materials that can only be found in the cursed keep, as &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; commissioned the master enchanter &lt;a href=\"Godan\"&gt;Godan&lt;/a&gt; to create a special weapon for them, as recognition of their dedication to the cause.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;battle for Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; Commander, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cleric%20Laresa\"&gt;Dark Cleric Laresa&lt;/a&gt; led her troops against the forces of the Alliance, and tried to take control of &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; to prevent their expansion deeper into &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nIt is unclear when or how it happened, possibly as a result of internal conflicts, but the Cult of Forgotten Shadows eventually fell apart. When the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; wished to restore it and join them at &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; where the last remnants of the cult were gathered near the grave of Natalie Seline. After her spirit was pulled from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and restored to her body, Natalie and the cultists traveled to Netherlight Temple. News of Natalie's return would quickly spread fast among those who shared her beliefs, and soon Azeroth would see the rise of the Cult of Forgotten Shadows.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, priest trainers of the cult sent their apprentices to meet &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Goodchilde\"&gt;Martin Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt; in the priest section of the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. As a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, he takes care of sending them on missions, more particularly to fight the enemies of the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to obtain materials for the creation of weapons at the height of their dedication, as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cleric%20Cecille\"&gt;Dark Cleric Cecille&lt;/a&gt; did in the past.\nBeliefs.\nWhile many priests draw on powers such as the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; or the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, shadow priests turn to &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark energies&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish their goals. The Light is often said to bring about feelings of positive emotion\u2014 hope, courage, comfort\u2014 and the like. Shadow abilities are just the opposite, able to impart feelings like despair, doubt, and panic. In a poetic sense, it can be said that the emotions which the Light brings about come from the \"heart,\" whereas the emotions manipulated by shadow are often based on survival logic, and therefore affect the \"mind\".\nMembers of the Cult believe that faith in themselves is what separates them from others, and that with their powers, they will cause great change in all of Azeroth, the weak will come to lean on them, the lepers will call them Lord, and the ignorant will look to them for guidance.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Forgotten Shadow is a corrupted reinterpretation of the beliefs and traditions practiced by the Holy Light, and is the religion of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The religion of those who follow and use the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; is called the Cult of Forgotten Shadow. It is a religion of divine humanism (see below).\nThe banshee &lt;a href=\"Aelthalyste\"&gt;Aelthalyste&lt;/a&gt;, in the Undercity, whom most priests report to, is the closest thing to a true leader for the cult. Although the cult has no official leader.\nForsaken who once followed the tenets of the Holy Light often alter their philosophy upon their transformation. Former priests of the Holy Light lost their faith when they became undead. Lost and hurt, these priests founded a new religion based on a self-centered version of their former faith. Dubbed the Forgotten Shadow, this philosophy centers around self-empowerment and a desire to balance life with death. Many of the virtues and principles of the Holy Light exist within the Forgotten Shadow, but are twisted to an egocentric view. While small, the Cult of Forgotten Shadow grows in popularity, especially among &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s. The cult claims &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt; as its home, as well as a section of the warrior sector in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not yet organized enough to claim much control over anything.\nThe Forgotten Shadow is the dark interpretation of the Holy Light's teachings, and many Forsaken find truth in its doctrine. Forsaken turn to the Forgotten Shadow for different reasons. Forsaken who feel isolated and outcast might join their brethren in support of the Forgotten Shadow to obtain a sense of solidarity, of belonging. Forsaken who feel betrayed by the Holy Light's failure to protect them sometimes find that turning their backs on the Holy Light is not enough; they throw aside the Holy Light and embrace its dark twin out of spite. Finally, some Forsaken simply see the value and practicality in the teachings of the Forgotten Shadow. A Forsaken of any class might emulate the values of the Forgotten Shadow, but devoted church members are usually priests. Some become &lt;a href=\"lightslayer\"&gt;lightslayer&lt;/a&gt;s, and others become &lt;a href=\"shadow%20ascendant\"&gt;shadow ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s. Even some dark rangers have joined the ranks of the cult.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;curse of undeath&lt;/a&gt; proved especially brutal to those humans who once followed the philosophy of the Holy Light. Their lives as Forsaken seem dreary, hateful and unspeakably cruel. Many allowed anger and bitterness to foster in their souls. They had believed in the teachings of the Light, and now find themselves shrouded in eternal darkness. Such Forsaken founded the Cult of Forgotten Shadow.\nPriests of the Holy Light who become Forsaken alter their beliefs to more adequately reflect their new existences. Practitioners of the Forgotten Shadow believe that the actions and emotions of the self have the capacity to change the universe. The Forgotten Shadow shapes reality. There is no inherent bond between self and universe; a bond exists only when a Forsaken imposes her will on the universe. By strengthening her personal power, a Forsaken can impart greater changes to the world around her. Exceptionally strong Forsaken can literally shape the world. Forgotten Shadow priests refer to this central tenet as Divine Humanism.\nThe Cult of Forgotten Shadow plays an important role in Forsaken society. Shortly after the emancipation of the Forsaken and the formation of their culture, the Forsaken indulged in a momentary backlash against necromancers. Necromancy was seen as the art of slavery, the tool of the Scourge, and its use was repulsive to the newly liberated undead.\nThe most serious failing of the Cult of Forgotten Shadow is its lack of organization. Dozens of different interpretations of the three or four virtues exist, and no two priests seem to be able to agree on how the faithful should follow the Forgotten Shadow. A single city can hold several different cult leaders, all in disagreement on their philosophy. Members of the Forgotten Shadow spend almost as much time arguing with other members as they do practicing the tenets they believe.\nA particularly charismatic and intelligent Forsaken may draw all the disparate branches of the cult together someday. A united front of philosophically aligned Forsaken would be a dire threat to the Church of the Holy Light. Priests of the Forgotten Shadow can gain access to the Death, Destruction and Power Domains.\nOrganization.\nThe cult is loosely organized, with a hierarchy defined by power and experience. Novice acolytes work at menial tasks, while a single &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt; serves as bishop for a community. Dark priests are more like archbishops ruling over wide territories. There are exceptions to the rules, as they haven't formed a strict organization as of yet. &lt;a href=\"Lightslayer\"&gt;Lightslayer&lt;/a&gt;s are the assassins of the religion sent out to kill enemies of the cult, as well as destroy practitioners of the Holy Light whenever possible. &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20ascendant\"&gt;Shadow ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s are those that have ascended beyond physical world, and have taken on a form between physical and spiritual, they are often used as spies, priests or assassins.\nThe Three Virtues.\nThe Cult of Forgotten Shadow preaches three virtues: respect, tenacity, and power.\nRespect.\nThe universe is the physical manifestation of other's wills. Thus, for a person to denigrate the universe is to ignore the personal power of those around them. This is not only disrespectful, it is dangerous. A follower of the Forgotten Shadow must develop his personal power in order to exert his will on the universe, but seeking too much power too quickly puts him in conflict with other, stronger beings. Only a foolish follower seeks to challenge his superiors right away. Showing respect ensures a measure of self-protection.\nTenacity.\nFollowers of the Forgotten Shadow put even greater stock in the virtue of tenacity. It may at first seem impossible for a person to change the universe when countless others seeking to do the same surround him. Through unwavering perseverance and tenacity though, they may triumph.\nPower.\nPower is the third virtue of the Forgotten Shadow, and the most difficult to attain. A Forsaken who grabs greedily for power might encounter power too great for him or her to handle, and die in their attempt to master it. A Forsaken who succumbs to despair and seeks no personal power has no reason to exist; he craves nothing, desires nothing, he sits alone and pines for his old life. To the cult, Forsaken who do not seek to better themselves might as well still be part of the Scourge. The quest for power requires caution, forethought, and a subtle touch.\nOther Virtues.\nSome branches of the Forgotten Shadow consider death to be a fourth virtue; most consider it sub-virtue of power. Additionally, some members of the Forgotten Shadow still show a limited yet twisted version of the virtue of Compassion (one of the Holy Light's main virtues).\nDeath.\nA Forsaken reaches the pinnacle of power when he masters death itself, transcends it. This power over death requires the same delicate touch of any other power. A Forsaken must not kill indiscriminately, nor can he withhold death from the weak. To kill wantonly escalates the Forsaken's risk of encountering power too great for him to overcome. It also robs him of his strength; a Forsaken who spends all day slaying wildlife and human peasants might exhaust his power, and be left defenseless when a true threat arises. Likewise, a Forsaken who shows mercy to the weak and forgoes regular exercise of his power may gain a reputation for weakness himself. This draws predators and offends the cult. He must always preserve a balance.\nCompassion.\nDespite their mercenary outlook, the cult possesses a streak of compassion. The living world fears and shuns the living dead, and who can blame them? The cult understands the plight of the Forsaken and wishes to ease their burden if only a little. This compassion tempers even the most heartless priest - though the compassion they show is only towards other Forsaken.\nAscension.\nThe ultimate goal of practitioners of the Forgotten Shadow is to ascend. Ascension occurs once a person achieves complete control over herself and the power to transcend death. A Forsaken who ascends becomes invulnerable, invincible, and eternal. In essence, he becomes a god.\nThe Cult of Forgotten Shadow teaches that the Forsaken of Azeroth were too weak to ascend. Their undead state is a curse brought on by that weakness. Once the Forsaken learn to master themselves and control the world around them, they shake off that curse and become what they always should have been. Those on the path to ascension often become shadow ascendants.\nDivine Humanism.\nInstead of seeing both a self and a universe and seeking to create a bond between them through compassion, the Forgotten Shadow preaches a much more self-oriented idea. Priests preach that the self has power over the universe, and the universe revolves around the self. They preach that if an undead was powerful enough to rise from the grave on their own free will, and become sentient, the undead may strengthen themselves by increasing their control of the world around them, thus becoming more godlike. Many priests dub this concept \"divine humanism\".\nDivine humanism is the concept that the self shapes the universe. In essence, each sentient creature in the world is a tiny god, able to exert their will to manifest small changes in the universe. A minor example of divine humanism might be something as simple as mood. The Holy Light teaches that to be happy, one must work to better the universe, and the effort of reflecting joy back through the universal bond spreads happiness. However, divine humanism notes that an angry individual who shows their rage triggers anger in those around them. They do not change some insubstantial universe \"out there\" - they make a choice and others sense the strength of their emotions and change themselves. In short, the Holy Light teaches that by changing the universe, you change those around you. The Forgotten Shadow teaches that by using your power, you can change those around you and change the universe. Power is key, not some mythical bond.\nBalance between Light and Shadow.\nWhile the undead generally hate users of the Holy Light, are hurt by it, and have learned how to use the Shadow, they also preach that there must be a balance between Light and Shadow, and that they must learn the Light as well, but never forget they were born from the Shadow.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and its successor the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; both have an unusually high number of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; holy men and women in their ranks compared to any other faction, including the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. They come as &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Cleric\"&gt;Clerics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Priest\"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Healer\"&gt;Healers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Initiate\"&gt;Initiates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lightbringers&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is possible that these faithful of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; are members of the Lordaeron branch of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; who were initially freed with the other undead and decided to band apart because of the tendency of the Forsaken to instead be &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s."}

The Cult was formed years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, as the predecessor and creator of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; officially being loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and establishing its foothold on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in his &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;prison-throne&lt;/a&gt;, reached out telepathically any dark soul lusted for power that would hear his call - most notably the then-Archmage &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; who would become an Archlich and the creator and leader of the Cult of the Damned.\nWhile Cultists aspire to become &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, they remain alive because undeath is considered an honor one must earn, and because living beings are useful to the Lich King for their ability to spy in living &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; settlements, and recruit powerful individuals from among the living, either into the Cult or the Scourge. The Cult ranks consists mostly of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, but &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and other races are also present.\nFollowing the rise of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; as the new Lich King, and his proclamation as \"Jailor of the Damned\", the Cult of the Damned have been seen leading the various remaining Scourge posts in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As Fordragon's ability to contain the Scourge was limited to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes of Azeroth had the responsibility to defeat the rest of the Scourge still beyond that continent.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of Bolvar as the Lich King, the Cult of the Damned re-emerged through Azeroth, answering the call of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;herald&lt;/a&gt; who preached that soon the \"Banished One\" will claim the soul of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and that all will serve him.\nThe cult is notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed.\nHistory.\nFormation of the cult.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, and gained control of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, he turned his attention south, to &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s chosen targets: &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was trapped bodiless and confined to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, he could reach out telepathically across great distances to those seeking power and knowledge of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; - his first minions, and the beginnings of the Cult of the Damned.\nChief among the men and women who heard the Lich King's call was &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, archmage of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Forsaking his position as a senior member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaran's ruling council, Kel'Thuzad traveled alone to Northrend. The vast &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt; ruins left decimated by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; confirmed his desire to ally with the Lich King. His arrival was expected, and he offered his soul to Ner'zhul. In exchange for loyalty and obedience, Kel'Thuzad was promised immortality and power, but he remained a mortal human for his appointed task: the organization of the Cult of the Damned, which would set the stage for the Scourge's conquest of Lordaeron. The Archmagus was old, but still very charismatic, a useful trait for amassing more and more of Lordaeron's easily-swayed citizens under the shadow of the Lich King.\nFor three years Kel'Thuzad worked, preaching his new religion to the masses, promising them immortality and an ideal society free of all the burdens the existing one forced upon its citizenry. Many of Lordaeron's overworked laborers and disenfranchised masses were taken in by this charismatic individual, and willingly sold themselves into service to the Lich King. Kel'Thuzad also used his fortunes and offers of great powers and immortality to attract and convince nobles and landowners to join his cause, bringing them into the Cult through the promise of using the lower classes to defeat their rivals and obtain even more wealth. Some of the earliest known members of the Cult of the Damned include &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronjahm\"&gt;Bronjahm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maleki%20the%20Pallid\"&gt;Maleki the Pallid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, many of Lordaeron's northern towns were completely under the control of the Cult of the Damned, and it became time for the Lich King to act.\nThird War.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; started, the cultists began openly operating alongside &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces, led by their master Kel'Thuzad, distributing plagued grain throughout northern Lordaeron. They were eventually scattered by the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and went back into hiding.\nIn the days since Prince Arthas took the fleet to Northrend, the Scourge continued to grow, taking villages and its turned inhabitants, with a small help from &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; and his corrupted food supplies.\nWhen the prince of Lordaeron became corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and changed his allegiances, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; ordered him to rally the Cult once more. The &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; began his work in &lt;a href=\"Vandermar%20Village\"&gt;Vandermar Village&lt;/a&gt;, where many hidden acolytes lived, though they eventually fell under suspicion of the local town guard. Arthas gathered the cultists and saved those in danger, destroying the village in the process. The acolytes began serving Arthas and openly acting once more.\n&lt;a href=\"Plague%20cauldron\"&gt;Plague cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s, artifacts which would spread the blight plague over wide areas, were created and placed by the Cult of the Damned in the cities they controlled, beginning in the northernmost reaches of the kingdom of Lordaeron. The plague spread quickly, wiping out the towns' populations and raising them as Scourge. Though this was a horror for an unsuspecting citizen, for a Cultist, undeath was a welcome reward.\nWhen Arthas shattered the Lich King's prison and took on the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and the spirit of Ner'zhul, the cult continued to serve him in the years to come.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Cult was still active, secretly present in nearly every city of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but its true objective was hidden; the Lich King's next move had yet to be revealed.\nAs the only living humanoid boss in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Widow%20Faerlina\"&gt;Grand Widow Faerlina&lt;/a&gt; is likely a high-ranked member of the cult. Other members include &lt;a href=\"Maleki%20the%20Pallid\"&gt;Maleki the Pallid&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the mortal &lt;a href=\"Thuzadin\"&gt;Thuzadin&lt;/a&gt; in Stratholme.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Cult of the Damned made a strong comeback and managed to infect many villages with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, including the Magmothran magnataur in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Farshire\"&gt;Farshire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; farms north of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and have infiltrated both factions' main strongholds within Borean Tundra.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, they attacked and destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Lifeblood%20Pillar\"&gt;Lifeblood Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, thus granting the undead access to the Basin. They later tried to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Glimmering%20Pillar\"&gt;Glimmering Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, but they were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Freya\"&gt;Avatar of Freya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s before they could do permanent damage.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, cultists trained, practiced, and killed mostly upon the gigantic series of gates the Lich King built to fortify &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, the area was crawling with acolytes who were raising &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s from the ice to increase the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the fall of the Lich King, the Cult of the Damned became independent of the Bolvar-controlled Scourge, and was still active in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to spread the plague and creating new undead horrors.\nHowever, their task is mostly to re-blight or prevent the healing of the Plaguelands (which has mostly failed outside of the Eastern Plaguelands).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, an apocalyptic future where the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s managed to free themselves from their prison, &lt;a href=\"Wastes%20Taskmaster\"&gt;Wastes Taskmaster&lt;/a&gt;s were still commanding &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s around &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Cult of the Damned was still active on the island of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, despite many attacks on &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, and were in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, until and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; took it.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; stated that according to &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; reports, the Cult of the Damned was still in Scholomance with &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt; at their head.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and with it the Lich King itself, the Cult of the Damned re-emerged all across Azeroth, emboldened by the message of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; brought by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Cult of the Damned considered the demons' defeat a victory for the Scourge as well. The Lich King was finally freed from the Legion's control, and could begin furthering his own plans using his powerful death knight, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. He already had the greater part of Lordaeron under his control, and he wished to expand his influence. The Cult of the Damned rejoiced in the release of its leader and continues to work for him after the war. They didn't blink an eye when Arthas shattered the Lich King's prison and took on the spirit of Ner'zhul, making the new Lich King the strongest being in the world. The Cult simply vowed to serve this new entity as it did the old, as long as he furthered the efforts of the Scourge. Considering the new Lich King is now a mobile individual, the Cult works itself into a frenzy with the thought he may leave his new home in Northrend and grace Lordaeron with his presence some day. Working beside the undead, delving into the dark magic of necromancy, and striving one day to become undead themselves, the Cult of the Damned is truly a frightening organization.\nOrganization.\nThe base of operations of the Cult of the Damned is &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and its leader is &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad takes orders from the Lich King himself, and orchestrates the spread of the Scourge. His two closest living lieutenants are referred to as simply \"Next In Line\", and are raised as &lt;a href=\"shades\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt; and replaced periodically. These leaders serve the Lich King without question, seeing &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; as the ultimate reward. Under the Next In Line, the Cult of the Damned appears to run with little rhyme or reason, but the (apparent) chaos serves the group's purpose - individual leaders cannot be picked out and targeted. Underneath the chaos is a tightly run operation with mortals dedicated to the study of dark magic, the conscription of new mortal members and undercover scouting for the Scourge's forces.\nThe Cult is situated mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and, to a lesser extent, in the rest of Lordaeron, always extending the Scourge's sphere of control. The Cult will often be found wherever the Scourge is.\nMilitary tactics.\nThe Cult of the Damned is not a military organization. It is an arm of the Scourge, and the Scourge has other methods of waging war. However, the cult contributes a pair of special weapons: necromancers and &lt;a href=\"blightweaver\"&gt;blightweaver&lt;/a&gt;s. Their dark rites support the cult, bringing curses on their enemies and raising new legions of undead.\nOn the battlefield, they are scavengers, using spells to bring their dead enemies under their control before the carrion birds can get to them, gathering large undead forces and directing them at key targets chosen by their Scourge commanders.\nDeath comes in many forms \u2014 and it's the job of the blightweaver to make sure that death comes in as terrible a form as possible. These tinkers of the vile concoct new poisons and breed new diseases, hoping to discover new plagues that will extend the Scourge's terror to every corner of Azeroth.\nOn the battlefield, the Scourge occasionally employs blightweavers as &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s of life; instead of sending teams of goblins to destroy a wall with a burst of explosives, they send these vile priests out to destroy a populace with an explosion of disease and poison. They sneak into a town while the battle rages elsewhere, plant plague animals in stables, and poison wells.\nMembership.\nWhile the current members of the Cult of the Damned are zealous individuals wholly dedicated to their cause, most new recruits are shy and weak-willed people unsure of themselves. Unpopular, abused people, often considered failures in their careers or their lives in general, are ripe for the manipulation of the Scourge as they don't have much to hold onto in the first place. With the promise of wealth, power, knowledge \u2014 whatever will motivate them \u2014 the Cult draws them in. When the mortals commit to the Cult, they are forced to drink a concoction that steals their will and enslaves them forever to the Lich King, to help them with the final act of submission. Afterward, they are given an Orb of Illusion, used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy, and are confident and in the full sway of the Lich King's powers, ready to work tirelessly to spread the will of the Scourge. Members view the Scourge with envious fascination, and many felt this way before any dark influences helped convert them. The undead seemingly defy the natural order of things and show limitless potential, for if one can beat death, one can do anything. To be undead is the greatest goal one can have in life. It is considered a reward for a life well lived (according to the Scourge, of course) to be given undeath. There is sometimes a murmur of dissent in the ranks when some feel that their fallen enemies are gifted with undeath undeservedly while cultists must work to receive that divine payment. Such grumblings are often put down quickly, usually with the threat of death with no final reward. The officers in the Cult explain that their enemies die and become allies because their numbers are much greater than the Cult of the Damned. If the Scourge only raised deserving mortals, it would not be the great force it is today. The Scourge needs the Cult because they need mortals to serve them.\nKel'Thuzad personally appoints officials and leaders for the Cult, looking for people both talented in espionage and in pursuing the dark art of necromancy. Good leadership abilities, a talent for recruitment and the ability to blend in with normal mortals are also valued skills. It is impossible to reach any officer ranks without magic, however. There are no ranking members of the Cult who do not know at least a handful of dark spells."}

The cult was led by &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, an evil &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of great power. The cult was based at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, but had agents in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ordil%27Aran\"&gt;Ruins of Ordil'Aran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers had a chance to get a &lt;a href=\"Journal%20Page\"&gt;Journal Page&lt;/a&gt; which states that the cult is a \"strand\" of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it has been discovered that most if not all of its remaining members are dead. The Tower of Althalaxx has been burnt down by Horde looters, and the Ruins of Ordil'Aran have been taken over by &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. Corpses of the cultists are still strewn among both areas.\nPower source.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; started, Athrikus Narassin trapped hundreds of Highborne in gems, falsely promising to save them. His cult received power by draining those &lt;a href=\"%3AGlowing%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;:Glowing Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;s, but there were only a few left. One, containing the soul of the Highborne &lt;a href=\"Sargath\"&gt;Sargath&lt;/a&gt;, could be found among the cultists, two others in the satyr camps &lt;a href=\"Night%20Run\"&gt;Night Run&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satyrnaar\"&gt;Satyrnaar&lt;/a&gt;. Another soul, the one of &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt;, was trapped in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by the Satyrs of &lt;a href=\"Deth%27ryll\"&gt;Deth'ryll&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ilkrud%20Magthrull\"&gt;Ilkrud Magthrull&lt;/a&gt;, lieutenant of Athrikus Narassin, commanded part of the Cult from the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Scar%20Shrine\"&gt;Fire Scar Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. He carried a tome that listed where the soul gems of those spirits trapped by Athrikus were.\nAllies.\nIt seemed that a lot of &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Felmusk\"&gt;Felmusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bleakheart\"&gt;Bleakheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deth%27ryll\"&gt;Deth'ryll&lt;/a&gt;, were allied with the Cult of the Dark Strand, as they protected soulgems of Athrikus. One of their leaders, &lt;a href=\"Delmanis%20the%20Hated\"&gt;Delmanis the Hated&lt;/a&gt;, watched over the Tower of Althalaxx. His presence there was probably to enforce the pact between the satyr and the cult with his presence and loyalty. Also the three satyrs &lt;a href=\"Balizar%20the%20Umbrage\"&gt;Balizar the Umbrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aligar%20the%20Tormentor\"&gt;Aligar the Tormentor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caedakar%20the%20Vicious\"&gt;Caedakar the Vicious&lt;/a&gt;, who attack &lt;a href=\"Feero%20Ironhand\"&gt;Feero Ironhand&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"Supplies%20to%20Auberdine\"&gt;Supplies to Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, may have been connected to the cult.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Darkstrand Cult is an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delgren%20the%20Purifier\"&gt;Delgren the Purifier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darian%20Thunderhammer\"&gt;Darian Thunderhammer&lt;/a&gt; were investigating it. Briefly, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; assisted Delgren. It is led by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt;. He has become powerful enough to command over a dozen &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s."}

This will prevent &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures that we wish to be susceptible to stun from being permanently stunned if you include enough in your raid who then rotate their Holy Wrath casts. \nThis will affect the difficulty of , but we didn't want the \"right way\" to defeat this fight to involve bringing five Paladins who their Holy Wrath spell. \nWe just hotfixed the following changes to the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; mode). \nAugust.\nAugust 6.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt; development cycle, players reported the bug that &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Streak\"&gt;Hot Streak&lt;/a&gt; did not trigger from &lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Living Bomb&lt;/a&gt; critical periodic damage. Initially, we made the decision to continue preventing Hot Streak from triggering. This resulted in the \"non-periodic\" text being added to the Hot Streak tooltip. Late in the 3.2 cycle, the decision was revisited, and Hot Streak was allowed to trigger from Living Bomb periodic damage, but too late to correct the tooltip. However, around the same time, Living Bomb was changed to be allowed on multiple targets per Mage. In addition, our QA team discovered a 3.2.0 live bug that periodic damage from &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Bolt\"&gt;Frostfire Bolt&lt;/a&gt; was being counted toward breaking the Hot Streak (as these could never crit). In discussion yesterday, we determined that with multiple targets per Mage, Living Bomb periodic damage triggering Hot Streak was too powerful. However, we still liked Living Bomb being used on multiple targets and didn\u2019t want to change that. Instead, yesterday (Wed Aug 5) we hotfixed Hot Streak so it could no longer be triggered by periodic damage, resolving both the bug with Fireball and Frostfire Bolt, and the balance concern with Living Bomb. In the course of that hotfix, a data error was introduced which caused the non-periodic damage from Fireball and Frostfire Bolt to never break the Hot Streak streaks on non-crits. That data error was corrected with a hotfix this morning (Thr Aug 6). \nFinal result: \nHost Streak triggers exactly as stated in its tooltip: \"2 non-periodic spell criticals in a row using &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Blast\"&gt;Fire Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Living Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Bolt\"&gt;Frostfire Bolt&lt;/a&gt;\". Only non-periodic damage interacts with it, and only those spells listed. Periodics do not affect the streak in any way. Direct damage from the listed spells always count, for or against the streak. \nSorry for any confusion that resulted from us not posting this sooner.

We've also made some improvements to the overall pace of combat at low levels: Due to the accumulated effect of years' worth of max-level tuning adjustments, many classes were killing low-level enemies nearly instantaneously, even without &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt; gear or other advantages.

It is &lt;a href=\"Prophet%23Known%20prophecies\"&gt;prophesied&lt;/a&gt; as the moment when the Old Gods will finally be freed from their ancient prisons and will return to end all life on Azeroth.\nHistory.\nA very ancient prophecy speaks of the Hour of Twilight--&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s final moments of existence. At the last sunset, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, sealed away within the depths of the world long ago, will enact their judgment and irrevocably twist the mortal world to reflect their essence. On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20orc\"&gt;Pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s received a prophecy of the Hour of Twilight from the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s: a time when the shadow would envelop the universe and snuff out all life in existence. When the Pale, as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, they immediately sensed the Old Gods and realized Azeroth was the place where the prophecy would occur.\n&lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;'s vision of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s one day causing the Hour of Twilight, capable of potentially wiping out all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the reasons the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; empowered &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; with their powers, to ultimately avert this single catastrophe, although Aman'Thul for all his vast powers was not omniscient and was unaware &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; would eventually be corrupted into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Using this to their advantage, the Old Gods corrupted &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; as a way to make their plan \"foolproof\", using one of the very Aspects destined to stop the Hour of Twilight, to instead usher it. Nozdormu received another vision of the future which made it apparent that Deathwing would be the Hour of Twilight's Harbinger after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt possibly started with &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;the reopening of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, when the Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; stirred from its slumber beneath the lands of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. A chain of events is set in motion where the Old Gods are rising, their ancient machinations are finally paying off, and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; is their greatest pawn upon the board. While the insane Aspect believes himself to have his own purposes, his mind and soul were devoured by the Old Gods from the onset, and in this final hour the former Earth-Warder of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s has become the ultimate weapon for the Old Gods to unleash.\nDeathwing's attempt at fulfilling the Hour of Twilight was finally stopped when he was vanquished at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and mortal champions of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. However, this victory came at a great cost, with the dragonflights' losing the majority of their power and immortality, as they had, at last, fulfilled their ancient purpose.\nEnd Time.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s vision of the Hour of Twilight, all the five Aspects, including &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself, lay dead and broken at the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, having been destroyed by their own powers. Every lifeform on Azeroth will be dead and rotting, except twilight dragons. This outcome was also a possible future if &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; would not step in the place of Neltharion as the aspect of earth, and remained in the Horde instead of appointing Garrosh as his replacement.\nThe grim aftermath of the Hour of Twilight can be witnessed first hand by players within the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. When the Hour of Twilight shown in the End Time has come to pass, all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; forever has faded, and only time-twisted echoes (and possibly some newly risen ghouls) are left to aimlessly wander a dead and empty world.\nSpeculations.\nTrue End Time?\n states in &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; that he has seen the \"true End Time\", worse than what is seen in the instance, and that the Hour of Twilight was simply a blessing the world cannot comprehend. This leaves the question as to what Murozond is referring to, but since he was once it is not surprising that Murozond would be able to travel through time to different possible outcomes to see this true End Time. As to why Nozdormu never mentions this true End Time is a mystery. Murozond may be lying. This concept may also explain the discrepancy between Ysera's vision and what players encounter.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; instance, the &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;future and maddened self of Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; states that he has \"witnessed the True End Time\", and proclaims that the dead and empty world the adventurers see is \"a blessing you simply can not comprehend\". When he is eventually slain by the adventurers with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;his former and still sane self&lt;/a&gt;, Murozond's final words are: \"... What I... have... seen...\".\nThese strange remarks suggest that Murozond is the consequence of Nozdormu eventually bearing witness to something he has yet to have witnessed in the present, and that the End Time the adventurers journey to is in fact a time pocket that Murozond and his &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; weaved to be able to escape or at least hide from this \"True End Time\". \nSince the End Time that Nozdormu/Murozond hides himself in already portrays the apocalypse having come to pass, it raises the very disturbing question as to what the Great Aspect of Time could possibly have seen beyond the end of the world that instilled such terror in him it forever pushed him over the brink of insanity.\nEven with Deathwing's demise, the Old Gods may still be plotting another way of achieving their ultimate goal, suggesting that the Hour of Twilight was only delayed and not truly stopped. The further proof to this claim is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Blank%20Scroll\"&gt;The Blank Scroll&lt;/a&gt;\" short story, where &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;--fueled by the power of the Scroll--managed to destroy most bastions of resistance against his goal to gain Orcish supremacy over the world. For a time they ruled, and then the apocalypse occurred; caused either by the Legion or the Naga and the Faceless ones (referred to as \"horrors from the sea\") or maybe both, fighting a devastating war that ultimately destroyed Azeroth.\nA similar outcome alluding to \"The Blank Scroll\" story is presented during the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; questline (as well as the Mythic-only last phase of the final encounter with Garrosh Hellscream in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; raid). &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;, trying to push the Vision to its limits, requests an adventurer to find a most devastating timeway he can find. During the vision, faction leaders of both Horde and Alliance can be seen impaled, adorning the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, which is ruined by the Orcish siege as well as polluted with Y'Shaarj's essence.\nWhile this is the version of the Hour of Twilight put forth on Azeroth, it does not, in fact, seem to be the true Hour of Twilight. The Pale Orcs of Draenor heard of the prophecy from the Void lords themselves, and this version states that the Hour of Twilight is when the Void consumes all reality. It's possible that this is what Murozond was referring to.\nIt is possible that the alternate future that is &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; was what Nozdormu was trying to prevent.\nAt least initially, whether Nozdormu's fate was inevitable seems to have been unclear. Nozdormu stated that the End Time was not an \"inevitable\" future, &lt;a href=\"Alurmi\"&gt;Alurmi&lt;/a&gt; claims afterwards that the End Time was apparently overwritten as a timestrand, and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; in their post-Cataclysm meeting that Nozdormu and others \"had altered that future forever\", thereby erasing his responsibility for Murozond. Nevertheless, the most recent lore in Chronicles Vol. 3 seems to indicate that Nozdormu's fate was \"inescapable\". Exactly how Nozdormu regained enough of his Aspect abilities as Murozond to counter his former empowered self is also debatable, although it is possible the Old Gods or their servants (although most of those on Azeroth are apparently slain in the present day) empowered him much like they did Deathwing. Whether this means Murozond's End Time is also inescapable as Azeroth's future, or something else entirely, remains ambiguous. \nVoid-fallen Azeroth\nIt's possible that the true Hour of Twilight is not the resurfacing of the Old Gods on Azeroth, but the successful corruption of Azeroth's world-soul into an immensely powerful &lt;a href=\"World-soul%23Corruption\"&gt;Dark Titan&lt;/a&gt;. The potential for a world-soul to be corrupted by the Void Lords was what drove Sargeras to begin the Burning Crusade, with the goal of wiping out all life in the universe in order to prevent the Void Lords from corrupting it. Under the Void Lords' influence, Azeroth could be used as a tool for them to corrupt the universe, or as a source of power to use to fully manifest themselves into it.\nThe seeming contradictions as to the nature of the Hour of Twilight might be attributed to the mercurial and incomprehensible nature of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; itself, with its constantly embracing all possibilities as potential truth, and makes it possible that there is indeed more than one single future outcome for the Hour of Twilight."}

Reaching their destination will be an arduous endeavor: the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; has amassed its forces near the temple, determined to intercept the Dragon Soul at any cost.\nSet in the present-day &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, now under a full invasion by the Twilight's Hammer. Players must escort Thrall and the Dragon Soul safely to Wyrmrest Temple, where the assault on Deathwing is to commence. But the Twilight's Hammer forces are numerous, and their leadership remains strong. Those attacking the temple are commanded by a man known very well for the strength of will he's offered Alliance citizens. Now with his own will broken, he preaches only Deathwing's cataclysmic vision for all life on Azeroth.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"With the Dragon Soul retrieved from the past, the Heroes of Azeroth now prepare for the final confrontation with Deathwing. In the frozen wastes of Northrend, the towering spire of Wyrmrest Temple is under the assault of Deathwing's Twilight forces. In order to save Azeroth, Thrall must arrive safely at the temple with the Dragon Soul in hand.\"\nGeography.\nWalkthrough.\nThe party arrives through the timegate in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vice\"&gt;Crystal Vice&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; awaits them in order to aid him reach &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ice%20elemental\"&gt;ice elemental&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"Arcurion\"&gt;Arcurion&lt;/a&gt; will ambush the group, and after the party has dealt with his minions, &lt;a href=\"Arcurion\"&gt;Arcurion&lt;/a&gt; himself appears at the exit from the canyon and joins the fray.\nWhen Arcurion falls, the party heads to &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt; digsite. On the other side red drakes await the party in order to transport them to Wyrmrest. On the way the group must deal with the Twilight gauntlet, and finally &lt;a href=\"Asira%20Dawnslayer\"&gt;Asira Dawnslayer&lt;/a&gt; - the second boss of the instance that kills one of the drakes on her way in.\nWhen Asira is defeated, Thrall resurrects the slain drake and heads towards the temple, which is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Iso%27rath\"&gt;Iso'rath&lt;/a&gt;-like maws. More drakes arrive to take players there as well.

If you have any ranged DPS in the group who are able to fly, have them stand on the parapets along the tower and just DPS the shade to death. The shade's summons and the regular guys on guard won't be able to hit due to their melee range, but the shade casts shadow bolts and won't go into auto-evade mode.

While influential, House Duskmere owed much of its power to the heir to the house, &lt;a href=\"Ruven\"&gt;Ruven&lt;/a&gt;. The Duskmeres would embrace the secrets of Elisande's &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; allies, with Ruven Duskmere himself becoming one of the few &lt;a href=\"Felborne\"&gt;Felborne&lt;/a&gt;. Ruven and his fellow Duskmeres eventually began smuggling &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; citizens out of the city by water as prisoners, for their souls to be used to power the Legion's war effort.\nAs the conflict raged, the position of advisor to the Grand Magistrix became available, and was quickly contested by the nobility. House Duskmere remained a close ally of &lt;a href=\"House%20Stelleris\"&gt;House Stelleris&lt;/a&gt;, owing to the personal relationship between Ruven and &lt;a href=\"Coryn%20Stelleris\"&gt;Coryn Stelleris&lt;/a&gt;, and the Duskmeres would support Coryn in his bid for the title. Their chief opponent, &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; (secretly working with the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;), worked to undo this alliance. Rebel &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s would assassinate Ruven Duskmere in the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Court\"&gt;Midnight Court&lt;/a&gt;, and rumors were intentionally spread that Coryn Stelleris was responsible.\nRuven's death and the subsequent rumors would turn House Duskmere against House Stelleris, who they now blamed for the murder. This would result in Ly'leth Lunastre winning the election and, after Coryn's death in &lt;a href=\"Tal%27ashar\"&gt;Tal'ashar&lt;/a&gt;, taking the role of Advisor to the Grand Magistrix."}

Powerful and aristocratic in a society that values both qualities, the Lunastres remain one of the guiding factions among the shal'dorei, and are currently under the stewardship of &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Lunastre is based from the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;, on the western upper levels of Suramar. This is in contrast to the other noble houses, who generally reside in the eastern half of the city proper, and highlights the Lunastres' less haughty attitude among their brethren. There exists a large number of servants and other agents continuously in the employ of House Lunastre, who show unflinching loyalty toward their patrons.\nHistory.\nWhile House Lunastre held prominence since at least one generation beforehand, the faction's true significance arose at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Having succeeded her late (and possibly assassinated) father as leader of the house, &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; secretly allied her family with the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the coming conflict, the resources of House Lunastre would play a major role furthering the rebel cause, and would allow them to gain a foothold in Suramar City.\nHouse Lunastre, along with its allied houses, would eventually contest an opening for the position of advisor to the Grand Magistrix; Ly'leth herself would eventually succeed to the position, continuing to work covertly for the Nightfallen cause from within the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself. Towards the conclusion of the civil war, Ly'leth and her family's loyalties would be discovered, leading to her imprisonment. She would ultimately be freed when the Nighthold fell to the insurgents.\nFollowing the Nightfallen rebellion, Ly'leth (and by extension House Lunastre) held increased influence as part of Suramar's new government led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. Though the rebellion had caused &lt;a href=\"Anarys%20Lunastre\"&gt;some rifts&lt;/a&gt; within the family, the house was once again fully united in its aftermath. They would subsequently join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of Suramar some time before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;."}

Within nightborne aristocracy, House Stelleris occupies one of the highest positions, and stands as one of the most powerful of such factions within the city. Like most of Suramar's nobility, House Stelleris is based from the Noble District located around the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;. They are notorious for employing underhanded and cruel tactics to achieve their goals.\nHouse Stelleris has traditionally been allied with &lt;a href=\"House%20Duskmere\"&gt;House Duskmere&lt;/a&gt;, and has been seen to stand against Houses &lt;a href=\"House%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Astravar\"&gt;Astravar&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the death of its leader &lt;a href=\"Coryn\"&gt;Coryn&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown if House Stelleris still remains active.\nHistory.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, House Stelleris was led by &lt;a href=\"Coryn\"&gt;Lord Coryn&lt;/a&gt; and wielded significant power in and around the city's Noble District. Unlike the more sympathetic &lt;a href=\"House%20Lunastre\"&gt;House Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, members of House Stelleris displayed all the haughtiness and disdain commonplace among &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; nobility.\nAs the conflict escalated, the position of advisor to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; became available for aspiring members of the aristocracy, who scrambled to claim the honor. Lord Coryn Stelleris quickly became one of the chief contenders, and fought viciously against &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; for the title. Though House Stelleris attempted to coerce &lt;a href=\"House%20Astravar\"&gt;House Astravar&lt;/a&gt; into supporting their bid by kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Ailen%20Astravar\"&gt;Ailen Astravar&lt;/a&gt;, this plan failed with the intervention of Ly'leth's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruven\"&gt;Ruven&lt;/a&gt;, a close friend of Coryn and head of &lt;a href=\"House%20Duskmere\"&gt;House Duskmere&lt;/a&gt;, would soon be killed by &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebel agents (who Ly'leth was secretly in league with); rumors were soon spread by opponents of House Stelleris that Coryn was responsible for the murder. These events would lead to House Duskmere turning against Coryn and House Stelleris, whose reputation was ruined by the incident. Ly'leth would subsequently win election to the position and travel to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt; to accept the appointment.\nDespite the setbacks, Coryn refused to concede defeat and would confront Ly'leth personally within the Sanctum of Order, challenging her to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27ashar\"&gt;Tal'ashar&lt;/a&gt; for the title. In the ensuing duel between Coryn and Ly'leth's chosen &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;, Coryn would be slain. Now unopposed, Ly'leth claimed the position of advisor.\nEven after Ly'leth Lunastre's victory in the election, House Stelleris continued to harass her allies and attempt to disrupt her support base, specifically hiring masked thugs to this end. With the help of her allies in the Nightfallen, Ly'leth would succeed in rooting out and putting a stop to these attacks."}

Their seat is the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;, in the region of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. Before their establishment as a House, the Waycrest family led the war against the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; when humans first settled Kul Tiras thousands of years ago. Providing most of the nation's ore and some of its toughest warriors, House Waycrest has been a loyal supporter of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s rule for centuries.\nHistory.\nHouse Waycrest's history dates back to at least as far back as the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;war against the Drust&lt;/a&gt; during the founding of Kul Tiras. With settlers forced to abandon their land due to the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; destroying every settlement they came across. Realizing that the battle was going against them, &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; ordered several of his men to see if they could find any weaknesses the Drust might have. With several results such as onions and silver, Arom was able to turn the tide. Not even the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;Drust construct&lt;/a&gt;s could stop them. Arom chased the Drust king all the way up a mountain and stabbed the Drust king. As he was stabbed &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;'s power was broken and with it his connection to his stone constructs, which shattered.\nWith this victory, Arom was given the title of Lord and from then on, his family would rule Drustvar as House Waycrest.\nMillennia later, the Drust sought to return from the afterlife. Gorak Tul communed with &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; and in exchange for Drust magic, she and her followers would bring the Drust back to the realm of the living.\nIt all started when the Lord Arthur Waycrest, a descendant of Arom, came under a dire illness. His wife, Meredith, would lock herself in their chambers with no words from inside of their Manor. Eventually, Lady Waycrest appeared to calm down the villagers and took control of the army. Meredith began recruiting young girls to join her cult, the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;. At night, she would teach them all that she had learned, and at morning they would return to their households without saying a word. The cult would spread to others with the men being put under a curse of subjugation. Eventually, the village fell.\nAt the same time, the daughter of the Lord and Lady, &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; would find herself accused of witchcraft for the happenings at &lt;a href=\"Fletcher%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Fletcher's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Marshal Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt;, Lucille would prove her innocence and reforms the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the Heartsbane Coven. With her friends and allies, she mounted an attack against the Coven and managed to push them back at every turn. After taking down the barrier at Corlain, she and the Order of Embers rush all the way to Waycrest Manor. At the entrance, they were confronted by Meredith who corrupted the Marshal and ran inside the manor. With a said heart, Lucille watched Everit being taken down. She kneeled next to him to mourned his loss. With no other option, she and the Order of Embers stormed the Manor.\nBut Lady Waycrest was merely a vessel for Gorak Tul's power, and her death opened the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, the doorway for the Drust to enter Azeroth.

The purpose of this House is the creation of necrotic constructs -- abominations and their ilk, to populate Maldraxxus's armies. However, as of late, &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; has been serving a very different master. It is the origin of all the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; constructs of the necrolords and their fleshcrafters, who depend on the art of fleshcrafting embued within their Margrave and used by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; in creating Maldraxxus.\nThe house is not just &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es are present, such as &lt;a href=\"Faldo%20Iscar\"&gt;Faldo Iscar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Amputory\"&gt;Amputory&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"aranakk\"&gt;aranakk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thread%20House\"&gt;Thread House&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Thread%20Mistress%20Leeda\"&gt;Thread Mistress Leeda&lt;/a&gt;. The process of creating a construct involves gathering flesh and parts to construct the body, where different types of flesh can provide different effects (such as making the construct impervious or obedience and dexterity as with &lt;a href=\"Kyrian\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; flesh), pulled apart at the &lt;a href=\"Separation%20Chamber\"&gt;Separation Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, let liquify and congeal in the central pool, and requiring the flesh be purged of its memories and soul before assembly in order to insert a Maldraxxian soul by a necromancer, such as Faldo Iscar. Alternatively, an existing construct may be separated body and soul by a necromancer. Souls of constructs are kept within and around the &lt;a href=\"Etheric%20Vault\"&gt;Etheric Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Bones needed for the constructs are generated from the &lt;a href=\"Ossein%20Foundry\"&gt;Ossein Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and infused with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. Stitching the flesh together requires &lt;a href=\"%3APristine%20Fleshstitcher%20Needles\"&gt;:Pristine Fleshstitcher Needles&lt;/a&gt;, carved from the bones of Maldraxxus itself, and &lt;a href=\"%3ARazorthread%20Spool\"&gt;:Razorthread Spool&lt;/a&gt; (likely from the Razorthread Spiders seen around the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; and around the Thread House). Once the body is constructed, the body is pumped full of ascerbic bile and mucilaginous enzymes and then fitted with a heart. Bringing the construct together requires an &lt;a href=\"Abominable%20Stitching\"&gt;Abominable Stitching&lt;/a&gt; table and anima. The weapons of the constructs are created at the Ossein Foundry.\nEach House of Maldraxxus has two Barons, with &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Antolyte\"&gt;Baroness Antolyte&lt;/a&gt; leading the House's invasion of Bastion and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Halis\"&gt;Baron Halis&lt;/a&gt; staying in the House of Constructs. The &lt;a href=\"Stitchmasters\"&gt;Stitchmasters&lt;/a&gt; are elements of the House that resisted Gharmal's warmongering orders, instead remaining true to the vision of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them &lt;a href=\"Rebellious%20Souls%23Description\"&gt;were punished&lt;/a&gt; for standing against him by having their crafted forms taken from them, reducing them to useless souls. They later joined with the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, regaining their forms and helped to take down their former leader.\nDescription.\n\"The true cost of our wars is the honored fallen. Damaged beyond reclamation upon the battlefield, the House of Constructs simply won't accept what they cannot remake.\""}

Positions within the organization are typically inherited. Under the direction of the kingdom's ruling dynasty, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;House of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;monarch of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; is aided in their role as head of government by the House of Nobles, which possesses considerable power on many internal matters and the running of the kingdom's day to day affairs.\nThe nobles are mainly royal advisors who have major leverage over business and labor, due to the fact that they own much of the land themselves. For instance, it is able to lobby for important administrative issues, and possesses the right to overrule regional elected officials on matters of law. While the nobles wield considerable power within Stormwind, the House has less influence within the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. They have clashed with the monarch on more than one occasion, but the monarchy has recently learned to not let the nobles push them around anymore.\nThe king can provide the House with temporary stewardship if he leaves the kingdom.\nHistory.\nThe House of Nobles already existed before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, as in order to secure a spot among them, the &lt;a href=\"Ellerian\"&gt;Ellerian&lt;/a&gt; noble family of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; pre-arranged the marriage of &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin Ellerian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; at her birth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, most of the nobles of the kingdom were slain by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; when they razed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Following the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; secure his place as Stormwind's next king by providing him with experienced ministers and advisors.\nAfter being razed by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the House of Nobles contracted the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemason's Guild&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild the broken &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;city of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. They spent years toiling to rebuild the glorious city but were left broke, their fees and salaries left unpaid and unspoken for, as they were forgotten by the city's officials. When the time of the rightful payment came, the nobles of Stormwind couldn't because they ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; manipulated both sides with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; - her meddling in the rebuilding of Stormwind left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the guild, while the workers were enraged that the nobility despised them and were threatening to withhold payment. Although some of the nobles supported the Stonemasons Guild, such as &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count%20Erlgadin\"&gt;Count Erlgadin&lt;/a&gt;, who lobbied to improve the working conditions for the stonemasons during the restoration of the kingdom.\nUpon returning from a foray, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was unable to negotiate a resolution that appeased both parties. While he agreed that the Stonemasons' fees were excessive, he felt the amount offered by the council of nobles was too stingy. In retrospection, Varian realized that the nobles were unduly influenced by Lady Katrana, and later suspected that half of each side had been ensorcelled by Prestor. When the Guildmaster of the Stonemasons &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, and it turned into a heated dispute, which resulted in riots that led to the murder of Queen Tiffin.\nThe conflict ended when VanCleef and his Stonemasons fled the city and the wrath of King Varian Wrynn, hiding in the rural areas of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to escape prosecution. From the shadows, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; continued to stoke their rage by using her influence as Lady Prestor to cut off supplies and support to the region. They became the terrorist organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, turning to &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;ry and murder to recover the gold owed to them, and under &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, they were determined to destroy the corrupted House of Nobles and Stormwind City with it.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Baurles%20K.%20Wishock\"&gt;Lord Baurles K. Wishock&lt;/a&gt; caused quite a stir amongst the House of Nobles after he discovered the hidden enclave of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of Stormwind, in the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Lamb\"&gt;Slaughtered Lamb&lt;/a&gt;'s basement and catacombs. When he began to lobby for a full investigation, and intended to petition the king to shut down the establishment, he was murdered with poison by warlocks wishing to practice their ways without disturbance.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Targorr%20the%20Dread\"&gt;Targorr the Dread&lt;/a&gt; was captured, he was being held in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced to death. However, one of the bureaucratic nobles put a hold on his execution to serve as their political pawn, until he was killed by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Berton\"&gt;Guard Berton&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the House of Nobles interfered with the judgment of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; regarding the execution of the grave robber &lt;a href=\"Dextren%20Ward\"&gt;Dextren Ward&lt;/a&gt;, and instead had him locked in the Stormwind Stockade. To send a clear message, &lt;a href=\"Councilman%20Millstipe\"&gt;Councilman Millstipe&lt;/a&gt; sent an adventurer to execute Dexten, so that the corrupt bureaucrats understand that the people of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; will stand against Stormwind if they do nothing to help them.\nAmong the corrupt nobles, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; had an ally, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gregor%20Lescovar\"&gt;Lord Gregor Lescovar&lt;/a&gt;, an aristocrat who conspired with the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. He was later assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Tyrion\"&gt;Tyrion&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a member of the House of Nobles, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20S.%20J.%20Erlgadin\"&gt;Sir S. J. Erlgadin&lt;/a&gt; grew bitter about the role of the nobles in the betrayal of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%27%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons' Guild&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he decided to no longer uphold his position as a &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; in the political assembly, and gave up both his place and title to join the &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%20Safari%20%28group%29\"&gt;Nesingwary Safari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Comic.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; disappeared, after being kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, he was succeeded by his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. However, the kingdom was kept in a state of chaos and political unrest due to the corruption created by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; and her manipulations of the House of Nobles. When Varian returned, a massive ceremony was held in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, where the citizens had only been informed that the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; had ransomed the king. During the ceremony, Anduin told his father that the ransom was paid with a painful new tax imposed by the House of Nobles, and that their people were even more angry and impoverished.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, several nobles were part of the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Delegation\"&gt;Honor Delegation&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, selected to stand behind the king when he would deliver his memorial speech. Among them, some nobles led by &lt;a href=\"Aldous%20Lescovar\"&gt;Baron Aldous Lescovar&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded his traitorous father, were growing discontent with costs of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; wars that their ferocious &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was involving the kingdom in, though they had no love for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; either. When &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; approached the drunken group, they behaved rudely towards her and Aldous told her that she should use her influence to stop the king's current plans. However, Varian entered and was enraged to find that the nobles had been grumbling about the costs of his campaigns, to which the king harshly berated them for their petty complaints. Varian then dismissed the nobles, causing the stunned audience to slowly file out.\nWhen Varian didn't show up in time to start his speech to the people of Stormwind, some of the nobles wanted the ceremony to move forward, king or no king, while others insisted that they should wait for their leader, no matter how long it took. When the people began to lose patience, all the nobles and other members of the delegation convinced &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; to give a speech, as he was truly loved by the citizens. After King Varian survived an assassination attempt and made his speech, everyone applauded with joy, even Aldous Lescovar and his nobles were standing and cheering, swept up by the power and pride of their king's vision.\nTides of War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian Wrynn declared war on the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and decided to lead a naval force towards &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to break the naval blockade of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Although the nobles tried to convince him to stay in Stormwind City, he refused to send his soldiers to fight without being on their side.\nFourth War and aftermath.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the House of Nobles was still active in the kingdom. Since &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension as king, the House of Nobles has seen great strides in rooting out corruption, mainly under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of the . Among the nobles targeted by the measures, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; and his household had made some questionable decisions to regain their prestige, but the king's actions against corruption only made things worse for them.\nAfter King Anduin's abduction by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as regent and protector of the realm with the support of the nobles. The nobles were keen on restoring Stormwind's defenses in the wake of the Fourth War, and Turalyon remained popular with them in the years to come.\nDragonflight.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt; succeeded her father as the head of her family and a member of the House of Nobles. Rather than dissolve her noble house, she used her influence among the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to support and formalize the &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants seeking to revitalize the region. When they began to ask for support from the kingdom, some leadership and nobles in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; were already receptive to their requests, notably &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Joran%20Tremaind\"&gt;Lord Joran Tremaind&lt;/a&gt; who began to support them. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, while many corrupt nobles appeared favorable to the actions of the guild, they would soon send their agents, refusing to let the people of Westfall have power over them, and she would be there to stop them.\nFor Countess Cecilia Clessington, the Breadbasket Guild was a first step towards real changes in the Stormwind society, not only by uniting the voices of the people to bring a message to the leaders of the kingdom, but also to make things evolve from inside the House of Nobles. Her long-term goal being to gradually transform the House of Nobles into the \"House of the People\". Although many nobles are against this project, some of the younger nobles have started to listen to her proposals, such as Lord Joran Tremaind.\nIn the RPG.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; finished rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, though, the corrupt House of Nobles refused to pay the guild for its work. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; was unable to fix matters because the House of Nobles held too much political power and outmaneuvered him repeatedly. Some of the more senior of the Stonemasons, including &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, were offered governmental jobs if they'd just be quiet and play along.\nSpeculations.\nMost members of the House of Nobles in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; Keep are presumably part of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Court of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Though not of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; caste, the very highest echelon of &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; society, the Ravencrest clan nevertheless occupied a position of great influence in the realm. The house was known to be quite ancient, and from their imposing seat at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; to the east of the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, the Ravencrests remained loyal servants to the venerated &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; throughout her long reign.\nThe most famed member of House Ravencrest, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; notably led the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; during the infamous &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; against the encroaching &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Kur'talos's assassination during the conflict, and the war's subsequent chaotic conclusion, led to the virtual end of House Ravencrest as a prominent force. Despite this, the Ravencrest line continued to modern times through certain surviving members, such as &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rooksguard\"&gt;Rooksguard&lt;/a&gt; served the House of Ravencrest as its elite military force, specifically as protectors of Black Rook Hold.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; to bear the clan designation of Ravencrest originally discovered the huge granite formation that would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Remarking that huge, dark birds circled and nested atop it, the elf took it as a sign, and for more than a generation servants of his line carved the solid rock into a mighty fortress like none other seen among the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The structure extended its military influence over most of the realm, the power of Black Rook Hold tipping the balance when conflict arose between the night elves and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, those of the clan of Ravencrest became the honored of the throne and the blood of both sides intermingled.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAt the onset of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of kaldorei who were not slain initially formed what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of stopping the demons. As the most senior authority figure outside the capital, and as head of a large portion of the night elves' military, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; took charge as head of the Resistance. A skilled tactician, levelheaded commander, and inspiring leader, Kur'talos was unique among the kaldorei ruling classes.\nThough he, like many in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, despised the pompous &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, he was unflinchingly loyal to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Despite evidence that the Queen had been involved in bringing the Legion to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the first place, Kur'talos and the vast majority of Resistance fighters were adamant about rescuing the Queen from the treacherous Highborne.\nThroughout the conflict, Kur'talos's leadership delivered many victories to the Resistance, though they were eventually pushed back to Black Rook Hold itself. Believed to be able to withstand the demons, the fortress was used to cover an evacuation of the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the campaign, Queen Azshara, frustrated with what she saw as Kur'talos's defiance, ordered his assassination. Stabbed from behind during a battle with the demons by an agent of the Queen, Kur'talos's death proved to be a great blow to the Resistance. When the war finally ended with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Kalimdor was torn apart and the night elves now found themselves isolated on a new continent.\nFrom that point onward, night elf society underwent a series of drastic changes that saw the removal of aristocratic classes. Although the last member of the Ravencrest line to occupy a position of major authority, Lord Kur'talos was survived by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna&lt;/a&gt;, who endured the war. For his heroism during the war against the Burning Legion, Kur'talos Ravencrest remains the most famous and celebrated member of the house to date.\nFollowing the Sundering, Black Rook Hold was thought lost with the rest of Old Kalimdor, though this later proved untrue.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched its third invasion of Azeroth, it sparked a war in the Broken Isles. It was subsequently revealed to many that the ancient Ravencrest seat at Black Rook Hold had in fact survived the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Now located in the region known as &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress quickly became a target of the demons. During a ritual, the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in raising the spirits of all those who had once made their home in Black Rook Hold, including Kur'talos Ravencrest and many of his descendants. These ghosts were made to see the Legion's enemies as invading demons, and thus forced to relive the horrors of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war, however, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assaulted Black Rock Hold, succeeding in defeating many of the spirits and reaching Kur'talos, who was being manipulated by a &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; disguised as the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Latosius\"&gt;Latosius&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing fight, Kur'talos saw through the demons' illusion, reacting with horror at their impending victory. He proceeded to summon the souls of his ancestors to aid in the fight against 'Latosius', now revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Dantalionax\"&gt;Dantalionax&lt;/a&gt;. This combined force ultimately proved sufficient to defeat the demon and end the Legion's influence in Black Rook Hold.\nKur'talos's daughter &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, who had since taken the path of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, returned to Black Rook Hold after the Legion seized control there. Becoming caught up in the demons' illusion herself she attacked those assaulting the hold, believing she was defending her ancestral home and was subsequently slain."}

Five members of the dynasty came into power in Quel'Thalas: &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, two unnamed monarchs, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The Sunstriders reigned in Quel'Thalas for almost 7,000 years, aided by a group of the seven highest lords in the kingdom, known as the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;; although the Convocation became the official ruling body, the Sunstriders maintained a modicum of political power as the royal House.\nFamily tree.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nHistory.\nSunstrider is a &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; term that means \"he who walks the day\". Such a name was an oddity among the nocturne, moon-worshipping &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, and it was chosen by the family's progenitors to symbolize their penchant for delving into the unknown, for breaking expectations and throwing caution to the wind in their search for greatness. The Sunstriders served the throne of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; for twenty generations up until the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where current head &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt; instead chose to rebuke the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, as such carrying on his family's tradition of boldness with pride.\nDath'Remar was born a member of the wealthy and powerful Highborne. He was a wise elf, but was obsessed with the Highborne's magical way of life, and resented the restrictions placed upon his kind by the night elf government following the War of the Ancients. He and the Highborne were eventually banished from Kalimdor by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; for their refusal to forsake magic. Dath'Remar led his people across the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the land that would one day be &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, founding the new &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to the north, where he established his royal bloodline and renamed his people the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. He created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; using a stolen vial of the Well of Eternity and erected the elven capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Dath'Remar's weapon was called &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient rune-inscribed sword which would also be wielded by both of his known descendants. During his reign, the armor &lt;a href=\"Lu%27minellia\"&gt;Lu'minellia&lt;/a&gt; was also crafted. Dath'Remar stepped down as leader after establishing his empire. He believed, and proclaimed, that Quel'Thalas would come to dwarf the night elves' civilization and stand as a monument for the ages. The Sunwell was named in Dath'Remar's honor, in recognition of the Highborne leader's bold quest to reignite their culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the great-grandson of Dath'Remar, ruled Quel'Thalas for roughly 2,800 years. This period encompassed the bloody &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, in which Anasterian dealt the elves' hated &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; neighbors a heavy blow; and Anasterian also ruled during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, facing the Old Horde and the Scourge. Although uninterested in the humans' war, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; when his own kingdom was threatened but withdrew from the Alliance following the war's conclusion. Anasterian was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the Third War, along with the Convocation and a staggering 90% of his people. He was slain in a heated duel with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the man who would become the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Anasterian's son and successor decreed that Anasterian would always be remembered as the last king of the high elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian's only son, took up the mantle of leadership in his father's place after the crushing Third War. Although he felt lost without his beloved father, Kael resolved to do all he could for his shattered kingdom and its beleaguered people and promised to make his father's memory proud. As the last of the Sunstriders, Kael carried a heavy burden and took on sole leadership of the Sunstriders' remaining subjects without the destroyed Convocation of Silvermoon, which he never restored. Kael'thas renamed the high elves the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of their fallen king and brethren and named &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; his steward while he left Quel'Thalas for Lordaeron and then &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to bring his people deliverance and claim vengeance for the destruction of their kingdom. Kael'thas was hailed as a true champion of the blood elf people, and a proud defender of their race's ancient lineage.\nDownfall.\nThe last of the Sunstriders faced many challenges after leaving his homeland, coming to reside in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a spacial fortress in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Damningly, the prince fell prey to &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; the Deceiver's influences while sojourning on Outland, covertly shifting his allegiance from &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, in return for the promise of his people's salvation. After the fall of Tempest Keep, he returned to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, to further the plans he had struck with Kil'jaeden.\nIn the Legion's shadow, Kael'thas's decisions made him many enemies, but the most furious opposition ironically came from his own people. His own kingdom eventually branded him a traitor after the prince returned in order to summon forth his master, and the people of Quel'Thalas were shaken by his actions.\nKael'thas was eventually killed and buried on Quel'Danas, the same place as his father.\nLegacy.\nKael'thas' death brought an unhappy end to the Sunstrider dynasty, casting a bitter pall over the blood elves left behind. His statues remain standing in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, which has inspired mockery from both the Alliance and Horde.\nKael was succeeded by his regent, Lor'themar Theron, who has continued to style himself as the \"regent lord\" in the wake of House Sunstrider's downfall. This is in part due to Kael'thas officially decreeing that King Anasterian would be the last king of Quel'Thalas, but also because Lor'themar does not wish to start his own dynasty.\n&lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt; continues to be honored in Quel'Thalas, and aspiring blood elf adventurers are encouraged to pay their respects to the founder of their kingdom - all who prosper in Quel'Thalas do so thanks to him. &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; is remembered as one of the blood elves' greatest heroes, and they are known to charge into battle with his name upon their lips. The &lt;a href=\"Monument%20to%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Monument to the Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, erected during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Battle for Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, quickly took on additional significance for the sin'dorei, as it was on Quel'Danas that Anasterian made his heroic last stand against Arthas.\nThe Sunstriders' family blade, &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, was eventually recovered by a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;fire-favoring mage of distinction&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Sunstriders ruled &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Sunstrider Palace&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is helped in its duties by &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;a royal court&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily tree.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; was originally founded 1,200 years before the First War by the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline, who had migrated south from the nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling past the rocky mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In a fertile valley they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right. It had a long and prosperous history, with the king served loyally by the knights of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt;. Secretive &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s also served the kingdom, and as such &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; had its own &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;court conjurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe constant bickering and infighting that marred the rules of the former kings of Arathor had no place in the court of Wrynn, and all had been peaceful for many generations in the kingdom until the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ended the conflict by scattering the unified &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; packs and bringing back peace, solidifying the rule of the Wrynn dynasty over the entire kingdom.\nThe family survived the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, but were not restored to the throne of the kingdom until after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom was renamed &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The Wrynns had minimal ties to other houses, though their friendship with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Menethil\"&gt;House of Menethil&lt;/a&gt; (the ruling house of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;) prior to its destruction at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; is well-documented. The House of Wrynn remains in control of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; (who was acting king after his father's disappearance) ruled through co-regents for a time.\nBarathen \"Adamant\" Wrynn died during the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Tiffin was killed by a rock thrown at her head in a riot by the Stormwind-based &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; (which would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;). When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Varian led the assault at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Varian was killed during the battle and his son Anduin became the new ruler of Stormwind."}

Their numbers have grown incrementally since then. Preferring neutrality, this group of techno mages built a small fortress in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, just south of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, making it equal access for all races who wish to learn. They call this fortress, and, by extension, their organization, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Arcane%20Contraption\"&gt;House of the Arcane Contraption&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause most techno mages are neutral, or so interested in meeting those of like minds, they welcome any &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; into their ranks. Techno mages of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; affiliation are not required to cast off their affiliations, but there is a strict code of truce in the House of the Arcane Contraption. Any racial \u2014 or other \u2014 issues are settled in a small arena in the courtyard, where the techno mages battle using their magical inventions. Some battles can be fierce and bloody, the techno mages actually going for the kill with invented weapons, but others are less heated, usually having the inventions battle each other.\nThe House of the Arcane Contraption has remained impenetrable since its founders, the &lt;a href=\"Cabal%20of%205.3\"&gt;Cabal of 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, built it 13 years before the Third War. Even the demonic fury that destroyed much of Ashenvale did not touch it. The techno mages defended their fortress with such fury that even the demons left it alone. (Although others say the techno mages put such a strong glamer on the fortress that the demons couldn't see it, and were less concerned with that smell of arcane magic than the power of the World Tree.)\nInside, a large courtyard littered with broken springs, bits of wiring, and soot marks from fireball blasts on the stone walls usually contains at least two techno mages working on inventions considered too dangerous for the inside. The rooms inside are made of various materials, depending on what they are used for. The mages' rooms contain simple wooden walls and doors. The lower levels of the fortress, where most castles would have dungeons, are all workrooms. Although egos reign supreme in the house, the workrooms are public places. If a techno mage wishes to create in his own room, he can, but many prefer the wider areas of the workroom, not to mention the stone walls that are less likely to burst into flame.\nThe House of the Arcane Contraption is built on the side of a hill. The courtyard and front gate are opposite the hill, but through a door in the rear of the courtyard one can find the crypt. This is the final resting places for Those Who Discovered the Final Answer. Techno mages' bodies (or body parts, or ashes) are interred here, alongside plaques depicting the names of the deceased and their failed invention. If another techno mage had picked up the invention to perfect it, his name is inscribed under the plaque. If he failed, then his remains lie beside the first techno mage's."}

Filled with countless champions, this house is one of the last holdouts against the Jailer's insidious campaign.\nEvery House of Maldraxxus has two Barons. Initially, &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; served as the two barons, though the latter was later captured and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;; assumed dead. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, who came into the service of the House shortly after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. Mograine returned with the aid of the Maw Walker, though he did not resume his position. Instead; Vyraz proceeded to betray and slay Krexus alongside many of his loyal warriors. After this, Vyraz assumed the mantle of Margrave. Mograine and Draka proceeded to turn against Vyraz, leaving the two barons of the Chosen as empty positions.\nDespite this, Draka still goes by the title of Baroness, perhaps in defiance of Vyraz's usurpation of Krexus' mantle. Alexandros also claims he acts in the name of the House of the Chosen when confronting &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;, though the House is later acknowledged to still be firmly in Vyraz's grasp.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; under control of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was helping the Chosen under Vyraz. These Chosen eventually moved a bulk of their forces to &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;; where Vyraz worked closely under the eye of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking retribution, Draka, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker and the Primus confronted the treasonous margrave and his sea-witch ally at the pinnacle of this area. Despite being empowered by Helya, Vyraz was defeated and Helya was banished by the Primus, restoring the House of the Chosen and avenging Krexus. With the Chosen back under their rightful liege, the Primus promoted Draka to serve as the new Margrave of the Chosen.\nA challenge the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; established for the House, usually reserved for the most renowned of soldiers, was to attempt to cross the lake of magma to reach the runed stone at the center of their citadel.\nDescription.\n\"The House of the Chosen is equal parts peerless and fearless. The fiercest fighters from the mortal realm are sent to Maldraxxus, where they become even greater in death than they were in life.\""}

It involves the new &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; mechanics introduced in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nObjectives.\nYou are to use Hodir's Spear to challenge a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Wyrm\"&gt;Wild Wyrm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Ancient%20Winters\"&gt;Valley of Ancient Winters&lt;/a&gt;. Once in its grip, you are to fight to the death.\nDescription.\nHodir's Spear is an icon of great prowess in battle.\nIts mere presence instills a deep hunger for glory in all who enter &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Niffelem\"&gt;Dun Niffelem&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, simply being near it has compelled you to test your own abilities.\nScanning the horizon, your vision locks on a wild wyrm as it flies nearby.\nIt is decided. Of you and he, only one shall see the next sunrise...\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nCompletion.\nIt is done.\nYou have stared certain death in the face and emerged victorious.\nBy single-handedly defeating such a mighty beast, you have brought great honor to Dun Niffelem!\nNotes.\nAll damage done to you is based on a percentage of your total hit points. The size of your health bar does not matter, but you need to be at full health. \nYou need to locate an elite wyrm flying above the path west of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Niffelem\"&gt;Dun Niffelem&lt;/a&gt;, and use the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Spear of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; while under it to pull it down. You will then grab onto its chest and hang on for dear life, while the wyrm tries to knock you off with its claws.\nWhile on the wyrm, you get a buff on yourself which represents your grip on the wyrm, Wild Wyrm's Grip. It will start at 60, and can go up to 100. If it reaches zero, you will let go and plummet to your death (unless you have slow fall available -- &lt;a href=\"Snowfall%20Lager\"&gt;Snowfall Lager&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased from vendors for 2x &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20Ulduar\"&gt;Relic of Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe wyrm itself will have 100,000 HP.\nPhase 1.\nOn phase 1, you're given four spells on your vehicle bar:\nNote: Before you enter the vehicle, after the spear is thrust, you have a small window to cast heal over time effects on yourself, or shielding effects. These won't last through most of your flight, but it will help reduce the damage you take by a good 1000 HP or more. Most heal over time effects and heal on damage effects do not work, but shielding effects and a small amount of heal over time effects do.\nNote: You must get the wyrm down to 20% health before you pass over Dun Niffelem or your grip will plummet quickly and you'll fall.\nPhase 2.\nOn phase 2, you're given two spells on your vehicle bar:\nStrategy.\nFirst of all, while learning this it is good to take off all clothing. This will not affect your survivability, but may save you a large repair bill. This quest is frustrating to learn, but fun once you get the hang of it.\nOne way to do phase 1, is to spam Grab On and Thrust Spear one after another, until you get an emote stating the wyrm gets ready to use its claws () and then hit Dodge Claws () and Mighty Spear Thrust. Replenish grip quickly with Grip On and continue until you get to phase 2.\nAnother way is to use a rotation, which may or may not work better. Depending on the person/class (class matters, as some classes have spells that reduce damage):\nOn phase 2, the wyrm will grab you up into its mouth, giving you the debuff Jaws of Death, that will kill you slowly for 3% of your max health every second. Use Pry Jaws Open as many times as you can before dying and finish off with Fatal Strike, hopefully not having taken too many hits from its claws on phase 1. You must have at least one stack of Pry Jaws before you can attempt to deliver a Fatal Strike, and 10 is the recommended amount. You may miss on your first Fatal Strike (), so watch your health, pry jaws open 2 or 3 more times, and strike again as soon as its cooldown is up. 20 stacks guarantees that Fatal Strike will work. \nAs long as the wyrm dies before you do, you will receive credit for the quest. This phase is quick, and more about luck than anything else.\nOther Fun Ways to Die.\nThere are two other factors that can still kill you if you don't have slow fall:"}

{"id": "27319", "revid": "4133", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27319", "title": "How the user interface is rendered", "text": "Page Composition.\nWell, an understanding of how the UI is rendered would help:\nThere are several strata that a frame goes into, e.g. background, normal, dialog, tooltip. A strata simply means that all frames in one strata will be rendered above frames in a lower strata, and below frames in a higher strata.\n The actual strata, according to UI.xsd are: PARENT,BACKGROUND,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,DIALOG,FULLSCREEEN,FULLSCREEN_DIALOG,TOOLTIP\n Note that PARENT is a 'compile time' only strata, and doesn't exist at runtime, use GetFrameStrata at runtime.\nWithin a strata, each frame has a frame level, which determines the order in which it is rendered. The optimal layout is to have all frames in the same strata at the same frame level, since they can be batched and rendered at the same time. When a \"toplevel\" frame is clicked on, it is raised above other frames in the strata.\nWithin a frame, there are several draw layers, e.g. background, artwork, overlay, which can contain textures and fontstrings. Within a single draw layer, textures are rendered first, and then fontstrings are rendered afterwards, so text always shows above textures within a single draw layer. Other than that, there is no defined render order, so if you have two overlapping textures in the same draw layer, you never know which will overlap the other.\n As of 1.9, the available levels are: BACKGROUND, BORDER, ARTWORK, OVERLAY, HIGHLIGHT\nOnly frames can get mouse events, and then only if they have mouse event handlers or are frame types which are clickable (buttons). The mouse focus goes to the frame which is registered for mouse events with the highest strata and the highest frame level under the cursor.\nI hope that helps!\nEvent/Update Ordering.\nEach time the screen is re-rendered (i.e. each Frame, in the FPS sense), the process runs as follows:\nThe most important part of this is that OnUpdates happen right before painting the UI, so you can defer making rendering decisions until then without any visible impact."}

{"id": "166368", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=166368", "title": "How to Paladin", "text": "How to Paladin is a series of &lt;a href=\"machinima\"&gt;machinima&lt;/a&gt; movies featuring Shepiwot; a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; and is supposedly meant to be teaching viewers how to play this particular class in World of Warcraft, taking approximately five minutes for every piece of cinema. Created by a 23-year-old Dutch player nicknamed \u201cStoker\u201d, the series has garnered much praise and disapproval for being \u2018silly\u2019. The footage is usually played at many times the gaming speed, and background music from the anime is used as a soundtrack (the most frequently used piece is from a track titled 'Escape' on BGM Music Disc Two). Each video shows Shepiwot jumping, buffing, healing, dancing and killing mobs for no apparent reason. The series as a whole shows different aspects of the game; we can see Shepiwot &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;leveling up&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;\u2019ing running &lt;a href=\"instances\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing after he had managed to reach level 70. Everything is filmed with the camera often changing focus and position (several times within three seconds is not unusual). Clips used in the movies usually do not last longer than four seconds. The sum of this knowledge has led many viewers to refer to \u2018How to Paladin\u2019 as stupid and unnecessary.\nNevertheless, the overall response seems positive since &lt;a href=\"WarcraftMovies.com\"&gt;WarcraftMovies.com&lt;/a&gt; statistics indicate the average rating for all the installments up to \u2018How to Paladin XXII\u2019 is 3.29 out of 5 . In addition, each individual part has attracted over 2500 downloads, with part XV even having over 50000. YouTube also shows that all parts have a rating of at least 4 out of 5 .\nStoker has also tried to bend the negative responses in his own benefit by making a laugh out of them. Every episode after the first part starts with screenshots of negative comments on previous installments on WarcraftMovies.com accompanied by ironic and poorly spelled remarks such as \u201cAfter the great success of\u2026\u201d. As of October 2, 2009, there are 35 episodes, with 10 specials, such as \"How To Paladin: Insanity Remix\" and \"How To Paladin: Comments on Comments\"."}

{"id": "174580", "revid": "41588387", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=174580", "title": "How to save the noob in your party", "text": "In almost every instance in wow, you'll have at least one noob with you who constantly gets aggro from the mobs. This noob has usually rolled a noobish class like &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; or - Light help you - &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, and he probably thinks he's some kind of \u201ctank\u201d or something.\nObviously, you must save this noob from the dangerous mobs in the instance. This guide explains how to prevent him from being hit by the mobs, so the party can successfully complete the instance.\nPart 1 \u2013 The pull.\nThe noob will regularly be the first to aggro a group of mobs, often by using a ranged ability. Such behaviour can not be allowed, and should be stopped.\nThe best way to stop it is to nip it in the bud. That's why you should always try to attack mobs before the noob does. Hit them with everything you've got before he gets the chance to attack. Using abilities like multi-shot, which hit multiple mobs, will make it virtually impossible for him to get aggro on all of the mobs, and your party will be safe.\nShould the noob get in an attack before you do, don't worry. Abilities like fireball, charge and cheap shot can still save the day. Just be sure to hit the mobs that are running towards the noob before they reach him, and pull them as far away from him as possible. You get extra points for breaking a dangerous group of hard-hitting mobs into pieces, spreading them out across the area so the noob can not possibly reach them all.\nSometimes, the noob will try to pull a caster mob. Realizing he cannot possibly win a fight against a caster mob, he will move back around a corner, out of the line of sight of the caster mob. What the noob probably doesn't know is that the caster mob will just run after him, around the corner, and start attacking him again. To prevent this from happening, you should immediately lay the smack down on the caster mob with your ranged abilities. That way, the caster mob will target you instead and stay in place, far from the noob.\nPart 2 \u2013 The fight.\nSometimes, the noob will manage to get aggro on a whole bunch of mobs, who will all start hitting him. Don't worry, not all is lost just yet. You can still save the noob. The most important thing is that you start doing as much damage as you can immediately \u2013 don't give the noob a chance to foolishly build threat on all mobs. As soon as the fight starts, use your highest-damage abilities. If the noob misses his first attack or two, chances are that you can still manage to pull aggro away from him.\nIt is also important that you target a different mob than the one the noob is targeting, since that one will be the hardest to pull aggro on. Use /assist to see the noob's target, then pick a different one yourself. If the group you are in is using marks, never, ever, attack the mob marked with a skull. Usually, the mob you will have to attack is marked with a moon or a blue square instead.\nWhen you successfully manage to get aggro off the noob, make sure to run away from him as quickly as possible. Put some serious distance between him and you, so he doesn't unintentionally use a taunt ability on your mob. After all, it's your mob, not his.\nIn instances where mobs run away when they get low health, make sure that your party burns down the health of several mobs at once. That way, it will be nearly impossible to stop them all for the noob and the others in your party, so as they run away they will aggro more mobs, which means you will finish the instance quicker.\nIf you are in a team with a warrior or druid noob, keep an eye on the red bar below next to his name. The more he hits and gets hit, the fuller this bar gets. Your goal is to keep this bar as empty as possible. The emptier the bar is, the less threat the noob can generate, and the mobs will move to more appropriate targets like you and the healer instead.\nIf the noob is a paladin, he will have a blue bar instead. This bar will be full at the start of fights, and grow empty as the noob does foolish things. If the noob gets healed, though, it will get a bit fuller again. That's why you should make sure you are the one taking damage instead of the noob. That way, his blue bar will go empty really quickly, and he will not be able to do any more foolish things.\nIf the noob is a death knight, he will have a light blue bar. This bar bounces up and down from empty to full and back again, and there seems to be little correlation between the bar and the noob's threat level. This unpredictability makes protecting a death knight a real challenge. Let's hope you're up to it.\nPart 3 \u2013 Party etiquette.\nTeaming with a noob can be a frustrating experience. These noobs not only steal your aggro, they also steal the heals that you need to stay alive and do your imba dps. So, the moment you get hit, you should start reminding the healer that you need heals. Spamming \u201cHEAL ME!!!\u201d in party chat is a good way to do this. Even better is spamming it in raid warning. That way, it will appear right in the middle of everyone's screen, and the healer will have no choice but to heal you instead of the noob. \nLikewise, if you are so unfortunate to die, it is a good idea to spam \"REZ ME!!!\", \"REZ PLX\" or simply \"RES\" until someone resurrects you. This is important because, if you died, the noob probably died too (as there was no one to save him) and so he will surely run and ruin everything again if he is resurrected before you are. There is always a chance that the entire group died, which means there is no one to resurrect you, but it'd still be wise to spam \"RES\" so the healer knows who to resurrect first when he/she returns after corpse-running back to the instance. Also notice that you must never release your corpse when you are dead, instead of waiting for someone else to come and resurrect you. This is because your corpse acts as a arrow on the minimap, which will help the rest of the group to return to the same place in the instance before the group died and not get lost while trying to find this. Spamming \"REZ ME!!!\" during this time often also acts as motivation to the group, as it shows you are still online and willing to continue the instance even after dying. \nIt is also important to keep the noob in his proper place. The best way to do that is to repeatedly ask if anyone has damage meter installed, and ask to have it posted after every fight. Make sure to laugh at the noob and the healer if they're below you in damage, and call them noobs. This will force them to respect your leet skillz. This is also very motivational as it encourages players to improve their skills, even though they would never match yours. \nIn some groups, the noob will ask if you have KTM or Omen installed. If the noob does that, be sure to insult him, and tell him that only noobs need addons. If he questions you, ask another party member to post the damage meter stats, and point out how much better you are.\nOf course, the real reason you're doing instances in the first place is phat lewt. To make sure that you get the phattest lewt, make sure to loot mobs as quickly as possible, especially when you're still in combat. That way, any greens, blues and purples will pop up on everyone's screen while they're still fighting, which will obscure their vision of the fight but increase their morale. \nAlso, make sure to roll need on everything you can possibly use, even if it doesn't fit your class or spec or you already have better gear. You deserve it \u2013 you saved the party from the noob, so you should get first pick of any drops. It's only logical. If the noob is being difficult and begins criticizing you or even demands some of the loot, either be honest and tell him he is a noob who should be thankful you saved him or end the argue with a simple explanation such as you needing the lewt for your off-specc or money.\nFinally, and most important of all, always leave during the middle of an instance. This will make it clear to the rest of the group just how important you are. It signalizes that you are a very powerful and skilled player which many other players need to help them, and therefore rarely have the time to complete a instance. Be sure to explain this fact to the group by saying \"sry gtg friends need me\" or \"guild calling\". Stating this, the group will notice how skilled you are, and will for sure invite you to groups later. For added effect, pull some mobs right before you leave the group, to show that you would still want to continue the instance unless you had to leave. The others will be in awe of your greatness.\n=External links="}

The Aldor are an ancient draenei priesthood working with the Sha'tar to battle the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.

While both factions strive for a common goal, they find themselves at odds with each other for control of the city, and the naaru's favor.\nHistory.\nShattrath was founded by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; after their arrival on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, 195 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. They chose the former location of the great &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s two centuries before. The site was protected by mountains, had access to the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and no other races had settled there after the violent fall of Goria. The city's name, Shattrath, means \"Dwelling of Light\" in the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;draenei language&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe draenei &lt;a href=\"artificer\"&gt;artificer&lt;/a&gt;s erected sleek buildings, crystals and roadways, creating the new locus and capital of the draenei civilization on the planet. Huge and thick walls, as well as towers and citadels protected it from the outside. The city was the pinnacle of draenei culture and religion.\n100 years before the Dark Portal, the ogre &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Hok%27lon\"&gt;Imperator Hok'lon&lt;/a&gt; led a force to Shattrath to reclaim the ruins of Goria. Although the ogre vastly outnumbered the draenei, the city's defenses held with ease. When an elite force of draenei warriors including &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; assassinated the ogre imperator and his generals, the ogre army broke and went home. The ogre would never try a frontal attack on the draenei again.\nSiege of Shattrath.\nAfter the war with the orcish &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; broke out, the draenei fortified Shattrath. In time, the draenei leadership decided to abandon all outlying settlements, and pull back to Shattrath and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, making the defense of these two settlements the primary goal.\nAfter the fall of Karabor, the draenei considered evacuating Shattrath. However, acting on the advice of &lt;a href=\"exarch\"&gt;exarch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Larohir\"&gt;Larohir&lt;/a&gt;, they finally decided to make a stand in the city, hoping to convince the orcs that they had broken the draenei. Many draenei civilians fled to the safety of locations like the temple of &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of the draenei military, along with many civilians, would stay behind in Shattrath as a sacrifice. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; blessed all of those that stayed behind individually, before leaving the city himself.\nIn grim irony, the Horde used the stolen &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal shard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3ALeafshadow\"&gt;:Leafshadow&lt;/a&gt; to conceal their advance toward the draenei capital city. They used &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Siege%20weapon\"&gt;war machines&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;red mist&lt;/a&gt; in their attack against Shattrath, bombing its walls with a plague that would burn and choke the draenei defenders. Thousands of draenei stood firm on the walls of Shattrath, however after fierce fighting they could not hold against the overwhelming orcish attack. As Shattrath fell, blood ran through its streets, temples and courtyards. The Horde spared none, razing the city. It would be left in ruins and darkness for years.\nDuring the fighting, several groups of refugees managed to escape the city, led by &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of these groups succeeded in escaping, but many didn't. Vindicator Maraad led the last such group, but failed to protect them and they were slaughtered. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Guard%20Porung\"&gt;Blood Guard Porung&lt;/a&gt; stormed an enclave of draenei paladins who had barricaded themselves within a corner of the city and single-handedly slaughtered the defenders.\nThe survivors of the siege eventually mostly trickled into Telredor. Many of the survivors were struck with the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;, and turned into &lt;a href=\"Krokul\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Broken\", physically deformed and shunned by the other draenei. The Broken included the vindicators Akama and Nobundo. Some of the surviving vindicators, priests and &lt;a href=\"rangari\"&gt;rangari&lt;/a&gt; retreated to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually died there when the orcish &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s caused its destruction.\nAftermath.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, a small order of surviving draenei priests, moved into the ruins of a temple within Shattrath, and continued their worship of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving at Outland, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; chose Shattrath City as its base of operation, being attracted by the rituals conducted there. He was welcomed by the Aldor, who pledged themselves to do its bidding. A'dal drove away the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and created a safe haven here. He held court at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon, other people started arriving in Shattrath, drawn by A'dal's power. Among them were &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and his followers, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and members of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Since the city was one of the few safe places of Outland, refugees also arrived here in great number, mostly dwelling within the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;. Under A'dal's leadership, these people would unite to rebuild Shattrath as a beacon of hope. The naaru also started recruiting an army to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; saw a danger in the rebuilding of Shattrath, so he sent a force of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"magister\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal\"&gt;Voren'thal&lt;/a&gt;, to take the city. However, A'dal granted the magister a vision that convinced the blood elf army to put down their weapons, and pledge their loyalty to the naaru instead. They became the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and settled in their own &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; within Shattrath. The Aldor reacted to the arrival of the Scryers unhappily, as some of their ranks had been slain by the blood elves in earlier battles. The intense rivalry between the two factions did not abate, as they continued to vie for the favor of the naaru.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces reached Shattrath, bolstering its defenses against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The city became a staging ground for armies, as well as a place of trade between the peoples of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Outland. By this time, Khadgar had become an influential figure in the city, and tried to mend the rifts between the different factions.\nAlthough the attacks against the city continued, Shattrath did not fall. On the contrary, its forces, led by the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt;, moved on &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. They took part in the fight against Illidan, including the storming of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually another military order was created in the city, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. It included both Aldor and Scryers, and waged war against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Sunwell Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and Horde led by &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Lazaril\"&gt;Bishop Lazaril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; made camps here to work on weapons against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nikki%20the%20Gossip\"&gt;Nikki the Gossip&lt;/a&gt; described Shattrath as a dangerous place. &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the city in order to convince &lt;a href=\"Lonika%20Stillblade\"&gt;Lonika Stillblade&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Consortium%20Arcanist\"&gt;ethereal arcanists&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt; have been hired by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to maintain portals to Shattrath City within the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, respectively in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAreas.\nThe city is divided into four major sections on different levels, separated by lifts or stairs. \nThere are also several undisplayed locations:\nFinally, there are also &lt;a href=\"Lore%20location\"&gt;lore-only&lt;/a&gt; locations that don't appear in the game:\nFactions.\nBoth Horde and Alliance players start as Neutral (0/3000) with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, the faction of &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; which rule the city, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldor and the Scryers are at odds with each other. Doing quests for one faction will simultaneously raise your reputation with the questgiver's faction and lower your reputation with the opposing faction. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; gives you a quest (Allegiance to the X) that will give you a free 3500 rep with the faction of your choice (and -3850 faction with the opposing group) sending you to friendly with the faction you chose and hostile with the other. The Aldor have many Shadow Resistance patterns on sale for crafters while the Scryers have many Arcane Resistance patterns.\nBlood elves and draenei who complete this quest find themselves merely at Neutral status if they choose the opposite racial faction (blood elves choosing Aldor, for example). Furthermore, the opposite racial faction will be hostile by default (even if it is not listed on the reputation pane yet), so draenei players should not attempt to enter the Scryer's Tier unless they have already picked allegiance to that faction (and vice versa). \nQuests that give reputation with Aldor or Scryer also often give gain with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;. This gain does not show in the chat log, but can be confirmed in the reputation panel.\nAldor.\n&lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; gains with Aldor correspond with a 10% greater loss of reputation with Scryers. \nScryer.\nReputation gains with Scryer correspond with a 10% greater loss of reputation with Aldor. \nTravel connections.\nTeleport.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, there were 8 portals, one to each major Alliance and Horde city."}

The city was used as a staging ground to attack the Iron Horde's enemies in the region, as well as a dock and a point of congregation for Iron Horde troops. Blackhand's second-in-command, , was also stationed there. \nA combined force of heroes from Azeroth, draenei, and Frostwolves (including , , &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;) take part in the Battle for Shattrath, and assault the Iron Horde army from several points. Orgrim Doomhammer abandons the battle after witnessing the deaths of innocent draenei, though is immediately confronted and killed by Blackhand, who then does battle with Durotan, Maraad, and Yrel aboard his ship. Maraad is killed in the ensuing chaos, Yrel and Durotan work together to survive Blackhand's onslaught, and the pair escape with Khadgar's help. Though Shattrath was freed from the Iron Horde, Blackhand had also survived and fled the city.\nDraenei returned to Shattrath following its liberation, though the treacherous former exarch Socrethar later usurped the city with the aid of the Burning Legion and the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;.

He is aware that his colleague &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt; suspects the elemental &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; of treachery. The conflict between Baron Geddon and Garr suits Shazzrah well, for in fact it is Shazzrah who seeks to posses both halves of the &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Talisman of Elemental Binding&lt;/a&gt; so that he might find a way to siphon its energies for his own use. Ragnaros was very likely aware of his underling's penchant for duplicity when he split the talisman in half and entrusted the pieces to Baron Geddon and Garr.\nShazzrah is an &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt; that shares a spawn area with &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Mazj\"&gt;Rune of Mazj&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, when Shazzrah blinks he will leave behind an Image of Shazzrah that continuously casts Arcane Explosion for the rest of the encounter. He is also immune to taunts.\nStrategies.\nStrategy 1.\nShazzrah can be fought in any area that gives a nice 35 yard radius (either the room he patrols or back in Garr's room). The raid is divided into four groups that stand at max range around the main tank. The reason for this layout is to minimize the damage from Shazzrah's arcane explosions whenever he blinks. Each group should consist of several decursers (Mages and Druids) along with an offtank to bring Shazzrah back to the tanking spot. Shazzrah's Curse must be removed immediately by Mages and Druids, starting with the main tank as he's constantly being bombarded by Shazzrah's Arcane Explosion. Since the curse's range is only 35 yards, Druids can stand back 5 more yards and heal the main tanks while focusing on decursing their group without being affected by the curse. Mages can then focus on DPS and be the ones who worry about decursing the main tank. Detect Magic must be kept on him at all times so that his Deaden Magic can be removed ASAP. Only ranged DPS can attack Shazzrah early on. When he gets low enough (around 5-10%), melee DPS can move in to help speed things up.\nStrategy 2: A Ranged Fight.\nThe benefits of this method is the ability to apply Mage DPS and mana saved by only one person needing decursing. Position your raid around the lip of Garr's room in a horseshoe with the open end facing the tunnel which leads to the Lava Packs. Shazzrah can be pulled into this room and a Warrior can easily establish initial aggro. After Shazzrah is in position, the raid may wish to spread out in a complete circle, closing the horseshoe. Everyone uses whatever method of ranged damage they have. When he blinks, the targeted player should run towards the Main Tank who will also move to Shazzrah and pull him back into the center. Shaman and priests need to make sure Shazzrah does not have the Deaden Magic buff on him, so it is imperative that mages keep their \"Detect Magic\" debuff up at all times. When Shazzrah is below 10% of health remaining, all warriors should run in, execute and run back out.\nStrategy 3: Paladin Tank.\nWith the new addition of a 40 yard taunt for paladin tanks this fight can be made much easier. First your guild has to have trusted a paladin tank well enough to train them, gear them, and support them in running endgame. Don't think simply having the ranged taunt makes a paladin viable for this position. After that station your raid in a large circle around the tankadin spaced as far apart as possible. Every time he blinks the paladin tank has to run about 5 feet to taunt Shazzrah back to him. Make sure DPS does not start until aggro is firmly back on the paladin. Do not start DPS as soon as the taunt takes place as Paladin taunt only last three seconds and that is NOT enough time for Shazzrah to make it completely back to the middle of the circle. Once he is back in the center and has begun to swing at the paladin with his staff DPS can resume. Healers should be stationed throughout the circle to heal up the people near the blink point. Selecting them manually from their toons can actually work fine since people are spaced out so far. If done right only 2-3 players in the outer circle should be hit by his AE and even then should only be hit once or twice before the taunt pulls Shazzrah back to the center. No taunts of any kind other than the paladins should be used otherwise he will stay at the outer circle and kill most of your raid until the paladin tank can take him back. If used successfully it makes for a much cleaner fight and simplifies the process by a considerable degree.\nReward.\nShazzrah's death rewards 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; up to 20,999/21,000 Revered.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They primarily operate near the &lt;a href=\"Clutches%20of%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Clutches of Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, gathering their forces in hopes of overrunning the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperations.\nIf any word were to describe the Shek'zeer swarm, it would be lazy. Their local &lt;a href=\"Vess-Guard%20Na%27kal\"&gt;Vess-Guard's&lt;/a&gt; strength is derived from genetic augmentations, rather skill or experience. Their &lt;a href=\"Shek%27zeer%20Manipulator\"&gt;manipulator&lt;/a&gt;s do not form actual bonds with their &lt;a href=\"kunchong\"&gt;kunchong&lt;/a&gt;, but rather imprison them, before binding them with sonic whispers. Perhaps most damningly of all, their &lt;a href=\"Shek%27zeer%20Swarmborn\"&gt;swarmlings&lt;/a&gt; are rapidly matured and saturated with &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; energy via &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Amber%20Shards\"&gt;Dread Amber Shards&lt;/a&gt; that are shaped into foci, rather than maturing properly. These newly hatched swarmborn are unfit for the swarm, driven not by the instinct to kill or feed, but rather by the terror that has been imbued in them. As one might imagine, the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; are outraged by these \"shortcuts.\"\nEven so, however, the Shek'zeer mantid are still a threat. Their &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blade\"&gt;Amber Blade&lt;/a&gt;s, which they carry with pride, are some of the finest in the empire; and their &lt;a href=\"Shek%27zeer%20Needler\"&gt;fliers&lt;/a&gt; have exceptional agility and endurance, though it is unknown if this is due to training or more genetic modifications. As a defensive measure, they hid pheromone mines around the entrance to the imperial palace, foreseeing the potential of an invading army. They have an unrivaled knowledge of distilling &lt;a href=\"kypari\"&gt;kypari&lt;/a&gt; sap, which they use to make a delicious, nutrient-filled elixir. Furthermore, they were seemingly able to disable one of the Klaxxi's sonic relays, near the palace. Their greatest achievement, had they succeeded, however, would have been the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Malik%20the%20Unscathed\"&gt;Malik the Unscathed&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt; of the Klaxxi. Thankfully, the &lt;a href=\"wakener\"&gt;wakener&lt;/a&gt; intervened before this could occur."}

For a variety of political or personal reasons, certain members of the nobility opted to live outside the capital city. Moreover, not all night elves (or other races of Kalimdor) joined the main force of night elf defenders. Such holdouts were not necessarily resistant to the idea of joining their compatriots. Indeed, it seems likelier that these small pockets of resistance had heard nothing of the primary defending force and were unaware of the demonic invasion's massive scope. The Shen'dralar were one of these holdout groups.\nThe Shen'dralar were &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s most revered &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s, charged with the storage and safekeeping of her most precious tomes. Within the walls of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; the Queen's most important demands were processed - often in secret. Led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt;, the Shen'dralar dutifully obeyed their queen. They journeyed into the misty heart of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s southern jungles and established a grand city called &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shen'dralar defended their city as best they could during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. As legend has it, it is said that the Ancient &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; came to their aid to help them defend their city against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Great Sundering later decimated the world, Eldre'Thalas narrowly escaped destruction. Only the efforts of Tortheldrin and his followers spared the city. Together, they wove a great spell to shield Eldre'Thalas from the destructive forces of the Sundering. Although they had saved their city, then Shen'dralar soon discovered that the Well of Eternity had been consumed in the Sundering. Without the fount of power to draw on, Tortheldrin and his followers saw their immortality greatly diminished. The Shen'dralar soon fell into a deep lethargy and languished in their isolated sanctuary.\nTortheldrin eventually formulated a plan to revitalize the Shen'dralar. He forged pylons in the halls of the west wing of Eldre'Thalas, constructing a prison to house a new source of power behind a grand force field: a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;. To the shock of the other Shen'dralar, Tortheldrin had covertly summoned and bound the terrifying creature to siphon the demon's power and give it to his followers. Any objections were quickly settled once the other Shen'dralar experienced the demon's energy for themselves. Though dark and volatile, Immol'thar's power was invigorating and addictive, more so than the Well of Eternity had been. The siphoned energies would sustain the Highborne's magic, allowing those within the walls of Eldre'Thalas to feed their endless and growing magical pangs. Had the demon broken free of its bonds, it would have destroyed what little was left of Eldre'Thalas. This happened around the time the Highborne led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; were exiled, 7,300 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the ensuing years, the Shen'dralar continued to be isolated from the rest of night elf society, and so their subsequent dangerous actions went unnoticed by their distant kindred. They were never exiled from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, nor have any Shen'dralar become &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years passed and the power required to keep Immol'thar imprisoned while sustaining life within Eldre'Thalas began to shift. The cost to keep Immol'thar bound grew to overshadow the rate at which energy could be siphoned and distributed. The once net gain turned to loss. Almost overnight, Tortheldrin's seemingly ingenious plan unraveled, and his access to the demon's magic was gone. Not only had the Shen'dralar lost their immortality once again, but they had also grown hopelessly addicted to Immol'thar's potent energies. Desperate to regain his power, Tortheldrin and his Shen'dralar loyalists began murdering their fellow Highborne. At least one Highborne, named &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Tordin\"&gt;Azj'Tordin&lt;/a&gt;, has escaped death at the hands of Prince Tortheldrin, but most have not been so lucky. Their spirits now wander the corridors and courtyards of Dire Maul.\nTortheldrin's treacherous plan worked. Having thinned the population, the remaining elves could draw on Immol'thar's power indefinitely. Unsurprisingly, Prince Tortheldrin guards jealously the secret of this arrangement, and those who meddle in his domain, such as the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Telmius%20Dreamseeker\"&gt;Telmius Dreamseeker&lt;/a&gt;, can expect a brutal end.\nWith the Shen'dralar's numbers diminished, Tortheldrin and his followers abandoned much of their once-glorious city. The greater part of Eldre'Thalas fell into darkness and despair. Soon, other creatures from the surrounding jungles moved in to stake their claim to the crumbling elven refuge.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Shen'dralar are knowledgeable about a great many secrets and did, tantalizingly, know where the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; could be found before it appeared in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Year 25, the majority of elves, including the prince, was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; when they raided Dire Maul. The surviving ones fled the ruined city and wandered in the woods for years, trying to wean themselves off demonic power and feel whole again.\nThe return of the Highborne.\nThe Shen'dralar Highborne first resurfaced around the time of the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Daros%20Moonlance\"&gt;Daros Moonlance&lt;/a&gt; coming to the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; arriving to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in order to seek an audience with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe Highborne Shen'dralar &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s from Dire Maul eventually settled in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Many night elves were wary of their guests as they dredged up painful memories from the past. The Highborne in particular were treated with suspicion and even open hostility. They began training new night elf mages. Because their expulsion from night elf society after the War of the Ancients was due to their use of arcane magic, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were outraged to hear that the kaldorei had welcomed the Highborne back and were tolerating the practice of arcane magic again. After witnessing the \"rookie\" mistakes made by the new kaldorei magi, however, the blood elves are anxiously awaiting whatever mess the kaldorei are going to put themselves in. What's more, some sin'dorei have been able to exploit the kaldorei's inexperience in order to rout Alliance forces, as seen in the \"&lt;a href=\"Amberwind%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Amberwind's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" quest series in Azshara.\nOver the next few years, Mordent Evenshade and his Highborne followers continued to serve the Darnassian night elves and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with Mordent and some of the other Highborne surviving an assassination attempt in Darnassus at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, who resented and rejected their sudden return to night elf society.\nFourth War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the Shen'dralar destroyed several bridges and siege engines to slow down the Horde. And to their surprise, their arrival to the battlefield was met with cheers from the other night elves, as the Shen'dralar until this moment had only cautiously been made welcome in Darnassus.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, after which the surviving Shen'dralar lost a second home to the Horde, Mordent Evenshade encountered Horde forces in &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, and later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his journey to collect information and find a way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; expressed his admiration for the Highborne library. Despite being abandoned and damaged, the black dragon mentioned that there was still some knowledge to be gleaned from the tomes they were forced to leave behind as they escaped the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s aggression. Nevertheless, some of their librams appear to have survived the devastation, as by the time of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Mykos\"&gt;Lorekeeper Mykos&lt;/a&gt; made a donation to the archives of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; by removing the Athenaeum seal of the book &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20and%20How%20to%20Swing%20It\"&gt;The Light and How to Swing It&lt;/a&gt;, so that all &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; can read it.\nAfter the war, the only trace of the Highborne in Dire Maul is in the form of wailing &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs a faction.\nThe Shen'dalar faction became unobtainable in , so that &lt;a href=\"Insane%20in%20the%20Membrane\"&gt;Insane in the Membrane&lt;/a&gt; no longer requires &lt;a href=\"exalted\"&gt;exalted&lt;/a&gt; with them anymore and a new Feat of Strength - &lt;a href=\"Agent%20of%20the%20Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Agent of the Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; has been given to those who gained exalted with the faction before &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nPrior to the faction's removal in \"Cataclysm\", players automatically became with the Shen'dralar upon first meeting them. From there, it was possible to gain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the Shen'dralar by turning in &lt;a href=\"libram%20%28item%29\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s and class books, such as the &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Codex of Defense&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href=\"rogues\"&gt;rogues&lt;/a&gt;. Each libram and class book turned in nets +500 reputation points. Further, turning in librams rewarded characters with an &lt;a href=\"augment\"&gt;augment&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; piece. While librams could be turned in repeatedly, class books could only be turned in once.\nCompleting &lt;a href=\"Pusillin%20and%20the%20Elder%20Azj%27Tordin\"&gt;Pusillin and the Elder Azj'Tordin&lt;/a&gt; would award you 500 reputation.\nIn patch 3.1.0, a new &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; was added, which when exalted with the four &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; cities, honored with &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, and exalted with &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;, and Shen'dralar will give the player the title \"\"&lt;name&gt; &lt;a href=\"the%20Insane\"&gt;the Insane&lt;/a&gt;\"\". Shen'dralar has since been removed as a requirement for this feat."}

To satisfy that wanderlust, to explore the world he knew waited beyond Pandaria's shores, Liu Lang wanted to have a way to leave Pandaria and yet be able to come back through the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; that hid the small continent. He came to realize that sea turtles always return to the beach where they were born, and thus he would always have a way back home.\nWanderlust.\nAt this point, the sea turtle had no name. When Liu Lang bought his travel supplies at &lt;a href=\"Halfhill\"&gt;Halfhill&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shen-Zin\"&gt;Shen-Zin&lt;/a&gt;, owner of &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%27s%20Sundries\"&gt;Shen-zin's Sundries&lt;/a&gt;, Shen-Zin humored his announcement that he was going to explore the world by suggesting that he should take a bamboo umbrella and offered one, on the house. A grateful Liu Lang happily told the supplier that he would name his sea turtle after him.\nLiu Lang would spend the rest of his life traveling with Shen-zin Su, making return trips to his homeland every five years, each time bringing with him stories of the wondrous things he'd seen. The turtle would prove time and again to have grown even larger from the last visit, eventually growing to the size of a giant island, large enough to support an entire colony and several villages.\nOn Liu Lang's final voyage from Pandaria, he fell into a deep sleep and died, his spirit merging with the sea turtle. Shen-zin Su stopped returning to Pandaria, despite being able to do so if he wished. In fact, he avoids the mist where the island continent is located. While only Shen-zin Su truly knows the reason why, the pandaren of Pandaria presumed that Shen-zin Su stopped doing so shortly after the death of his beloved friend, Liu Lang.\nThe descendants of Liu Lang's followers, whom Shen-zin Su would dub the \"grandchildren\" of Liu Lang, still travel on the great turtle's shell to see the world. The turtle has continued to grow since Liu Lang's time to a truly massive size, supporting several villages, forest, and small mountain ranges. The settlers would appropriately call the sea turtle's shell \"the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Shen-zin Su out at sea was hit with horrible waves, but it seems he was able to compensate for them and the pandaren were not unduly affected.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the great turtle was dragged by the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Skyseeker\"&gt;crashed into it&lt;/a&gt;, causing the great turtle to no longer swim straight. Realizing that the source of Shen-zin Su's pain is \"The Skyseeker\" a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;young pandaren adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Shang%20Xi\"&gt;Master Shang Xi&lt;/a&gt;'s disciples head into the forbidden &lt;a href=\"Pei-Wu%20Forest\"&gt;Pei-Wu Forest&lt;/a&gt;. There, the party helps triage members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fend off new horrors from the depths. Immediate threat taken care of, &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; decides to blow up what's left of the Skyseeker. Shockingly, this plan actually works, to a point. &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; glares at Ji and walks away, leaving him looking sad but resolute, as Shen-zin Su lets out a groan of agony. Shen-zin Su now has a river of blood pouring into the sea and it's up to healers of both the Alliance and Horde to stitch him up, but not without what's left of the invading forces harassing the healers.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt; on Pandaria was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Keletress\"&gt;Lady Keletress&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving monks traveled to Shen-zin Su, who happened to be close by. Later during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Keletress launched her last assault against the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, with her demonic army invading the back of the great turtle. However, with the power of the Storm Brew, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Grandmaster of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; managed to slay her and the demons were driven away by the monks.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; began, spurring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Shen-zin Su was swimming towards the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, as the pandaren living on his back heard that it's relatively safe to explore now."}

A shield may also be referred to as an aegis or buckler.\nA shield contributes to the &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; and can prevent damage by &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;ing attacks. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are the only classes that may use shields. A shield cannot be used with &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s that require &lt;a href=\"Two-handed\"&gt;two hands&lt;/a&gt; to wield, as shields fill the &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; slot. However, Warriors with &lt;a href=\"Titan%27s%20Grip\"&gt;Titan's Grip&lt;/a&gt; may use a 2-hander and a shield. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s have several abilities can only be used when a shield is equipped, such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;.\nShields have far more armor than any other piece of equipment. A shield has roughly 60% as much armor as a full set of &lt;a href=\"plate%20armor\"&gt;plate armor&lt;/a&gt; of the same &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two broad types of shields: those with defensive statistics like &lt;a href=\"defense%20rating\"&gt;defense rating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dodge%20rating\"&gt;dodge rating&lt;/a&gt;, suitable for &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing warriors and paladins, and those with &lt;a href=\"spellpower\"&gt;spellpower&lt;/a&gt;, suitable for holy paladins and elemental and restoration shamans. \nShields have one major difference from other armor pieces; they can be equipped or removed during combat. All other armor pieces must remain equipped/unequipped until the Warrior/Paladin/Shaman is no longer in combat.\nBucklers.\nDuring the early beta days of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" there were two shield types: normal shields and bucklers, which were lighter and could be equipped by &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Patch%200.8\"&gt;Patch 0.8&lt;/a&gt; turned all bucklers into shields and gave shamans the ability to use shields but rogues and hunters could no longer use them."}

Consume Pricklevines and Lashers by rolling past them to fill up the quest's progress bar (Ridge Lashers grant 3% progress, while Cracked Pricklevines grant around 5%) and avoid the cacti and Big Mama, which knock the player backwards or throws them a significant distance, respectively. The static tornadoes around the ridge launch the ranishu in specific directions, some of which allow the ranishu to reach the outcroppings above the ridge. Should the player find their way to one of the higher outcroppings through use of the tornadoes and their Roll Dash and Shock Launch abilities, they can find the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lash\"&gt;Golden Lash&lt;/a&gt;, a lasher that instantly grants 50% quest progress all on its own when consumed.\nIf the player tries to leave the Carapace Ridge area before completing the quest objective, the ranishu will instantly be teleported back in. Upon completely filling the objective bar, the ranishu automatically travels back into the ranishu enclose next to Rozzy, ejects the player, and then despawns.\nTrivia.\nDuring the beta, this quest was named Ranishu Romp."}
