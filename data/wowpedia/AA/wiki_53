In &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;s, emotes make your character express emotion. \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", you can make your character \"emote\" by using predefined &lt;a href=\"slash%20command\"&gt;slash command&lt;/a&gt;s. These commands generate a chat message (typically in a special color) that describes what your character is doing. This chat message is often accompanied by audio and some character action.\nFor example, using the /thanks command, text displays (\"\"Character\" thanks \"target\".\"), an audio file is played (character voice: \"Thank you.\"), and a character animation occurs (character gesticulates).\nThere are 5 kinds of emotes in \"World of Warcraft\":\nMost emotes have no gameplay effect, but the /lie, /laydown, /sleep, and /sit commands cause the character to assume those positions, from which they must rise to enter combat. In addition, some emotes are involved in &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s or in triggering certain NPC reactions.\nCreating your own emotes.\nYou can create your own emotes using the /e or /me slash commands, which will send a message to nearby players starting with your name and ending with the action you type (or anything else you might type). For example, if your name is &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, then entering:\ncodice_1\nwill cause nearby players to see:\n Thrall scrabbles in the dirt.\nYou can use certain &lt;a href=\"Macro%20API%23substitution%20sequences\"&gt;substitution codes&lt;/a&gt; in your emotes. For instance, if your command contains %t, the %t will be replaced with the name of your currently selected &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; when the emote is sent. For instance, if Thrall is targeting a creature called Animal:\ncodice_2\nproduces:\nThrall scrabbles in the dirt, and finds Animal's shoe.\nCustom emotes will not be understandable by the opposing faction. The following will be the only thing the opposing faction will see:\nThrall makes some strange gestures.\nEmote/Action/Spell macros.\nYou can emote and cast spells or summons such as this macro for a warlock:\n /e prepares a dark ritual.\n /y Come to me, Felhorse!\n /cast summon felsteed\nWill appear as:"}

Each Keeper created a keystone imbued with their power, to ensure that the tomb would remain undisturbed.\nKorthek was regarded as \"Korthek the Brave\" and was renowned for his strength and strategic agility. Tales of him inspired young sethrak warriors and ignited the flames of battle in the bleakest of moments. He was able to single-handedly turn the tide, fought for his people with passion and ferocity, and was known as a beloved brother. In those days, Korthek and his fellow Keepers Vorrik and Sulthis led all sethrak in their worship of Sethraliss.\nHowever, as the sands continued to spread, Korthek tired of peace and grew hungry for war. Sulthis heard talk of Korthek being eager to attack the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, but did not understand why he would want to start a fight he could not win after the sethrak had lived in peace for so long. Korthek plotted to combine the three keystones to unearth Mythrax and use him as a weapon to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, he raised an army of like-minded sethrak who became known as the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, and they began to slaughter those who opposed them. Sulthis was the first to fall at Korthek's hands, but not before safeguarding his keystone. Vorrik and the other sethrak still loyal to Sethraliss became known as the &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; and were forced out of their home and into hiding, and have been fighting Korthek's Faithless ever since.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSince Korthek's betrayal, the Faithless have brought war upon &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;. Korthek leads them in their fight, searching for the remaining keys that will allow him to break the barrier around Atul'Aman and use Mythrax to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, Korthek has allied with &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, who also seeks to unleash Mythrax.\nKorthek is first seen in eastern Vol'dun conversing with Jakra'zet, who tells the emperor that they need to speed things up as &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; has received \"nosey visitors\" in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. When Jakra'zet notices a group of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; passing overhead, Korthek conjures lightning magic that blasts &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Jorana\"&gt;Bladeguard Jorana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt;'s mounts from the sky.\nEventually, Bladeguard Kaja, &lt;a href=\"Warguard%20Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; recover Keeper Sulthis' &lt;a href=\"Sulthis%27%20Keystone\"&gt;keystone&lt;/a&gt; from its resting place in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Vorrik at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik concludes that Korthek has grown not only spiteful and arrogant over the years, but also mad: Mythrax will kill them all should the creature be released. Vorrik has long held out hope of being able to peacefully convince Korthek to abandon his heresy, but resolves that all of Zandalar is at risk while Korthek and his allies hold even one key to Mythrax's prison and that he needs to confront the \"emperor\" personally. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;, Vorrik and his ally wreak havoc on the Faithless' fortress and ride &lt;a href=\"Rakjan%20the%20Unbroken\"&gt;Rakjan the Unbroken&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Skycallers%27%20Spire\"&gt;Skycallers' Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Korthek initially remains in hiding within the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;Temple of Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; until he finally emerges, allowing Vorrik, the adventurer, and the vulpera &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; to engage him in battle. However, during the fight, the emperor reveals that Jakra'zet already has Korthek's keystone and has likely retrieved Sulthis and &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Keystone\"&gt;Vorrik's stones&lt;/a&gt;, which were left unguarded at the Sanctuary of the Devoted. Eventually, Korthek is defeated and tells Vorrik that he never forced any of the sethrak to follow him and that their people are conquerors. Vorrik replies that \"Our people are dead, because of you\", then kills the emperor."}

He believed that the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; would return. Through the haze of his paranoia, he saw treachery behind every smile, a scheme behind every vow of devotion, and cunning traps in the calm prophecies of the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; waterspeakers. Later, he had a maze built beneath his palace, with a safe room at the center. The next time his fear gripped him, Ku fled for it, shut the door, and waited for the terror to subside. It never did. The maze had been so cleverly constructed that the emperor had forgotten the way out.\nSearch parties sometimes heard him calling, but years passed. Occasionally, an explorer went into the maze and ran out screaming, wild with terror, for Ku's time in the dark had twisted him into something appalling to behold. Soon, a cub named &lt;a href=\"Li%20Tao\"&gt;Li Tao&lt;/a&gt; chased his &lt;a href=\"bandicoon\"&gt;bandicoon&lt;/a&gt; kit into the maze. He soon realized he was being followed. Even though he was too frightened to look, little Li Tao still understood that here was someone even more frightened than he was. So he reached back and led the poor emperor out of the maze."}

His actions separated Pandaria from the rest of the world prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, due to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; using Shaohao's power and arrogance to cloak the land in &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt;. These actions saved Pandaria from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, but doomed it to a future of stagnation and isolation. The last emperor then became one with the land and watched over Pandaria in spirit form for over 10,000 years.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; coming to Pandaria's shores, Shaohao became more active, sharing his wisdom with the Alliance and Horde, warning them of the Sha of Pride, and helping them to become stronger on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEmperor's Burdens.\nAccording to legend, Shaohao studied at &lt;a href=\"Tian%20Monastery\"&gt;Tian Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. When he was a prince, Shaohao befriended &lt;a href=\"the%20Monkey%20King\"&gt;the Monkey King&lt;/a&gt;. He was crowned 10,000 years ago, but he was an untested, uncertain young pandaren, completely unaware of the burdens he would bear. On the day of Shaohao's coronation, a monk from Kun-Lai presented him with the gift of &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt;. The new emperor did not know its importance, and did not even recognize the monk as being sent by Xuen, the White Tiger. He merely thought the staff was a pretty ornament. Shaohao believed he was destined for a life of comfort and ease since Pandaria had been a peaceful land for generations, and he did not believe that would change.\nFollowing tradition, he sought the counsel of the great &lt;a href=\"waterspeaker\"&gt;waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; who, instead of good news, delivered him a terrible prophecy: a &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; was calling forth a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;host of demons&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;great well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;green fire rained from the skies&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;'s continents would soon be &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;shattered&lt;/a&gt;.\nForlorn and without hope, the last Emperor ascended the sheer slope of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt;. Daggers of cold sliced through his silken robes, and the biting wind heaped scorn on his journey. Only at the very peak of the mountain did the emperor find quiet and solace, and here he spoke with the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of wisdom. The Jade Serpent urged Shaohao to divest himself of his burdens, to purify his spirit, and to become one with the land. The Emperor was perplexed by the Jade Serpent's council, but no further answers were to be found atop the frigid peak. Dejected, Emperor Shaohao trudged back down the mountain to consult his companion, the Monkey King, and determine his next move, with Xuen's gift in hands. He returned home to the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaohao meditated for three days and three nights, for the counsel of the Jade Serpent was unclear. How could one purge oneself of all doubt? Weary of waiting, Shaohao's traveling companion the Monkey King whittled a &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;strange grimacing visage out of bamboo&lt;/a&gt;. He urged the Emperor to place the mask of doubt on his face. While mischief was the Monkey King's motivation, the mask worked. As Shaohao pulled the mask away, his doubts took on &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;a physical form&lt;/a&gt;. For seven hours they fought until the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; was buried at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, Shaohao finally knew what must be done, and his journey to purge his negative emotions began. He traveled to each temple of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, purging himself of the negative emotions. In &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, he stumbled into a marsh, but with the help of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, he freed and purged himself of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Sha of Despair&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen he continued towards the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. When Shaohao looked upon the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; lands from the great wall, he was frozen with fear. To cross into their territory was to risk almost certain death. The &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; held him immobile, paralyzing his thoughts. &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Ox, was there to remind him that fear only controlled his mind, not his feet. Shaohao understood, wrested himself free of fear, and walked on. The young emperor also saved the Monkey King from the mantid's clutches by trapping them in sap and brought his hozen friend back to safety. The Monkey King was enraged, but the mantid were not his enemy. Shaohao reminded him that the Burning Legion was the true threat. Now, without fear or despair or doubt, Shaohao believed himself ready to face the Burning Legion's might.\nBut he did not wish to face it alone. He wanted an army to command, so he climbed Kun-Lai and continued on to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, the training grounds of the most dedicated fighters in the land. These souls trained to fight the mantid and all of Pandaria's other enemies. Shaohao came to them confidently, demanding that they submit to his authority. Xuen saw that he was carrying his coronation gift, Sheilun, but that it had been nothing more to him than a walking stick. The White Tiger also saw that the emperor had rid himself of a great many dangerous emotions, but not anger toward the Legion that made him brash and reckless. Xuen offered a simple challenge, to strike a single one of these monks, and the emperor would have full command of the soldiers. Shaohao accepted and swung Sheilun over and over again, but he struck nothing at all. The monks were too skilled, and they easily evaded him. Shaohao's humiliation and anger built up, and they exploded. A great darkness burst forth from him, and in his rage, Shaohao broke Sheilun over his knee and lashed out with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;Sha of Anger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Violence\"&gt;Violence&lt;/a&gt;. When he regained his senses, a monk lay dead, the victim of Shaohao's unchecked aggression. Xuen watched the emperor's heart break for the life he had taken. Then Shaohao knelt humbly, accepting his failure, ridding himself of anger forever. Shaohao realized that he fought for his people. Shaohao was now ready to fulfill his destiny. He took one half of the broken staff with him and set off to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, prepared to save Pandaria.\nBefore entering the Vale, he also established the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; to continue to watch and protect against the sha menace. The Emperor was forever changed, and as he set forth on the final leg of his adventure, he was a creature of faith, courage, patience, love, and peace, a creature of pure light. At the dusk of the final day, the sky was bathed in green fire, and the very ground trembled in terror. But the Emperor was not afraid. His mind was clear of any doubt or despair. He feasted and he sang as the sky tore open. Seeing fear and doubt in his subjects' eyes, Shaohao told them that one should live each day to its fullest, and sleep each night with the peace of a mind unburdened.\nIt is said that all the trees in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;vale&lt;/a&gt; blossomed as he entered, and continue to blossom to this day. He ascended to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Eternal Spring&lt;/a&gt;, to separate Pandaria from the rest of the world. But try as he might, he was unable: the ground trembled yet did not move. Soon, he began to doubt, and the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; began to emerge from &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;the east&lt;/a&gt;. He began to fear, and the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; began ripping out its shackles to &lt;a href=\"Niuzao%20Temple\"&gt;the west&lt;/a&gt;. Desperately, he called out to the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; for help. Yu'lon circled the Vale, and explained that Pandaria was more than just the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; to the west were as much a part of the land as Shaohao's empire behind &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;the wall&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that all things were connected in an eternal whole and that his beloved land was more than just the Pandaren Empire, Shaohao at last understood. All Shaohao could do was shield them from annihilation and give his subjects time to learn the lessons he had learned. With Sheilun in his grasp, Shaohao became one with the land. Through Sheilun, his spirit was transformed, surrounding Pandaria as a great mist. Although Shaohao was gone, the staff remained and clattered to the floor. When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;world tore itself apart&lt;/a&gt;, Pandaria drifted quietly into the ocean. And as the Emperor's empty robes fluttered to the ground, the land became enveloped in &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;impenetrable mists&lt;/a&gt;, hidden away from the rest of the world. However, despite having been thought to have defeated all of the sha, Shaohao had held on to one vice \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. It was through the emperor's pride that Pandaria was cloaked in mists, as he thought that the residents of Pandaria were better than the rest of the world and could solve their own problems. Shaohao's staff remained on the ground until the monks of &lt;a href=\"Tian%20Monastery\"&gt;Tian Monastery&lt;/a&gt; found it and took it to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping.\nAfter Emperor Shaohao disappeared, the power in Pandaria shifted to the local level. With all threats walled off there was no longer a need for an emperor anymore, making Shaohao the last Emperor of Pandaria.\nEscalation.\nAs the war began to escalate between the Horde and the Alliance, the Darkspear trolls had started a rebellion against Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The legendary brewmaster &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was involved. Amidst the strife, Chen decided to learn how the mists of Pandaria had parted and given Hellscream the chance to seize control of the resources from the continent. He sent adventurers to find an old Seer he had met during his travels named Hao Pham Roo, an expert on Emperor Shaohao.\nIn Kun-Lai Summit, the adventurers found that Seer Hao was too old to follow the trail of the last emperor at the mountainside of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt;.

When they finally reached the destination, &lt;a href=\"Seeker%27s%20Point\"&gt;Seeker's Point&lt;/a&gt;, Seer Hao revealed his true identity: the spirit of Emperor Shaohao.

Thus, old enemies must work together and proud races must admit they need help.\nAfter Shaohao finished his lesson, he vanished with a bow.\nTimeless Isle.\nThe spirit of Shaohao awaits adventurers to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and announce the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; to be called up for a challenge as World Bosses.

These constructs, along with a single extraordinarily powerful Anubisath called &lt;a href=\"Ossirian%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Ossirian the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt; turned the tides, forcing the remaining dragonflights to join in on the war, finally trapping the Emperors and their army inside Ahn'Qiraj behind the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn preparation for its reemergence in the world, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;the shadowy master of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; commanded Emperor Vek'lor to create a new obsidian statue superior to all other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt;.

United by the most powerful and influential troll tribe on &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire of Zul sought to halt the relentless advance of the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, who had begun to swarm across the breadth of the continent. The alliance was one of necessity, with each faction of trolls facing extinction at the hands of the aqir.\nWorking together and employing new tactics, the &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in repelling the aqiri invasion, significantly preventing the fall of the strategic &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Mountains\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Following these victories, however, the united troll tribes launched several brutal and concurrent campaigns to not only destroy the aqir threat permanently, but also to expand their borders to new and untouched lands. Having emerged the decisive victors at the war's conclusion, the empire nevertheless remained intact and continued to flourish. The Empire of Zul was now uncontested in its domination of all of Kalimdor.\nThe Empire of Zul would continue to exist for thousands of years, although its relevance and effectiveness waned as the various troll nations began to become more independent and isolated. The organization survived at least until the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, at whose hands they were soundly and repeatedly defeated. At this point, troll power had been greatly reduced on the continent, with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; now becoming the dominant race on the landmass. It is assumed that, with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the last vestiges of the once-mighty Empire of Zul were eradicated, as Kalimdor was torn apart and the troll race scattered.\nIt is unknown exactly how the Empire of Zul was led and governed. Although referred to as an empire, it was composed of largely independent tribes which maintained a majority of autonomy even during the war with the aqir. It is likely that meetings were held among representatives from each tribe to discuss and govern major aspects of the empire (as has been known to occur with other examples of unified troll tribes).\nHistory.\nFormation.\nAround 16,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; race flourished on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Skilled and adapted to their environment, the trolls began forming their own tribes and claimed new and untouched lands which were plentiful in all directions. In this period of relative prosperity, the troll race also began to develop its own culture, traditions, and religion. All trolls, regardless of tribe or opinion, revered Kalimdor's ancient &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s which they referred to as &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;. The most religious and powerful of the tribes was the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which made their home on the Zandalar Mountains, a sacred location to all trolls. The Zandalari were allied with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;their empire&lt;/a&gt;, but both the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; held contempt for one another. The Zandalari thought themselves above the mogu for two reasons: the presence of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Zandalari did not use slaves as the mogu did. The mutual contempt between the two would grow to polite indifference. They trusted the other not to attack because they were confident they would defeat the other. While Zandalari and mogu stood back to back, they did not watch the other and did not see the other falter.\nThe Zandalari were heavily dependent on a caste system, and as time went on those castes evolved into their own people. The lower castes eventually left the Zandalari, and the Zandalar trolls were content to see them go, seeing them as children who would see the folly of youthful rebellion and come back begging for Zandalari approval.\nThis peace, however, was shattered when the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; was awakened from millennia of hibernation by a small group of curious trolls. Seeking to please the ancient &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; once more, it reached out to the dormant race of &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; and ordered them to prepare to swarm across Kalimdor, destroying troll civilization. When the aqir eventually launched their assault, many smaller troll factions were immediately overwhelmed, unable to withstand the vast insectoid legions. As the aqiri advance continued, it looked unstoppable. Before long Kith'ix's army was nearing the trolls' most sacred location, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Mountains\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetermined to prevent the aqir from continuing further, the Zandalari tribe used its influence and power to negotiate an alliance between the largest of the troll tribes: the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding the threat to all tribes that the aqir posed, the disparate tribes agreed to unite. They resolved to put aside their differences and past grievances and to focus on defeating the insectoids. Under the leadership of the Zandalari, the tribes united into a single mighty force which they termed the Empire of Zul.\nThe Empire at war.\nFrom atop their temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains, the Zandalari commanded and directed the united troll forces in battle. From this strategic point, they possessed a commanding view of the surrounding region and were thus able to detect the movement of enemy forces while directing their own to weak points. At the Zandalari's behest, the other trolls now employed cunning ambush tactics against the aqir in the jungles surrounding the region. These proved highly successful and allowed the Empire of Zul to effectively whittle down their enemies' numbers while remaining difficult to pin down. Troll mystics and priests also utilized their close ties to the loa to enlist their aid against the insectoids. These Wild Gods proved so effective that they even wounded Kith'ix in combat.\nUnder the relentless onslaught of the united tribes, the aqir were forces to retreat from the Zandalar Mountains before they could truly lay them under siege. Kith'ix, now injured, fled to the northeast to recover while the other aqiri swarms continued the war. Although they had successfully driven the aqir back from their lands, the leaders of the Empire of Zul knew that the threat was far from eliminated. They recognized that, if the troll race was to be truly safe, the aqir would have to be exterminated altogether. Otherwise, the insectoids would simply rebuild their numbers and relaunch their assault. As a result, the empire mobilized its forces and moved out in various directions to hunt the aqir. The coalition's most powerful factions apart from the Zandalari themselves, were convinced to establish their own strongholds in distant lands from which they could attack the aqir.\nThe Gurubashi, Amani, and Drakkari tribes readily agreed and set off in different directions to defeat the aqir once and for all in the name of their united empire. Although each encountering different groups of aqir and struggling with different obstacles in beating them, all the tribes ultimately succeeded in breaking aqiri power throughout the continent. Declaring themselves the victors of the great war, the Empire of Zul now reveled in the fact that it had permanently ended the greatest threat to their race.\nAfter the war.\nFollowing the conclusion of the war against the aqir, the empire's major tribes decided to lay claim to the lands that they had occupied in their quest to eradicate the insectoids. The Empire of Zul now stretched across the continent from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; in the east to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; in the west. The new nations founded by the Gurubashi, Amani, and Drakkari tribes soon began to thrive, free from any conflict with each other. Through the power and unity of the Empire of Zul, the troll race had come to dominate the continent.\nWithout the war and imminent threat of destruction to bind them together, the troll nations grew ever more distant and insular from each other. The new territories which the tribes now ruled were very far from each other and so equated to relatively little interaction between the troll factions. Although successful in its one and only objective, the Empire of Zul as an idea now began to fade in relevance and necessity. The tribes' newly-established strongholds eventually blossomed into vibrant homes, temple cities, and ultimately the seats of empires in their own right. The Zandalari, meanwhile, content with the outcome of the war and the general direction the troll race was taking, withdrew to their mountain plateaus and cities to pursue spiritual knowledge. Regardless, they would still maintain immense influence over the thriving yet disparate troll societies, having ensured the trolls' continued survival in their time of greatest need.\nThe Rise of the kaldorei.\nIn the millennia that followed the founding of the empire, the troll race continued to maintain control over much of the continent of Ancient Kalimdor. This changed, however, when a new race known as the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; emerged near the waters of the mystical &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Although originally evolved from trolls (greatly influenced by their proximity to the well) the kaldorei, or night elves, bore very little resemblance at all to the other ancient race. Physically, they were much more sleek and elegant, but culturally they had adopted their own traditions. They adopted new religious beliefs and quickly established their own civilization in the center of Kalimdor. The night elves, highly intelligent and able to harness the innate magical forces of the world, began to forge their own empire completely independent of their troll ancestors.\nDespite the size and glory of the mighty Empire of Zul, despite its vast temple cities and rich culture, it was utterly eclipsed by the rapid expansion and development of the glorious &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In an ensuing golden age, the night elves expanded across the entire continent, driving the other races, including the trolls, farther away. At this point, the Empire of Zul was a shadow of its former self, devoid of the unity and energy it possessed when it warred with the aqir. Eventually, under the fantastic reign of the kaldorei monarch known as &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the two empires came into direct conflict. Of all the threats that the kaldorei encountered during the expansion of their empire, only the trolls had drawn their full attention.\nSporadic battles soon broke out between the two sides in the south and although what remained of the Empire of Zul fought ferociously to defend their lands, they were simply unable to resist the power of the night elves' sorcery. Their armies buckled under the onslaught and they found themselves unable to prevail against their elven foes. Azshara, however, had no interest in controlling the trolls' lands and so an accord was reached between the kaldorei and the Zandalari tribe, ever the leaders of the troll race. In exchange for a strict end to all troll incursions and expansion near night elf territory, they would\u2014by Azshara's grace\u2014be permitted to remain in possession of their sacred mountain ranges to the south. Though the terms were extremely uneven and humiliating for the trolls, they had no choice but to acquiesce. The shame of this agreement would sow the seeds of resentment among all trolls for thousands of years to come. Even in the modern day, the inherent troll resentment of elves can be attributed to these events.\nThe Empire's final days.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for the first time around 10,000 years before the First War, it sparked the legendary &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Although the trolls largely did not take part in the war, they suffered many of its terrible effects. Foremost of these was the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. At the conclusion of the war, the Well of Eternity exploded as a result of its use. The ensuing devastation tore Ancient Kalimdor apart and led to the creation of several new, smaller continents. For the last remnants of the Empire of Zul, this meant the end. The remaining unity of the troll nations, a far-cry from the days of the aqir war, was utterly destroyed when the various tribes were scattered with the landmass. The Zandalari, the leaders and greatest proponents of troll unity, were left isolated on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the newly-created &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, unable to continue their traditional role. Now separate and shaken, these nations not be united again for many thousands of years and would instead seek their destinies as now fully independent countries.\nLegacy.\nThe Empire of Zul ranks as one of the largest empires/political organizations in Azeroth's history. It represents a time when the troll race was at its most united; never again would the trolls see such levels of coordination and cooperation among each other. As a result of its size and power, the coalition had a great impact on many aspects of history.\nThe success of the empire in hunting the aqir, as well as its domination of the continent for many years, forced the remaining insectoids into relatively small pockets around Kalimdor. Some, such as the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; embraced their isolation by establishing their own, distinct nations and developing their own cultures and goals. As a result of these developments, many of these new insectoid races played different, but significant, roles in Azeroth's history in the millennia to come.\nThough the Empire of Zul was utterly destroyed during the Great Sundering, its influence and ideas remained for thousands of years to come. The concept of troll unity emerged once more at various stages again throughout history, . Even though a failure, this attempt at reunification is still symbolic of the Empire of Zul's lasting legacy and teachings among the trolls.\nSpeculation.\nThis may be the empire that &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;King Dazar&lt;/a&gt; founded, as Zuldazar, the 'city of gold', was its capital."}

Kel'Thuzad leaves, but not before mocking Arthas and Jaina, and commanding his &lt;a href=\"Ghouls\"&gt;undead minions&lt;/a&gt; to kill them, but Arthas and Jaina manage to destroy the granary anyway. Arthas and Jaina pursue Kel'Thuzad, killing his undead guards, and then slay Kel'Thuzad himself.

Cast &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Holy%20Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; on one, and then kill him, then do the same with the other one. As you enter Kel'Thuzad's throne, guarded by abominations, once again cast Divine Shield, move forward to Kel'Thuzad and kill him. Alternatively, a single level 3 Holy Light can also kill Kel'Thuzad, meaning that Arthas can just approach the necromancer and instantly kill him before a fight breaks out.

It is not optional, raids wanting to kill the bosses behind it must first defeat The Curator. The encounter is not difficult to learn, but is (for new raids) a rather hard &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;. A raid able to defeat this boss is in principle equipped well enough to clear the whole instance, save perhaps &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nMassive, powerful, fast and and above all surprisingly fast, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s reports mentions the Curator as a formidable opponent. It was created to protect Karazhan's secrets, things described as beautiful, magical, and unique, which have been lost or broken over time, although this does not prevent him from continuing his duty with ferocity.\nThough already defeated, the Curator reappears in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;\" battling against &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; and a group of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;ers. &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Curator\"&gt;Ancient Curator&lt;/a&gt;s appear in the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;Guardian's Library&lt;/a&gt; years later, and a similar construct known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Conservator\"&gt;the Conservator&lt;/a&gt; is encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;Karazhan Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Curator continues to decline, and is still erratic. The archmage is also trying to repair it.\nStrategy.\nFor new raids first entering Karazhan, the Curator is rather hard to kill. It's not a coincidence that this boss drops the first class set tokens - they really want them to be earned. There's not much strategy or room for fancy maneuvers - either the raid has the required DPS and the necessary mana endurance, or it does not.\nMost of the fight consists of two alternating phases: a 90 second Flare Phase followed by a 20 second Evocation Phase. Once the Curator's health drops below 15% it does a &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29%23Soft%20enrage\"&gt;soft enrage&lt;/a&gt;, stops summoning Flares and Evocating, but instead increases melee attack speed and Hateful Bolt frequency. 10 minutes after the pull the Curator does a hard enrage and wipes the raid very quickly.\nFlare phase.\nDuring the Flare Phase, The Curator summons ten Astral Flares, hits the tank with moderate melee damage, and casts Hateful Bolts.\nThe Curator summons one Astral Flare every 10 seconds, at a cost of 10% of its mana. Each Flare spawns with about 1000 threat from a random, non-tank player character and advances in that character's direction while hitting nearby enemies with Arcing Sear.\nEach Flare \"must\" be destroyed within 10 seconds, before the next one spawns. Failure to do so results in multiple Flares dealing damage at the same time - this situation usually means a wipe. It is not necessary to damage the Curator at all during this phase. Damaging the Curator \"is\" permissible, but only when no Flares are up (unless the raid has excess DPS: see Positioning below).\nThis cannot be over-emphasized: \"By far, the most important part of the fight is killing the Astral Flares as quickly as possible.\" Wipes usually happen because the healers run out of mana. They run out of mana because the Flares live too long. The solution is almost always to kill the Flares faster. The faster each Flare dies, the easier the healers' job becomes.\nWhile it is not necessary to tank the Flares, doing so gets them to hold still and makes them easier to kill. A hunter pet with attack power buffs and specced for arcane resistance and stamina is ideal for this task. Warriors, bear druids, paladins, and enhancement shamans can do the job, too. A decently-geared retribution paladin can rather easily hold the flares in place with &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Curator casts a Hateful Bolt every 10 to 15 seconds. The current best theory is that the Hateful Bolt hits the non-tank character that has generated the most threat on The Curator since the last Evocation and currently has enough health to survive the damage from the Bolt.\nIt is possible to assign one character - preferably a warlock or a shadow priest - as Hateful Bolt soaker. This character attracts most of the Hateful Bolts by steadily damaging The Curator. Equipping the soaker with arcane resistance gear negates a substantial amount of the damage from the Hateful Bolts. Note that using a soaker is reasonable only when the raid is still able to kill the Flares fast enough. It's typically done when using only two healers.\nEvocation phase.\nImmediately after The Curator summons the tenth Astral Flare with the last of its mana, it enters a state of Evocation for 20 seconds while it refills its mana. While it does so, it goes completely inactive and all damage dealt against it is tripled.\nMost raids must first concentrate on killing the tenth and last Flare before switching damage over to the Curator. Otherwise, there may be two Flares up after the Evocation, which is bad (see above). Killing the Flare quickly also grants the healers a few seconds break for mana regeneration. Overgeared raids can attack The Curator immediately to speed up the fight, and clean up the extra Flares after Evocation.\nCooldown and single-use abilities that temporarily increase damage output should be saved up for this moment and be activated at the beginning of the phase to quickly kill the last Astral Flare and to make the most out of the Curator's temporary vulnerability.\nOnce the Curator has finished refilling mana, the fight continues with the next Flare Phase.\nEnrage phase.\nWhen The Curator's health drops below 15%, it immediately switches to the &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; Phase. It stops summoning Astral Flares, ceases Evocations, and increases melee damage output and Hateful Bolt frequency. This means that the healers have to give the main tank and Hateful Bolt victims more attention while everyone else just nukes The Curator. This phase is actually the easiest part of the fight.\nPositioning.\nPositioning is a secondary concern, but it can help raids with marginal gear. A concentrated setup increases damage on the Flares by eliminating the need for melee damage-dealers to chase down Flares. A distributed setup reduces damage from the Flares by reducing the chaining of Arcing Sear.\nConcentrated.\nIf melee damage dealers are needed on the Flares, everybody except the hunters sets up close together, with the hunters as close as possible, just at their minimum range. The main tank is on one side of The Curator, and everybody else is on top of each other on its back (within melee range). This makes it easy for the melee characters to damage the Flares and quickly switch to The Curator when no Flares are up. The drawback of this method is that the Flare damage is maximized. This is offset to some extent because multi-target heal spells like &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; also have their maximum effect. More importantly, the Flares die more quickly in this formation, so they have less time to do damage.\nDistributed.\nIf the raid's ranged DPS is high enough to kill the Flares quickly (in less than eight seconds) without support from the melee characters, the melee group sets up close to The Curator and stays put. The ranged damage dealers and healers spread out and each stays at least ten yards away from everybody else. This significantly reduces Flare damage, because Arcing Sear doesn't jump farther than ten yards. Also, the melee group is on the Curator all the time, which shortens the fight.\nIf melee characters have to help killing Flares, the distributed setup does not work well. Even a single melee damage dealer chasing Flares breaks the ten yard pattern, and thus the Flare damage is maximized anyways. Worse, that melee character loses a lot of damage output while running around. Because of this, a concentrated setup is best for most raids new to this encounter.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Curator is the first boss in The Menagerie wing of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//hearthstone.gamepedia.com/One_Night_in_Karazhan\"&gt;One Night in Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; adventure in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Defeating that wing awards it as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Curator\"&gt;a legendary card&lt;/a&gt;."}

Though labeled as a group quest, this quest can be easily soloed by characters around level 40 (see \"details\" below for more info). In this quest, players are asked to use Catelyn's special knife (a troll artifact) to destroy an altar, causing a mage wielding the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; to appear.\nObjectives.\nDestroy the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Altar of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn's Blade&lt;/a&gt;, kill &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt; and bring the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn's Blade&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nSo you're looking for an altar of some sort? Well, I'm no expert on troll ruins like my father, but I have heard about a sunken troll city out near that island you're looking for. Maybe you should try there.\nYou got my knife back for me, so I guess you can borrow it... but I want it back when you're done!\nRewards.\nYou will gain:\nProgress.\nHave you retrieved the Stone of the Tides for me, &lt;name&gt;? I've already cleared out a space and purchased a fine stand for it.\nCompletion.\nAmazing! The Stone of Tides! It shall have a place of prominence in my collection of ancient troll artifacts. Did you see how it almost seems as though a tide is trapped within its surface? Magnificent!\nNotes.\nThe altar which must be destroyed lies in the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Reef\"&gt;Vile Reef&lt;/a&gt;, off the coast north-west of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; town &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The altar is in a ruined city sunk beneath the ocean. It may be useful to bring some way to breathe underwater for this quest.\nCoordinates of the altar: (24,23)\nThe altar is surrounded by a blue glow and should be easy to see from far away. Approach the altar and right click it to summon &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin mage who holds the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;. He is a level 40 non-elite who will turn into a water elemental. Since he is not elite, it is perfectly feasible for a single player to complete this quest, provided they avoid the nearby murlocs (or deal with them one by one, as a level 40 should be able to handle these lower level elites).\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt; is defeated, loot the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; and return to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nNOTE: Many glitches have been reported for this quest. The glitches involve &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt; not showing up after clicking on the altar, or have him show up but simply evade all attacks. Some players report that this only happens when you are too far away from the altar, and getting closer seems to fix the problem. Others claim that the only way is to restart the quest and return. Still other players have reported that the mob simply needs time to respawn.\nBug notice.\nAs of July 31, 2008, a &lt;a href=\"GM\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that the quest was badly bugged and cannot be consistently completed at this time.\nSee also.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Reef\"&gt;Vile Reef&lt;/a&gt;, where this quest takes place, is the location of several quests. It is a good idea to do all of these quests at once. As of patch 2.3, area is no longer elite."}

{"id": "59048", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=59048", "title": "The Dawn of Chaos", "text": "The Dawn of Chaos is a total conversion for &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;'s ', recreating the classic, but outdated, ' with updated graphics, a modified storyline, and a new hero system. The project is commonly referred to as DoC.\nIntroduction.\n\"Warcraft: Orcs and Humans\" was released to the public in 1995 and took the gaming world by storm. Its sequels, Warcraft II (and its expansion) and Warcraft III (and its expansion) were fantastically successful, leading to the present-day release of \"World of Warcraft\". New fans to Azeroth are often unwilling to play the original \"Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans\" because of several reasons: mainly, that the game's graphics are outdated, and that it runs poorly or not at all on new machines. Dawn of Chaos is meant to correct that injustice. As a total conversion project, it aims to recreate the first Warcraft game using the far more modern and flexible Warcraft III engine.\nDawn of Chaos isn't just a simple collection of maps for Warcraft III. With its own .exe, its own multiplayer, its own unique art and sound, and a long and engaging storyline, it is truly an entirely new experience no matter how familiar you are with the Warcraft series.\nPresentation.\nThe aim of Dawn of Chaos is to create a total conversion that will ultimately appear to be an entirely new game. Only the most restricted elements of Warcraft III remain, and DoC is essentially a unique product that utilizes the Warcraft III engine.\nGraphics.\nDawn of Chaos has its own entirely unique graphical style. No visual element of Warcraft III is included without extreme revision, because the graphical style of this mod and its parent game do not correspond at all. DoC has an extremely dark, vibrant visual scheme, with more realistic textures and coloration. Every tileset, structure, unit, interface, loading screen, 'glue screen', doodad, font, menu, and visual effect has been created or altered specifically for use in this project. The effect is genuinely one of an entirely new game.\nThis &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forum.samods.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D7895.0/\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; leads to a forum discussion thread with a gallery of all major human and orc units.\nSound.\nLike the visual elements, the sound in Dawn of Chaos is wholly original to this project. Unlike other modifications of Warcraft III, any situation that would have audio in a commercially-prepared game will have audio in DoC. This includes voice acting, music, and sound effects.\nInterface.\nThe user interface (UI) for each race has been replaced entirely. The fonts used by each interface have also been changed depending on which race you are playing, and minor changes (such as the use of square selections like \"Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans\" instead of circular selections like Reign of Chaos) have also been implemented. Loading screens have been specially created for each level with help from our concept artists, involving sketches of major characters and level descriptions.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of DoC is a mix of different styles; the classic original Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and the newer, more modern \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\". It is worth learning the basics before leaping right into the game; expert players of Warcraft III will find much that is unfamiliar to them, while players of Orcs and Humans might feel right at home.\nLike any RTS, the focus of DoC is your main base.\nBase Building.\nUnlike the normal Warcraft III base-building style, DoC requires that all buildings be created adjacent to roads. You will not be able to construct any building until you place it directly adjacent to at least one square of road. This allows for complex city-building, as in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. This feature was not included by the more simplified Warcraft II and Warcraft III, and it adds considerable depth to the construction of your base.\nRoad System.\nAs with the original game, The Dawn of Chaos features a road system in which towns must be built upon roads. The roads are built by the Town Hall for the Humans and the Great Hall for the Orcs. Roads themselves can only be constructed next to other roads in grid-patterns. \nWall System.\nWalls are slightly different from roads, but work mainly on the same principles. While still constructed from the Town/Great Hall, Walls must be built within a certain radius of one of your structures, although they do not require nearby roads.\nPlot.\nAlthough Dawn of Chaos is a representation of the events of \"Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans\", the storyline deviates slightly from both the original bare-bones structure and the modern revisions.\nHistory.\nWhile still incomplete, The Dawn of Chaos is a long standing mod within the \"Warcraft III\" community, with roots dating back to 2002. The development team has released multiple demos of the engine over the past few years.\nUpon release of the very first demo showcasing the engine of the mod, many errors were discovered very quickly and the demo was recalled.\nWith most of the problems that plagued its initial release, the Human Demo was released again to give project fans a taste of what was to come.\nA multiplayer demo that featured one map that could host six players was released to the public for the purpose of beta testing as well as to reward loyal fans for their patience.\nAfter much delays, the Misty Forest was updated and re-released with its own gamebuild in .exe form.\nAfter certain bugs were reported, the Realm Design team sought out to fix it and finally released a new version."}

They were never heard from again. However, the great knight has recently appeared to the &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; in a vision - battered and pleading for assistance. &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; has ordered &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; to lead a detachment of warriors and healers into the mines in an attempt to find Sir Lothar, heal him, and bring him and any other survivors back alive.\"\nGuide.\nThis mission will take a little while. The enemy forces greatly outnumber yours, so rushing it may result in considerable casualties. You do have access to Clerics and healing, so be sure to top off your units' health and keep them alive. The safest way to handle this mission is to keep a tight formation with your Footmen at the front of your forces, your Archers behind them, and your Clerics in the rear. Keep an opening for an Archer to retreat back to your forces, so that it does not get trapped out in the open where he can be killed by an Ogre.\nSend an Archer ahead to scout the caves. Have him frequently stop to get optimum vision and to watch for incoming Ogres; they will be regularly sent against your forces. When you see one approaching, bring your Archer back to your other forces (They will outrun them) and select a Cleric so he can heal as needed. Once a good chunk of the path looks clear, move your forces forward and set up their formation, once more. Players will be doing this until reach a large room near the end where several Ogres await them. Keep a tight formation after entering and explore the entire room with a single scout, luring Ogres over to your main attack force. After going into the next large room on the east side, you will find several neutral units covered in blankets along the northeast side. These are Lothar and his Archer companions.

Only a handful of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; defenders remain to safeguard the ancient Elf kingdom from the onslaught of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The enchanted domain of the Elves has inspired &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to unleash his most perverted creation - the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt;. Formed from the corpses of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, these once proud defenders of Humanity now serve the Horde in a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; state of eternal &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Conjuring dark spells of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; horror upon their terrified foes, these Death Knights seek to unleash their wrath upon any foolish enough to stand in their way.\"\nBackground.\nSince the Horde's objective was to remove the stronghold itself, their plan was to raise a huge force and beat a path through their back door in much the same way as they had at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. First they needed to secure their base for construction. A group of Alliance enemies were already inside their walls, so the sappers were quickly moved out of the way for their ogres to do their work. When all was quiet again, the ogres immediately marched out through the west entrance and circled around to the other side of the forest, where more Alliance troops were trying to gather. From that point onward, they continued to keep forces in the clearing to eliminate enemies before they had a chance to gather in force there. They then plugged the west entrance with two &lt;a href=\"pig%20farm\"&gt;pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s and began building an army of workers to prepare for the assault.\nWhen they had their first &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; built up into a &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; and complemented with an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, it was necessary to send workers south to raise another great hall near a second &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;. A constant stream of ogre magi poured out of their barracks; a group of them was sent to guard the new hall while the rest continued to guard the clearing. Sappers were also built in large numbers, for these were the tools with which the enemy stronghold would easily be demolished. As last they had a huge army of twenty ogre magi, four catapults, and ten sappers to begin the final assault. Other magi stayed in the clearing to defend the base. Their army marched off in force to the southeast corner of the area.\nAfter slaughtering the few defenders around a third mine directly east of the city, their magi gathered west of it near an ice bridge, but did not cross it. &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Kilrogg\"&gt;Eyes of Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt; were summoned to look to the west, where a tower and &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e awaited their arrival. The magi then cast multiple &lt;a href=\"Ogre-Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29%23Spells\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt; just north of the tower, and then brought in catapults to start firing on it. The first barrage prompted the Alliance guards to rush them; they exploded nicely on the runes that were set up for them. Having cleaned up the remaining units, they continued west and demolished a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;. While they waited for their magic to build up again, the sappers were brought up, but remained in the rear, as they removed another emplacement of towers and defenders in the same fashion as the last with the runes doing most of the work for them. From there they made the final push through the back door of the city, pausing to build up mana again, and set runes to draw city guards to their deaths.\nFinally they allowed the runes that had not gone off to dissipate, cast &lt;a href=\"%3Abloodlust\"&gt;:bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; on their magi, targeted towers with their catapults, and poured into the city to create as much chaos as possible. This cleared the way for their sappers, who rushed in and levelled the stronghold with a fantastic display of fire and noise. The rest of the elves soon retreated, knowing that the Horde could not be stopped. Urok, believed that, once again, their &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;s were pleased.\nSpeculation.\nThe mission is depicted with three opponents: &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; (blue), &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; (green) and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (violet). Yet the only opponent with a base and a true army is the blue one, as the green and violet opponents do not have bases, only groups of elven archers and ballistae to protect their towers and farms. The blue base also starts with no footmen, only archers, knights and peasants and is described in the mission's objective as an elven stronghold. As such, it is entirely possible that the various opponents are meant to represent various branches of the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;Elven Ranger Corps&lt;/a&gt; and that their names are just caused by an engine limitation. Amusingly, the Alliance forces have no less than three &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;elven lumber mills&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The floating necropolis is a clear threat to all of Azeroth, but the presence of one of the Scourge's most important agents also provides a great opportunity to those willing to take the fight to the heart of the undead war machine. With this goal in mind, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are now vying for control over strategic points in the Eastern Plaguelands. \nFour towers are crucial to establishing complete strategic control over the Eastern Plaguelands: &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;Crown Guard Tower&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Eastwall%20Tower\"&gt;Eastwall Tower&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northpass%20Tower\"&gt;Northpass Tower&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood%20Tower\"&gt;Plaguewood Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest.\nTower Breakdown.\nControlling the Towers.\nIn order to capture a tower, a player must have PvP enabled. Capturing a tower is based on a tug-of-war system (much like &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen a tower is captured, a message is displayed in the local defense channel. Mousing over a tower on the map will display its ownership, and if it is contested or progressing.\nEchoes of Lordaeron.\nWhen a faction controls at least one tower, that faction's players are granted the buff &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Echoes of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, increasing physical and magical damage to Undead. Echoes of Lordaeron is zone-wide across both &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe effect is based on the amount of towers controlled:\nRewards.\nPlayers who directly participate in capturing a tower receive 189 &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system%20%28pre-2.0%29\"&gt;Bonus Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from the Echoes of Lordaeron buff, players may specifically look to control the Northpass Tower for Lordaeron's Blessing, as this buff functions in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;."}

Head northwest to Skycaller Omnuron's position just outside of the raging inferno.\nEvery minute or so a named Windcaller appears:\nThe windcaller will set off, clearing the fire near him. Do not stick too close to the windcaller, but instead try to stay in the fire-free area.\nSeveral Flamewaker Assassins with ~77k health will charge the windcaller. Peel them off so the windcaller can keep moving. Make sure to keep up with the fire-clear area!\nPast the inferno, the windcaller will reach a clear area with a Pyrelord, an 85 elite fire elemental with 304k health. Any attacking assassins will deaggro and flee. The Pyrelord has the following abilities:\nFinish off the Pyrelord and it will pull all nearby units to it as it dies. As it dies, the ground around it ruptures and players fall down in to the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Flow\"&gt;Molten Flow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt; is inside to the northeast. Speak with her to continue.\nShe also knows the way out:\nThe Thermal Vent at back at the entrance will launch players to the surface, no head-watching required. To get back to the bottom without liquifying, a Rappelling Rope can be found at the hole's northern edge."}

The party enters but immediately encounters a group of &lt;a href=\"Onyxian%20Warder\"&gt;Onyxia's warders&lt;/a&gt;, though the dragonspawn are quickly dispatched by Jaina's frost magic and Broll's magical roots. Thargas remarks that the rest of the group barely even have to lift their blades with the two powerful magic users in their midst, but Jaina reminds him that the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; has had thousands of years to perfect her own magical skills and that they shouldn't sheathe their weapons just yet.\nFurther into the lair, the party comes upon Onyxia, who is carrying Anduin in her claws and warns the intruders to stop lest she kill the boy. The prince yells at his father not to listen to her as she's going to kill him anyway. In response, Lo'Gosh throws a blade that impales Onyxia's other foreleg, enraging her and causing her to drop Anduin onto a clutch of her eggs, which immediately hatch into hungry whelps. Broll quickly transforms into a bird and swoops in to carry Anduin out of harm's way but is felled by the dragon's fire breath, causing the prince to land among the whelps once more. Valeera and Thargas rush in to save Anduin and Broll (who quickly gets back on his feet), with Valeera giving the prince one of her enchanted daggers to fight with. Thargas tells Valeera to guard the prince while he and Broll rush the dragon.\nThe Stormwind guards begin firing enchanted arrows at the dragon, but when Thargas charges in he is swept into more hatching eggs by Onyxia's tail. The black broodmother takes to the air, incinerates several of the guardsmen, and summons in yet more reinforcements. In response, Broll summons huge, living roots to kill the whelps and ensnare the dragon herself so they can take the battle to its source without wasting time on her brood. As Varian and Lo'Gosh prepare to strike at their nemesis, however, she casts a &lt;a href=\"Fear%20effect\"&gt;fear spell&lt;/a&gt; targeted at Broll that washes over many of the other combatants, briefly paralyzing them. Onyxia seizes the opportunity to break free of her bonds, knock Jaina to the floor with her tail, and gloat that after the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;House of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed, the Lady Prestor will \"reluctantly\" become the regent and eventual ruler of all Stormwind.\nOnyxia begins to chant in &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;, yelling \"Reln nu ramani ar ravelahn\" (\"Let the will of this puppet be broken\"). Varian recognizes it as the start of the spell that almost destroyed Lo'Gosh back on the island. Yelling that Lo'Gosh is the embodiment of the will of Stormwind's king, Varian jumps in front of his double as Onyxia finishes \"Abela mal am dakana!\" (\"Once and for all!\") and unleashes the spell, which impacts both Varian and Lo'Gosh simultaneously.\nAfter a long moment of silence, the reborn Varian Wrynn emerges from the spell, his two halves having been inadvertently fused back together. Onyxia tries a final time to incinerate him, but Varian jumps atop her head and impales her skull with &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;his newly-fused sword&lt;/a&gt;. As Onyxia's corpse collapses on the floor, Varian jumps down and embraces his son. The king declares that Onyxia is dead and that the line of Stormwind's kings has been restored. Through her machinations, Onyxia has made Varian twice the warrior, statesman, and king he was before, and he proclaims that \"on this night and in this hour, Stormwind has been reborn!\""}

Arthas interrogates his prisoner concerning entry to the inner kingdom. The stubborn &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; insists that the \"fallen prince\" will not be able to enter their land, citing that not only their gates will protect their &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;, but the enchanted forests as well. Arthas is not in the least bit moved by his prisoner's confidence, as he has come prepared with crude &lt;a href=\"meat%20wagon\"&gt;meat wagon&lt;/a&gt;s to aid him in clearing the trees to create a path leading to the &lt;a href=\"elfgate\"&gt;elfgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the meat wagons clear a path, Arthas and his forces destroy a small settlement guarded by &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s who were caught by surprise. The &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; mercilessly slaughtered any elf who tried to defend their land. Having successfully obliterated a high elven &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad advises Arthas to construct a base on the site, as he senses that the energies of this place are strong. As he instructed his &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s to begin haunting the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; and summon structures to supplement their war effort, the undead forces are met with more elven defenders, this time led by the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The couragous elf threatens Arthas to withdraw his forces, lest they taste the wrath of the high elves. Yet again, Arthas is unfazed by the elf woman's words, and he continued to fight until the elves were pushed back.\nOnce Arthas' undead bastion was in full operation to add to his forces' already growing numbers, Arthas took his army deeper into the woods. There, he is met by Sylvanas and her forces again and again. However, as often as they attacked, so too were the undead able to push them back. Deeper into the fabled enchanted forests of Quel'Thalas, the undead were also greeted by its wildlife and other sentient inhabitants, whom they thought were also rising up to halt their invasion. Just as any elf though, Arthas and his loyal minions killed and raised them alike.\nAs the undead advanced, the outnumbered high elf forces retreated deeper and deeper towards the outer elfgate. The army of the dead overwhelmed each and every one of the defenders' hamlets. The weary elves soon realized that everytime one of their own falls, the forces of their adversary grow. Though this did not stop the Elven &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;Ranger Corps&lt;/a&gt;, they too soon fell and along with their leader, Sylvanas Windrunner, watched as the undead under Arthas' command destroy the outer elfgate. Sylvanas, though knowing that she had failed to protect the outer elfgate, recalled her troops to fall back to the second gate. Sylvanas admits defeat at this gate, but she confidently told the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt; that he won't get through the second. The mission ends with the undead claiming victory at the fallen elfgate."}

It announced the introduction of competitive \"Dance Battles\", in reference to the &lt;a href=\"dance%20studio\"&gt;dance studio&lt;/a&gt; feature that had been announced for \"\" at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt; but subsequently never released.\nIntroduction.\nThe act of jubilant self-expression through dancing has long been an integral part of World of Warcraft's social interactions. Now it's been taken to a whole new level with the new Dance Battle system, coming to the game in an upcoming content patch. Combining elements of Arena competition with the dynamism and creativity of coordinated, player-controlled dance animations, Dance Battles offer a whole new kind of crew-versus-crew challenge.\nSo You Think You Can /Dance?\nFrom the interdimensional fortress known as Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider has issued a challenge far and wide to dance crews throughout Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, and Northrend -- in order to find out who is Azeroth's best dance crew!\nHe's handpicked his judges from nearby Area 52 in Outland and retrofitted his flying fortress for its new purpose -- to host a series of exhilarating dance-offs. He's also relocated his fiery, faithful companion A'lar and retooled the phoenix's chamber to accommodate the competition. It's here that your crew will find the NPC dancemasters, who will allow you to initiate a dance-off or accept another crew's challenge.\nYou'd Better Bring It!\nYou perform dance moves using a custom interface similar to those that appear when controlling a vehicle in Wrath of the Lich King. The custom action bar displays all available dance moves, which each crew member can individually configure by speaking to the appropriate NPC before the competition.\nNext, your crew will need to create their routine. To practice, simply select a backing track, and the music will begin after a brief countdown. The best routines are carefully planned out in advance and executed with individual skill as well as with an overall group dynamic in mind.\nWar Stomp the Yard.\nOnce engaged in a Dance Battle, simply select the dance move you wish to perform, and your character will execute it. As with the Arena system, close communication and teamwork is crucial -- you'll have to be in sync, both with the music as well as with the other members of your crew, to become the \"server\" and not the \"servee.\"\nEach crew will take turns performing, with the order randomly selected at the beginning of each dance-off. Whichever crew posts the higher score from the judges is declared the winner of the battle. At the end of the Dance Battle season, only one team will be dubbed Azeroth's best dance crew!"}

The goal is to clear out the Legion invasion force, fight a boss, do an event, and complete an objective.\nGameplay.\nPlayers will first be introduced to Invasion Points through a quest that challenges them to enter and defeat the demonic forces inside. Each Invasion Point can be accessed without a queue to enter and while no group is required, additional players will be able to enter the Invasion Point instance within a short period of each other. No queue is required to enter.\nThere are two tiers of Invasion Points that will not only increase in difficulty, but also increase in rewards\u2014and you'll need to bring along extra help if you want to complete the highest tier.\nSeveral Invasion Points will be available on Argus at any given time along with one Greater Invasion Point. The portals into these encounters will be visible on your world map and each player will need to click on the portal to enter (even when in a group.) Each Invasion Point will cycle within a couple of hours and despawn, so you'll want to keep an eye on the timers indicated on your map. You and your party will face some additional challenges from location to location, whether it's contending with the extremes of cold or playing in fire. Completing these Invasion Points will provide Argus Waystones which can be used toward earning a weekly reward.\nGreater Invasion Points will provide access for you and your raid to one of the new World Bosses and the chance to get some great loot starting at ilvl 930. If you don't have a raid at your beck and call, there's always the Group Finder (I) where you're sure to be able to recruit some heroes to join you. Bosses will only award loot once per week. The invasion points provide a certain degree of variation to Argus and allows players to see some different settings.\nBosses.\nFrom its stronghold on Argus, the Legion employs a vast array of portals to spread across the cosmos like a plague. Countless worlds have been plundered for resources, their inhabitants forced to serve the Dark Titan or endure a slow, agonizing death.\nUnless these worlds can be liberated, the Burning Crusade will consume everything it touches and leave the universe in ashes.\nWorlds.\n&lt;a href=\"Aurinor\"&gt;Aurinor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA planet composed of floating islands with seemingly nothing but clouds beneath them.
