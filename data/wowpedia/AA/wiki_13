Mankrik also helps defend &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; on Mount Hyjal against the minions of Ragnaros during the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nMankrik and his wife &lt;a href=\"Olgra\"&gt;Olgra&lt;/a&gt; battled quilboar in a small tauren camp when they were separated by the overwhelming numbers. As he saw his wife being overwhelmed by newcomers, rage came over him as he turned to face his enemies, but they brought him down easily with their vast numbers. He later awoke to a tauren druid tending his wounds \u2014 the druid had come across him on the Gold Road as he fell. Filled with uncertainty whether his wife was still alive or not, he stood at the Crossroads every day scouting the horizon for more quilboar to quench his bloodthirst.\nCataclysm.\nHe later managed to retrieve the corpse of his wife and bury her, raising a &lt;a href=\"Humble%20Monument\"&gt;humble monument&lt;/a&gt; in her honor. However his thirst for quilboar blood had still not been quenched, killing every single one of them he'd seen since they murdered his wife and burned down his homestead. Still not satisfied with the slaughter of the quilboar at &lt;a href=\"Thorn%20Hill\"&gt;Thorn Hill&lt;/a&gt;, he later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, realizing that there he would never have peace without his wife, wanting to see the quilboar's very homes razed. It's then hinted that &lt;a href=\"Mahka\"&gt;Mahka&lt;/a&gt; helps him to settle with his troubles and may be romantically involved.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; may receive Mankrik as one of their random strike force partners in the daily quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He will not join &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players. /waving at him counts toward the achievement, &lt;a href=\"Have...%20Have%20We%20Met%3F\"&gt;Have... Have We Met?&lt;/a&gt;\nLegion.\nHe was present at &lt;a href=\"Grol%27dom%20Farm\"&gt;Grol'dom Farm&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; Northern Barrens.\nDragonflight.\nMankrik visited the &lt;a href=\"Zen%27shiri%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Zen'shiri Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to buy himself a new sword and a \"nice\" bracelet for &lt;a href=\"Mahka\"&gt;Mahka&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later appeared alongside Mahka at the renewed &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. He wasn't part of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; delegation or any clan delegation.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nI came to the Crossroads from the south seeking help, &lt;class&gt;, but I find only cowards who turn their backs on me -- even the mighty &lt;a href=\"Thork\"&gt;Thork&lt;/a&gt; insults me so. He is a good leader, but his dismissal of my plea causes me greater anger.\nHe claims my rage makes me hasty -- that it clouds my judgement -- but I will not rest until I have vengeance!\nCataclysm.\nI thank you, &lt;name&gt;. Your dedication to my plea gives rest to my lost wife's spirit, and for that I could never repay you enough.\nI cannot say that my hatred will ever cease for the quilboar, but it is satiated for now.\nNow I must begin to rebuild my life.\nI swore that nothing would stir me to take up this blade again.\nI was a fool.\nClan.\nIt is possible that Mankrik is a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;, as he shows signs of obsession (asking you to kill dozens of &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;) and also displayed a Burning Blade banner outside his hut in the Crossroads. This seems to be confirmed with his new guise in '. When he appears as a &lt;a href=\"Mankrik%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt; in ' he says \"We're frostwolf. We don't lose, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Guard%20Ehanes\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;\", implying that he is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. However, since &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the alternate Draenor is not a perfect copy, it is possible that Mankrik being a Frostwolf rather than a Burning Blade member is one of the differences between the alternate Draenor and the main timeline. Alternatively, he may have decided to leave the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; and be trained as a blademaster."}

There is also no NPC called \"Mankrik's Wife\", as she is called \"&lt;a href=\"Beaten%20Corpse\"&gt;Beaten Corpse&lt;/a&gt;\". This results in almost everyone accepting this quest resorting to asking for her location in &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20Chat\"&gt;Barrens general chat&lt;/a&gt;. This becomes extremely annoying, as &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters spend large amounts of time in the Barrens, and hearing the same question repeated over and over and over again tends to drive the somewhat more experienced players a tad irritable.\nRepeated requests for the location of Mankrik's Wife have resulted in responses that vary wildly in accuracy \u2014 some place her quite close to her actual location (though such responses are probably given out of pity for the lost player), while others \u2014 depending on the prevailing mood \u2014 attempt to send players to far-off, hard-to-reach (or often totally impossible to reach) places (such as 'Inside Blackrock Mountain' or 'Next to Illidan's Throne'). Even the \"World of Warcraft\" general database \"&lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;\" has answered this question, using location markers to spell out the word \"THERE\" and a giant arrow pointing at the location of the &lt;a href=\"Beaten%20Corpse\"&gt;Beaten Corpse&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn many realms \"Mankrik's Wife\" has also become a generic response to general chat questions involving quest-givers, merchants, etc. For example:\nMany people who begin blood elves often ask in General Chat for the location of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Shrine of Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt;. A handful of people have recently dubbed this \"The Shrine of Mankrik's Wife\"\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Saurfang%20facts\"&gt;facts&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, one of them is \"Mankrik's wife made the mistake of telling Saurfang that Sword Specialization is superior to Axe Specialization\".\nCataclysm.\nNear the time of the Cataclysm, Mankrik finally recovered and buried his wife, ending the legend.\nSearching for \"Mankrik's Wife\" now points to the location of the &lt;a href=\"Humble%20Monument\"&gt;Humble Monument&lt;/a&gt;, but still uses the same \"THERE\" with a giant arrow pointing to the new location on the Northern Barrens map."}

When &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was placed in command of the pit lords, he recognized Mannoroth's value as a brutal, bloodthirsty fighter and made the pit lord his second-in-command. Mannoroth helped lead the Burning Legion in assaults on countless worlds, and led the first invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. His ruthlessness and vile cunning made him into one of the favored lieutenants of his masters, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He is known as \"the Destructor\" and \"the Flayer\".\nIn addition to his martial prowess, Mannoroth was a powerful spellcaster. His magical knowledge and power exceeded even the most gifted night elf sorcerers, including &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. Of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, only &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; proved superior.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", he is resurrected by in after having been slain by , and serves as the penultimate boss of Hellfire Citadel.\nMannoroth serves as the secondary antagonist in and the supporting antagonist in ' and '. \nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; failed to sufficiently strengthen the portal for &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' entrance into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, he sent &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; to guide them. But even adding his arcane knowledge and might, they were met with limited success. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; suggested they cut off the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; from outside interference, save for their own use. However, they lacked the magical expertise to make it happen and Xavius once again sought help from Sargeras. Disappointed in Hakkar's failure, Sargeras decided to send one of his most trusted commanders to assist them. As Mannoroth's monstrous form emerged from the portal, a frightened Highborne nearly collapsed in shock. Mannoroth pointed a taloned finger at the careless sorcerer and incinerated him with black flames. In a thundering voice, Mannoroth stated, \"There will be no more failure.\"\nMannoroth drew up the diagram for the shield spell and the Highborne were finally able to seal the Well's power from all but themselves, allowing them to widen and solidify the portal. In a matter of hours, hundreds of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s poured through. Mannoroth departed the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; with them to purge the unfit and crush the resistance gathering outside &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. He left Xavius in charge of maintaining the shield and strengthening the portal.\nThe night elf forces opposing the invasion had been weakened from being cut off from the Well and sent &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the shield spell. He managed to sneak into the palace using his dream form and killed Xavius before shutting down both the shield array and the portal. Mannoroth immediately felt the loss as Sargeras' presence disappeared with the portal. The &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Well restored, they turned the tide against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's&lt;/a&gt; forces and pushed them back to Zin-Azshari.\nHaving failed his master for the first time and fearing punishment, Mannoroth worked quickly with the Highborne to rebuild the portal. This time, Sargeras sent &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and Xavius\u2014reborn as a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to assist the invasion. While the majority of the Legion's forces went out to combat Azeroth's defenders and capture Malfurion, Mannoroth was left to oversee the portal.\nAt some point, he watched &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; who offered Sargeras his help. The Dark Titan burned his eyes. Archimonde used his magic to strengthen the magical barriers around the palace so that it was impossible to launch an assault on the demons' stronghold. Mannoroth single-handedly slaughtered entire regiments of Kaldorei defenders and sowed chaos by unleashing squads of doomguard across the land. During the war, Mannoroth clashed with the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nNear the end of the war, a band of night elves led by Illidan assaulted Mannoroth and Captain Varo'then on the shores of the Well. Unknown to either, this band, besides Illidan, consisted of adventurers from the far future.\nDrawing upon the power of Kalimdor from every part of nature, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; cast an incredible gale across the Well of Eternity. The night elf and demon sorcerers stabilizing the portal were swept out across the black waters. Using his incredible strength and bulk to resist the gale, Mannoroth drew upon the energy of the collapsing spellwork to create a fiery shield to protect himself. He believed himself successful and began laughing hard from his sense of superiority as 'the Flayer', 'the Destructor', and one of Sargeras' chosen. But to his dismay, it was sucked away by the strong wind. Mannoroth was last seen being cast out over the Well roaring in frustration.\nMannoroth and the orcs.\nMillenia later, in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; dispatched Mannoroth to the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The demon was first summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;'s courtyard. Describing him to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that \"Mannoroth is known for many things. Patience is not among them.\" Kil'jaeden then ordered the warlock to shed Mannoroth's blood in order to provide it to the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. One by one they drank from the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Chalice of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, falling prey to the &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt;, with some exceptions such as with &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt;. The chieftains' corruption nevertheless quickly spread to the rest of the Horde and ultimately most orcs were engulfed by a demonic bloodlust that damned them.\nHowever, after the Dark Portal was opened and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s engaged the humans over the course of two wars, they were unexpectedly defeated and routed by the humans. The orcs, and in turn, Mannoroth, had failed. Mannoroth, painfully aware of this fact, made plans to have his vengeance.\nThe Third War.\n&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, however, ignored Mannoroth's desires for vengeance, and crafted a new pawn: the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. This Scourge would succeed where the orcs had failed.\nFinally, Mannoroth was summoned by the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, into the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He was followed by &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, gloated openly that the Scourge (whom he regarded as his in the same way Mannoroth felt about the orcs) had succeeded where the orcs had failed. This only enraged Mannoroth further, and he was infuriated to discover that the orcs had left. Mannoroth and Tichondrius, in pursuit, followed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; across the sea to Kalimdor. Archimonde reminded Mannoroth, though, that the orcs could still be a useful tool to them.\nUpon arriving in Kalimdor, Mannoroth sensed the presence of Cenarius, and he worried that the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; could prove to be a nuisance in their plans. Tichondrius suggested that perhaps the orcs could be used to destroy Cenarius, for the orc who Mannoroth once corrupted years ago on Draenor, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, was here, and had incurred the wrath of the demigod.\nAt Tichondrius' suggestion, Mannoroth spilled his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; into a fountain of life, defiling it in hopes the orcs would find it and drink it. Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s, sensing the power, initially led him to the fountain, but quickly realized it was cursed, and implored Hellscream not to meddle with it. Grom and the rest of the clan were beset by Cenarius and the night elves, who were enraged by the defilement of their forests as Thrall had tasked him with gathering wood for their new settlement. As their weapons had no effect on the demi-god, Grom ignored the witch doctors' advice and drank from it with the rest of his clan. Mannoroth's blood infused the orcs with fel energy, allowing them to kill Cenarius.\nWith the demigod dead, Mannoroth appeared and took full control of Hellscream as the true invasion, the \"Legion's\" invasion, of Kalimdor began. Realizing that the remaining orcs were still a formidable force under the leadership of Thrall, Mannoroth formed a new plan to take him out.\nThrall found his former friend Grom had fallen under the sway of the Legion and vowed to save him. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and her expedition, the orc-&lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; alliance successfully defeated Hellscream's corrupted clan, captured Hellscream, and purged him of his madness. The taint, however, was still within him.\nMannoroth's defeat.\nAfter Thrall reclaimed Hellscream, Mannoroth lured them into the craters formed by the falling &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, where he hoped to kill Thrall and re-enslave Hellscream. Thrall confronted the demon lord in battle pouring all his strength and hatred for the demon into one powerful blast with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Mannoroth applauded the effort and revealed that it had caused only slight scarring of his wing. He then tossed the young warchief against a cliffside with a powerful charge, knocking him out cold and leaving only Hellscream. Mannoroth reminded Grom that he owned his body and soul and gloated that the blood curse could never be broken. \nHellscream then faced the choice between giving into the demon corruption once more or resisting and saving Thrall, and indeed his entire race. Refusing to accept that the orcs were cursed forever, he chose his kin. In a heroic last stand Grom slipped past Mannoroth's defenses and sliced open his chest.\nMannoroth was thus slain by his greatest creation and most favored pupil, Grommash Hellscream \u2014 a fitting irony, some might say. The demonic fires erupted outward, destroying the astonished Mannoroth and mortally wounding Hellscream.\nWith the death of Mannoroth, the blood curse on the orcs was finally lifted. After his defeat, &lt;a href=\"The%20Armor%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth's horned skull and armor&lt;/a&gt; were spirited to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and were attached to a large, dead and irregularly shaped tree which bears a striking resemblance to the general outline of an annihilan. However, the large double-headed spear used by the mighty pit lord remains in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, forever sundered and locked in time to show where the blood pact was ended. The remains have become a memorial to warn against consorting with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and celebrating the feat of Grommash Hellscream in finally lifting the blood curse.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Mannoroth's skull was moved above the throne of the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The ends of the tusks were added to Garrosh's armor, while the skull on Garrosh's shoulder came from a huge predator he hunted and killed himself. Mannoroth's armor was added to the throne itself.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe remains of Mannoroth are located in Orgrimmar right outside of Grommash Hold, and his weapon within the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA vision of Mannoroth appeared in the quest &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;Hero of the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; when Thrall showed young &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; a vision of his father and what he achieved.\nCataclysm.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent back in time to a pivotal moment during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. There, Mannoroth was focusing the arcane energies of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; into the Dragon Soul in order to widen the portal for &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. This activity strengthened the shield the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; had placed around the Dragon Soul, preventing &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; from retrieving it. He tasked the adventurers with killing Mannoroth so the link between the Dragon Soul and the Well would break.\nThe adventurers were assisted in their fight against Mannoroth and &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. After Varo'then was slain, Mannoroth drew more energy from the Well and summoned an onslaught of demons to help turn the battle in his favor. As the situation became dire, Illidan transformed into a dark, twisted version of himself and was able to disrupt Mannoroth's connection to the Well. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; seized the opportunity to assault the portal, causing it to violently implode. Mannoroth and the demonic Legion were pulled out of Azeroth.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAlternate Gul'dan summoned Mannoroth to and proceeded to drink his blood to gain demonic power. He then prepared a cauldron full of the pit lord's blood atop the in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, which would become known as the , and there offered it to the assembled orcish clans while Mannoroth secretly looked on. of the stepped up to take the first drink, but rejected the offering, refusing to become a slave. He revealed his awareness of the truth of Gul'dan's plot, as his clan suddenly attacked Gul'dan and Mannoroth. In the battle that followed, Mannoroth was blasted by an &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; before ultimately meeting his end when Grommash plunged &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; into his skull.\nMannoroth was later resurrected by alternate Gul'dan and served as the penultimate boss of . Gul'dan first put his soul back into his skeleton, later reconstituting his body anew and empowering him, so he wouldn't have to spend too much time in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; reforming a body. He was still slain once again.\nIn the RPG.\nMannoroth crafted &lt;a href=\"Spite\"&gt;Spite&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nMannoroth was a simple being with no overriding ambition to change his station in life. Craving blood and carnage over everything else, he willingly acted as an enforcer for Archimonde and the Burning Legion. His only desire was to wage an unending war against the mortal races of the universe. He was a terribly efficient weapon of destruction for the demonlords and could always be found at the forefront of their invasion forces. Mannoroth had forever been cursed with an immeasurable, unending thirst for blood. Even the bloodlust of the orcs was a minor compulsion compared to the absolute addiction that bloodletting was for Mannoroth. In the absence of mortals to fight, Mannoroth often turned on his own demon kin, slaying felhounds and infernals with an unnerving sense of satisfaction. He preferred the kill to the chase, and would quickly slay mortals who were unfortunate enough to stumble upon him. Mannoroth sought out the most concentrated area of foes and wades into battle. He was not happy unless he was spilling the entrails of his enemies at his feet. When a victim fell, he usually spent an extra attack or two on the victim making sure the target was quite dead. This could be quite messy, which was exactly how Mannoroth liked it. In fact, he could get a bit reckless if foes were not dropping to his massive two-bladed sword at least every attack.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Cairne tried to the stop the attack, but &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tula\"&gt;Captain Tula&lt;/a&gt;--agreeing with Garrosh's order and seeing it as an opportunity to get materials for her own damaged vessel--pointed out that Cairne was only in charge of the evacuation and not the military forces, who were commanded by Garrosh. The Horde easily captured the Alliance ship, and after the battle the eleven Alliance survivors were given skiffs and told by Garrosh to tell others what happened as an example of his \"mercy\"."}

The battle begins against a set of channelers and their minions as Mannoroth is nothing more than a heap of bones on the ground, and concludes with a final battle against the fully empowered Mannoroth.\"\nOverview.\nPlayers initially face a set of Fel Iron Summoners that call servants of the Legion into Draenor. After their defeat, Gul'dan resurrects Mannoroth. When Mannoroth reaches 65% and 30% health, Gul'dan overcharges the Fel Spires to further empower the pit lord.

Though both &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; have fought bravely thus far, the fate of Azeroth will be decided at the Well of Eternity's very brink.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Dealing with the Rabble.\nPlayers must defeat Captain Varo'then while Illidan and Tyrande fight off Mannoroth and the demonic forces entering from the Well of Eternity.\nStage Two: Flames and Darkness.\nAfter the players defeat Captain Varo'then, his enchanted Magistrike Blade lies on the ground. After a player throws and embeds the blade into Mannoroth, the demon begins to take massive damage from the stored magic within the blade.\nMalfurion Stormrage.\nUtilizing the powers of nature bestowed upon him by the demigod Cenarius, Malfurion Stormrage focuses the will of the living creatures of Azeroth upon the demonic portal hovering over the Well of Eternity. When Mannoroth reaches 25% remaining health, Malfurion casts a spell to cause the portal to violently implode and pull the demonic legions out of Azeroth.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nLet Illidan tank Mannoroth.\nThe players should engage Varo'then. The Magistrike appears as red chain lightning. The chain range appears to be quite large, so spreading out is futile. During Fel Firestorm the players can either run out of fire (like the &lt;a href=\"Argaloth\"&gt;Argaloth&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt;) or group up near Illidan to take advantage of his Waters of Eternity aura.\nThe Doomguard Devastators are of no concern most of the time because Tyrande is 1-shotting them.\nPhase 2.\nTwo Dreadlord Debilitators come through the portal and incapacitate Tyrande. Players should move into the moon beam that appears on Tyrande for a massive damage buff. Ranged should burn down the Dreadlord Debilitators to rescue Tyrande while the melee mow down the lesser demons.\nPhase 3.\nOnce the party has defeated Varo'then, &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then%27s%20Magical%20Blade\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; drops and becomes clickable. A party member should click it, which throws it at Mannoroth, embedding it in him, causing hits on him to sometimes inflict Magistrike.\nAttack Mannoroth. As long as Tyrande is 1-shotting demons DPS don't need to care about them. If demons do start attacking the healer, bring them to the tank so she can AoE and aggro them.\nPhase 4.\nIllidan casts Gift of Sargeras, buffing himself and the party, making it quicker to defeat Mannoroth. It is not yet clear if this is triggered by time or by boss health."}

Under the roots of the great &lt;a href=\"kypari\"&gt;kypari&lt;/a&gt; trees, these aqir, known thereafter as &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, established a new empire. They saw no purpose in continuing a battle they knew they were not strong enough to win. They believed that the best way to serve the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, whom they still fervently worshipped, was to conserve and refine the mantid's strength rather than expending it. While a revered empress ruled over the mantid's day-to-day activities, a council known as the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; controlled the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s' destiny. Rather than seek retribution on the trolls, the Klaxxi turned their gaze eastward to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; guardians.\nThe mantid found themselves drawn to the Vale; though they did not know it at the time, they were in fact drawn to the lingering essence of the deceased Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; had been sealed below the valley by the mogu and their former master, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;. To seek out this dark essence, the Klaxxi launched a surprise attack on the mogu, who narrowly withstood the swarm and drove the insectoids back to the kypari forests. The Klaxxi did not consider the defeat a failure, for their surviving warriors had matured and grown more powerful and cunning. They patiently waited one hundred years before launching another assault. Once again, the survivors returned stronger, and so the mantid cycle began. Every century, a new clutch made war on the mogu, culling the weak and allowing only the strongest mantid to return to the kypari. Within only a few cycles, mantid society had become tightly honed and rigid. The mogu marked the change with concern and launched a campaign into Manti'vess itself to ensure the permanent end of the cycle. The attack came decades before the next clutch of warriors would hatch, and the mogu initially devastated the mantid ranks, until a single warrior by the name of &lt;a href=\"Korven%20the%20Prime\"&gt;Korven&lt;/a&gt; turned the tide of battle, driving the mogu back and sending them into a retreat. The Klaxxi elders proclaimed Korven a \"&lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;\" and promised that his deeds would become legend, but Korven was not satisfied, as he knew that it was only by chance that he had arisen in his race's hour of need. Thus, after years of experimenting with kypari sap, Korven devised a way to preserve a living creature in amber, potentially for thousands of years, allowing them to be reawakened by the Klaxxi should the need arise. Korven, named \"the Prime\" by the Klaxxi, was the first to be preserved, the first of many paragons, and the cycle he had almost single-handedly saved continued unbroken for generations.\nSpeculation.\nManti'vess is very likely the original name of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, as both fit the role of the mantid capital and the location of Manti'vess on the matches the location of the Heart of Fear in modern-day Pandaria. This term is never used for it, only variations of \"Shek'zeer's palace\"."}

The mantid forced the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; out of their homeland &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and devour everything in their path in order to build their own crystalline empire of ruthless warriors and scheming feudal lords.\nWhen Pandaria was found by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; were left reeling when the mantid's hundred-year cycle of aggression kicked off a decade too early and their greatest warriors burst through the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. The beleaguered pandaren fought off the worst swarm in recorded history with the aid of the newly-arrived Alliance and Horde. While trying to isolate the cause of the mantid's erratic behavior, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; and many of her mantid were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, and with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were able to defeat her.\nFollowing the resurrection of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the Klaxxi allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;s took up guard beneath &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to protect the heart of their dark former god, but were ultimately defeated during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zara\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zara&lt;/a&gt; has ascended the throne. With the awakening of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, she pledged her swarm to the Old God's will. In service of her dark master, she unleashed her forces upon the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; to claim Pandaria in N'Zoth's name.\nBiology and culture.\nThe mantid are an intelligent and highly evolved race of insect-like creatures who have menaced the people of Pandaria since prehistoric times. While their society has a queen, they don't operate as a hive mind. They are sentient beings, capable of constructing tall buildings and mastering weapons.\nMantid act with individual cunning, making them formidable in single combat and unstoppable when their numbers converge. Every mantid generation, the young hatch in incredible numbers and then swarm toward the rest of Pandaria, devouring anything in their path. Only the strongest return. Although the ancient &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; managed to protect their lands by building &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;a gigantic wall&lt;/a&gt; between themselves and the mantid, the generational swarms require an all-hands defense of the wall or the very heart of Pandaria will be lost.\nThe mantid have poison that chews through the skin and infects the blood. It makes for slow, excruciating death when not treated.\nNewly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature. Those hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on their enemies instead.\nKypari trees and amber.\n&lt;a href=\"Amber\"&gt;Amber&lt;/a&gt; is the cornerstone of mantid society. Harvested from the great &lt;a href=\"kypari\"&gt;kypari&lt;/a&gt; amber trees, they use this material in their architecture, their art, and their technology. Amber is fashioned by ambersmiths into sharpened blades and weapons. Some &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; among the mantid are even preserved in amber for a time in need.\nThe empress and her council of Klaxxi safeguard the great trees of &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; - known as the \"&lt;a href=\"kypari\"&gt;kypari&lt;/a&gt;\" - as the only source of their precious amber. Legend has it that the kypari once flourished east of the wall, but the mogu cut them all down in their never-ending war against the mantid swarm. The mantid prefer to age Kypari sap before consumption, and use &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Sap%20Feeder\"&gt;special devices&lt;/a&gt; for the process. The design has not changed much over time.\nThe kypari trees are sacred to the mantid and are regarded as living shrines steeped in their culture. They are the foundation of mantid society. Each tree carries with it a name bestowed upon it by the mantid. The mantid who live at that tree, be it in the roots, in the branches, in the nooks and crannies, share a name with that tree.\nSociety.\nMantid society is organized by caste.\nMantid assaults on the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; are a terrible thing to experience, both as a defender, and as a mantid. Only the smartest, strongest, or most agile of the mantid survive this encounter, and pandaren defenders are slaughtered outright in terrible numbers.\nMantid survivors make their way back to the great tress, often bearing trophies of their conquests. There, they are welcomed back into the mantid society and take their place among their civilization according to the level of their deeds. With each cycle, the mantid grow stronger. Those who travel beyond the wall are forewarned: any mantid you encounter beyond the wall is a hardened veteran, to be feared and respected.\nMantid are born with little on their mind but a lust for battle. Participation in a swarm is not only a cultural rite of passage - it is the catalyst for their physical maturation. Only those who return from battle can develop from a swarmborn into a fully-aware, individual citizen. Most mantid shed their wings as a rite of passage once they grow strong enough to wield heavy armor and weapons.\nThe mantid view other races such as pandaren as \"lesser creatures\", and take pleasure in slaughtering them by the thousand. However, they do not consider these lesser creatures to be entirely without purpose, nor is their defeat the mantid's true aim. Rather, the mantid make use of their enemies' defenses to cull the weak from their numbers and hone the skills of the strong. As the mantid say: \"Battle is an efficient mentor.\" The purpose of the cycle is not death. It is knowledge.\nWhile the mantid do use &lt;a href=\"Windwool%20Cloth\"&gt;windwool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Silk\"&gt;imperial silk&lt;/a&gt;, their preferred material is a type of \"fabric\" fashioned from the wings of various &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; creatures - including themselves.\nThe empress.\nThe empress of the mantid is a force to be feared throughout Pandaria. From her, the nearly endless hosts of the mantid are spawned. The empress sings to her swarm, giving them purpose, her words filling their minds. Her desires are their desires, and they do not hesitate to obey.\nThe mantid empress gives orders and direction to her swarm from a distance, speaking directly into their minds. She appears to communicate with them through some form of sound, although one that is apparently inaudible to other races. Her communication can be blocked through sufficient disruption of the sound of this kind.\nThough mantid empresses are long-lived, they are not immortal. A council of mantid elders, known as the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, see to the organized transfer of power from one empress to the next. The exact nature of the exchange is extremely secretive, but it appears to involve a trial by combat, with empresses traditionally displaced in their old age by a carefully chosen successor. Remains of the previous empress are fed to her successor. For this reason, the unbroken line of power has extended throughout the entire history of the mantid civilization. Though few in number, the Klaxxi evidently play a pivotal role in shaping and protecting mantid culture. It is unclear if they can directly countermand the will of the empress, however.\nYoung mantid \"swarmborn\" are extremely dependent on the voice of the empress. Without her constant communication, they are left in a fugue, milling aimlessly around, and will not even act to defend themselves or their empress. Indeed, the swarmborn are unable even to recognize the empress without her voice speaking from within their minds.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Vizier%20Zor%27lok\"&gt;Imperial Vizier Zor'lok&lt;/a&gt; is the Voice of the Empress, and his words alone inspire the insectoid race's warriors to give their lives without question.\nWeaponry.\nMantid weaponry is characterized by large, curving blades of honed amber. Ideal for slicing, these weapons are lightweight and no less durable than those forged from metal. The sword techniques of the mantid are a carefully-guarded secret.\nCompared to their &lt;a href=\"Aqir\"&gt;Aqir&lt;/a&gt; brethren, the mantid are quite adept at using technology to turn the tide of battle, and several &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s, saboteurs and &lt;a href=\"bombardier\"&gt;bombardier&lt;/a&gt;s can be found among their ranks. They also use &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"war%20wagon\"&gt;war wagon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nKunchong.\nThe cycle of mantid birthing and building revolves around the &lt;a href=\"kunchong\"&gt;kunchong&lt;/a&gt;, a colossal insect large enough to threaten whole towns by itself. The mantid revere this enormous creature, and when instinct compels it to stampede throughout the continent, eating earth, trees, and lakes, they follow behind, collecting the amber-colored resin it secretes, birthing their young and creating their homes in its wake. If other races\u2019 homes are trampled by the kunchong, it is of little consequence to the mantid. Where the kunchong's shadow falls, they walk. Where they walk, the land is transformed.\nMany of the more mundane pieces of mantid furniture, though amber in color, are actually made from kunchong secretions.\nSound.\nMantid can generate and hear sounds from a much broader spectrum than those available to the other mortal races. Their innate understanding of extremely high and low frequencies allows mantid to create weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Pulse%20Generator\"&gt;Sonic Pulse Generator&lt;/a&gt;. The sonic pulses delivered from this apparatus can actually tear muscle and organs apart at the cellular level; direct hits can liquefy one\u2019s innards.\nMasters of sound, the mantid long ago found a way to use amber to extend the range of their acoustic casting. In this way, they are able to communicate over vast distances. No army has successfully marched on mantid lands undetected, and even lone travelers are urged caution as their movements are no doubt being watched the moment they venture beyond the wall. The technology behind mantid sound beacons is incomprehensible for non-mantid races. They seem to rely on mantid physiology."}

Although the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s thought the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s were all that was left of the split empire, there was another colony that lived farther south. They worshiped an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; with seven heads named &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, who was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s upon their arrival, as their creator. Indeed, the word \"&lt;a href=\"klaxxi\"&gt;klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;\" meant \"priest\" in the old tongue. &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Y'Shaarj's shadows&lt;/a&gt; haunt &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to this day, and the mantid swear that if it ever returns they will ally with &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;its army&lt;/a&gt; instead of with the other mortal races of the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; are the mantid homeland. From here, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; commanded a seemingly endless swarm of mantid. They hurl themselves against the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall, nearly overwhelming the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; defenders. Historically, the mantid have swarmed in regular and predictable intervals. Mantid assaults on the Serpent's Spine are a terrible thing to experience, both as a defender, and as a mantid. Only the smartest, strongest, or most agile of the mantid survive this encounter, and pandaren defenders are slaughtered outright in terrible numbers. Mantid survivors make their way back to the great tress, often bearing trophies of their conquests. There, they are welcomed back into the mantid society, and take their place among their civilization according to the level of their deeds. With each generation and each cycle, the mantid grow stronger.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe recent swarm is about ten years too soon, and the pandaren are caught off-guard. It's not that the Empress is getting more strategic; in fact, her whole society is in the middle of an upheaval. Shek'zeer has been overwhelmed and possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, and she's running her empire into the ground. At her command, the mantid are embracing the sha, willfully corrupting themselves, their sacred trees, and the entire ecology of their land. Blind fear has driven the empress onto a warpath and it's tearing her civilization apart.\nA council of mantid elders known as the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; are the stewards of mantid history and culture, and their goals are much more long-term than those of the empress. They recognize that the empress has lost her mind, and that swarming Pandaria will mean little if their entire civilization is given over to the sha in the process. The Klaxxi have now declared that their beloved empress must be put down. The Klaxxi do not have an army to fight back the swarm, but they do have access to the &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;s, warriors of ancient mantid eras preserved in amber who are buried all over the Dread Wastes. These powerful champions, ingenious alchemists, and deadly assassins, preserved at the height of their abilities, must now be awoken if the corrupted empress is to be defeated.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the rise of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zara\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zara&lt;/a&gt; as the new Grand Empress, she mobilized most of her forces to search for &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison Shek'zara allied the mantid with him, and they made regular raids with a new swarm into the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; would learn that the new swarm developed a concentrated royal jelly that accelerates the growth of newly hatched mantid."}

Tyr asked the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s for aid, and the war ended with &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; putting the Winterskorn into a timeless sleep beneath &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was first mentioned as the first war between the earthen and the iron dwarves, where only a few facts were known, such as the participation of &lt;a href=\"Urel%20Stoneheart\"&gt;Urel Stoneheart&lt;/a&gt;, the first king of the earthen, and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Val%27anyr%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Tenuous Peace.\nFor many ages after Loken's betrayal, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; who were exiled from Ulduar spread across northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The lumbering giants gradually trickled into the mountains and seas around the region, disappearing from sight. The &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; tunneled into the deep places of the world, where they fought for dominance against a race of brutish and misshapen creatures known as &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; remained aboveground, congregating into small clans. Some of these factions wandered the harsh northern landscape as nomads. Others established dwellings across the forested tundra of the region.\nA tenuous peace existed between these groups of titan-forged, but it could not last. In time, malign forces moved to assert dominion over the lands once protected by the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s. Among these forces were two of Loken's own creations, the brutish &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt;. Both saw the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Ulduar as a land ripe for conquest; however, they were aware that they needed an army, and to this end the fire giants turned towards the fierce &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; of vrykul.\nAfter taking control of the clan by force the fire giants were quick to strike the fires of their battle lust, while forging armor and weapons for the army designed to work against the other titan-forged.\nThe Winterskorn Invasion.\nHowever just as the new army was to embark on its great conquest, the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; struck. Seeing their forces succumb to it did not deter Volkhan and Ignis from their goal, but both were aware that they could no longer rely on the Winterskorn alone to achieve victory. To strengthen their army Volkhan and Ignis molded powerful molten golems and iron constructs of their own design. This massive Winterskorn army marched first against the good-natured earthen, storming their underground lairs. The earthen were utterly unprepared to face such an overwhelming and organized force. Entire caverns were massacred to the last living creature.\nA small group of survivors escaped the onslaught and sought the help of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;, who had thus far eluded Loken's wrath. Incensed by what they learned, Tyr and his companions immediately journeyed to the earthen's cavernous home to aid the beleaguered titan-forged. Tyr himself led the bravest of the earthen in skirmishes with the Winterskorn, while Archaedas and Ironaya constructed defenses to ward off future attacks. In time, the earthen and their allies drove back the Winterskorn.\nAlthough their attempts to conquer the Storm Peaks failed, Volkhan and Ignis did not concede defeat. They returned to their blistering forges and created a new army - one even greater than before. Not satisfied with golems and constructs alone, Volkhan and Ignis crafted enchanted snares with which to enslave entire flights of &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. These creatures would serve not as mounts, but as beasts of war. The giants outfitted their winged servants with fiery weapons to strike terror into the hearts of the earthen. The Winterskorn's next brutal assault shattered the earthen's defenses and drove them from their refuge. The earthen scattered across the icy mountain passes, but they could not escape their foes. Vrykul and golems hunted the earthen on the ground, while proto-dragons assailed them from the skies. Even Tyr, Archaedas, and Ironaya were forced to flee from the Winterskorn's fury.\nDragon's Fury.\nKnowing that he and his allies could not defeat the Winterskorn alone, Tyr called on the five &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; for help. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead titan-forged. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn's iron ranks.\nMuch as they had done in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the aspects worked in unison to overwhelm the vrykul army. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in tomb cities across northern Kalimdor. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\nLegacy.\nWith the Winterskorn defeated, Keeper Tyr at long last turned his attention to Loken. So long as Ulduar remained sealed off and the titan-forged were divided, more conflicts would arise. Tyr grimly concluded that unless he took action against Loken, Azeroth would spiral into an abyss of war and chaos. Tyr and his allies would bid their time and hatch a daring plan to steal the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Loken in the hopes that studying the recording within (which included Loken's actions) would allow them to beat fallen Keeper. They eventually were able to pull off a daring plan and acquire the Discs, though valiant Tyr would lose his life against Loken's &lt;a href=\"Zakajz\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;sent to&lt;/a&gt; retrieve the discs.\nMeanwhile, the slumbering Winterskorn would continue to be warped by the Curse of Flesh. &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;When they eventually awoke&lt;/a&gt;, almost every one of them would discover they had degenerated into mortal creatures of flesh and blood."}

Many wild creatures roam this beautiful landscape.\nHistory.\nLong ago, Winterspring was a home for many &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt;.\n10,000 years ago, the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt; was located here. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; who inhabited the city stole the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;:Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, but when they toyed with its tempting power its shattering cursed them all. Kel'Theril suffered until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; destroyed it for good, and now the dead wander as ghosts.\nOne hundred years before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and traveled to Winterspring in order to obtain the crystal. Like their Highborne ancestors, the high elves were cursed by the crystal's power.\nThird War.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance remnants&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the night elven &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ancients\"&gt;corrupted satyrs&lt;/a&gt; made camps here. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; destroyed a human camp and the satyrs and awakened the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;druids of talon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Dens%20%28Winterspring%29\"&gt;Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, a &lt;a href=\"death%20revenant\"&gt;death revenant&lt;/a&gt; cursed a glade, raising &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. Tyrande, Malfurion, and the Sentinels defeated him and recovered the glade.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Invasions%20%28Classic%29%E2%80%8E\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; the area only to be fought by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Winterspring was invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe area was also &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; twice by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the years leading to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nOne year before the Cataclysm, the blood elves sought the Crystal of Zin-Malor as their ancestors had. They were cursed and became &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt;.\nA hunting party has set up camp in the northern foothills, and the bridge to &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; has been destroyed.\nGetting there.\nWinterspring can be accessed through &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;. To reach Winterspring, head through the hold entrance in the northeastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and continue straight after the bridge. It used to be that, in order to pass through the hold without the Timbermaw Furbolgs attacking you, you would need to have reached at least unfriendly reputation with the Timbermaw &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. There are several quests in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; which can be completed to raise reputation with them. This is no longer necessary and Timbermaw mobs are unfriendly but will not attack.\nGeography.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; have established bases in the region. Though there are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in Winterspring, there are several &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the area.\nQuests.\nQuests in Winterspring mostly revolve around hunting the local wildlife or investigating the sources of madness plaguing them. Throughout their progression through the zone, players go from fighting the &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfall tribe&lt;/a&gt; at the request of &lt;a href=\"Donova%20Snowden\"&gt;Donova Snowden&lt;/a&gt;, to studying &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; spirits at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Lake Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt;, to game hunting from &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Goodgrub%20Smoking%20Pit\"&gt;Goodgrub Smoking Pit&lt;/a&gt;, to helping the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; exiles at &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; reclaim their home.\nIn the RPG.\nWinterspring (also known as Winterspring Valley or Winterspring Grove) is a frozen land covered in snow similar to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. While most &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; find the land less hospitable than the nearby forests, a number of elves reside there for two main reasons: first, it is in close proximity to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;; and second, its mysterious hot springs may be connected to &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; activity. Winterspring's perpetual cold is natural enough, and it is the closest area to Mount Hyjal's summit. This valley has long been involved in a struggle between malevolent &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and the fearsome white &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt; cats.\nHome of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and filthy &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;, there's a lot to be done in this frozen tundra.\nHistory.\nThe ancient ruins in Winterspring are evidence of the scars left by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Once hinterlands, the entire eastern expanse was ripped away during the Sundering, leaving a sprawling coastline.\nThousands of years ago, this valley upon the slopes of Mount Hyjal served as a place for the night elves to start anew in the wake of the Sundering. It was also here, long ago, that &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; took up residence to watch over neighboring Hyjal and the nearby &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; keeps its vigil here, whereas most of the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s have moved to the base of the World Tree or other locations. The recent success of &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt; has brought more adventurers into Winterspring, which the natives hope will aid them in defeating the threat of the demons of &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis otherwise cold and serene place shakes with periodic conflict between the forces of the sorcerer-dragon &lt;a href=\"General%20Colbatann\"&gt;Cobaltann&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves who strive to drive them from the slopes of Mount Hyjal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of Everlook recently discovered a new mine to the south of their city, not far from the dragon caves of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;. This mine is valuable due to a large amount of &lt;a href=\"arcanite\"&gt;arcanite&lt;/a&gt; within it, but thus far it proves inaccessible. While not part of the blue dragon's cave complex, the dragons are territorial, and so the goblins are looking for a hero that can find a way to convince the blue dragonflight to allow them access to the mine, in exchange of a nice reward of course.\nGeography.\nWinterspring lies to the east of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, and to the northeast of &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest access to any of these locations on foot is through the caves of the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, although Everlook offers flying mounts that travel to Felwood or Moonglade \u2014 for a price.\nWinterspring Valley is above &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; and is the last stop along the road that winds up to Hyjal Peak. The valley is separated from Moonglade, lower on the mountain slope, by a thick, white cloud bank. Once above the clouds, the air is crisp and clean and the sun shines often when the snow is not falling.

It is a cold land perpetually covered in snow and holds the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt;, old &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; holdings, and the traditional homeland of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Many wild creatures roam the beautiful landscape. However, the southern parts of the region have been completely taken over by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThousands of years ago, this valley upon the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; served as a place for the night elves to start anew in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. A realm of near-perpetual winter, the valley has long been involved in a struggle between malevolent &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and the fearsome white &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt; cats.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Reign of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; the valley was in a rare period of springtime or summer with no snow to be seen anywhere.\nGetting there.\nWinterspring can be accessed through &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;. To reach Winterspring, head through the hold entrance in the northeastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and continue straight after the bridge. In order to pass through the hold without the Timbermaw Furbolgs attacking you, you will need to have reached at least unfriendly reputation with the Timbermaw &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. There are several quests in &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; which can be completed to raise reputation with them.\nGeography.\nWinterspring Valley is above &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; and is the last stop along the road that winds up to Hyjal Peak. The valley is separated from &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, lower on the mountain slope, by a thick, white cloud bank. Winterspring is a cold realm consistently covered with snow and frost. Once above the clouds, the air is crisp and clean and the sun shines often when the snow is not falling. The trees of Winterspring were bent and twisted into odd positions during the climactic &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the World Tree's massive roots are also exposed here, towering overhead like massive oak archways. This otherwise cold and serene place shakes with periodic conflict between the forces of the sorcerer-dragon &lt;a href=\"General%20Colbatann\"&gt;Cobaltann&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves who strive to drive them from the slopes of Mount Hyjal. Snow cats, bears, and other creatures of the wild are seen here on occasion, but only rarely due to the high altitude. It is a place of cold medium forest and rugged mountains.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; have established bases in the region. Though there are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in Winterspring, there are several &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the area.\nNotable characters.\nWinterspring is home to several characters of note. At the Frostfire Hot Springs, &lt;a href=\"Donova%20Snowden\"&gt;Donova Snowden&lt;/a&gt; attempts to find out more about the taint that has affected the local furbolgs. On Frostsaber Rock, &lt;a href=\"Rivern%20Frostwind\"&gt;Rivern Frostwind&lt;/a&gt; enlists aid in providing food and safety for his pets in exchange for the secret to tame them. And high above Mazthoril, the matron protector &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the deepest lairs of the black dragonflight in search of draconic artifacts of power."}

{"id": "14666", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14666", "title": "Wipe", "text": "Wipe is short for wipeout, meaning a situation where the entire party or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; is killed. Sometimes referred to in other games as a \"TPK\" (Total Party Kill) or \"TPW\" (Total Party Wipe). Wipes can occur for many reasons \u2014 a bad &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt;, a group member failing to do their job, unexpected &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g., from a &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"runner\"&gt;runner&lt;/a&gt;), etc. The term is rarely, if ever, used in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nWiping is actually a central element of the &lt;a href=\"endgame\"&gt;endgame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; content. As described in &lt;a href=\"Raiding%20for%20newbies\"&gt;Raiding for newbies&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; mobs in the raid instances are very hard, and only very rarely will one of them be defeated on the very first pull. Normally, bosses have to be \"learned\" by the raid, which involves many wipes. Some bosses remain difficult even after they have been killed a few times, other bosses quickly gain \"&lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;\" status, which means they can be killed by that raid with little effort.\nWhen a group wipes in an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; and they want to continue adventuring in the instance, the group has to walk back as &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s to the beginning of the instance and resurrect, then traverse the instance to where they wiped. However, this is very time-consuming, and (especially in endgame instances) some &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s may have a short &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20Time\"&gt;respawn time&lt;/a&gt;, thus the group may be forced to re-fight the way back to where they were before. Occasionally when something like this happens, groups will fall apart, especially in &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;pickup group&lt;/a&gt; raids. Fortunately some classes have &lt;a href=\"wipe%20recovery\"&gt;wipe recovery&lt;/a&gt; abilities which can significantly reduce the tedium associated with wiping, such as a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; ability, although more experienced groups will often prefer to use these during combat to increase their chances of success rather than mitigating the consequences of failure."}

Although they do drop Sha Residue, like the trash before the boss, so trying to kill the adds away from the group is advised. Once you have killed four Living Waters, Mari will unshield himself and begin casting Hydrolance, which will cause him to slowly spin, dealing massive damage to anyone in front of him. Move around in a clockwise circle to avoid getting hit by Hydrolance, and begin DPSing him, being sure again to stand only on the dry sections of floor around him. "}

They are actually the disembodied spirits of deceased &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who have become one with the forest, though their minds and the way they perceive things is very different than in life.\nDescription.\nUpon death, the souls of most night elves are brought to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; like any other mortal race. However, some instead linger in the mortal realm as wisps. &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; considers wisps to be a type of &lt;a href=\"%3Asoulshape\"&gt;:soulshape&lt;/a&gt; and believes that their existence is the result of the soul's intrinsic bond with their home forests creating a tether that allows them to remain among the living. However, he cannot entirely rule out the interference of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nWisps exist in tight connection with their forest homeland and night elves in general, performing such beneficial activities as construction, repair and defense of elven communities. The wisps act in unison with the night elves and serve to strengthen the demigod-like trees known as the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s. Beckoned by the night elves, wisps are capable of animating various trees and expanding themselves into rough-hewn structures of living wood and stone. In ', wisps can gather resources for night elf forces without destroying &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s and have the power to detonate, causing a backlash of mana. They are capable of navigating the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20world\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt; much faster than normal spirits.\nWisps are mostly silent except for a low humming sound. Oddly enough, some are able to communicate with mortals through thoughts. Some wisps have the extraordinary ability to encourage the rapid maturation of saplings into trees.\nWhile wisps are generally friendly in demeanor, they can cause small stings when making physical contact with those they don't like. When truly angered, they can burn people to nothing but charred skeletons or merely ash in just a few moments.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, thousands of wisps, known as Ancestral Spirits, gathered at the call of the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and sacrificed themselves to destroy the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and save the world, so there are fewer wisps today than there once were.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the spirits of the dead inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; were coaxed from their bodies and appears as wisps.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the wisps summoned by &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;G'Hanir, the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; summoned a wall of wisps to try and slow down the invading Horde forces, destroying some of their number and delaying them considerably for a while, though the Horde was ultimately able to break through their defenses.\nIn the RPG.\nWisps are mysterious \"forest spirits\" of unknown origin. Wisps are forest spirits that heal ancients and keep the forest clean and pure. They are dedicated to the well-being of night elf forests. They are connected to the forest on a supernatural level rivaling that of Cenarius' children; indeed, many believe that wisps often evolve into mighty ancient protectors and other creatures. Wisps play a major role in night elf life by creating and repairing their wooden structures. In addition to healing living wood with their mere touch, they can detonate themselves to banish or kill summoned monsters (such as any outsider, elemental, or several kinds of undead). Wisps show little intelligence, free will or self-interest. They appear to exist purely to serve the will of the night elves. Whether this is reality or whether they serve the night elf leadership out of some personal agenda or sense of duty is unclear at this time. A tremendous number of wisps were destroyed at the end of the Third War in Malfurion\u2019s gamble to destroy Archimonde. As a result, they are nowhere near as numerous as before the Third War, but nevertheless, they play an integral part in the lives of all night elves. Some human scholars think that wisps are the souls of deceased night elves, but these claims have yet to be proven and are met with near mockery among the night elves. The glowing ball of light hovers a few feet off the ground. Within the eldritch glow, inside can be seen the translucent features of an elven face.\nWisps avoid combat and will flee when attacked if they can. Instead, they follow night elf orders, which usually means they act as support troops, healing ancients and repairing night elf structures. They detonate if ordered to do so, or if they cannot flee. If pressed, they slam into mortal foes or detonate themselves to destroy or banish outsiders or undead. A wisp may sacrifice itself to seed an ancient. It takes decades for the ancient to grow to maturity and centuries before it reaches its full potential. Wisps have the ability to safely extract wood from a tree without damaging or harming the plant. This is a slow process, but over the course of a day, a single wisp can produce about 20 pounds of lumber from a large tree. Wisps have the capability to mold wood into nearly any form. A wisp can change the shape of up to a 5-foot cube of wood, shifting the wood\u2019s dimensions at will. This potent ability allows wisps to swiftly create structures for the night elves. A wisp can sacrifice itself. Creatures within 30 feet suffer the simultaneous effects of the spell's banishment, &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and mana burn. A wisp may heal an ancient, plant or wooden structure. The wisp must touch the plant or structure, to heal it.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This gathers 5 lumber at a time, and wisps do not need to return to a nearby lumber drop-off point. This means a wisp can be placed anywhere on the map as long as a tree is nearby, allowing players to track enemies that are unaware of their presence. However, most Night Elf players tend to get a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shredder%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Goblin Shredder&lt;/a&gt; if possible, since games typically end early and the gold and food used for wisps could be used elsewhere.\nWisps build in a manner similar to &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peon&lt;/a&gt;s; from the inside, so they are safe from attacks while constructing buildings. However, when they build any Ancient (or Tree of Life), the Wisp is consumed in the creation of the said building. If the player cancels the construction of the building however, then the wisp will be returned.\nSpells and abilities.\nather.\nNotes:\nCreate uilding.\nWisps are consumed when creating Ancients (all of the trees) but not when creating a normal structure such as a Hunter's Hall, Moon Well, Altar of Elders and Chimaera Roost.\netonate.\nNotes: Detonate not drains mana from invulnerable units. The dispelling effect still affects invulnerable units.\nDetonate is targeted on a location rather than an enemy unit so make sure you adjust where you want the Wisp to Detonate if the enemy moves after you target it. Detonate should only be used up close because attempting to use it from a distance will often result in the Wisp getting destroyed before it will do so.\nDetonate is generally not useful in many cases, because of how weak the spell fairly is. It's only useful in early game when the enemy rushes your base. If they do so, Detonate any Wisps the enemy may target. Wisps give experience, and detonating them prevents them from gaining that experience. Detonate is fairly effective against most enemy Heroes because they will generally lack a means of mana regeneration, which could cause them trouble when they attempt to creep the map.\nDon't detonate too many Wisps at once, because this will just destroy your gold as you attempt to train more Wisps to start collecting lumber again. Only use Detonate if the Wisp is about to be destroyed and you have no way of saving it.\nReign of Chaos differences.\nIn , Wisps have a movement speed of 220."}

They are led by the &lt;a href=\"matron\"&gt;matron&lt;/a&gt;s. The death magic they wield has contorted their bodies. When a witch grows powerful enough, they slit their own throats to &lt;a href=\"Drustvar%20hag\"&gt;ascend&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWitchcraft has long been in the superstitions of the people of Drustvar, but it is only recently that some of those superstitions have become reality. In Drustvar folklore, there are several beliefs about witches. The townsfolk have several ways to identify a woman as a witch. Some believe that a witch's stomach is full of dark spirits and that they thus can never get sick and puke. Others believe that witches are immune to fire, that they never cry, or that &lt;a href=\"Bloodfly\"&gt;bloodflies&lt;/a&gt; don't bite witches because their blood is vile. Some say that a witch always floats, they never sink in water, even when tied to heavy objects.\nThe wave of witchcraft that recently fell over Drustvar was begun by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, wife of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lord Arthur Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. When she called out to any power that could save her ill and dying husband, the ancient Drust king &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; answered, and promised that death would never part the couple, for a price. Having both been turned into undead beings, Lady Waycrest formed the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; of witches and became their \"Mother\". \n&lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;emissaries&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; re-founded the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to combat the threat of the coven. Through their efforts, they discovered in an ancient Order of Embers tome that witches were vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemical fire&lt;/a&gt;. After a long campaign, both Lord and Lady Waycrest were killed by the Order of Embers' Inquisitors.\nPowers and abilities.\nWitches possess a wide range of abilities that make them dangerous, such as the ability to disguise themselves as normal humans. They can also control or corrupt living beings, both local wild life and even humans. They can also corrupt harvest resources such as grain. Those enslaved by their magic are recognizable by the blue-ish glow from their eyes. While it can be possible to release them, usually by breaking the fetish that keeps them under their spell, sometimes they can be too far gone, in which case the only solution is death.\nWitches can use the spirits of the deceased to power &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker creatures&lt;/a&gt;, or create &lt;a href=\"Effigy\"&gt;effigies&lt;/a&gt; that can turn humans into pigs or freeze subjects into place. Witches are also able to summon spiders en masse.\nWitches are still present in Drustvar during the events on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and a Kul Tiran garrison fights against them."}

Troll witch doctors utilize &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"juju\"&gt;juju&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. Some witch doctors carve their names into &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Staff\"&gt;ancestral staves&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroll.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; witch doctors set about casting hexes and curses against the infamous weapon of &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, but history bears out that even the darkest voodoo did little to negate the effectiveness of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; blade.\nDuring times of war, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; faced off against many powerful foes. Some, even, that they could not break. Their witchdoctors devised cursed pots and through the use of powerful magic, summoned them at different locations within the enemy's encampment. Shortly after, a fountain of &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s would spring forth, causing a ruckus and confusing the enemy in the process. Little did they know that these frogs carried a plague with them that would quickly devastate their ranks and force them to retreat or surrender.\nAlthough they are savage and nefarious in the extreme, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; witch doctors have aligned themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; out of pure necessity. These dastardly &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; users are adept at manipulating the chemical processes within their fellow warriors in order to augment their combat abilities. They served as spellcasters for the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, being able to create several types of wards for such activities as healing, trapping, and watching over the land.\nZuvembi brew is arguably a witch doctor's most insidious concoction. Driven by the cauldron master's strength of mind, Zuvembi brew takes the will of those who breathe its fumes. It makes them compliant and easily manipulated. It is low magic, relying upon ancient cantrips and recipes known only to witch doctors of a certain skill.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20berserker\"&gt;Troll berserker&lt;/a&gt;s are fueled by a cocktail of primitive and dark magic, potions concocted by the shadowy witch doctors that send the ferocious &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s into a blood-chilling frenzy.\nThey are assisted by &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Figurine\"&gt;voodoo figurines&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowerful &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; witch doctors are sometimes called \"corpse mongers\".\nOther.\nExcept the trolls, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gorloc\"&gt;gorloc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pygmy\"&gt;pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; can be witch doctors. There are also &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%20Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;witch doctors&lt;/a&gt; that are under the command of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Kurzen\"&gt;Colonel Kurzen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWitch doctors are semi-playable as troll &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; (with shadowy magic, ritualistic chants, and spiritual guidance), &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s (with wards being replaced by totems), and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s (with curses, soul harvesting, haunt).\nA common title among troll &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, they range from the very powerful, &lt;a href=\"Hakkari%20Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Hakkari Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;, to the relatively weak, .\nIn the RPG.\nThe arts of the witch doctors originated with the trolls, and they make up the vast majority of those who practice these arts. Some of these witch doctors have agreed to take on the occasional non-troll apprentice, usually from among the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe witch doctor is an alchemical and spiritual master, skilled at not only simply brewing potions and alchemical goods, but at awakening the spirits of the ingredients that go into his goods. A witch doctor at work can be unsettling, for he croons and chants to the herbs and animal parts that go into his brew, shaking a rattle to awaken them from their slumber, and sometimes even bursting into dance to appease them and make them favor him. The powers that witch doctors revere are creatures of wild, ecstatic worship who demand dynamism from their servants. The witch doctor's arcane magical art is formed from the ability to twist and turn nature through a crude yet effective science called &lt;a href=\"juju\"&gt;juju&lt;/a&gt;. Often the more cunning and savvy members of the savage troll tribes, witch doctors are uncommon among other, more civilized races that instead rely on shamanistic aid in times of need. During war, the witch doctor's &lt;a href=\"juju\"&gt;juju&lt;/a&gt; can give a troll tribe a needed edge.\nWitch doctors teach that worthy trolls receive dominion over various aspects of nature upon their death - whether plants, weather, beasts, or even disease. When witch doctors exhibit their supernatural powers to cure the sick, control nature, or assist in battle, it is said that ancestral spirits are riding them. The witch doctor's seething cauldron contains a hallucinogenic mixture of herbs, poisons, crushed insects and other noxious materials. He may add drops of this Shaka brew to improve the efficiency of any potion or alchemical item he creates. The Shaka brew maximizes all variable, numeric effects of the witch doctor's potions or alchemical creations. Drinking a potion treated with the Shaka brew leaves the imbiber with a euphoric buzz. The Bambe brew is a secret recipe that extendes the effectiveness of magical potions. Drinking Bambe brew potions leaves the imbiber with a faint crawling sensation over their skin. The witch doctor can add drops of the Zuvembi brew to any potion. The brew creates a powerful suggestive state in the imbiber that he can trigger and control. After drinking a Zuvembi brew potion, the imbiber can be dominated by the witch doctor.\nCreating curses and hexes is a specialty of the witch doctor. The witch doctor can make a deadly doll of wax or tallow containing a specific person's hair, skin or blood. He can affect the target with a harmful touch attack spell as long as the person is on the same plane. The doll disintegrates after a touch attack.\nUsing shadow and &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; magic, the witch doctors can also cast spells without the use of dolls. By repeating old ritualistic chants, the witch doctor curses the target into feeling pain without physically harming it, only mentally. This might still prove deadly. The witch doctor can shake and rattle the gourds and necklaces that he carries to create a frightening rhythmic effect. The juju of the highly skilled witch doctor becomes potent enough to kill (the Death Rattle). The reagent required to use this ability is a death gourd, which must be cursed and carved by the witch doctor himself using bizarre and disgusting components. The witch doctor can rattle his death gourd, targeting a number of living creatures, the closest creatures are affected first. Witch doctors are also benders of will, as they can control other lesser intellectual beings with their mind. These tricks can be fatal for several enemies of the witch doctor, not knowing whom of their allies to trust anymore. They are also able to sear through a targets mind and erase or create new memories as they please, causing the target to get confused and not knowing what is real. These rituals will also inflict massive pain onto the target.\nMuch like a wizard, the witch doctor relies on his ability to bend magic to his will. &lt;a href=\"Juju\"&gt;Juju&lt;/a&gt; secrets can only go so far, though.\nJungle troll witch doctor.\nTrolls are the ultimate witch doctors. It was the trolls, so they say, who invented the art. Their pots ever bubble with strange concoctions, and they scatter protective and decorative totems around their dwellings. They speak in tongues most can't understand, communing with the strange &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; spirits from their tribal religion that grant them their power. They decorate themselves with ritual tattoos and designs, and shrunken heads dangle from their staves. The iconic troll witch doctor focuses on helping his allies with his strange blend of science and faith. He plants magic totems to help his allies, which may start a bloodlust or an adrenaline rush in his body. A powerful witch doctor may even transform their foes into frogs. He's not a particularly skillful combatant, but when the Horde is in a scrape, somebody calls for the doctor."}

The upstart \"&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" and the strange beings that seem to have arrived in their wake are just a new skin on an old snake. They will be gone soon. And Witherbark will endure.\"\nOverview.\nWitherbark grows increasingly dehydrated as he attacks the group, consuming his stores of Aqueous Energy. When his Energy is depleted, he roots himself in the soil and calls globules of water from the nearby lake to restore his vitality. Players may destroy those Globules before they reach him to prolong this phase.\nStrategy.\nNon-melees should be generally on the opposite side of the boss from the water. The tank should position him some distance from the water, facing away from the party. He will spawn vines under party members, which should be gotten away from.\nWhen he is low on health, he will \"freeze\" and take double damage. Globes will appear from the water and move toward him to revive him - these can be killed to prolong his debuff phase. If a globe touches a vine, it will spawn an add, but if the ranged DPS and healers are positioned correctly, this shouldn't be much of a problem."}

When she loses 10% of her health, Velhari calls forth an Ancient Enforcer to assist her in combat. At 70% health, Velhari switches her active aura to Aura of Contempt. When she loses 10% of her health, Velhari calls forth an Ancient Harbinger to restore her health. At 40% health, Velhari once more switches her active aura to Aura of Malice. When she loses 10% of her health, Velhari calls forth an Ancient Sovereign to bolster her defenses.

He was found by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; after being injured in battle and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; to heal, where the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; had him care for the recovering &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; so their opposite personalities would achieve balance. Tyrathan was haunted by doubt after losing his scouting squad to a &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; attack in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. He and Vol'jin eventually become friends, even making a pact to kill whomever killed the other. \nBiography.\nAs a boy, Tyrathan was inspired to become a hunter by the legends of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;. The Khort family has long served the Vanyst family of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; nobles, a tradition which Tyrathan continued. Tyrathan met his wife when he was hunting a pack of wolves, but as time went on his wife grew to worry about how easily killing came to Tyrathan. He feels that while he was away as a soldier, that perhaps his wife and &lt;a href=\"Morelan%20Vanyst\"&gt;Morelan Vanyst&lt;/a&gt; have grown close.\nTyrathan served in &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore's&lt;/a&gt; forces that occupied &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and during that time he met the troll leader, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in the past he spent time in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and learned how to speak &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt; from his troll guide &lt;a href=\"Keren%27dal\"&gt;Keren'dal&lt;/a&gt;. He speaks Zandali with a Stranglethorn accent.\nPandaria.\nTyrathan's superior, &lt;a href=\"Bolten%20Vanyst\"&gt;Bolten Vanyst&lt;/a&gt;, had him lead a squad of scouts to &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt; and report back within three hours. The team was ambushed by &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, which killed all the hunters and their &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s, including Tyrathan's friend &lt;a href=\"Larsi\"&gt;Larsi&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrathan was the only survivor, though with a broken leg, and dragged himself through the forest feeding on whatever plants he could find until he was found by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrathan was tasked by the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; to tend to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who was also recovering at the Monastery after being &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;betrayed by the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Despite nearly being polar opposites, Tyrathan and Vol'jin slowly became friends as they had similar near-death experiences in Pandaria. They eventually even make a pact to kill whoever kills the other. The two of them worked together to defend &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrathan and Chen would also face a group of Zandalari scouts in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Tyrathan, Chen, Vol'jin, and a squad of Shado-Pan entered the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; to stop the revival of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;, all but Vol'jin were captured by the Zandalari and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Vol'jin seemingly leaving them to join the Zandalari, Vol'jin saved Tyrathan and the others and they left the island. Returning to Kun-Lai, Tyrathan helped defend the Shado-Pan Monastery against a Zandalari attack as part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-three\"&gt;The Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough mortally wounded by a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; spear in the battle, Vol'jin called upon &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; to return his spirit. Bwonsamdi agreed, given the large number of Zandalari souls the pair had delivered to him through the battle, but promised that he would not let Tyrathan go forever. Following this Tyrathan told Vol'jin that he planned to recover before going back home to his wife and children, remarking that he needed to tell his wife that he understood and that his children need to know him.\nLegion.\nTyrathan secretly arrived at the funeral ceremony of Vol'jin in the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; after his death, and watched it from afar. When approached by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, he reveals that they were good friends and that he is going to avenge him.\nTyrathan can also be found at the &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; after joining other hunters in the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, where he comments that he is thinking about lost friends.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nPlease don't call the guards. I came to honor Vol'jin, not to cause trouble.\nHe was a friend. We fought side by side against great odds. I owe that troll my life.\nWe once swore to each other that, should one of us be killed, the other would avenge him. Always thought he'd outlive me...\nWhatever it takes, I'm going to make good on my promise.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When taking humanoid guise, she has refused to take the form of a human, finding elves more aesthetically pleasing, and seems to prefer not to meddle in the affairs of mortals. Her alias is Tyri, possibly either a nickname given to her by Kalec or a name she goes by when in disguise.\nBiography.\nThe Sunwell.\nKalecgos was sent by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; on a mission for the blue flight. Worried about her future mate, Tyrygosa followed, arriving just in time to rescue Kalecgos from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. They were joined by the human paladin &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; and a strange young woman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. The four journeyed together for a while, their exploits eventually leading them to the land of Quel'thalas where after being assaulted by the traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; and an enslaved &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; they discovered Anveena was the new avatar of the Sunwell. With the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Dar'khan was defeated and Anveena was left in the care of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos, having sworn to look after her, remained in Quel'thalas as Anveena's guardian. Tyrygosa departed, along with Jorad Mace, after wishing her betrothed farewell.\nShadow Wing.\nSometime after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrygosa traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to investigate a familiar yet powerful source of magic. She eventually reunited with &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;, and through their adventures they encountered a &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Dragonflight\"&gt;mysterious new flight of dragons&lt;/a&gt; that emanated the mysterious magical aura that she's been sensing.\nTyrygosa was eventually brought to a Netherwing dragon lair by &lt;a href=\"Valoku\"&gt;Valoku&lt;/a&gt; and after inspecting the eggs that the Nether dragons originated from, she pieced together that the Netherwing dragons are actually descendants of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nTyrygosa recruited Valoku and &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; in helping her rescue their enthralled brethren and during the battle for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrygosa used her magic to usurp control of the Nether Dragons under Ragnok's enthrallment.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;'s army, Tyrygosa attempts to free the enthralled dragons Ragnok enthralled but &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt; informs her that those enthralled under his devices gradually weaken until they eventually burn out. Nothing can save them unless an extremely powerful source of arcane power can revitalize the dragons enough to free themselves. Tyrygosa, Kadavan, and Zzeraku open a dimensional rift to Azeroth and bring a group of enthralled Netherwing dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; where they absorb its magical energies. Yet Zzeraku and the Nether dragons grow mad with power, and frustrated with everyone they've ever encountered trying to use them, decide to be masters of their own destinies and conquer Azeroth for themselves. Tyrygosa tries to reason with Zzeraku, telling him that by following Deathwing's path, Azeroth will rise against them and lead to their destruction. Though conflicted with Tyrygosa's sincere concern for his kind, Zzeraku believes that only by gaining power can he safeguard his people. The Netherwing dragons attack the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and in the midst of the chaos, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; awakens from his slumber. In his insanity, Malygos misinterprets the nether dragons arrogant proclamations of being the embodiment of the Nexus and absorbs them and their power.\nThe dragon's Nether-warped physiology began to affect the Spell-Weaver himself, ultimately helping him regain some of his lost sanity. With his sanity restored to him, Tyrygosa's patron declared war on mortal spellcasters, sending his flight out to do his bidding. Only &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; managed to escape.\nBeing unable to guide the Nether dragons to a better end weighed heavily on Tyrygosa. She later returns to Outland where she decides to look after a new generation of Netherwing eggs.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nTyrygosa, in the disguise of Tyri, can be seen in The Burning Crusade at &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Ridge\"&gt;Celestial Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;. She is involved in the investigation of &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. After asking adventurers to assist her by defeating the dominant Netherdragon in the area, &lt;a href=\"Veraku\"&gt;Veraku&lt;/a&gt;, she takes control of the brood, planning to keep them safe and in check.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Siege of Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; the heroes of Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; are nearby &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and raiders begin by attempting to relieve the beleaguered Aspects under siege by the Twilight's Hammer, the Twilight dragonflight and the Black dragonflight. An &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Tyrygosa\"&gt;Image of Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; warns them that they have to hurry as Wyrmrest falls as they speak. Along with an army of mortal races and dragons led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Devrestrasz\"&gt;Lord Devrestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes battle their way through and stop an earth elemental at the base of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. is pounding at the foundations of the spire trying to level it.\nOnce inside Wyrmrest Tyrygosa explains that Deathwing has summoned extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt; to assault the Temple as well, and Maws of the Old Gods are erupting from the nearby earth. Tyrygosa orders that they need to be killed.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrygosa heeded Kalecgos' call to reunite the blue dragonflight and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, where she can be seen within the &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20Biscuit%20Inn\"&gt;Conjured Biscuit Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"netherwing\"&gt;netherwing&lt;/a&gt; were invited to the Dragon Isles and made a home in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrygosa reunited with them and was seen speaking with &lt;a href=\"Mordenaku\"&gt;Mordenaku&lt;/a&gt; at their new roost.\nIn the battle before &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrygosa can be seen assisting Kalecgos and Stellagosa in maintaining a magical barrier that keeps Primalist forces at bay.\nQuotes.\nI've never seen anything like these nether dragons. They seem to have inherited their sire's temperament, but they have become something entirely different.\nI spent years with the netherwing in Outland--when I heard that Mordenaku was bringing the flight to the Dragon Isles, I knew they'd need some help adapting.\nHe mentioned that you helped them settle in. I'm glad he has more than one ally on this side of the Dark Portal! Thank you for your aid."}

The FontInstance methods are not reflected in the SimpleHTML frame until you SetText on the frame. It also appears that you can only supply the block elements and not the inline elements (ie Hyperlinks cannot be colored a different color). Other than that, see FontInstance for documentation of these methods.\nSupported HTML.\nThe following HTML tags are supported:\nWell-formed HTML.\nSimpleHTML will only display text as HTML if it is well-formed; the following conditions and quirks apply:\nStandard escape sequences.\nSimpleHTML also supports the usual &lt;a href=\"UI%20Escape%20Sequences\"&gt;UI Escape Sequences&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to change font color, or as an alternative syntax to specify hyperlinks.\nSetting element styles.\nIt is possible to set different fonts for the text-container elements (h1, h2, h3, and p), using &lt;a href=\"API_FontInstance_SetFont\"&gt;SetFont&lt;/a&gt;:\n SimpleHTML:SetFont('h1', GameFontHighlightLarge);\nYou can also define font properties for these elements in your XML files, eg:\n &lt;SimpleHTML ...&gt;\n &lt;FontStringHeader1 inherits=\"GameFontHighlightLarge\"/&gt;\n &lt;/SimpleHTML&gt;\nCreation Using Pure Lua.\nCreating a SimpleHTML object using pure Lua is very simple.\n MySimpleHTMLObject = CreateFrame('SimpleHTML');\nAfter, the creation of the object you can assign the HTML code to be displayed.

Even while underground, a dwarven prospector will unerringly know the direction of the north. In their journeys, dwarven prospectors learn how to travel through and survive in many types of wilderness. In fact, dwarven prospectors often learn how to pace themselves when traveling long distances and can move at impressive speeds even in rough terrain.\nProspectors can be a superstitious lot, and many have particular items they swear were vital to past successes and victories. Traditionally this item has been a rock taken from the prospector's birthplace, but some prospectors swear by their \"special belt\" or \"lucky boots\".\nProspectors are also known for their prodigious memories for places to visit. They are often compared to the memory of kodo beasts (which will remember the face of a hunter who wounded them more than a decade earlier).\nProspectors are also experts at library research as they study their past and future destinations in the halls of a library or archive.\nProspectors often make numerous friends and allies in their travels, until it seems as though they have acquaintances nearly everywhere they go.\nThey are &lt;a href=\"dungeoneer\"&gt;dungeoneer&lt;/a&gt;s and can speak &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is likely working closely with &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Jorell\"&gt;Apothecary Jorell&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Go%27Shek%20Farm\"&gt;Go'Shek Farm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Third War.\nA former young &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, Lydon participated in a battle during &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' liberation. The night before attacking the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas met with the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Forces\"&gt;freed undead&lt;/a&gt;. She spoke about their purpose in the world and asked if they will help her retake the Capital. Lydon asked her what will happen to &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and his men. Lydon had already embraced his fate and spoke about humans as being another race. She responded that they will just serve for the battle.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nApothecary Lydon was a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. He helped &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Zamah\"&gt;Apothecary Zamah&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Lydon%27s%20Toxin\"&gt;Lydon's Toxin&lt;/a&gt; to fix the Horde's problem in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt;. He created the Elixir of Suffering and tested it on his frog &lt;a href=\"Umpi\"&gt;Umpi&lt;/a&gt;. He sent adventurers to collect &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20Blood\"&gt;Mountain Lion Blood&lt;/a&gt; in the goal of creating a death-brew which he used to poison the dog of Hillsbrad, &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20%28dog%29\"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt; as a test and for fun. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt;, he created the Elixir of Agony and tested it on some hostage farmers. He participated in the identification of the &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Bottle\"&gt;Venom Bottle&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation lead to &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; god of troll. After her supposed death, he sent the Shadra's poison to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. \nEdge of Night.\nLydon oversaw the attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during the Dark Lady's absence. Lydon attempted to dissuade the warchief from using the Forsaken people to form a ramp of bodies for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s main advance and proposed to use the new blight instead. This merely served to agitate Garrosh.\nLater, as she dreams of the Forsaken's defeat, the Dark Lady observes Lydon's futile attempt to arrange a last defense of the Forsaken at the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;.\nLydon was relieved when Sylvanas arrived to handle the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; though was confused by her statement of receiving reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt;, unaware of Sylvanas' recent pact with the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Lydon was stationed in the ruined &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; taking samples. He was later sent to oversee &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt;'s experiments at the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;. He was dragged away by Stillwater's guards when he realized the Warden's project was not only a failure, but killing other Forsaken. The &lt;a href=\"A%20Lost%20Lad\"&gt;apothecary was found&lt;/a&gt; and rescued by a hero. Together, they coordinate to destroy the failed experiments and execute the insane Stillwater.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nDialogue.\nDuring , the following lines have been rewritten:"}

After the two returned from their adventure in &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt;, Gadrin told them about the death of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; and orcs, but Vol'jin already knew this thanks to his visions while in First Home.\nAs they had foreseen the lord of the orcish clans, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the Darkspear islands, and rescued the tribe from the powerful &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Witch\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;. After settling in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; he invited the trolls into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, where Gadrin became one of Vol'jin's most trusted advisors at their new home on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the young witch doctor Zalazane, Gadrin led the mystical training of many &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. However, Zalazane went mad from the mystical forces he had unleashed. The crazed witch doctor placed a curse upon the Echo Isles and drove Gadrin and his brethren away. Until &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Zalazane's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, Gadrin sought to end his rampage and put the souls of his cursed brethren to rest.\nGadrin's deceased brother, &lt;a href=\"Minshina\"&gt;Minshina&lt;/a&gt;, was calling him during his dreams, so he decided to send adventurers to retrieve Minshina's skull from the Echo Isles. \nBefore the Echo Isles were liberated shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, he instructed the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to gather tiki masks in order to put deceased trolls from the isles to rest. He also worked with them in order to summon &lt;a href=\"Elortha%20no%20Shadra\"&gt;Elortha no Shadra&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the Cataclysm he deals with the expansion of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nHe was present at the funeral ceremony of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, as a troll representative, Gadrin was present in &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rise\"&gt;Spirit Rise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; standing next to &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; shortly before &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; arrived to speak about the healing of Azeroth. Sylvanas wasn't looking forward to the conversation with Gadrin.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSince Vol'jin's death, Gadrin says that he often has felt Vol'jin's spirit whispering to him. His strength was the lifeblood of the Darkspear, and some would even say he was the spirit of the true Horde.\nThe Echo Isles came under attack once again by Zalazane, who broke free of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; and came back as a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; with an army of undead. Gadrin led the defense of the isles.\nGadrin later carried Vol'jin's ashes to &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the burial site of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; kings. Along the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Road\"&gt;Golden Road&lt;/a&gt; up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Mugamba\"&gt;Mount Mugamba&lt;/a&gt; Gadrin told of Vol'jin's past deeds to honor him, even as the Sandfury, Gurubashi, and Amani tribes fought to keep the ashes of a \"Horde-loving traitor\" out of Atal'Dazar.\nIt was eventually discovered that Vol'jin's spirit was not in his urn, which deeply concerned Bwonsamdi. He tasked Gadrin, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; with performing a seance to find the lost Warchief. With the presence of his old teacher and friend, Vol'jin appeared, not to reveal what happened to him, but to say that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; were in turmoil: &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;'s influence was spreading without the Grand Seal, and trolls of the past and present alike cried out for justice against the Blood God. The time to end G'huun was nigh and Vol'jin requested they use &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20Vol%27jin\"&gt;his glaive&lt;/a&gt; to stab G'huun's corpse to draw his blood and show all of Zandalar that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; is dead. Talanji then accompanied a team of Horde adventurers into the Underrot and Uldir to defeat G'huun and Gadrin was present when Talanji presented their victory over G'huun to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assault on Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, Gadrin aided Rohkan and &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Konawla\"&gt;Madam Konawla&lt;/a&gt; in conducting a ritual to imbue adventurers with the ancient powers of trolls in order fight against the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nGadrin was present at &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Later, at &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s request, he performed another seance with Talanji and &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; to call on the spirit of Vol'jin once again. When Baine asked Vol'jin who it was that had told him on his deathbed to make &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; the new warchief, spirits of the dead attacked to silence the question. Gadrin returned to Orgrimmar to call on Vol'jin's spirit at the site of his funeral pyre, with &lt;a href=\"Bwemba\"&gt;Bwemba&lt;/a&gt;'s help, to search for answers.\nGadrin was also present in &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nYears ago, I trained Zalazane and Vol'jin to master their craft. I never would have guessed how their destinies would shake de world.\nThere is something you wish to discuss, &lt;class&gt;... come, sit by me.\nSpeculation.\nThough the Darkspear had no official leader after Vol'jin's death, Gadrin appeared to have stepped up to the plate unofficially by \"Battle for Azeroth\" as shown in the Echo Isles questline, up until &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; formally became the Darkspear Chieftain.

Master Snowdrift as head of the Blackguard discipline oversaw the second trial known as The Test of Strength. However during this test to the shock of the Shado-Pan a sha interrupted the test and attacked the three surviving recruits, thankfully the three were able to work together to defeat the sha. \nWhile the three pandaren recuperated they were visited by Master Snowdrift who commended them by surviving a test he would not give even to his most senior students. He further remarked that he was proud of their strength and there would be no more testing to prove their worth to Shado-pan.

Unaware of the dangerous energies stored in the artifacts, Snowdrift took up the Fist and was immediately struck by a spear of lightning that seared his flesh and scarred his body. Though he was injured, he survived his encounter with the weapon. He and the other Shado-Pan feared that the weapon and its counterpart shield could do grave harm to the world if they fell into the wrong hands. To prevent this, they took the artifacts to &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger.\nHe can be ultimately found in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;."}

With one trustworthy person being the only one to loot a boss's body and distribute the loot there is no chance of a ninja looting the body or selecting need or greed after everyone else has passed for rolling.\nHowever, some players are against using the Master Looter rules, possibly due to time issues, or because there is the risk of the Master Looter himself/herself being a ninja looter (which this loot system is meant to prevent).\nHow to distribute loot as the Master Looter.\nWhen the Master Looter (who is the Party Leader in a group of five, but can be assigned to someone else by a Raid Leader in a Raid), loots the body, the loot window comes up just like when playing solo. When the loot is clicked a submenu appears off to the side of that particular piece of loot listing every group in the raid. Each of those groups lists the people in that group when moused over. The Master Looter then clicks on the specific name of the character getting that piece of loot. When the Master Looter assigns a &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; piece of loot, they also get an alert verifying that the loot is definitely supposed to go to that person.\nWarning.\nAny loot on a dead mob can only be looted by the player who was Master Looter at the time that mob was killed. If the Master Looter leaves the party, no one else will be able to loot that mob."}

Since most mages critically hit between 20 and 40% of the time this talent is equivalent to an effective mana cost reduction of all spells which can critically strike.\nNotes.\nThis Talent is especially good for high level arcane mages, as the mana conservation means more spell damage increase from .\nFor &lt;a href=\"channeling\"&gt;channeled&lt;/a&gt; spells that deal damage in ticks such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, the mana returned is based on the tick that critically hit, and not the entire spell. For example, Arcane Missiles in its higher levels deals damage in 5 ticks: it will only return 15/30% of 1/5th of the cost of Arcane Missiles and not its total. However, because these two spells have high mana costs, Master of Elements can still go a long way in conserving mana for a mage who uses either.\nPrior to patch 3.0.2, Master of Elements only affected fire and frost spells. It was changed in that patch to affect all mage spells."}

Gothik will then summon timed waves of set mobs on the left side of the room, dubbed the \"living\" side. Each time a mob is killed, their soul will travel across either balcony to be reborn on the other side of the room, dubbed the \"undead\" side. Phase one lasts 4 minutes and 34 seconds.\nPhase Two.\nAt 4 minutes and 34 seconds, Gothik teleports onto the living side of his room and engages the raid, switching sides every 15 to 20 sec. Gothik stops teleporting and the central gate opens at 30% health remaining.\nStrategies.\nPreparation.\nThis is considered one of the toughest encounters in Naxxramas. Raid leaders need to split their raid into two proper compositions, one for the living side and one for the undead side. As all of the mobs on the undead side are immune to magical damage, this side should mainly consist of melee players. Likewise, casters should be on the living side with Priests, Mages, and Hunters prioritized specifically due to their CC. All adds except Unrelenting Trainees hit hard and require tanks, though no more than three tanks are necessary on the living side.\nPhase one.\nDuring this phase, Gothik spawns sets of adds on the living side in timed waves, with the first set spawning at 24 seconds into the encounter. These composition of these waves are pre-determined, as well as the platforms these mobs can spawn on. The undead side spawn locations are not fixed, but players can see which bone pile each soul travels to in order to determine where the spectral add will spawn.\nWhenever a mob is killed on the living side, it will spawn a corresponding mob on the undead side (or two mobs in the case of Unrelenting Rider]]. These mobs are more powerful than their \"living\" counterparts and are immune to most if not all CC effects. Simply killing adds will flood the undead side and likely lead to a wipe. In contrast CCing too many adds will overwhelm the living side with spawns and make it impossible to kill enough before Phase 2, assuming none break CC early and start killing players. Communication is important in order to feed adds across the room at an adequate rate without overwhelming either side with too many spawns.\nOn the living side, trainees are vulnerable to all CC effects, deathknights can be shackled and rooted, and all three add types can be snared. On the undead side, only stuns are effective and only on trainees and deathknights. Spectral riders and horses are immune to all CC effects.\nThe final wave will spawn 50 seconds before Gothik lands, and any remaining adds on the living side that cannot be killed on the undead side in time should instead be CC'd. All CCs will need to be maintained for the duration of the encounter as Gothik is the highest priority.\nIf at any point one side of the room has no living players, the central gate will open and all active mobs from that side will immediately aggro onto remaining players.\nKill priority (Highest to Lowest):\nPhase two.\nGothik teleports down at 4:34 in fight. This phase is considered a dps race due to Harvest Soul, a stacking debuff that reduces all stats by 10%. Harvest Soul is cast immediately when Gothik lands and about every 20 seconds after, requiring the raid to quickly dispatch him before their stacks become too high. Too many stacks will cause Shadow Bolt to one-shot players, and the significantly reduced damage and healing dealt by the raid will be too little to keep up. \nGothik lands on the living side, and then will teleport to the melee side after 15 to 20 seconds, repeating this cycle. As the gate blocks line of sight, only players on the same side of the gate will be able to damage Gothik (Gothik can target any raid member regardless of los and will shadow bolt through the gate). Once Gothik is reduced to 30% health, the central gate will open and the raid is free to run across and finish him up.\nNotably, after Gothik's defeat, any remaining adds must be killed as they do not despawn. Slain living adds will continue to spawn their spectral counterparts on the undead side.\nLoot.\nYou receive 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels."}

He is wise and takes a long view on things. Gral is quite powerful and when it comes to his knowledge of the sea, none can compare. He watches over every voyage. Gral does love knowing things, almost as much as &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt; loves his stories, and he's not as cranky as he seems. Folks would come from all around to share their experiences with him.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, he appears as the Spirit of Gral.\nBackground.\nFive years before the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Zandalar\"&gt;war in Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; tore down Gral's temple of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Gral\"&gt;Atal'Gral&lt;/a&gt; and killed every last one of his followers. The loa was furious and anyone near the water could feel his pain as each follower fell. There was a talk by the Zandalari of rebuilding the temple, but with Gral either missing or weak, it remained just talk.\nThe naga would return years later seeking secrets at the ruins of Atal'Gral, and Gral was awakened to combat them. Gral knew that the naga were dealing with the darkness they could not comprehend and would soon become nothing more than a hollow tool to &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;those who may answer&lt;/a&gt;. He could feel it beneath and around him, and so awakened from his slumber in order to defeat their local leader, &lt;a href=\"Summoner%20Siavass\"&gt;Summoner Siavass&lt;/a&gt;. Gral knew that &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; reached into a dark place from where she could not return and vowed to tear her apart himself when the time came in revenge for his followers. Afterward, Gral observed the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; as queen of Zandalar.\nHe later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20Gral\"&gt;Sons&lt;/a&gt;. When the resident &lt;a href=\"gilgoblin\"&gt;gilgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s were almost done for, Gral found them and befriended them over a shared enemy in the naga. Gral can be seen outside the waterwall. His spirit sometimes appears to attack the naga.\nAt the funeral of the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ponoliak\"&gt;Ponoliak&lt;/a&gt;, Gral appeared and devoured his funeral boat. The tuskarr celebrated this as a joyous occasion, for Gral had chosen Ponoliak.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Gral serves as the patron of Gral's Sharks, a &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;-themed team of troll &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and personally appears as .

At the time, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the dispositions of the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, though the existence and location of \"Gral's Call\" was not known.\nDuring an Alliance strike against &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, the presence of \"Gral's Call\" was discovered in records recovered from the \"&lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Pa%27ku\"&gt;Breath of Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;\", and it was believed to have been en route from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. On the last leg of its journey home to Zandalar, \"Gral's Call\" spotted the new Alliance outpost at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt; along Zuldazar's southern coast. Alliance forces responded quickly to the flagship's arrival, which threatened the secrecy of the outpost. Portals were opened to allow &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Grenadier\"&gt;grenadiers&lt;/a&gt; to board the vessel, where they clashed with the Zandalari crew. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zalkran\"&gt;Captain Zalkran&lt;/a&gt; attempted to flee to report the location of the Alliance.\nHigh Commander &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; himself, accompanied by an Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;, worked their way through the ship to kill &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Ko%27jan\"&gt;Advisor Ko'jan&lt;/a&gt;, though the captain had already fled. Luckily, Zalkran was captured shortly after by General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, thus preventing any troll from escaping the ship. With \"Gral's Call\" secure, the Alliance evacuated the ship before destroying it from a distance with explosives. Captain Zalkran was subsequently sent to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;."}

He played a vital role in the development of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;\" the Forsaken sought to create.\nBiography.\nSylvanas.\nIn life, Putress' great passions were experimentation, creation, and discovery. During the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he was amongst those who became mindless &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; only to have their free will restored and joined the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. After the Forsaken secured the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, he sought out their new Queen but was rebuffed by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. Not deterred by the demon, Putress was able to successfully track down Sylvanas and follow her, a feat which impressed her enough to give him an audience. Putress, who remembered little of his old life and mourned for nothing in it, cast off his mortal name upon rising as Forsaken. He eagerly embraced the new identity Sylvanas had given him and balked at the mere mention of a potential \"cure\" for undeath, as he considered his new existence a boon rather than a curse.\nHis conviction and declaration to use the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; that had created the Forsaken and tame it as their own convinced Sylvanas to create the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; with him as their Grand Apothecary. He was then ordered to seek out Varimathras in order to receive whatever or whoever he required to craft this &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas consented to this undertaking on two conditions: whatever his plans for the living, Putress was to ensure the perfected plague also slays the Scourge; and that should the situation ever present itself, he was to seize the moment and destroy Arthas with it. She swore her grand apothecary to secrecy, knowing many would consider his work unconscionable.\nScourge Invasion.\nGrand Apothecary Putress was an important figure during the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, researching the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; infestation from an apothecary camp in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, he began sending &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; members back to their capital cities with severed &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; heads that had zombie brains containing both the plague and his anti-plague compound which partially cured them. Putress believed his research on the Scourge contagion held the secret to curing the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and also would facilitate their fight against the Scourge. As he expected, his research eventually helped to end of the zombie invasion. When Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; called for a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with other Horde leaders to discuss how to deal with the Scourge, Putress was present. Sylvanas offered Putress's services to Thrall citing that his knowledge of the plague would make him a valuable asset in the campaign against the Lich King.\nBattle for the Undercity.\nIn the early stages of the Northrend Campaign, the Royal Apothecary Society put the finishing touches on the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;, a new plague that not only killed living creatures but also destroyed the undead. In the middle of the battle at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Putress appeared on a cliff overlooking the battlefield and used Forsaken catapults to unleash the blight on the unsuspecting forces gathered below, indiscriminately killing Scourge, Horde, and Alliance alike and forcing the Lich King to retreat back into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The losses on all sides were great, and perhaps the greatest loss of all was the presumed death of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, it was revealed that Putress and several members of the Royal Apothecary Society had betrayed Sylvanas, and sided with &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who had secretly remained loyal to his &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; brothers and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; while serving under the Dark Lady. Together, they had orchestrated a coup d'\u00e9tat and forcefully taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, nearly killing Sylvanas in the process. While the Horde banded together with Thrall and Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;kill Varimathras and retake the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, assaulting it directly, the Alliance joined with &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, embittered by the loss of Bolvar, to invade the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; via the sewers to &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;deal with Putress&lt;/a&gt; and retake &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Putress was killed in Varian's manhunt, and the king was left to gaze at the full horror of the Royal Apothecary Society's work. &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Head%20of%20Putress\"&gt;Putress' head&lt;/a&gt; was then severed from his body and Varian tossed it at Thrall's feet.\nLegion.\nUpon his death, his soul entered the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; where it was later harvested of its essence by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nShattrath City.\nHis first appearance was as a level 80 elite at the new apothecary camp on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Echoes of Doom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, where he was involved with the following quests:\nQuotes.\nScourge Invasion.\nWhat a landmark discovery!

After the resistance against her swarm earns her ire, she directed &lt;a href=\"Kri%27vin\"&gt;Kri'vin&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to it. When &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers were scouting out the swarm within &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, Shek'zara confronted them and ordered the swarm to show them the price for defying N'Zoth. However, her swarm failed in this endeavor with her enemies successfully escaping.\nUnlike Shek'zeer, she does not command from her throne, but marched to the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20Setting%20Sun\"&gt;Gate of the Setting Sun&lt;/a&gt; to command from the front. It is there where she can be confronted and killed by adventurers.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"With the awakening of N'Zoth, Shek'zara, empress of the mantid, pledged her swarm to the old god's will. In service of her dark master, she unleashed her forces upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms to claim Pandaria in N'Zoth's name.\"\nStrategy.\nGrand Empress Shek'zara does not require a tank-swap, but requires quite a bit of healing. She periodically summons Zarathik Swarmguards and Ambershapers. Both should not be ignored as their Bladestorm and Amber Bolt Volleys start strong, but if too many are up at the same time, they can be deadly, especially when in concert with Shek'zara's own abilities. \nShek'zara uses two main abilities, both borrowed from &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Vizier%20Zor%27lok\"&gt;Imperial Vizier Zor'lok&lt;/a&gt;. First is Song of the Empress (aka, Attenuation). She was stand stationary and begin channeling sonic waves outward, 4 at a time. These are relatively easy to dodge so long as you stand 5 feet or more away from where she is standing. A melee player who is fast enough to react can easily stay in melee range to damage the boss while dodging the waves. Her second ability is Force and Verve (same as Zor'lok). She will again stand stationary and begin a short cast before channeling for 6 seconds. Once she begins her cast, 2 Sound Barrier circles will spawn which the raid needs to get under. The Sound Barriers protect from 70% of incoming damage, but Force and Verve will still cause the raid to be taking a serious beating, so healing cooldowns are recommended at this time. \nRegularly kill the adds, dodge the sound waves, and get under the Sound Barriers, and with sufficient healing, the boss should go down. \nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nGrand Empress Shek'zara appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Her flavor text reads: \"So is a Grand Empress an empress that's grand or an empress' empress?\""}

Despite the Sha driving her being a remnant of the mantid's patron god &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt;s believed the Empress was leading their race to ruin and made it their goal to depose her.

Traditionally, mantid rulers are displaced in their old age by a carefully chosen successor. However, Shek'zeer's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zara\"&gt;intended replacement&lt;/a&gt; is still too young and weak to unseat her, leaving the Klaxxi with no choice but to kill the current empress. If action is not taken against her soon, all of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; may crumble before the mantid's ravenous swarms.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nStage 1: A Perilous Battle.\nGrand Empress Shek'zeer health: \nStage 2: The Empress Retreats!\nWhen the Empress runs out of sha energy, she retreats to her chrysalis and calls for her royal guard.\n&lt;a href=\"Set%27thik%20Windblade\"&gt;Set'thik Windblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nSet'thik Windblade health: \n&lt;a href=\"Kor%27thik%20Reaver\"&gt;Kor'thik Reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nKor'thik Reaver health: \nStage 3: Ultimate Corruption!\nAt 30% remaining health, the Sha of Fear breaks the Empress' chrysalis and imbues her with a profound corruption.\nStrategy.\nShek'zeer is a three-phase encounter, cycling between phases one and two until she reaches 30% health.\nPhase one.\nStart out with the two tanks charging in and the rest of the raid spreading out in a wide semi-circle in front of her to avoid Dread Screech splash damage. The tanks will need to taunt off each other after every few Eyes of the Empress casts, as if it reaches five stacks, her current target will be charmed and deal a lot of damage to the raid. \nShek'zeer will summon three Dissonance Fields at random locations in the raid. Dissonance Fields absorb magic cast by players, whether voluntarily or not. This is useful for mitigating the Cry of Terror, where a randomly selected player deals Shadow damage to the entire raid every two seconds unless standing in the field. After absorbing enough magic, the field will explode with a Sonic Discharge, doing a healthy chunk of raid-wide damage. It is very important to get the three Fields to pop at different times to keep the fields from dealing unhealable amounts of damage to the entire raid.\nIn Heroic mode, the Sha of Fear will occasionally Corrupt a Dissonance Field, causing it to deal Shadow damage to random members of the raid until the field discharges.\nPhase one lasts until Shek'zeer runs out of sha energy (150 seconds) or she reaches 30% health. Sha energy is displayed as her power bar that counts down from 150. When she runs out, she will retreat and summon her royal guard, starting phase two.\nPhase two.\nPhase two brings out royal guard, in the form of several Set'thik Windblades and Kor'thik Reavers. All guards within eight yards of each other are affected by the Band of Valor and deal 20% more and take 10% less damage for each guard within range. Thus, the most effective way to kill them is to keep them in two groups (one for each tank), then pull one away from the group and focus it down.\nReavers tend to lob Poison Bombs at random players but may use their frontal cone ability Toxic Slime. They will also inflict Poison-Drenched Armor on their current target, which causes that target to occasionally deal bonus Nature damage. Reavers have a huge amount of health, to the point that it is faster to use the amber traps to kill them. Let windblades create sticky resin pools and have players run through them to congeal them to amber traps, then kite reavers through the traps.\nWindblades will either Fixate on a random target, who must kite it around the room lest it get hit with Sonic Blade, or channel an interruptible Dispatch ability, which acts much like a rogue's &lt;a href=\"Fan%20of%20Knives\"&gt;Fan of Knives&lt;/a&gt;. Windblades also coat the ground with Sticky Resin, which acts as a void zone. If enough resin-coated players run into a pool of Sticky Resin, it will congeal into an Amber Trap, dealing 5% of the victim's health as damage every few seconds. The trap only works on mantid, not on players, so use this to defeat the reavers. Windblades will try to free trapped reavers, so focus on on the windblades to ensure the reaver dies in a reasonable amount of time.\nPhase two lasts for a set length of time or until all adds are dead, at which point phase one restarts.\nPhase three.\nAt 30% remaining health, phase three begins. All members of the raid except the tanks should stack up immediately behind the empress for group healing purposes. Shek'zeer retains Eyes of the Empress, but otherwise gains a new set of abilities. She starts casting Sha Energy, dealing Shadow damage to 2-5 random players. She will also use Calamity, which knocks off half of each member of the raid's remaining (not total) health. She casts a &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;able Visions of Demise on a random player, which after four seconds causes that player to run in &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; for 20 seconds and deal damage to nearby allies.\nHer big ability this phase is Consuming Terror, which will do a large amount of damage and fear targets caught in a 70-yard cone in front of her for eight seconds. She also casts Amassing Darkness, which bounces a small amount of damage around the raid.\nIn Heroic mode difficulty, she will also cast a Heart of Fear in the direction of a random target. However, a player can stand between the heart and the target, taking the damage instead.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The fate of Azeroth awaits!\"\nBattle description.\nRetail game.\nInformation gathered from human spies revealed that large numbers of Orcs were closing in for an attack upon the unsuspecting village of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;. After having successfully established a farming community in the previous mission, King Llane assigns the Regent to the task of defending Grand Hamlet from the Orcs' invading forces.\nThe Regent dispatches several groups of &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s out to meet up with the Orcish &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Spearman\"&gt;spearmen&lt;/a&gt;. Crossing the bridges of the nearby river to the west, the humans discovered more Orc patrols within the area, which they managed to defeat through isolated clashes and skirmishes. With the Orcish patrols defeated, the humans succeed in defending Grand Hamlet from the Orcs' raid.\nGame demo.\nIn the \"\" game demo, the Orcs completely overrun the town of Grand Hamlet as the last human defenders fight to their deaths and the village is destroyed.\nGuide.\nThis is a survival map where you must outlast the incoming enemy forces. There are 16 enemy units, but they will only approach the town one at a time (about every couple game minutes). When they are all dead, the player wins.\nBegin by training a Peasant and sending your starting Peasant to a Gold Mine. There is one to the northeast and one to the southwest. The southwest mine is closer and is not in the way of incoming enemy units, so start working on that one. You will need a farm immediately after your Peasant pops out. \nGet your economy going, then work on a Barracks to pump out some Footmen. After you take care of a few incoming units, you should have room in your resources to build a Lumber Mill. Unlike in future versions of Warcraft, the Mill does not serve as a drop point, only access to Archers, Arrow Strength upgrades and access to advanced buildings, such as the Blacksmith and Church. You can defend the base with Archers (after building a Mill) and they have access to the arrow upgrades; These add +2 Minimum damage (which cannot be blocked by enemy armor) to your Archers' attacks, allowing them to outrange and outdamage the (eventual) incoming Spearmen. Keep in mind: Archers do not hit as hard as Footmen, even with full upgrades.\nYou can play this two ways: You can wait it out and allow the enemy to send one enemy at a time until they have all been taken care of, or you can go on the offensive with a task force of Footmen and/or Archers. If you decide to explore the map, make sure you leave some forces behind.\nThe following guide will tell you which direction enemy troops come from when they approach the base:\nEnemy Approach.\n Grunts\n Spearmen\nThe Easy Way.\nSend your peasant to the nearest mine (southeast of the base) and train another one, immediately. Take your existing forces and place them the the north of your base. Once your second Peasant becomes available, use him to get a Farm going, then resume building Peasants. Focus on getting an economy that consists of no less than five or six Peasants on gold and two on lumber. \nAfter the first Grunt has been killed, the next one will arrive from the south, so move your forces down a bit. Watch out for this Grunt, because he may swing around the far side of the trees and emerge near the Gold Mine your Peasants are working on. Use your Archer to scout around a little to the south so you can observe which direction the Grunt to approach from, but don't stray too far south, or you will get the attention of several Spearmen.\nAfter the second Grunt is dead, move your surviving forces to the west side of your base. By this point, your Barracks should be constructed and you should be pumping out additional Footmen. Start training reinforcements when gold permits (which should not be a problem if you have plenty of Peasants mining gold) and be sure to keep up with farm construction. Once you have enough Footmen to place two at each point entering town, you can start worrying about Archers (To be fair, they are not needed on this map, given the lack of strength each attack has on the base; this is more in case you are hovering an unusual amount of gold and cannot spend it fast enough). The Archer upgrades are nice, but not required. If you plan to spend the gold on them, then get the first one.\nIf you find yourself hoarding gold, build a second Barracks and pump out additional troops. Having at least 8-10 on hand should be enough to send an expedition force out to start clearing out the map while leaving a few behind as the enemy AI will continue to send single units to your base."}

He agreed to participate in Doan's experiment, and together, they succeeded in purifying what would later become the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Lord Commander Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; informed them of the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' suspension of the Silver Hand, the priest followed his comrades to explore all available options to wipe out the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He was later present in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; during a meeting on Lordaeron's situation.\nHe later learned about the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Rivendare\"&gt;Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of Alexandros Mograine, he joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and organized the ceremony of induction of &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; as a paladin into the ranks of the Crusade.\nWhen the Scourge attacked Hearthglen, Isillien was present on the ramparts of the fortified town to fight. He ordered the mage Doan to fight, however, the latter asked him to be patient and explained that he needed to conserved save energy for the right moment, before unleashing a powerful blizzard which decimated the waves of undead.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nEventually, Taelan Fordring realized how far the Scarlet Crusade had fallen from its noble purpose, and defected. As he made his way down the road from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, he was met by Isillien, who was ordered by the &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate him. Isillien was willing to do this for pleasure, not of obligation or duty; for he considered the Fordring bloodline weak. The Inquisitor stroke down Taelan. Not long after, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; arrived and, upon seeing his son's body, flew into a rage and attacked the Crusader, killing him.\nIn the RPG.\nThe priest Isillien was formerly a priest of the Holy Light in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, assigned to be the liaison for the Knights of the Silver Hand. There he worked closely with the elder &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; and his youthful charges, tutoring the young &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s in their quest for truth. He fled with Abbendis as Lordaeron fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Priests and paladins fought as the Scourge attacked the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, but they fled as Lordaeron fell around them. Some whisper it was the wounds both men received in battle, or perhaps just the shock of seeing their whole purpose destroyed, but since that day both Isillien and Abbendis have been quite insane.\nOnce a devoted priest of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, he now sees his dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt; as an even greater purpose. This dedication is real; it\u2019s a powerful and total commitment to something that has measurable results \u2014 something the Holy Light never gave. Early in the life of the Crusade, he developed techniques for inquisition and questioning, as well as holding cells and torture chambers to extract information or to hold prisoners or initiates to see if they are infected by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; are also held in these cells, and Isillien often visits them late at night, always alone. Crusaders say he enters the dungeon looking angry and almost mad (\"mad\" relative to the average crusader, which would be justifiably insane to the average eye). He exits calm and smiling, and speaks to no one about what he has been doing, and no one cares enough about the undead to wonder too much. He is 55 years old.\nIsillien and Abbendis wandered the area as the Scourge defiled the land, destroying what undead they could, gathering what warriors would join them. They had but one concern: eradication of all that had destroyed Lordaeron. Isillien became the spokesman for the group, his ravings gaining more followers than repelling them. Isillien is the heart of the Crusade. Abbendis and Isillien felt that although they had a good base, they really needed to attack the Scourge where they were the thickest: in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Isillien took on the title of Grand Inquisitor and control of the Western Crusade, while Abbendis led the majority of the forces to &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the east to strike at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Isillien guides the priests in the Crusade in their new roles as inquisitors, based in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. He is in charge of questioning undead and mortals alike to ferret out whatever information he can on the movement and settlement of the undead. Isillien controls the warriors through his impressionable &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt; in the west. Isillien taught Taelan Fordring about the Holy Light and what it was to serve.\nWhen the Scarlet Crusade was founded, Isillien realized that the order would be forced to deal with living adversaries as well as undead. Sadly, most spells focused toward either harming one or the other \u2014 a difficulty he was determined to resolve. Isillien developed a series of variations on healing spells that would not only inflict harm upon the undead, but on living victims as well. He passed this teaching on to each potential inquisitor, and it has become one of their trademark abilities."}
