They have recently befriended members of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, and although they have differences with their dwarven brethren, they welcome &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; members within their settlements.\nThey were led by &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;, \"King of the Frostborn\", who ruled over them from the mighty &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. This changed when Yorg recovered his memories, which he had lost some years back, and remembered that he was &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, a dwarf from the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Muradin decided to return home with his brothers so he left &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the leadership of the frostborn in his absence.\nHistory.\nThe Frostborn is a mysterious newly discovered faction of frost dwarves. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; thinks they migrated from &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; with many making &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; their home, since there are no records of them in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAges ago, after being corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; killed his brother's wife &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, and tricked &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; into believing that &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;King Arngrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s were responsible. In a fit of rage, Thorim threw his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;, at Arngrim, who was in the middle of a battle against a clan of frost dwarves. The explosion of Krolmir striking the ground killed all those nearby and froze the entire tableau for all time, catching the moment the shockwave threw many of the dwarves into the air.\n500 years ago, the Frostborn found &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt; half-dead in the snow. The frost dwarves nursed her back to health, and she learned their ways. After she'd spent a full year and a half with them, she told them she finally had the strength to return to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and face her family. She told them the chronicle of her brother's life, so they would know him too. Then, the Frostborn gave her a gift: a &lt;a href=\"Mithrios%2C%20Bronzebeard%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;, forged from the broken pieces of the axe she'd had with her and that she had broken in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; fighting &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. She followed their tradition and named the mace after the person she carried it for: &lt;a href=\"Mithrios%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mithrios Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt;, her lost brother. Mithrios then stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; for years to come until it ended up with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a party of Frostborn returned from a trek across the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; during an extremely harsh blizzard. They followed a trail of blood-soaked snow and found a lone &lt;a href=\"mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarf&lt;/a&gt; wandering and who spoke a dialect they could not understand. Not about to let their new-found cousin freeze to death, they took him along with them and continued on. Not long after, an extremely large &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt; burst out of the snow and swallowed one of the Frostborn before they could react. &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt;'s father thought they were all doomed before he heard a furious roar behind him, and turned to see the mountain dwarf &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20avatar\"&gt;growing in size, his skin getting a stone-like texture and his hands sizzling with lightning&lt;/a&gt;. He smashed the beast's head with a &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt; in his powerful state, the jormungar's head barely connected to its body as it collapsed dead. The Frostborn were in wonder and awe, and Velog's father named him &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;, a name reserved for heroes of the Frostborn, as he had no name when they encountered him and he had earned this title. Yorg eventually became King of the Frostborn years later, as he had trained the Frostborn into even greater warriors than they could have boasted during &lt;a href=\"Thunderfall\"&gt;their war&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s. The defeat of the huge jormungar at his hands became an example for all Frostborn as their hardest test of strength for warriors of the Frostborn is to defeat something much larger than them, such as a &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, or a jormungar as a testament that their size is not their weakness.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the frostborn at Frosthold befriended the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 unlike the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and welcomed all &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; members into their homes. &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;, \"King of the Frostborn,\" agreed to allow his people to join the Alliance against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Yorg was uneasy about lending aid to anything that might cost frostborn lives. This alliance benefits the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; because it is believed that the frostborn may be able to aid them in their quest to find out more information about their &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; heritage.\nIt was ultimately revealed that Yorg Stormheart was in fact &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, long thought to have been killed when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; took up the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, Muradin was merely wounded and had lost his memory, and so was willing to take on the persona of Yorg Stormheart. He was later reunited with his brothers &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, and recalled all his lost memories. Muradin then decided to leave the frost dwarves to hunt down Arthas, now the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and chose &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; to replace his as the new King of the Frostborn.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mithrios%2C%20Bronzebeard%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;Mithrios&lt;/a&gt; was found by a Frostborn patrol after a skirmish with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The frost dwarves discovered runes on it that linked the weapon to the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and to the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. As the Frostborn were repairing the weapon, &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;King Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; wrote to his old friend to come to visit them and tell the story of the weapon. Muradin, however, had no idea what weapon Velog was referring to, so he called his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, to come with him.\nWhen the Bronzebeadthe dwarves arrived, the Frostborn were glad to see Muradin. After the presentations and a feast, they spent the night drinking and sharing stories. During the night, Muradin told Velog that he had no doubt he left the Frostborn in the right hands, and with the help of the historian of Frosthold, he learned the story of the meeting between &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt; and the Frostborn.\nAfter the Bronzebeard brothers left, Muradin sent a letter to Velog, inviting him, and any Frostborn who would care to make the journey, to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to bring their families together and wanting to show them &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;'s interesting places - &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nThe frostborn are similar to conventional dwarves, with an exception being that their skin is an icy blue. &lt;a href=\"Glorthal%20Stiffbeard\"&gt;Glorthal Stiffbeard&lt;/a&gt; has snow-white skin, a trait shared with the frostborn skins used in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\"; signifying not all of their race is blue-skinned. Upon even closer examination, the frostborn have similar marks on them as those of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostborn descend from earthen the same way that the rest of dwarven kind do; possibly having retained these markings rather than having abandoned them as the rest of dwarf kind has.\nWhile no female frostborn appear alive in game, frozen corpses of them can be found at &lt;a href=\"Thunderfall\"&gt;Thunderfall&lt;/a&gt;. They, just as with the male frost dwarves, look similar to normal dwarves. While none are shown in game, the historian of &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; is noted as female; so they appear to still be present in frost dwarf society. The lack of female frostborn is likely due to the fact that the Frostborn use several skins previously reserved for the earthen, which female dwarf models do not possess.\nCulture.\nA tradition of the Frostborn is to name the weapon they use after the person they carry it for. They also write on their weapons what is most important to them, telling the world what and who they fight for. This tradition was later passed on to the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20Clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard Clan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Muradin, one of the Frostborn's lessons is \"The avalanche will fall as it wills, but you dig yourself out of the snow.\"\nWarfare and tactics.\nFrom the immortalized battlefield of Thunderfall, many aspects of Frostborn battle techniques against their larger foes can be seen.\nThe women of the race seem to be specialists in ranged combat, as they can be found leading the ranged battalions of female and male Frostborn, as well as being the sole healers on the battlefield. These ranged battalions consisted of bowmen and riflemen, the riflemen being somewhat scarce but present nonetheless. These groups usually formed by their siege weaponry, &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e, and seemed to slowly push forward as evidenced by the tactics used by the frontlines to guard those who moved forward (see below).\nWhile mostly on the front lines, men would be in charge of loading and firing the ballistae, while some were part of the ranged battalions with the women. On the frontlines the men would swarm their enemies, using a variety of melee weapons, as well as utilizing spears to throw at their enemies from afar. Unlike the ranged battalions, spearmen were often men from the frontlines, throwing a secondary weapon to attack their enemy as they moved in. As stated previously, the ranged battalions would slowly move forward, those who did were often shielded by a barricade of men, who utilized large shields to defend against the large clubs of the frost giants, which could easily kill the dwarves without the defenses. The Frostborn utilized their enemies large size by using nearby objects as a way to jump onto their enemies and attack the foe from on top of it.\nJoined with the frontlines were the cavalry of the Frostborn, which were men armed with large polearms riding bears into battle.\nWeaponry.\nThe Frostborn are seen using various melee weapons, from swords to axes to even polearms. From the evidence of the battle of Thunderfall, their ranged weaponry at the time mainly consisted of bows, but &lt;a href=\"Rifleman\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt; could also be found. The men on the front lines would hurl spears at their enemies while moving in when the opportunity presented itself.\nFrostborn used bears as ground mounts to ride into battle on, as well as &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e to fire at their enemies. &lt;a href=\"Stormcrest%20Eagle\"&gt;Stormcrest Eagle&lt;/a&gt;s seem to have replaced the bears as a mount, their ability to fly would prove much more useful in the mountains of the Storm Peaks, while a land mount would have limited use for travel in the area.\nMounts.\nAs the Wildhammers did with &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s after moving to the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, the frostborn have developed a special bond with a flying creature, the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrest%20Eagle\"&gt;Stormcrest Eagle&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s are abnormally larger than any other species of eagles and are very resilient, due to them having to make their home in the harsh Storm Peaks, which is similar to the frostborn's situation. The frostborn ride these great beasts as flying mounts. The frostborn have also been known to breed these eagles, since &lt;a href=\"Stormcrest%20Hatchling\"&gt;Stormcrest Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;s can be found at Frosthold.\nFrom the battle of Thunderfall, it seems that the frostborn used bear mounts at one time, likely &lt;a href=\"Icemaw%20Bear\"&gt;Icemaw bears&lt;/a&gt;, due to their being the only bears native to the region. They were used as the mounts for the frostborn's ground cavalry, and aside from the battle of Thunderfall they have not been seen used again. Likely they have been replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrest%20Eagle\"&gt;Stormcrest eagles&lt;/a&gt; completely due to the Storm Peaks being difficult to manage on foot, while air travel is much easier.\nThey also use white &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s called &lt;a href=\"frosthound\"&gt;frosthound&lt;/a&gt;s for tracking.\nReputation.\nReputation description.\n\"This mysterious race of frost dwarves makes their home in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. They've recently befriended members of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and welcome &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; members within their settlements.\"\nGuide.\nReputation with the Frostborn is gained by completing their non-repeatable quests and their one daily quest. The daily quest &lt;a href=\"Pushed%20Too%20Far\"&gt;Pushed Too Far&lt;/a&gt; is given by &lt;a href=\"Fjorlin%20Frostbrow\"&gt;Fjorlin Frostbrow&lt;/a&gt; at Frosthold. Upon completion, the quest awards 250 reputation.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3\"&gt;patch 3.3&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; factions receive spillover rep from quests and 5-man dungeons. This negates the need for doing solely Frostborn dailies to reach exalted."}

Multi-school abilities benefit from bonuses that affect any of their schools, use the lowest resistance value among their schools, ignore absorption and immunity effects that apply to only some of their schools, and can be used even when one or more of their schools have been locked with an &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupt effect&lt;/a&gt;. For example, Frostfire spells have the ability to apply both &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;'s used by fire spells, and &lt;a href=\"chill\"&gt;chill&lt;/a&gt;s used by frost spells.\nEquipment sets.\nA few equipment sets refer to Frostfire magic (although they do not use it in any way):\nHistory.\n\"Frostfire\" as something associated with mages was first mentioned as the name for the Frostfire Regalia set in vanilla WoW. However, the mechanic was not implemented until \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Bolt\"&gt;Frostfire Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Frostfire school did not exist at that time, Frostfire Bolt's mechanics served as a prototype for the multi-school effect, dealing whichever type of damage the target was most vulnerable to. The school was officially introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, along with the second Frostfire spell, &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Orb\"&gt;Frostfire Orb&lt;/a&gt;. However, Frostfire Orb was later removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, and Frostfire Bolt was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;."}

There is no accessible method of reaching Frosthold from foot; requiring one to fly. From depictions within \"\", and the fact that none of the buildings are accessible in game, it appears there is a larger city present within the mountain that is simply inaccessible to players; similar to &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; came to Frosthold, where the Frostborn were glad to see &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.

During the night, Muradin told Velog that he had no doubt he left the Frostborn in the right hands, and with the help of the historian of Frosthold, he learned the story of the meeting between &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt; and the Frostborn, 500 years ago."}

Due to the ice trolls' unrelenting hostility toward outsiders, historians have yet to learn how these two tribes were separated from the Drakkari and came to live so far from the ancient site of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe frigid lands of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; where once ruled by the Frostmanes before the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; conquered it from them. \nAt some point, several Frostmane trolls came too close to Ironforge and attacked a group of dwarves which included queen &lt;a href=\"Eimear\"&gt;Eimear&lt;/a&gt; who was killed during the attack. Mountaineers fought the trolls back but couldn't save the queen.\nThe Frostmane trolls once ruled over the frigid lands of Dun Morogh, only to have their &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; fall to dwarven armies. The ice trolls were driven to the hills in retreat, a shameful blow to their warlike nature. With the Ironforge armies focused on quelling the trogg invasion or fighting Alliance wars, the Frostmane trolls have seen the opportunity to reclaim their ancestral home of Dun Morogh and restore their long-lost &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being smaller than their Drakkari brethern, much like the Winterax trolls are, the Frostmane trolls have been launching increasingly frequent and aggressive attacks against the dwarves living in Dun Morogh, using Constriction Totems to block paths for Dwarven mountaineers. The dwarves currently consider the Frostmane tribe little more than a nuisance, and have not made a concerted effort to vanquish them. The &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Senate of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; has taken small note of the annoyance, and have sent &lt;a href=\"Grelin%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Grelin Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Senir%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Senir Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt; to take care of the problem.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; they've been forced out of their homes by troggs and into conflict against the Ironforge dwarves. With the death of their chieftain at the hands of the troggs, the Frostmane turned to &lt;a href=\"Battok%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Battok the Berserker&lt;/a&gt;, a well-respected warrior. Under his leadership they have retreated from &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Hold\"&gt;Frostmane Hold&lt;/a&gt;, established a new settlement called &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Retreat\"&gt;Frostmane Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and started launching strikes against &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nSometime after the events at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; have turned their focus on rallying the Frostmane tribe of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, but their plans were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Builder\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Scout\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the tribe at Frostmane Retreat were forced to join the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but they seemed to make &lt;a href=\"Unworthy%20Convert\"&gt;poor converts&lt;/a&gt;. The demons &lt;a href=\"Vel%27dromas\"&gt;Vel'dromas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corruptor%20Tyl%27vara\"&gt;Tyl'vara&lt;/a&gt; seemed particularly involved in the process.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Speaker\"&gt;Frostmane Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. They, like many other tribes, are unhappy with the idea of the Zandalari joining the Horde.\nDespite this, the Frostmane make up a large portion of the procession to mourn &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; after his death. They are neutral to the Horde, only fighting back if attacked first.\nSpeculation.\nThe Frostmane tribe may worship many of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; primarily, with their connection to snow and ice. Though trolls can worship loa universally."}

This will pass through an area with several &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; ogres (which were elite prior to Patch 2.3).\nAn alternative is to head west in Hillsbrad Fields, between the road and Darrow Hill (the cave with Yetis). Past the cave is a valley to the north. Follow this valley to a gap in the mountains which leads into the Alterac Mountains and straight to Growless Cave.

A fearsome, rune-inscribed two-handed longsword, it possessed the power to shatter and imprison the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of its victims and could remake the living into mindless &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Frostmourne was thrust from the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; by the Lich King &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and was taken up by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.

Few weapons have shaped modern history as much as Frostmourne. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; reforged the shards of the blade into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nFrostmourne and the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; were crafted at the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;, who was forced against his will to do so by &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer intended to use the blade and the Helm to establish his influence on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, thereby allowing him to claim his \"final prize\", a secret that the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; sought to hide. As a mourneblade adorned with the runes of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Frostmourne contained the power of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Frostmourne was the \"finest\" of the Runecarver's mourneblades, but was later surpassed in terms of power by &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who pretended to serve &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; bore the two vessels of Domination across the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; and bound the disembodied spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to them, after which he was imprisoned in an icy tomb called the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\n&lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was not content with being a pawn for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, however, and began working on a plan for escape. The first stage of his plan was set in motion when he used his powers to push Frostmourne through the ice and out of the Frozen Throne. It was sent to a &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; to await one who would claim it and become the Lich King's agent. Ner'zhul found his agent in &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the young prince of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; who had come to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in a quest to end the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Arthas and his men arrived, they met up with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, a dwarven explorer who had been searching for Frostmourne after hearing of the weapon's power. When the forces of the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; began to close in around them, Arthas and Muradin set out to claim it.\nFrostmourne was defended by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"revenant\"&gt;revenant&lt;/a&gt;s. They tried to warn Arthas of the danger, but he ignored the warning and destroyed them. When they found the sword, Muradin read the inscription on the dais: \"Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit.\"\nMuradin realized then that the blade was cursed, but Arthas said he would gladly bear any curse to save his homeland. Upon speaking those words, the ice encasing the sword shattered and exploded outward. A jagged shard struck Muradin and seemingly killed him. Arthas discarded his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, and rushed to heal his friend. The Lich King, through Frostmourne, began whispering to him, and Arthas left Muradin whom he thought was lost, and took hold of the blade.\nWith the sword in hand, Arthas returned to his base. He launched a counterattack against &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and quickly destroyed the dreadlord's base. Mal'Ganis confronted Arthas, telling him that the Lich King had known that he would take the cursed sword. He spoke as if he believed Arthas was now on his side, but to his surprise Arthas used the runeblade to slay him. With his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; forfeited to the Lich King, Arthas ran off into the frozen wastes of Northrend.\nNow a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;killed and converted his former army&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Lordaeron, where he was hailed with a royal welcome. Arthas proceeded directly to the throne room, where he killed his father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, and set the Scourge loose throughout the city. When Arthas confronted his former mentor &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Hammer of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; clashed with the runeblade. Each weapon blow erupted in showers of warring &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; energies, until Arthas managed to almost sever the paladin's arm, causing him to drop the hammer, before killing him.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; used a powerful spell to attack the Frozen Throne, where the Lich King was imprisoned. Though the spell was unsuccessful, it widened the crack through which Frostmourne had been thrust, and the Lich King's power began to wane, so he recalled Arthas to Northrend to aid him. Arthas defeated Illidan and ascended the spire to the Frozen Throne. He then used Frostmourne to shatter the ice and made it into a much more literal throne, donned the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; that was sealed within, and became the new Lich King.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Frozen Halls.\nJust after he is defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the undead &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krick%20and%20Ick\"&gt;Krick&lt;/a&gt; lets it slip that Arthas leaves Frostmourne unattended in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, his private sanctum in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter surviving the Pit of Saron, the guides for the adventurers braving the Halls (&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance or &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde) lead the way into the Halls of Reflection. As Krick promised, Frostmourne stands alone, floating serenely above an altar in the center of &lt;a href=\"Sword%27s%20Rest\"&gt;the entry chamber&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina or Sylvanas attempt to commune with the souls trapped within the blade to find the key to the Lich King's weakness. They are contacted by the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, who warns them that another must take the Lich King's place in order to keep the Scourge under control.\nFall of the Lich King.\nDuring the final battle against the Lich King at the Frozen Throne, Frostmourne was shattered by &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, wielded by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. The thousands of souls trapped within the blade swarmed the Lich King, suspending him in the air, where he was finished off by the champions assembled to defeat him.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Dedication%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Dedication of Honor&lt;/a&gt; monument at the center of &lt;a href=\"Runeweaver%20Square\"&gt;Runeweaver Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, a bust of the shattered hilt of Frostmourne is shown at the feet of the statue of Tirion Fordring.\nNo one initially knew where the remnants of Frostmourne and its battered hilt ended up. At &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, it was stated that the shards of Frostmourne were taken by \"someone smart\" and put \"somewhere safe\"... at least until someone gets it in their head to try to reforge it.\nLegion.\nIn \"\", a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;frost death knight&lt;/a&gt; can gather the shards of Frostmourne and reforge them into two powerful new runeblades - &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Icebringer and Frostreaper, the Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;, but not until they vanquish the lingering remnants of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; within.\nCurse.\nFrostmourne has the ability to drain life from its victims \u2014 and to drain the soul of anyone whom it connects to. The Lich King is capable of seeing through the eyes and hearing through the ears of anyone who wields Frostmourne; this ability cannot be stopped by any mortal means. The Lich King can communicate with the wielder at will telepathically, on any plane and at any distance. The Lich King uses this ability to try and corrupt the wielder over time. This has several effects. An individual who wields Frostmourne will not part with it willingly. Over time the person will go from good to neutral and finally to evil. A non-undead evil wielder will then become undead. Finally the sword is able to suck the being's soul into the sword. Frostmourne then retains the memories and skills of its victim. In fact, as long as the wielder's original body remains within one mile of Frostmourne, the sword maintains control of the body, and he may not be completely aware that his consciousness has shifted to the weapon. Beyond one mile, the sword cannot control the wielder's body, and the wielder of course finally becomes quite aware of his current state (if he is not already).\nThe Lich King can take possession of a soulless body that comes in contact with him and Frostmourne at the same time. The soul within Frostmourne is destroyed unless it willingly merges with the Lich King, becoming lost as a separate entity for all eternity. If a soul merges with the Lich King, he gains all the skills and memories of the victim. He has only done this one time, with Prince Arthas Menethil.\nPowers.\nWarcraft III: Reign of Chaos.\nIn \"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos\", Frostmourne increased Arthas' base damage by 22 points and allowed him to deal chaos damage, which was fully effective against all types of armor (including that of buildings and divine beings). \"For balance reasons, this effect was only applied during the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; mission and not during the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Path of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Legacy of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; campaigns.\"\nWarcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nIn \"Manual of Monsters\", Frostmourne is an artifact-level bastard sword with the following abilities: an increased chance to hit (\"+5\"), increased damage (\"+5\"), an increased chance of scoring a critical hit (\"keen\"), an increased attack speed (\"haste\"), the ability to strike incorporeal creatures as though they were fully corporeal (\"ghost touch\"), the ability to cause bleeding wounds and reduce the victim's stamina (\"wounding\"), bonus damage against good-aligned beings (\"unholy\"), bonus damage against living beings (\"2d6\"), and a life-draining effect that heals its wielder whenever he deals damage.\nWorld of Warcraft Trading Card Game.\nIn the \"Icecrown Citadel\" raid deck, Frostmourne has a \"Harvest Soul\" ability. When it deals fatal damage to an opposing ally, its attack power increases by 1 and it deals 2 frost damage to each opposing hero.\nIn the \"Reign of Fire\" set, when one of your own allies is destroyed, Frostmourne's attack power increases by 1 and your hero recovers 3 points of health. When your hero is at full health and damages an opposing hero, Frostmourne allows you to bring one of your dead allies back into play.\nArthas: Rise of the Lich King.\nIn \"\", Arthas is able to wield the runeblade almost effortlessly, despite its size and weight. It slices through most opponents with minimal resistance, and shatters most weapons it comes in contact with. Those slain by Frostmourne have their souls drawn into the weapon.\nIts greatest challenge was clashing with the legendary elven blade, &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; scion &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; had reforged to combat Frostmourne. Though able to put up a defense against Frostmourne's merciless onslaught, its fiery origins proving a good counter to the icy runeblade, Kael'thas ultimately abandoned the battle, leaving Frostmourne undefeated.\nList of kills.\nThe following notable characters were slain by Frostmourne and/or lost their souls to it. According to King Terenas Menethil II's spirit, there were thousands of souls contained within the blade. Countless souls were freed from the broken blade, but others were not so fortunate. As a mourneblade, Frostmourne could shatter the souls of some of its victims into fragments when it was wielded with rage. These fragments were delivered to &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the rest of the victim's souls incomplete."}

Presided over by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Thelwater\"&gt;Warden Thelwater&lt;/a&gt;, the Stockade is home to petty crooks, political insurgents, murderers, and a score of the most dangerous criminals in the land. The stockade allowed visitors for the prisoners.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the Stockade is a high-security prison complex, hidden beneath the canal district of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Presided over by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Thelwater\"&gt;Warden Thelwater&lt;/a&gt;, the Stockade is home to petty crooks, political insurgents, murderers, and a score of the most dangerous criminals in the land.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Mac%20%28human%29\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; was a 14-year-old boy who volunteered to serve as a guard in the Stockade when the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; was sent off to the front. Mac reprimanded some of the prisoners for tearing their wool blankets to make scarves, a symbol of &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;their gang&lt;/a&gt;. For that, Mac was stabbed in the back and killed.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, a prisoner-led revolt caused by the Defias Brotherhood has resulted in a state of pandemonium within the Stockades - where the guards have been overthrown and the convicts roam free. Warden Thelwater has managed to defend himself, and enlisted brave thrill-seekers to venture into the prison and kill the uprising's mastermind, &lt;a href=\"Bazil%20Thredd\"&gt;Bazil Thredd&lt;/a&gt;. The incident was solved with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, it has gone unnoticed and has been kept secret from society.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Targorr%20the%20Dread\"&gt;Targorr the Dread&lt;/a&gt; was captured, he was being held in the Stormwind Stockade and sentenced to death. However, one of the bureaucratic nobles put a hold on his execution to serve as their political pawn, until he was killed by an adventurer sent by &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Berton\"&gt;Guard Berton&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; interfered with the judgment of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; regarding the execution of the grave robber &lt;a href=\"Dextren%20Ward\"&gt;Dextren Ward&lt;/a&gt;, who sold bodies to the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt;, and instead had him locked in the Stormwind Stockade. To send a clear message, &lt;a href=\"Councilman%20Millstipe\"&gt;Councilman Millstipe&lt;/a&gt; sent an adventurer to execute Dexten, so that the corrupt bureaucrats understand that the people of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; will stand against Stormwind if they do nothing to help them.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, Thelwater supervised the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Cultist%20Infiltrator%20%28Elemental%20Unrest%29\"&gt;Cultist infiltrators&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in the city, as well as their interrogation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the quakes angered the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s in the ground below the prison, led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Overheat\"&gt;Lord Overheat&lt;/a&gt;, they slaughtered half of the inmates as they subsequently erupted into the halls of the Stockades. Later, another prisoner revolt occurred in the prison, where Warden Thelwater and &lt;a href=\"Rifle%20Commander%20Coe\"&gt;Rifle Commander Coe&lt;/a&gt; managed to contain the prisoners. Rather than executing them all, as Coe wished, Thelwater decided to enlist adventurers to once again venture into the prison and put down the uprising, thought to have been instigated by some new prisoners under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Randolph%20Moloch\"&gt;Randolph Moloch&lt;/a&gt; - but also by the terrifying menace known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;\" and his violent &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter Randolph Moloch was killed, he was replaced by his brother &lt;a href=\"Mortimer%20Moloch\"&gt;Mortimer Moloch&lt;/a&gt; to peacefully end the rioting, however, the latter faked a heart attack and collapsed. Rifle Commander Coe believes that Mortimer will adopt his brother's name and continue his \"epic schemes\" in the prison, and that it would be necessary to take care of it one day.\nFollowing the death of the Gnoll King, the prison was brought back under control and the prisoners were locked up again, while the &lt;a href=\"Hogger%27s%20Trousers\"&gt;Hogger's Trousers&lt;/a&gt; were kept by the guards as a memento that improve their morale.\nLater, non-violent criminals were sent from the Stockades to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; as a penal legion under the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt;.

At some point, Horde forces were sent by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the Stockades, where they faced the soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; stationed, in order to free &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. They also tried to release Saurfang, but he refused to go with them. Saurfang later escaped via the sewer system, emerging in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and heading to the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way his escape was aided by &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of , who told guards to take the night off thus allowing Saurfang to sneak by, but it is unknown if Saurfang knew he had help or not.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zalkran\"&gt;Captain Zalkran&lt;/a&gt; was captured and sent to the Stockade.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the war, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; personally watched the procession of &lt;a href=\"Cotley\"&gt;Cotley&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"apothecary\"&gt;apothecary&lt;/a&gt;, into the stockades where he ordered for the undead to be treated fairly and due to be set free after being thoroughly questioned.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, she was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; custody as the beginning payment of what was owed by the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Sira was subsequently sent to the Stockade. From &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, a kaldorei mage teleported Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; into the Stockades who then met with Sira.\nDungeon Journals.\nWoW Dungeon Journal.\n\"Stormwind Stockade is a high-security prison complex, hidden beneath the &lt;a href=\"Canals%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;canal district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; city.

Warden Thelwater keeps watch over the stockade and the highly dangerous criminals who call it home. Recently, the inmates revolted, overthrowing their guards and plunging the prison into a state of pandemonium.\"\nGeography.\nStormwind Stockade is located inside Stormwind City, on the northernmost section of the canal surrounding the Mage Quarter, the building is marked with a meeting stone directly next to its doorway, the actual entrance into the instance is directly inside the building, down the small, open set of stairs.\nFor Alliance characters, the Stockade is without a doubt the easiest instance to simply walk into, being in what is arguably the most popular of the Alliance cities. For Horde, this is a different story, and if one wishes to enter the instance in a manner besides queuing for it at the correct level, it will take some work.\nOne popular way for Horde characters to enter the Stockade is to gain access to the port on the eastern side of the city. This can be done by swimming or using waterwalking abilities (&lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Path of Frost&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Water%20Walking\"&gt;Elixir of Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;, for example) to swim to the port from &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Once in the port, one can make their way through the canals to the instance.\nStormwind Stockade is a very cramped instance. It consists primarily of three hallways, each with branching rooms extending from them. The two northernmost hallways have two circular rooms on the ends, both containing a boss fight, while the middle hallways extend to another important room containing a boss fight.\nIn the RPG.\nThe criminals who survive arrest and trial reside in one of the city's two prisons. Common criminals from pickpockets to murderers stay in the Stockade. More dangerous types \u2014 demons, rogue mages, and the like \u2014 are left to rot in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt;, which is surrounded on all sides by water.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Although there is a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt; just slightly east of the cave entrance, you can't resurrect from there and run right inside Booty Bay, because if you try to resurrect at a different Spirit Healer, it will resurrect you back at the graveyard you died at.\nSwim from Westfall.\nAnother way to get to Booty Bay from Stormwind is to start from &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. This method is recommended for lowbies (lvls 10-19) since it is the safest.\nAlong the coast of Theramore Island.\nAnother, both relatively quick and rather safe - way to get to Booty Bay from Stormwind or other Alliance territories is to take the roundabout route via &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you take this route, you also get the flight paths in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Island\"&gt;Theramore Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; as a bonus - don't forget to pick them up! This route is especially easy for Night Elves, who can take the boat from &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and who get easy access to the Barrens this way too (skipping &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;).\nGhost run through Ratchet.\nIf you're an extremely low character, or don't want to die a lot, try this:\nAshenvale to Ratchet.\nFor a character close to level 20, this might be the best way. (The swim from Westfall is not hard, but it is tedious.)\nThis is especially useful if you are already in &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Grove\"&gt;Silverwing Grove&lt;/a&gt; buying &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PvP%20reward\"&gt;PvP reward&lt;/a&gt; gear from ."}

The settlement was almost completely defenseless (only a handful of &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; were stationed in the town), but they were able to send a request for help before the attack started. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; moved quickly to prevent the orcs' aggression, dispatching the legendary &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to the scene. Uther advanced to the orc encampment to try and stop the orcs from attacking, and Arthas was sent to defend Strahnbrad, in case Uther was too late.\nOn his way to Strahnbrad, Arthas rescued &lt;a href=\"Little%20Timmy\"&gt;Little Timmy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and killed &lt;a href=\"Menag\"&gt;Menag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benedict\"&gt;Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, and their band, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhill%20Bandits\"&gt;Bloodhill Bandits&lt;/a&gt;, who were notorious in the region.

Some defenders of Strahnbrad reunited with Arthas and his men and together they were able to rout the orcs easily. The attack was directed by the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Master\"&gt;Slave Master&lt;/a&gt; of the Blackrock orcs, but Arthas and his men defeated his &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s, finally killing him.

Here upon the glittering sands of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; the Horde and Alliance battled to be the first to capture the mysterious titan relic housed behind the crumbling walls of this ancient citadel.\nStrand of the Ancients was a two-turn battleground featuring siege engines, gun turrets and seaforium charges. The battleground layout consisted of several gates spread across three walls which had to be destroyed in order to continue, capture points and a graveyard after each wall. Teams took turns to attack, using siege engines and bombs to destroy the citadel's walls, while the opposing team defended it using machine gun turrets and man-power. The attackers' goal was to break through walls and capture the relic inside, while the defending team attempted to resist the assault for the duration of the round. The winner was the team which captured the relic in the shortest time. \nPlayers could queue for Strand of the Ancients from level 65, through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;.

Yet, on a narrow island chain, a sliver of titan handiwork is out in the 'open'.\"\n\"As Horde and Alliance vanguards began to course over the continent of Northrend, their mystics awoke to dizzying visions of an isle, and a gleaming power behind heights of stone. The Strand\u2019s long-abandoned citadel towers and great gates loom mightily...but there\u2019s crumbling rock and rust among those fortifications. They can be brought down.\"\n\"Disembark on the Strand with your war machines and fellow soldiers, smash the walls of yesteryear and claim a prize of eons\u2019 past. Or seize the titans\u2019 once-magnificent bulwark, man their guns, and blast your enemies back into the sea.\"\nDescription.\n\"To the south of Dragonblight lies the resting place of a legendary Titan artifact known by the Alliance and Horde to possess critical information regarding the Titans and their methods. Strand of the Ancients is a 15 vs 15 battleground, where each side takes a turn attacking and defending the Titan artifact at the southern tip of the island. Prepare yourself for battle, for fate cannot determine success upon this Strand of the Ancients.\"\nOverview.\nGoal.\nStrand of the Ancients is played in two rounds, each lasting up to 10 minutes. Each team has a maximum of 15 players; a team will be assigned to be either the attacking team or the defending team. Attackers prepare for battle split into two boats that approach the northern end of the strand, while defenders spawn at the southern graveyard and should move toward defensive positions.\nThe attacking team lands on the island at the start of the battleground and will use siege weapons to break through the island's walls and capture graveyards along the way. After the first team captures the relic, or 10 minutes have elapsed, the factions will switch, so the attacking team will become the defending team and vice versa. It is described as a \" scenario\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; a \"coin toss\" was implemented for Strand of the Ancients, which randomizes which faction starts on offense and which starts on defense. Prior to this coin toss, the Alliance team always started on offense.\nHonor reward system.\nStrand of the Ancients items are available by spending honor accumulated.\nReputation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; is the Alliance faction for the battleground, and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt; is the Horde faction. However, no reputation is earned by competing in this battleground.\nTactics.\nSome common tactics include rushing walls with charges, leaving so many charges at the wall makes it hard to defuse them before they all go off, Vehicle assault with melee defending the demolishers, or a combination of the two.\nDefenders should make use of the turrets and pick off rushers as they run in. Paladins on a mount with crusader aura make this very difficult, but noticing the rush can save the wall.\nAlso, try to take out demolishers unless a rusher gets your attention; most of the time, you will be in a lot more trouble against demolishers than a single mage targeting your turret.\nGraveyards.\nAs stated above, graveyards are captured via clicking on them and completing a channeled effect similar to the various capturable points in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn offense, you want to capture the Eastern and Western Graveyards as soon as possible in order to gain the additional demolishers. Some people argue that the Southern Graveyard shouldn't be captured until the relic door has been destroyed because doing so makes your team respawn away from tanks and bombs which slows down your team's ability to get new tanks back into the fight. However, capturing the Southern Graveyard makes your enemies spawn further away from the Yellow Gate which allows your tanks and bomb carriers to approach the gate unharmed.\nOn Defense, defend your east and west GY's with a furor. The turrets on the Red and Purple walls can shoot players that are trying to capture them making it very easy for 1 person to defend a GY. Let the Offense cap the south GY if the walls are still up, it will slow them down.\nTurrets.\nUse turrets to destroy tanks and defend East and West GYs. A tag team of turret operators at a gate can kill a tank before it reaches the wall. The closer the target is to where the rocket lands the more damage it will take. Up to 6000 dmg against a tank and 3000 against a player. Note that the turret projectile has a significant travel time. When taking out a moving target, you must anticipate where it will be in the 1\u20132 seconds it takes for the rocket to explode. When firing on moving demolishers, target the ground about one tank-length in front of it. Demolishers move and turn slowly compared to players, so it is much easier to use the turrets on them. Additionally, enemy players tend to crowd around the demolishers, and will take damage as well.\nThe turrets cannot hit targets beneath them, so a tank that is left or right justified on the wall can only be hit by 1 of the turrets.\nDemolishers.\nSome people argue that demolishers/tanks are the best means of winning this fight. Always capture the Eastern and Western Graveyards to increase tank supply and reduce travel time. Tanks should operate in groups, never go in one at a time. You will get 1) Owned 2) Yelled At 3) Laughed at by both teams. Tanks spawn two at a time at each &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;, so jump in one and ideally wait for another player to jump in the other before rolling out.\nA note on tanks: ALWAYS DRIVE THEM TO THE GATE. NEVER USE A TANK TO ATTACK PLAYERS. It's pointless to attack players with a tank, just keep the tank moving to the gate.\nWhile tanks are very effective at breaking through gates, they are slow and vulnerable. Other players need to provide support for the tanks, by killing or CCing enemy players who are attacking them. Snares and roots are effective at keeping melee away. Ranged classes should take passenger seats on the demolishers and take care of anyone that is attacking the demolisher.\nBombs.\nSeasoned players have discovered that Bombs are the most effective way to destroy walls for several reasons:\nSeaforium bombs can be found near almost any graveyard. They can be picked up while mounted, and carried while mounted, stealthed or invisible. After resurrecting, always grab a bomb, even if you aren't planning on using it immediately. It will come in handy if you make it to a wall.\nDefenders should be on the lookout for enemies that try to sneak by towards a wall - they are probably carrying seaforium.\nStrategies.\nOffensive.\nThe primary goal of the offense is to get through all the gates to the ancient relic in the keep at the southern end of the battleground. The gates can only be brought down through seaforium charges and demolishers. When you are coming off the beach, take a seaforium charge if you intend on using it on the gate. This comes in handy when you're going against a defensive group that doesn't like to be out further than the gate and therefore wouldn't be able to disarm the charge in time. The defense will probably be waiting by the demolisher on the beach ready to attack it and destroy it before you have a chance to use it. Here and all throughout the game you have to make sure that opposing players on foot can't damage your demolishers, otherwise they'll never make it to the gates they have to knock down.\nAny players that can do slowing effects and damage from the passenger spots should join the demolishers:\nThe defending team will have two turrets to every gate, and it's important that if they are manned ranged players work to destroy them without placing themselves in danger of getting shot by turrets. It's possible that once the gate is down melee players can walk around and attack from there. \nCapturing the first two graveyards will enable the &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;s, which provide more demolishers and are a good spot to pick up new seaforium charges. If a &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Killing%20Spree\"&gt;Killing Spree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; is on the offensive side, they can use their respective abilities to teleport themselves up behind the turrets and either assault them from there to distract the turret's pilot or run past the gate to capture the next graveyard undetected. Capturing the last graveyard will push the defensive side back to spawn in their own courtyard. \nIf you are having trouble getting demolishers through because of players on foot destroying them, synchronize your demolishers to move in at the same time so that focus will be divided, or at least be too focused to take out every one before they hit the final door.\nClicking the orb at the end will instantly win the round.\nDefensive.\nStrand of the Ancients Defense is unique among battlegrounds in that your team is free to move on the map during the initial countdown to the start of the round. A common mistake by less experienced players is that they stand around at the initial spawn point. The defense \"absolutely must\" use the time to get in to position to engage the enemy as soon as they land on the beach.\nRight at the start of the game, you want to have people on the turrets for both the blue and the green gates. The rest of the group goes onto the beach getting ready to greet the incoming offense. Defense should be relatively split between the two landing docks, as the offense will also be split evenly on the incoming boats.\nThe demolishers have to be destroyed as soon as possible to prevent the gates from going down. Therefore, the one demolisher on the beach is often popular to destroy first. Demolishers also take priority to kill over players, unless they were hindering your ability to attack the demolisher. If you can crowd control any players trying to intercept your assault on the demolishers, then do so and continue on the demolisher until it is destroyed. Upon destruction, the driver will dismount and be very vulnerable if caught in a large group that just destroyed the demolisher.\nOnce the first gate is down (blue or green) the Eastern and Western graveyards are now open for the enemy to take. As soon as these graveyards are taken, the enemy gets better forward position when resurrecting, and additional demolishers from the adjacent &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Though it is still more important to destroy demolishers and keep the enemy from breaking the next gate (red or purple), holding these graveyards will do a lot to hinder the advance.\nPay attention to your map as well. Just because you're holding off people just fine at the purple gate might not mean the same for red. All active demolishers are visible on the map to all players. A single demolisher that has reached a gate with no one nearby to destroy it will be able to burn through a gate in about 15 seconds. Be prepared to concede that gate and fall back to the next one.\nIf there are demolishers incoming to the yellow gate, you will have to fall back and destroy it before trying to push forward again on defense. Typically, once both red and purple gates are down, the entire defense should fall back to the yellow gate and be prepared to destroy vehicles coming from either side. Watch the map to see where the closest demolisher is, and move towards it as a group. Do not wait for it to get within firing range of the yellow gate, or it will eventually go down. Good teams will send demolishers in groups of two from each vehicle emporium, which makes it more important to intercept them early and burn them down before they reach firing range of the yellow gate. Always watch the map and be ready to mobilize and meet demolishers coming from either side.\nIf the yellow gate goes down, you will have to use it as a chokepoint to prevent players and demolishers from getting past. If your entire group has not moved back and tanks are not going down quick enough before being able to touch the door, you will not have the best chance of lasting the timer. \nWhile in the final courtyard, a few players on the offensive side tend to stray off and go west towards a pile of seaforium charges. If they are not intercepted, they will circumvent your group to the door and plant the seaforium charge. A couple people with good crowd control can guard the steps and prevent a seaforuim assault on the final gate. Though, it is best for most of the team to be at the yellow gate chokepoint, to prevent players from ever getting in the courtyard, and to burn down demolishers as quickly as possible.\nIf the door to the keep goes down, do your best to drag out the timer for as long as possible by keeping players out of range of the orb either through snares, disorients, stuns, or knockbacks. Any player on the opposing team has to be just lucky enough to charge through and click on the orb in order for the offensive team to win the round.\nThe most important thing to remember on defense is to hold back anything that can do damage to the gates. This means always attack demolishers as soon as possible, before they are in range of a gate. Also be on the watch for players who rush past towards a gate, as they probably have a seaforium charge to plant. Always work to push the offensive assault back, but be prepared to fall back if something slips through. All it takes is one uncontested demolisher to roll through every gate and lose the match."}

Enslaved by an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, he must fight for survival against members of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Will he strike the uneasy balance with the other races he'll need to find the secrets of his past?\nPlot.\nCaptivity.\nThe story begins with a caravan heading through the wastelands of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the caravan run a successful business fighting gladiators in the arenas of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but they've just lost their prize champion (&lt;a href=\"Bloodeye%20Redfist\"&gt;Bloodeye Redfist&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, they see a lone, unconscious &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; on the shore of &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The survivor is quickly approached by a &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;, and seemingly about to be devoured when he rears up and begins fighting the massive reptile. The orcs, true to their business, start betting on the winner. Their boss, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; comes out to tell them to get a move on when he sees the human's struggle and joins in the betting.\nThe man is strong and agile, and eventually kills the crocolisk (who Rehgar attacked too, only to discover it hadn't been necessary since the human already killed it). Rehgar asks the man his name, and the man replies that he can't remember anything. In light of this information, Rehgar smiles and Frost Shocks him into renewed unconsciousness. The orcs throw the human into a cage. Although &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, one of the caged gladiators, warns Rehgar that he's \"playing with fire\", Rehgar, suspecting that the man may be an army &lt;a href=\"deserter\"&gt;deserter&lt;/a&gt;, feels confident enough to use him as his new gladiator without worrying about &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; reprisal.\nCellmates.\nThe human awakes a few hours later in his new home (a cage). His companions in captivity introduce themselves as Broll Bearmantle, a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera tells the human that they're going to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to become gladiators, and that Broll is one already. Broll and Valeera immediately start fighting (a recurring trend). Neither elf is grateful for their counterpart's presence, Broll seeing Valeera as an untrustworthy, betraying, magic addict blood elf, Valeera seeing Broll as weak and subservient.\nThe human comments that Valeera is too young to be a gladiator, and she spits back at him that she was old enough to survive on her own after bandits killed her family. She survived the bandits and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, but was caught and thrown in jail after trying to steal a shaman's talisman. Rehgar bought her from the jail and took her for gladiator training. After more argument between the two elves, the caravan arrives at Orgrimmar.\nOrgrimmar.\nIn the Orgrimmar arena Rehgar tells Valeera and the human that he'll help them channel their inner fury into fighting prowess. They start off by having Valeera and the man fight Broll. After Valeera taunts Broll about the size of his staff, Broll shifts into bear form and they have at it. The human, however, stands on the sidelines and refuses to fight. Another gladiator team -- a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; managed by a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; -- watch the human and wonder what he's up to. They plot to fight Valeera and Broll so that they won't be well enough to win the Dire Maul tournament.\nAt night, the gladiator trio huddle around a fire in a dungeon cell. Broll says that they'll never become a team, since the human, now dubbed \"Croc-bait\", won't fight and he and Valeera just want to fight each other. Valeera tells the human that Rehgar picked them to be gladiators since they reminded him of himself in some way. She also tells him that his amnesia seems to be caused by dark magic. Broll offers up an orc meditation remedy, and the man has a brief flash of memory -- he's a child, alone in a burning and collapsing city.\nWhen he comes out of the fugue state, Valeera and Broll are fighting... again. Broll lays into Valeera about the blood elves joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, enraging her. As the other two sleep, Valeera broods about being betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, siding with &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, and being magic-addicted since birth. The next day, she decides that Rehgar, not Broll, is her true enemy, and that she'll kill him when she gets the chance -- but she still has a plan to show Broll up. She casts a spell on him...\n'Training'.\nAs the protagonists prepare to train in the arena, the goblin-managed team shows up and tells them to get off the field. The troll calls them \"nature luva, coward and turncoat\", which sets off Valeera's temper. She stabs the undead and the teams get to fighting. Valeera holds up pretty well against what Broll calls her new Horde allies, but Broll is having some issues -- he can't shift into feral forms, and as a feral druid, he's pretty much useless. Valeera realizes that Broll's problems are from her Mana Tap spell the night before and runs to save him from the tauren, who easily smacks them both out of the way. \nMeanwhile, the human hacks off the hand of his troll opponent, decapitates the undead, and stabs the tauren in the shoulder. Valeera runs up, hugs him, and thanks him for saving Broll. Broll is mighty pissed about Valeera draining his energy, and it looks like they're about to fight again when they're faced with a new opponent. Rehgar has brought in an exceptionally large orc to test his team. \nThe huge orc heads over to kill Broll when Valeera runs at him screaming. The orc breaks Valeera's arm and throws her into the corner. The human pulls out his sword and tells the orc that the elves are under his protection, telling the orc to throw away his sword or die. As the orc and Croc-Bait get to fighting, Rehgar grins, knowing that he's set up a great arena team."}

Blending in with other types of less-dangerous flora, they often lay in wait, concealed for several days, until prey approaches into range.\nThe plant consists mostly of large, trunk-like stalks covered in semi-translucent bark. Its entire length is dotted with numerous clusters of leafy, thorn-covered vines that almost manage to conceal a pattern of strange, swollen bulges protruding from various places along the main stalk.\nPossessing a rudimentary digestive system, stranglethorn vines can extract nutrients only from the easily digestible outer layers of fleshy creatures. After food is stripped of nutritional value, it is expelled from the trunk and discarded at the plant's base.\nInedible materials such as beetles, insects, and skeletons are completely ignored by the plant. &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20beetle\"&gt;Carrion beetle&lt;/a&gt;s often form a symbiotic relationship with the plant, living in burrows at the vine's base. There, they help break down the remains of the plant's victims and lay eggs in the decomposing corpses. In turn, carrion beetles are considered food by other predators, and serve as lures to draw additional prey within the vine's reach.\nA stranglethorn attacks with its vine-like tendrils when prey strays within reach. It uses paralytic poison which subdues its prey, making it easier to pull towards its trunk. The prey is then encased over the next hour in a bark-like shell over as the main trunk grows around it. The outline of the victim is usually visible for several days afterwards. Once the creature is digested within the main trunk, a split forms and indigestibles are expelled. The split closes back up, leaving the stranglethorn's treasure buried under a thin layer of dead leaves and organic debris at the base of the main trunk."}

Will the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Fishing%20Hat\"&gt;Lucky Fishing Hat&lt;/a&gt; make its triumphant return onto the heads of anglers everywhere? You'll soon find out! \nDescription.\nThe Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is a weekly fishing event held in Stranglethorn Vale. There is a highly competitive fishing contest and a more casual rare fish turn-in for this event.\nWhen it happens.\nAs this is a timed competition and thus time-sensitive, with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"connected%20realms\"&gt;connected realms&lt;/a&gt;, time zones are now used to start the tournament rather then with realm time like all other holidays/events. This is so everyone starts at the same time and makes things fair for all competitors.\nThis event is held every Sunday from 2pm-4pm, which translates to:\nThe turn-in NPCs are available until 5 p.m.\nThe competitive portion of the event.\nThe contest is to catch 40 &lt;a href=\"Speckled%20Tastyfish\"&gt;Speckled Tastyfish&lt;/a&gt; and to turn them in to &lt;a href=\"Riggle%20Bassbait\"&gt;Riggle Bassbait&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; before anybody else does.\nThe mechanism of the turn-in is a quest, which only the first three winners each week to complete it can complete.\nRiggle Bassbait will yell zone-wide (both the Cape of Stranglethorn and Northern Stranglethorn) with the following announcement:\nAfter this announcement, the majority of fish caught in fishing pools will be tastyfish, but rarely players may catch non-contest fish.\nThe rewards.\nThe first three winners will receive the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Angler%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Master Angler of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;, and a reward choice depending on their placement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prize\"&gt;Grand Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner of the competition can pick their prize out of:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Place\"&gt;Second Place&lt;/a&gt; winner can pick their prize out of:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20Place\"&gt;Third Place&lt;/a&gt; winner will get a &lt;a href=\"High%20Test%20Eternium%20Fishing%20Line\"&gt;High Test Eternium Fishing Line&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza prizes are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;, so each character must win their own. Except for the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Pirate%20Ring\"&gt;Dread Pirate Ring&lt;/a&gt; as it's &lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;Bind to Account&lt;/a&gt; (BtA).\nHow to catch Speckled Tastyfish.\nSpeckled Tastyfish can be fished from \"any\" &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20pool\"&gt;Fishing pool&lt;/a&gt; anywhere in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, but only during the two hours of the event. This includes all inland and non-contest pools in the ocean.\nWith your fishing pole equipped, face the school and cast. Your bobber must land inside the school in order to catch the event fish, so cast again each time the bobber lands outside of the circle. When you have caught 40 Speckled Tastyfish, turn them in immediately.\nPreparation.\nA skill of at least 100 is highly recommended, however, so that you may learn &lt;a href=\"Find%20Fish\"&gt;Find Fish&lt;/a&gt;. With the Find Fish ability, fishing pools will appear on your minimap. Try to acquire a &lt;a href=\"Weather-Beaten%20Journal\"&gt;Weather-Beaten Journal&lt;/a&gt; and learn the ability prior to the event. They can be found in trunks and chests fished from any school in Kalimdor or the Eastern Kingdoms. Junk pools drop chests more often than fish pools, so these are a better source for the book if you are farming it.\nPractice fishing Fishing pools prior to your first Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza, so you know how the placement of the bobber in the circle works. Also, set your &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; inn to expedite your turn-in.\nFriends.\nBring assistance. Take turns on who assists/competes in a given week (but don't switch roles within a week during the competition). Friends can spot Fishing pools for you. &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; have level 20-30 mobs. Friends can help with this if you need help.\nYou can deplete a competitor's pool by fishing it. On a PvP server, the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is essentially a battleground. Ganking is a valid contest strategy. Come with many friends.\nOther notes.\nTurn off your PvP flag for this event if you are not on a PvP server. If there's an announcement when there are winners, it's very difficult to notice when your eyes are locked on your bobber. But if you're at it for more than 20 minutes (Normal Realm) or 25 minutes (PvP Realm), others have probably already won.\nRiggle will make zone-wide announcements for the first and second place winners:\nCharacters who are currently or with &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; can still turn in to Riggle\u2014as he is not affiliated with the Booty Bay faction. Riggle stands on a dock out in the open not far from the fishing trainer, so competitors with flying mounts can reach him if they hurry. Quickly turn in after reaching him, however, as he is in range of the &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay%20Bruiser\"&gt;Booty Bay Bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s who will make their displeasure known.\nThe non-competitive fish turn-ins.\nYou can continue to fishing after all winners have been declared. You can safely fish all the way until 4pm; the NPCs for the turn-ins (&lt;a href=\"Jang\"&gt;Jang&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fishbot%205000\"&gt;Fishbot 5000&lt;/a&gt;) will stay around for an hour after the tastyfish become unavailable.\nRare fish.\nThere are rare fish you can also catch, which you can turn in to the &lt;a href=\"Fishbot%205000\"&gt;Fishbot 5000&lt;/a&gt; NPC for special rewards. These fish do not expire, and can be saved to be turned in during a future Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.\nAdditionally, fishers can catch a &lt;a href=\"Rockhide%20Strongfish\"&gt;Rockhide Strongfish&lt;/a&gt;, which can be equipped as a one-handed mace!"}

The news was troubling; with the recent wars in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, far from the shores of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, business had been struggling of late. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; frowned. It would be difficult to draw visitors back to his colorful port without a gimmick of some kind; the old wounds between &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; still ran deep in the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the day.\nThe light in the room disappeared suddenly. Revilgaz turned to find the large, grizzled &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Seahorn\"&gt;Fleet Master&lt;/a&gt; in the doorway. \"There's some nutty goblin rowing into the harbor,\" Seahorn rumbled. \"He's shouting your name over and over. Sounds like a damn parrot.\"\nCurious, the Baron walked out onto the balcony, his eyes seeking this mysterious visitor. The search was short; he quickly sighted the simple rowboat tied at the dock, as well as the bruisers escorting the owner. From this height, it was impossible to confirm the identity of the individual, but at the least it would prove a distraction from the trials of administration.\nThe escort reached his balcony at last and pushed the guest forward. Revilgaz arched a brow at the thin goblin before him, trying hard to maintain his smile as his nostrils were assailed by the stench of fish. \"It's &lt;a href=\"Riggle%20Bassbait\"&gt;Riggle Bassbait&lt;/a&gt;, isn't it?\" he said, determined to get through this meeting as quickly as possible. \"What can I do for you?\"\nRiggle's face split into a hopeful smile. \"You remember me! Please, Baron Revilgaz, I've just made the most amazing discovery. It's sure to breathe life back into the fishing industry, you mark my words! There's just one problem. . .\" The fisherman rubbed the back of his neck nervously. \"I don't have the &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; I'd need to properly fund such an operation. I don't suppose you could give me a loan. . .?\"\nRevilgaz's smile vanished instantly, all pretense of friendliness gone. \"I already extended you credit once, Bassbait. I can't afford to be handing out favors; particularly not now. Sorry I can't be of more help.\" He gestured dismissively to the bruisers, who took hold of Riggle's wrists.\n\"Wait!\" the angler cried, fighting as the bruisers pulled him away. \"I brought a sample of what I've found. Please, let me prepare it for you!\"\nA sigh escaped the Baron's lips. \"Oh, all right. I hope you're not wasting my time.\"\nAn hour later, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cook\"&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt;s presented the Baron with a steaming plate of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;. The master angler stood to one side, wringing his hands anxiously, as Revilgaz took a tentative bite. His eyes flew wide as soon as the meat hit his tongue. \"This is fantastic!\" the Baron exclaimed. \"What is this? I've never tasted the like.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Tastyfish\"&gt;Tastyfish&lt;/a&gt;, I call it,\" Bassbait said with a sheepish grin. \"I can get more, but I need money first. . .\"\nRevilgaz stood and patted the fisherman's shoulder. \"I have a better idea, one that will serve us both. I'll have my economy bustling again, and you will have your name on the lips of every angler in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Come, let's discuss the terms.\" With that, he led the curious Riggle into his office. . .\nWeeks later, a satisfied Baron Revilgaz looked out over his beloved town, adventurers pouring from the recently arrived ships. Goblin vendors were out among the new arrivals, doing brisk business on bait and tackle. Beside the Baron, an amazed Riggle Bassbait stood with jaw agape.\n\"You see?\" Revilgaz said with a grin. \"Everyone's here for your new tournament. They'll catch the fish you seed along the coast, and everyone profits.\" He clapped the angler on the back. \"Go seed the waters; they're anxious to begin. Oh - and make sure to keep the water around Booty Bay itself clear; I'd rather the participants have to hike a bit. They'll be thirstier when they get here; all the better for business.\"\nRiggle hurried down to the &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;, his mind awhirl. At long last, his favorite sport would be back in the limelight. Soon everyone would know the name of Riggle Bassbait, Angler Extraordinaire!\nDetails.\nThe Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is a grand new event set along the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.

After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Stranglethorn Vale was split by a large sinkhole containing a raging whirlpool called &lt;a href=\"Sundering%20%28Stranglethorn%20Vale%29\"&gt;The Sundering&lt;/a&gt; at its center. The areas of Stranglethorn are now known as &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; (aka Stranglethorn Jungle) and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;The Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe region is remarkable for three aspects. Its exotic and dangerous jungles, which requires preparations of antidotes against its deadly flora and fauna. Its &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, rarer than in the glory days of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but still present and hunting in the lands of their ancestors. They are known to be strong for close combat. Last but not least, its &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, swarming in the region, the most notable of them are members of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nThe Vale was the primary center of the trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and their cities were dotted all over the region.\nIn troll legends, it is said that the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; first made its appearance on the coast of Stranglethorn. It was found and picked up by a wandering troll warrior. Intrigued by the blue stone he found, he took it with him on his journey. As time passed, the troll discovered that the stone gave him control over water. He could summon &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, manipulate the tides, and accomplish feats that only the powerful mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; were able to manifest. The warrior traveled back to Zul'Gurub to show his newfound abilities to the Emperor. He gained the court's audience easily with his powers and gained the title \"Tidebearer\", leaving his old name behind. The troll also received a place of honor in the Court of Gurubashi. Tidebearer served the Gurubashi Empire for years, but as time wore on, he became more reclusive. The Stone of Tides carried a curse as well. The Bearer of the stone would start to fade over time until he would disappear from the physical world forever. Keeping this secret from the Empire, the Tidebearer went to the beach where he found the stone and walked into the water, where he disappeared. Many generations later the stone would wash upon the Vale and be picked up by a new Tidebearer. This process would continue, and Tidebearers would come and go just as the last before them.\n1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful Gurubashi Empire was torn apart by a massive &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. An influential group of Gurubashi priests called forth the avatar of an ancient and terrible blood god named &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; and named themselves the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;, soon a large amount of Gurubashi joined and became devout followers of Hakkar. With their newfound power, the Gurubashi Empire began to soundly defeat nearby &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; clans, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; tribes as well as trolls who opposed Hakkar. Under Hakkar, the Gurubashi and Hakkari began conquering large swaths of land as well as outlying islands around the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, achieving all that they had hoped for.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; began to observe the events from afar, at first pleased with how the Gurubashi had begun to return to conquest and traditional worship. Though it soon became clear that Hakkar's bloodlust would \"never\" be sated, the fiendish god would drive not only the troll race to destruction but the entire world as well.\nIt did not take long before the Zandalari rallied their forces and set sail towards the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; where they met with Gurubashi trolls who had hidden their dissent from the Hakkari. The Zandalari and their new Gurubashi allies quickly learned that a faction of Hakkar's most zealous priests, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, were attempting to summon the loa's spirit into a living form. This would awaken terrible new dimensions of his power and spell certain doom for the troll race.\nHorrified by the plans, the Zandalari hosts stormed the Gurubashi capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Battles raged among the vine-covered ziggurats of the temple city day and night. Though finally, atop of Hakkar's bloodstained shrine, the Zandalari defeated Hakkar and most of his crazed followers. A number of his fanatical Atal'ai priests had though escaped into the jungles surrounding Zul'Gurub, in time these trolls finally settled in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; north of the Gurubashi capital. In the heart of the wild marshland, they secretly constructed a great temple to their bloodthirsty loa: the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last emperor of the Gurubashi was &lt;a href=\"Var%27gazul\"&gt;Var'gazul&lt;/a&gt;. From his capital, he prepared plans of war, an invasion on an unknown enemy. However his plans were thwarted by the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt;, which destroyed the land west of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and sunk the city of &lt;a href=\"I%27lalai\"&gt;I'lalai&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Empire's fall, the cities of the troll empire fell into ruin, although they are still populated by trolls.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; went rogue, she was found and confronted by &lt;a href=\"Tarthen\"&gt;Tarthen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in Stranglethorn Vale. In terms of the power used by the two magi, the duel that ensued was one of the greatest to have ever occurred between a Tirisgarde and the renegade Guardian. But it was also one of the shortest. Tarthen bore &lt;a href=\"%3AEbonchill\"&gt;:Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt; in battle--the greatstaff reported stolen some months ago. When he unleashed the weapon's stored power on Aegwynn, she immediately turned the energies back on him with a counterspell. A storm of frost magic surged over Tarthen, encasing him in a layer of diamond-hard ice. Despite the hot weather in the region, Tarthen was still frozen solid when the members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; found him. It took considerable effort to thaw his corpse and free Ebonchill from his lifeless hand.\nBooty Bay.\n&lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; was originally a former small port town inhabited by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s which was overrun by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; managed to drive out the trolls from the immediate area to claim the shores of the cove for their new center for operations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Booty Bay. This happened prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, as Booty Bay was already territory of the Steamwheedle Cartel by then. \nFirst War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded Azeroth most of their forces waged war against the humans of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; into Stranglethorn Vale, which reminded the orcs of their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the Bleeding Hollow were determined to claim Stranglethorn for themselves, however the Gurubashi refused to share their lands with outsiders and the two forces would clash in battle. Though the Gurubashi were weakened by the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt; their knowledge of the land allowed for them to launch a guerrilla campaign to drive the invading Bleeding Hollow out of the region. Kilrogg and his Bleeding Hollow would eventually be ordered to retreat by &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; after he learned of the conflict and concluded that too many orcs were dying for no apparent gain.\nAt an unknown point in time the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; were forced out of Stranglethorn.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe crafty &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s set up their mining and deforesting operations here. The goblins have maintained a tenuous hold over these remote facilities, but they remain threatened by the jungle trolls' growing obsession with purging their ancient lands of any and all foreign invaders.\nStranglethorn is as deadly as it is beautiful. The Vale is inhabited by a large variety of beasts and hostile creatures that low level characters should not face alone. The primary sapient inhabitants are the &lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp\"&gt;Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter&lt;/a&gt; trolls, in the northwest and east respectively. The troll city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; sits in a valley in the northeast, which was once the capital of Troll civilization in Stranglethorn. In the north is a small village controlled by the renegade &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Kurzen\"&gt;Colonel Kurzen&lt;/a&gt;. Other inhabitants include an encampment of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Off the southeast coast is &lt;a href=\"Jaguero%20Isle\"&gt;Jaguero Isle&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by the enormous gorilla &lt;a href=\"King%20Mukla\"&gt;King Mukla&lt;/a&gt;. There is a renegade group of sailors, known as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, who have built camps on the southwestern and southern shores of Stranglethorn Vale. A small population of &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit some underwater ruins in the northwest. The &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; also has two mining operations in Stranglethorn. In the northwest, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Tribe\"&gt;Zandalar Tribe&lt;/a&gt; has its base in &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The Water Gate from Deadmines can also been seen north of Yojamba Isle, though it cannot be entered.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Stranglethorn Vale was invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nStranglethorn Vale has been split by a large sinkhole containing a raging whirlpool called &lt;a href=\"Sundering%20%28Stranglethorn%20Vale%29\"&gt;The Sundering&lt;/a&gt; at its center.

Another Alliance camp called &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Livingston\"&gt;Fort Livingston&lt;/a&gt; was also errected while the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; moved from &lt;a href=\"Yojamba%20Isle\"&gt;Yojamba Isle&lt;/a&gt; along with their structures.

The from the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; can also been seen north of Yojamba Isle, though it cannot be entered.\nThe weekly &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt; event happens every Sunday from 2-4pm.\nPvP.\nIn addition to the inhabitants listed above, the zone is populated by a large variety of relatively high level wild creatures. On PvP servers, it is a strategically important area, given that it is sandwiched between both Horde and Alliance territories, and thus it is also often one of the most actively contested areas in the game. This is particularly true of the area immediately surrounding Nesingwary's Expedition at the north end of the zone, near the Duskwood border. However, questing and hunting here is challenging and profitable, provided you can dodge the bullets. Some high level players love ganking, especially around the Bal'lal Ruins and between Booty Bay and Grom'Gol Base Camp.\nStranglethorn should probably be avoided by flagged players under level 30, and even those above level 30 would be well advised to travel in groups of three or more. Only the brave should enter alone.\nHistory.\nStranglethorn Vale has for millennia been the home of the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the Gurubashi came to be unduly cruel, sacrificing trolls of other tribes to their evil god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. After an extensive civil war, the tribes of Stranglethorn split, forever becoming enemies. The &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe was one of these tribes, eventually driven offshore by a band of rampaging &lt;a href=\"murlocs\"&gt;murlocs&lt;/a&gt; and taken in by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, Stranglethorn remains a wild place full of danger.\nThe Stone Of The Tides\nExcerpt from &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Legends of the Gurubashi, Volume III&lt;/a&gt;\n\"\"The ancient Gurubashi Empire was a source of many fascinating and intriguing legends that can be, no doubt, traced to their Environs. As examinations of their belief systems Societal practices have pointed to a great reverence for their natural surroundings. The Gurubashi Empire was surrounded on three sides by sea, so it comes as little surprise that water would figure prominently as an aspect of their society. Recent discoveries during Surveys of the Troll ruins in Stranglethorn have shown reference to an object called the \"Stone of the Tides\". Various fragments of troll legends can be pieced together to paint a rather complete picture of the stone and its importance to the Gurubashi Empire. It appears that the Stone of the Tides allowed its bearer to control water in its many forms.\"\"\nIn Troll legends, it is said that the Stone first made its appearance on the coast of Stranglethorn. It was found and picked up by a wandering Troll warrior. Intrigued by the blue stone he found, he took it with him on his journey. As time passed, the troll discovered that the stone gave him control over water. He could summon &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, manipulate the tides, and accomplish feats that only the powerful mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; were able to manifest. The warrior traveled back to Zul'Gurub to show his newfound abilities to the Emperor. He gained the court's audience easily with his powers and gained the title \"Tidebearer\", leaving his old name behind. The troll also received a place of honor in the Court of Gurubashi. Tidebearer served the Gurubashi Empire for years, but as time wore on, he became more reclusive. The Stone of Tides carried a curse as well. The Bearer of the stone would start to fade over time until he would disappear from the physical world forever. Keeping this secret from the Empire, the Tidebearer went to the beach where he found the stone and walked into the water, where he disappeared. Many generations later the stone would wash upon the Vale and be picked up by a new Tidebearer. This process would continue, and Tidebearers would come and go just as the last before them.\nGeography.\nStranglethorn Vale is 3,520 yards long. This is exactly two miles.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D13\"&gt;Topographic map of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nStranglethorn Vale is home to several characters of note. In Booty Bay, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Seahorn\"&gt;Fleet Master Seahorn&lt;/a&gt; seek aid in the battle against the Bloodsail Buccaneers. In &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kin%27weelay\"&gt;Kin'weelay&lt;/a&gt; attempts to rid the jungle of the bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Bloodscalp\"&gt;Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20Tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. In the Rebel Camp, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Doren\"&gt;Lieutenant Doren&lt;/a&gt; and his men seek to usurp the choke hold the evil &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Kurzen\"&gt;Colonel Kurzen&lt;/a&gt; has put on the northern forest, and at his expedition camp, &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt; sends bold hunters into the deepest parts of the vale in search of rare and exotic animals. Gnaz and Knaz Blunderflame have a small gnome house in the mountains above the Mosh'ogg ogre mound. They both sell engineering supplies to those who can find them.\nWarcraft III.\nA \"Warcraft III\" map exists called Stranglethorn Vale."}

Originally a na\u00efve priestess of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, she gains combat experience while fighting the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat.

She can only remember being raised by her older sister, &lt;a href=\"Samaara\"&gt;Samaara&lt;/a&gt;; it is unknown what happened to their parents. She grew up in the &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, the center of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; for her people, and as an adult served as an acolyte. Devoted to her beliefs and her studies, she showed promise as a healer. Prophet noticed her talent. He invited her to train as his pupil and began to teach her the value of leadership and sacrifice. But Yrel carried a dark secret within her. Velen sensed it, and he foresaw that for good or ill, she had a larger role to play. Yet when she considered her prospects, Yrel preferred to stay inside the temple, quietly caring for those around her. Unfortunately, that ideal did not survive.\nHer peaceful life was shattered when the savage &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; clans forged themselves into a fighting force named the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and set out to conquer Draenor. Yrel was captured and flung into a war. Now, she stands at the brink of greatness. Whatever her fate, Yrel is not destined to remain a humble acolyte in the Temple of Karabor. Draenor is in danger, and she's called to do something more: to shield her people from oblivion.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAssault on the Dark Portal.\nYrel was initially encountered by the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; expedition during their mission in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, where she was being held by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; as a slave in &lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Halls\"&gt;Umbral Halls&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer found her after she had killed &lt;a href=\"Ankova%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Ankova the Fallen&lt;/a&gt; in self-defense, the first time she'd taken a life. She then joined &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s group. Upon leaving the cave, she and Liadrin healed the former Frostwolf and draenei prisoners. After the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, she accompanied the Alliance onto the ships of the Iron Horde.\nShadowmoon Valley.\nShe escaped with them to . There, her mentor Velen greeted them and gave them a piece of land called &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; on which to establish a garrison. While the first perimeters were being built, Yrel asked the garrison's commander to kill &lt;a href=\"Quakefist\"&gt;Quakefist&lt;/a&gt; who was terrorizing the draenei. Afterwards, she left with the Prophet only to be sent back into the Garrison in order to show the commander the valley. They left for &lt;a href=\"Embaari%20Village\"&gt;Embaari Village&lt;/a&gt;, where her sister, &lt;a href=\"Samaara\"&gt;Samaara&lt;/a&gt;, lived. After their reunion, Samaara went to fight the who had started attacking the draenei in the north. In the meantime, Yrel rejoined the Prophet in &lt;a href=\"Teluuna%20Observatory\"&gt;Teluuna Observatory&lt;/a&gt; where captured draenei, Samaara included. Yrel and the adventurer confronted the Warlord but he escaped with the captives into &lt;a href=\"Shaz%27gul\"&gt;Shaz'gul&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only &lt;a href=\"Karnoth\"&gt;Karnoth&lt;/a&gt;, Shard of the Dark Star. Karnoth was killed by the adventurer and their allies. Afterwards, she and Velen went to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Glade\"&gt;Twilight Glade&lt;/a&gt; from where she was sent to rescue the draenei.\nIn Shaz'gul, she led a group of the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; who were all captured and executed. Only Yrel was spared as the others forced her to hide just before they were discovered. As she was hiding, heartbroken at the loss of her Rangari, the adventurer was placing bombs around the village. Upon finding Yrel, the adventurer convinced her to fight on. Once the bombs exploded, the two escaped while the orcs were in chaos. The Prophet and his student then went to &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20Fortress\"&gt;Anguish Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. After the commander disabled the protection, the draenei reached the top of the area and saw the Warlord and his Warchief introducing him the power of the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. After the orcs left, the draenei defeated a Void Lord. Yrel then found her sister on the brink of death. When Samaara succumbed to her wounds, Yrel swore to become strong in order to protect her people. She returned to Embaari from which she went to confront Ner'zhul once more. Though the draenei were initially unsuccessful and Ner'zhul summoned the , it was stopped by the Prophet by sacrificing himself. Before going to meet his destiny, he passed the mark on his head to Yrel. The Dark Star was purified back into the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; K'ara. At that moment, the Iron Horde invaded &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; quickly informed her of this and recommended to gather the draenei and flee, but Yrel was eager to fight on or Velen's death would be for naught. She flew to Karabor and started fighting against the orcs. She got to the harbor where, with the help of the adventurer and K'ara, annihilated the enemy forces and its leader, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Vorka\"&gt;Commander Vorka&lt;/a&gt;. She returned to Embaari and announced victory, thanked the adventurer and gave them &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%27s%20Arcanum\"&gt;The Prophet's Arcanum&lt;/a&gt;, Velen's hologram.\nGorgrond.\nShe and Maraad decided to send an expedition into &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; in order to discover its secrets and use them against the Iron Horde. Eventually, they too ventured there and sent the commander ahead to find . Unfortunately her &lt;a href=\"Naielle%27s%20Watch\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; had been attacked by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;. The commander eliminated the threat, and the remaining draenei with &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the heart of Gorgrond and stationed themselves in &lt;a href=\"Highpass\"&gt;Highpass&lt;/a&gt;. Yrel and her group of Rangari then continued to fight the Primals until the genesaur &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt; was killed and the &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Genesaur\"&gt;Will of the Genesaur&lt;/a&gt; was claimed. With the newfound artifacts and new allies, she led an attack on Iron Approach to the north. They destroyed an enemy army, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gar\"&gt;Commander Gar&lt;/a&gt;, and the gronn . They lost the artifacts, however, and she wanted to regroup in the Garrison and plan their next move.\nTalador.\nYrel, Maraad and Thaelin then ventured into Talador to halt the Iron Horde's invasion. She started worrying about Maraad's anger. On her orders, explosives were stolen and used to destroy their weapons. When the army stationed in Tuurem was destroyed, she joined Khadgar near Shattrath to plan their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;counter-attack&lt;/a&gt;. She claimed that Maraad was lost in anger and accompanied the group into Shattrath's harbor where she defended the archmage. Eventually, she, Maraad and attacked on his flagship. The Warlord overcame his enemies and almost killed everyone. In his last moments of life, Maraad used his remaining power and summoned an energy shield to protect Yrel. She then saw Blackhand walking to Durotan so she picked up Maraad's hammer and tossed it at Blackhand. The warlord grabbed Yrel but she quickly healed Durotan who threw his axe and Yrel cut it into Blackhand. The two and the bodies of their fallen comrades were then teleported back to the harbor while the ship exploded. Afterwards, she returned to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wrynn\"&gt;Fort Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nNagrand.\n in was attacked by the and Yrel, now a Vindicator, suggested to build a new base for the Alliance and immediately gave necessary orders. Yrel herself was found north of &lt;a href=\"Telaari%20Station\"&gt;Telaari Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Yrel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Yrel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. When the troubles of the Warsong clan, and the Highmaul ogres in &lt;a href=\"Mar%27gok%27s%20Overwatch\"&gt;Mar'gok's Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; dealt with, she sent her force into &lt;a href=\"Lok-rath\"&gt;Lok-rath&lt;/a&gt; to capture the Warsong orcs. She sent the commander to the captured leader, &lt;a href=\"Uruk%20Foecleaver\"&gt;Uruk Foecleaver&lt;/a&gt;, but the orcs refused to yield. Yrel had one more task for the commander - Thaelin had sent her boxes full of baby &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; as a prank and she asked him to collect them and sent them back to the dwarf in order to get her revenge. Once the Alliance forces were gathered and ready, she led the attack on &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;. After killing , she ordered &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20D%27kaan\"&gt;Rangari D'kaan&lt;/a&gt; to guard the entrance to Garrosh's throne area. With the words that Maraad would be proud of her, D'kaan blew the gate, and Yrel with the commander entered and started fighting Garrosh. The fight was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; who challenged him to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Yrel was then seen with the Frostwolf orcs, Horde, and Alliance planning their next steps near the Stones of Prophecy where Garrosh was killed.\nGarrison Campaign.\nYrel returned to Shadowmoon and visited the Garrison, telling &lt;a href=\"Deedree\"&gt;Deedree&lt;/a&gt; to send the commander to Elodor. Yrel explained that she had been invited by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; to face the Exarch trials, but she needs help with three tasks. She entered and defeated the fallen and Maraad who told her she was indeed ready. She also needed to kill the fury &lt;a href=\"Everburn\"&gt;Everburn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and help the Rangari in Nagrand with their poison problem in &lt;a href=\"Cerulean%20Lagoon\"&gt;Cerulean Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;. After it was done, her final task was to defeat the remaining Exarchs - &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, Naielle, and . Once she did it, Maladaar announced her as Exarch and joined the Council and the coliseum in Karabor exploded in joy.\nShe is ultimately seen leading the Alliance in the attack on Gates of Tanaan after the death of &lt;a href=\"Azuka\"&gt;Azuka&lt;/a&gt; confronting . Grommash \"invited\" them to Tanaan.\nFury of Hellfire.\nYrel arrived to Lunarfall and met with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. She praised his tactical strategies. Yrel joined with the Alliance commander to seek out a shipyard constructor named &lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt;. The orc told them to put a hammer in his hands and fight about it. The Exarch proclaimed that she didn't want him dead for they needed a shipwright. When the first transport was finished, they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. After scouting the eastern area and disabling Iron Horde's machinery, Lion's Watch is established. She was determined to fight in the name of the Light and her loved ones even the end of the world should come. Yrel then told the Alliance commander to seek out Maladaar in the west. She feared that he may have encountered the brunt of Gul'dan's forces.\nUpon hearing of renewed Shadow Council activity within Auchindoun, she and &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; return and discover it to be under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;. They are able to push the traitorous Draenei out and discover Teron'gor had continued devouring souls up until he was recovered by &lt;a href=\"Tyrant%20Velhari\"&gt;Tyrant Velhari&lt;/a&gt;. Teron'gor, now calling himself Gorefiend, is cut off from his feast of souls and Auchindoun is saved once again as Gorefiend leaves for . A renegade &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; named told the Alliance commander that Gul'dan is about to find the &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. Although too late to deliver the message sooner, he and Yrel disabled a barrier in &lt;a href=\"Corrupt%20Refuge\"&gt;Corrupt Refuge&lt;/a&gt; where Gul'dan just summoned &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh\"&gt;Cyrukh&lt;/a&gt;. The two casters were left weakened by the spell but the commander killed the elemental lord, destroying the Cipher and thwarting Gul'dan's plan. Yrel thanked him for it.\nSome time later, Yrel was told by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; that the Alliance commander had accomplished great things. She and the other Exarch gather in Karabor and witness the blessing of naaru enhancing the commander's legendary ring. Yrel and the draenei people will stand with the commander to the end. After this, she says that she would like to see Azeroth and comments that it must be an amazing world.\nYrel accompanies Khadgar and Grommash as they fight &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; alongside with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After Archimonde is defeated, Yrel tells Khadgar that they will help him if he ever needs the people of Draenor. She vows to see Draenor rebuilt.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28Hellfire%20Citadel%20tactics%29\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; worked together to drive the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from . The two peoples then lived in peace alongside each other for years. During this time, more &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Draenor and, without &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to fight, the draenei became fixated upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Draenor began to deteriorate for unknown reasons. The Lightbound believed that the orcs were choking the life from Draenor and dooming the land to desiccation, and blamed the Mag'har for the once-fertile land becoming lifeless dust, while believed that it was the Light that had doomed the planet. Having received visions from the , the High Exarch knew that the Army of the Light would bring order to countless worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. But first, the Mag'har needed to be taught to trust the naaru as well, for they brought peace and order. The naaru compelled the draenei to spread their influence among the orcs.\nThe Lightbound sent sermons, explaining they wished for all the people of Draenor to be unified in purpose. Those resisting the Light were seen as an infection that prevented \"Draenor's heart from being whole\". A few orcs converted to the Light willingly, but others had the Light forced upon them. Some orcs even sided with the draenei against their own kin, including Grommash's &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Hellscream\"&gt;own son&lt;/a&gt;. War followed, until the two sides found themselves in a stalemate in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lightbound refused to attack &lt;a href=\"Hellsreach%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellsreach Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Yrel confronted Grommash, referring to him as an old friend and attempting to get him to stand down. Grommash held her off while a group of Mag'har led by &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Draka and the deceased Durotan, fled to Azeroth. The outcome of her fight with Grommash is unknown.\nQuotes.\nShadowmoon Valley.\nMaraad says his injury is not serious, but in truth, he was gravely wounded by Ner'zul. Though I am not sure which suffered greater ill - his body or his pride.\nNevertheless, he was very lucky you showed up when you did.\nSomeday I hope to see this \"Azeroth\" of yours.

During the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, Yrgrim stood at the clan's bloody vanguard, leading brutal raids against the good-natured &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. However, at some point during the war the battle lust left Yrgrim, and he decided that 'Killing for the sake of killing... conquering for the sake of conquest... there is no honor in such things. There is only shame and regret.' So he saved a group of earthen by killing a group of vrykul that had cornered them, and took the earthen to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;. Though Yrgrim expected to be punished by his transgressions, Tyr asked him for his help against the Winterskorn vrykul instead. Yrgrim took an oath to the twin moons that he would serve Tyr and embody his noble ideals. In return, Tyr and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; created a massive shield called &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;, and gave it to Yrgrim to help him expose &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery. Yrgrim stood by Tyr's side during the rest of the Winterskorn War.\nMigration to Stormheim.\nWhen Tyr and his allies later stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; and fled, Yrgrim stayed behind and held off many of Loken's servants, including several &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt;s. After defeating them, Yrgrim sensed the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi's foul presence as they passed by underground, following Tyr's trail. Yrgrim raced south in pursuit of the creatures, and reached the place of Tyr's last battle in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, after he had defeated the C'Thraxxi and given his life. Yrgrim helped build the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to stay guarding his tomb. While most other refugees continued south, the vrykul were moved by Yrgrim's example and stayed with him.\nYrgrim stayed at Tirisfal Glades for several years, teaching the vrykul there about the pursuit of justice and nobility. Once he decided that he had taught them all that he could, tired after all his battles, he departed to find a champion that could bear &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt; in his stead. Knowing that others of his kind had fled the north, he went in search of them, hoping to find someone worthy to pass on his armaments. Eventually, he found &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; and strong descendants of his race.\nOn an island, Yrgrim built an arena. He proclaimed to his brethren that he sought a successor strong in will and body, and pure in heart. They would have to pass his trials in order to claim his weapons. Many berserkers and dragonriders answered Yrgrim's challenge, but all met with failure and death. Yrgrim held his trials for years until the challengers stopped coming.\nYrgrim then built a shine to Tyr in a complex that would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt; on the same island. Yrgrim crafted a door that would judge anyone before it as the first test of their spirit and body. The door wards would burn those that tried to open it with cleansing flame. Only those strong of will and pure of heart would be able to hold back the flames. If they had the strength to bear its gaze, they would be allowed in. Yrgrim then entombed himself in the shrine with his weapons, waiting for a time when a true champion would come. Since Yrgrim was never affected by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, he could patiently await inside the tomb for thousands of years. The ghost of a vrykul female known as &lt;a href=\"Runeshaper%20Griselda\"&gt;Runeshaper Griselda&lt;/a&gt; accompanied him in his long vigil. The island the shrine was built on would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, as it became the resting place of the shield &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany years later, a vrykul from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Gorvold%20Ironbrow\"&gt;Gorvold Ironbrow&lt;/a&gt; heard about Truthguard and Yrgrim, and followed his trail up to his shrine in Stormheim. Gorvold was, however, unable to pass Yrgrim's test, and returned defeated to Northrend.\nDelivering Truthguard.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Shield's Rest to recover Truthguard. After successfully passing the test at the shrine's doors, the Highlord battled Yrgrim and Griselda, defeating them in combat. Yrgrim conceded that the Highlord was worthy of his shield, and passed both Truthguard and his sword, &lt;a href=\"Oathseeker\"&gt;Oathseeker&lt;/a&gt;, to the champion. After that, indicating that he was weary, he retreated to the shrine and apparently turned to stone.\nQuotes.\nWhen the Highlord enters the shrine"}

Bound to this ethereal realm, she descended into an endless trance and became known thereafter as the Dreamer. She would later fight off the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and the corruption of her &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;children.&lt;/a&gt;\nYsera, now nicknamed the Awakened, recently awoke from her slumber within the Emerald Dream during the events of ', though she was not yet able to consistently tell the difference between dream and reality; while she was still sane, she was not yet entirely coherent. Ysera aided the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and other forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. She, along with her fellow Aspects, eventually gave up their titan-given power to stop their mad brother &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;last stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe continued to provide guidance and wisdom to all who revere nature, acting as mentor to the druids of Azeroth. Ysera was ultimately corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and was, with much sadness, slain by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Following her death, her spirit came to reside in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In time, the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; personally ressurected Ysera from a &lt;a href=\"Wildseed\"&gt;Wildseed&lt;/a&gt;, binding the Dreamer to Ardenweald itself in the process. Although Ysera is now alive, being bound to Ardenweald keeps her from leaving the Shadowlands. This was eventually circumvented by having &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; take her place in the Shadowlands, allowing her to return to Azeroth.\nYsera is also the foster mother of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDawn of the Aspects (past).\nYsera was one of the more intelligent of &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of her kind. Born smaller than the average proto-drake, Ysera was sick and a yellowish color. She and her two siblings, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dralad\"&gt;Dralad&lt;/a&gt;, were the only survivors of their clutch. While someone as small as Ysera would have normally be killed soon after hatching, Alexstrasza took care of her little sister.\nOn a day when dozens of proto-dragons gathered to hunt caribou, Ysera approached a blue-white proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; to ask him about her brother's corpse, which Malygos had found alongside Alexstrasza. She said that there was another corpse she and Alexstrasza had found, though Alexstrasza reprimanded her, saying they had agreed not to speak of that. The two argued, but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. After the gigantic terror had flown away, a confident grey proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; taunted them all for being afraid.\nYsera and Alexstrasza would later come across the shriveled-up corpses of two proto-dragons, including Malygos's old companion &lt;a href=\"Tarys\"&gt;Tarys&lt;/a&gt;. A small and terrified purple proto-dragon insisted that Galakrond had devoured the dead dragons, which matched theories Malygos had expressed to the two sisters. They went to fetch Malygos so he could meet the purple dragon. After his arrival, the corpses stirred and attacked as undead. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Ysera tore them apart.\nLike the other proto-dragons Ysera would gather under the command of &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt;. However unlike the alpha Ysera would be opposed to violence and preached her belief that peace could be made with Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;, to the dismay of her friends. Ysera's dream of peace was supported by &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt; who used his sway to help Talonixa give Ysera a chance to talk of her plan with everyone else. While seemingly supporting her Malygos later learned that Coros used the meeting as a distraction so that he could join up Galakrond unnoticed following its conclusion in which Talonixa swayed the other proto-dragons to her side on fighting Galakrond.\nWitnessing Coros's betrayal and subsequent devouring by Galakrond, Malygos would return to the others only to find Ysera and Talonixa in conflict over the fate of the bitten proto-dragons who had begun to act as Galakrond. Seemingly subjecting to Ysera's desire for them to still live, Talonixa decreed that the bitten would have to be quarantined for the safety of everyone else. Agreeing to this condition Ysera watched the bitten dragons be herded into a canyon and then watched in shock as Talonixa collapsed it, eventually killing all those trapped inside. It was after this event that Ysera would notice that Malygos had been bitten on his leg and would keep silent about it.\nVehemently opposed to fighting Ysera become somewhat fanatical in her quest for peace to the point where heedless to the consequences she approached Galakrond, even as Talonixa and the others were fighting his undead minions. Even as the proto-dragon army put a dent in Galakrond's not-living forces, Ysera was only saved from certain by the timely intervention by her sister. As Galakrond began to fight the Proto-dragon army, the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Tyr\"&gt;Watcher Tyr&lt;/a&gt; used one of the not-living to catch the sisters attention.\nSome time after, Malygos found his way to the three of them, and Ysera attacked him when he tried to kill the bound undead proto-dragon. As Tyr spoke with Malygos, Ysera freed the undead proto-dragon in order to make it see reason, an action that could have killed her if not for Malygos's timely intervention. After destroying the undead Malygos briefly succumbed to the hunger for flesh, but Ysera was able to recall him to his senses and Malygos was then cured by Tyr. Tyr then proposed hunting Galakrond and decided to stand by the proto-dragons this time, revealing a war hammer from beneath his cloak. Lastly, he pulled out an octagonal artifact, moving it to the three proto-dragons as it glowed, with the promise that he was \"trying to ensure some future.\"\nYsera would witness Galakrond returning outside the cavern, chasing Neltharion and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos and Tyr moved to the entrance to witness their battle, and Tyr was overjoyed at the proto-dragons' coordination. Alexstrasza, Malygos and a now full-sized Tyr joined in the battle. Temporarily stunning Galakrond with his hammer, Tyr ordered the proto-dragons to flee as he stayed to battle the monster.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a mountain range to the north and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the octagonal artifact before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond's slumbering place, which &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would later note in his visions was nowhere near &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the octagonal object on Tyr's belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr's hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true dragon.\nIn the battle, Tyr's hammer and the strange artifact were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the artifact, just as Galakrond's massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr's hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger. An unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. After being attacked by two not-living Ysera and the others found they could not find Tyr where they left him, concluding that some beast must have taken him for food.\nAfter recuperating Ysera and the others decide to hunt down Galakrond in order to kill him once and for all or die trying. Ysera, along with the others would be stunned to learn that Galakrond had begun to devour the not-living in order to feed his hunger and shortly after would engage in battle with the behemoth. During the battle, Ysera would work closely with Nozdormu and Galakrond would ultimately be killed after Malygos and Neltharion forced a boulder down his throat.\nAfter killing Galakrond Ysera and the others were approached by two other watchers, who revealed that they had taken Tyr to help him. Agreeing to protect Azeroth with her friends the two watchers were joined by two others and the titans acted through the keepers to transform Ysera and the others into the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where one of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that Titans created them from Galakrond. This was done to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\n&lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; blessed &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s younger sister, the lithe green &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; Ysera, with a portion of nature's influence. Ysera fell into an eternal trance, bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Known as the Dreamer, she would watch over the growing wilds of the world from her verdant realm, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nWhen fallen &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; instigated the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies fought on the earthen's side. However, when Tyr realized that they could not win against the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; alone he called upon the Dragon Aspects for aid. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn's iron ranks.\nMuch as they had done in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspects worked in unison to overwhelm the vrykul army. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, Ysera and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in tombs cities across northern Kalimdor. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; had their child &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, his birth called the attention of Ysera through the Emerald Dream. She took him under her wing and taught him much, becoming like a foster mother to him. Their relationship caused some mortals to falsely believe that she was his true mother, but their bond was not a biological one.\nYsera was one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s that gave some of her power to the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; would use it to betray them.\nWhen her dear friend &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; died to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera came to a screeching halt in the middle of combat and opened her eyes with a deafening shriek, one of the few times she had ever opened her eyes in history. As she tore through the carnage to her friend, thousands of demons were thrown in all directions with her paws and wings. Her rampage continued, making her way through to her goal, until she came still, her chin on Malorne's head; sobs could be heard as She of the Dreaming mourned the White Stag's end.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza planted a magical acorn from the Mother Tree &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; within the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. The Tree grew large until it reached the heavens and was crowned &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera enchanted the tree so that it would be bound to the Emerald Dream.\nDay of the Dragon.\nAt the behest of &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; grudgingly agreed to come out of their lairs and fight &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the power they had given to the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, they were no match for the Black Aspect - until the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was able to take the Demon Soul from &lt;a href=\"Nekros\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; and destroy it, releasing the powers the dragons had given to it ten thousand years earlier. With their powers restored, and the newly-freed &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; joining the fight, Deathwing was forced to retreat.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSome time before the events of World of Warcraft, Ysera learned about the plans of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari&lt;/a&gt;, to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, and destroyed the temple sending him beneath the water.\nYsera fell silent when the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; began, and some of her most trusted lieutenants (&lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt;) were warped by a dark power within the Emerald Dream.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nYsera appears at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, &lt;a href=\"Nishera%20the%20Garden%20Keeper\"&gt;Nishera the Garden Keeper&lt;/a&gt; asked Ysera for help against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who were raising &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s at the other &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s. Instead, Ysera, believed by Nishera to be affected by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, commanded the defenders of the Emerald Dragonshrine to attack anyone not of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nUlduar.\nDuring the battle against &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera appears in &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; form, along with the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, during a flashback of the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, ten thousand years earlier. Oddly enough, Ysera's eyes are open in the vision, the reverse of her usual habit; they are also blue, a change from both Ysera's green and the night elf norm of silver or gold.\nAgainst the Nightmare Lord.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the situation in the Emerald Dream became even more dire, as the insidious &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; unfolded his master plan to enslave Azeroth. Though Lethon tried to kidnap her, Ysera defended herself and she led the green dragons, &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s against the Nightmare. Later when &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt; was about to release &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera led her dragons to a tree where Malfurion was trapped. When the &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt; was free, Ysera saw her consort, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, trapped with the Nightmare and she rushed off to help him. However, the trapped consort was, in fact, Lethon in Eranikus' disguise and Ysera got trapped within the Nightmare. The Emerald Dream's nightmare worsened and thus the Nightmare was able to completely swallow both, the Emerald Dream and Azeroth.\nThe Aspect remained imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;Eye of Ysera&lt;/a&gt; for most of the remainder of the crisis, working with &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt; to assist Malfurion in stopping the Nightmare. Ysera was freed again by her consort Eranikus, who sacrificed himself to free her. Ysera was forced to leave the remainder of the battle to Malfurion, who was ultimately successful in stopping &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and largely halting the Nightmare. Ysera, with Alexstrasza, later presided over the long-awaited wedding of Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, and gave her blessing to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, which she had withheld when the tree was first made.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nDuring a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera arrived unannounced, her eyes open. Now known as Ysera the Awakened, she revealed that she had seen a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, and the end of all life on Azeroth. In order to prevent this terrible future, she called upon the aid of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, setting him on a quest to find &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; within the timeways.\nYsera later joined Thrall and the other Aspects in battle against the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the skies above the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and helped defeat the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic monstrosity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cataclysm era.\nYsera helped &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. She later aided in the restoration of the world tree and the war against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsera was present at both the meeting of restoring Nordrassil and the wedding of Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nFollowing his &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Bonds\"&gt;Elemental Bonds&lt;/a&gt; ordeal, Ysera realized that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had established a connection with the earth that went far beyond mere communication with the elements. She helped the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; understand and test his new abilities.\nWhile meditating, Ysera had a flashback to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that it might be the only weapon powerful enough to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera conferred with the other Aspects. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the artifact could be modified to harm Deathwing, while &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; proposed a plan to retrieve it from the past when it was in its purest form - during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nHour of Twilight.\nYsera's past self appears in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity instance&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsera also appears in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul raid&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other Aspects, she bestows her power upon the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; so &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; can use it to vanquish &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; once and for all.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; ended when a final attack from the Dragon Soul, infused with the essence of each Aspect, completely obliterated Deathwing. Alexstrasza stated that by averting the Hour of Twilight, the Aspects had fulfilled their great purpose. With their ancient powers expended, Ysera and the other remaining Aspects became mortal.\nDawn of the Aspects (present).\nAdhering to their tradition to meet when the two moons of Azeroth were at particular cycle Ysera and the other former aspects gathered together. With the loss of her aspect powers Ysera informed &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; that the fight against the Emerald Nightmare would be fought by the druids, such as &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the brief meeting Ysera, along with Alexstrasza and Nozdormu, decided that they would officially end the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Accord&lt;/a&gt; one month from now, to the shock of Kalecgos.\nLater on, Ysera and the others responded Kalecgos' request for a meeting, where using an artifact from Watcher Tyr reminded them about their past battle against Galakrond and that they didn't need to be aspects to help safeguard the world. Agreeing with him, the other three decided to continue their affairs in protecting Azeroth and that the Accord would continue. They also swore Kalecgos to secrecy about the nature of Galakrond, as they did not want anyone to follow in his dark path.\nWar Crimes.\nYsera was present at the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; begins to succumb to the Emerald Nightmare, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koda%20Steelclaw\"&gt;Koda Steelclaw&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; in place of &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; summon Ysera to ask for her aid. Ysera believes that the only way to save the Forest Lord is with the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and sends an adventurer to a nearby temple of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve them.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; attacks the temple and steals the Tears of Elune before Malfurion can use them to save Cenarius. Without the Tears, Cenarius succumbs to corruption, and Malfurion pursues Xavius in his rage at the loss of his &lt;a href=\"shan%27do\"&gt;shan'do&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Xavius is not done taking from Malfurion: when Ysera and an adventurer locate Xavius, he is able to use the Tears to corrupt the former Aspect herself, turning her into a dragon of Nightmare. Xavius and Ysera retreat with Malfurion held captive, followed by the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nA reunion with Tyrande is something Xavius has longed for for many years. With Malfurion held captive, Xavius gives the High Priestess an ultimatum: she can pursue him and spend her husband's last moments at his side, or she can return to the Temple of Elune and protect it from Xavius's forces which will be led by Ysera. Mournful and distraught, Tyrande chooses her goddess and the oath to her order over her love, though the decision hurts her. At the temple, Ysera is put to rest, and with her last breath she states that the nightmare felt so real.\nUpon her death, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; reached down and cleansed Ysera's spirit and body as well as the Tears of Elune. Ysera's spirit was seen lifted by tendrils of &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; and disappeared in a dragon-shaped &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the outline of her body in new plant growth.\nIn the final battle against Xavius, the Dream of Ysera helps players fight off the Nightmare. After the Emerald Dream is cleansed following Xavius' defeat, the ghost of Ysera can be seen walking towards a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;-touched flower in a cave.\nShadowlands.\nYsera's &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; was one of the last to arrive in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; ceased operating. She was eventually revived by the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; personally, at the request of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt;. The Winter Queen made comments about Ysera being \"[her] sister's pet\". According to the Winter Queen, Ysera is now bound to Ardenweald and will share its fate. While the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; performed a play introducing their new members from Azeroth to the rest of their Covenant, Ysera was in the audience and expressed horror and despair at both &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; stabbing Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, stating in shock that she thought the latter had only been a nightmare she had. She also was disappointed in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; going to war again. After the play was over, Ysera said that she had dreamed of Tyrande undergoing the ritual of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and is worried that her hunt will only end in tragedy.\nYsera had been having dreams of night elf souls tortured in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande consumed by vengeance, and the destruction of Ardenweald. She asked the Night Fae adventurer to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to find Tyrande, as she felt the Night Warrior would be the key to saving both the night elves and Ardenweald. Although Shandris and the Maw Walker could not convince Tyrande to give up her hunt, they did save many souls of night elves who had died in Teldrassil. Ysera said she would investigate a promising whisper she had heard regarding someone who could aid Tyrande.\nUpon discovering that &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, was once a Night Warrior in life, she sent Shandris and the Maw Walker to seek him out. The pair subsequently met with the former Night Warrior, and his husband &lt;a href=\"Qadarin\"&gt;Qadarin&lt;/a&gt;. While speaking with them, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"spriggan\"&gt;spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s, and the leader of the band cursed Qadarin with its dying breath. Part of the counter-curse required a token of lost love, which Ysera believed could be found with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; as something she had been given by her last prime consort; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. However, while Alexstrasza had indeed loved Korialstrasz, she had never loved anyone more than Ysera. Thus the Dragon Queen gave the Maw Walker &lt;a href=\"A%20Small%20Carving%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;A Small Carving of Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, which deeply touched Ysera when she saw that her gift was the token of lost love. This would ultimately prove a sufficient 'token of lost love' to help break the curse on Qadarin, and the husbands joined Ysera in her efforts to save Tyrande.\nYsera joined &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt; in trying to save &lt;a href=\"Gweyir\"&gt;Gweyir&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; curse, by sending the Maw Walker to &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; for guidance. However this would be for naught, as it was discovered there was no way to liberate those possessed by the Drust. Sometime later she sent the Maw Walker to rescue lost &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; souls from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, a task which saw the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jandria\"&gt;Jandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denalan\"&gt;Denalan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anaris%20Windwood\"&gt;Anaris Windwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ilthalaine\"&gt;Ilthalaine&lt;/a&gt;. Following this when &lt;a href=\"Flutterby\"&gt;Flutterby&lt;/a&gt; sent the Maw Walker to obtain &lt;a href=\"Anima%20Embers\"&gt;Anima Embers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera sent them to rescue Kaldorei souls that still languished within the Maw.\nAfter Thiernax deduced that the power of the Night Warrior could be dispersed amongst the past Night Warriors, Ysera sent the Maw Walker to acquire an expert tracker of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt;. She subsequently warmly greeted &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, who promised to not rest until he found the other Night Warriors. She later revealed that &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; had arrived, and through her dreams had glimpsed that he had come for the Maw Walker. She was filled with joy upon learning that &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; had been freed by the Maw. She further remarked that none could say what fate had in store for &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, whose spirit had become entwined with the essence of the fallen &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, and that the path he had embarked upon had never before been walked by a mortal soul.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly driven the Drust back to &lt;a href=\"Darkreach\"&gt;Darkreach&lt;/a&gt;, and receiving reports that &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt; was among them, Ysera sent the Maw Walker to join with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt; in dealing with the matter. However in truth this was a ruse conducted by the Drust, with \"Gorak Zhar\" in reality being a Drust-possessed Ara'lon with illusions in place to make him appear as Gorak Zhar. While the Wild Hunt was focused on Darkerach, the Drust sought to claim the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera joined with the Wild Hunt and aided them in battle against the Drust, while personally delivering the Maw Walker to the Winter Queen at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. She then joined the counter-attack against the Drust, which ended in the death of Gorak Zhar, and joined the Winter Queen's court in celebrating their victory. Ysera was pleased to have helped safeguarded Ardenweald and warned that they must remain on guard, for all was not right in the Shadowlands. She then stressed the Maw Walker must remain ready, for she foresaw that they would be needed for the coming challenges.\nChains of Domination.\nYsera aided the convents in &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;defending&lt;/a&gt; Ardenweald from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. As the fight between the &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and Banshee Queen neared its end, Ysera stepped in to aid and comfort Tyrande after Sylvanas and the Mawsworn left the battlefield. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; hoped that Ysera would be able to keep Tyrande stabilized long enough for them to save her.\nAs a result of the covenants working more closely together, Huln was able to pinpoint the location of two of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and informed Ysera to send the Maw Walker to him in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. Thus Ysera sent &lt;a href=\"Urgent%20Message%20from%20Ardenweald\"&gt;a message&lt;/a&gt; to the Maw Walker and sent them to Huln at the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Sepulcher of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, while encouraging them to hurry as she was unsure as to how long Tyrande could handle &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power. After the Maw Walker recruited &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Stonewright\"&gt;The Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; and the arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Ysera thanked them for their aid and explained that Tyrande was in dire straits. She subsequently aided them in the ritual to cleanse Tyrande of her Night Warrior's powers and as the ritual neared its ends, witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; converse as well as the creation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;the Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;. She then returned to the Heart of the Forest and bore witness to the Winter Queen using the newly created tear to remake her &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; and restore the Heart of the Forest.\nWith peace returned to Ardenweald and Tyrande saved, Ysera sent the Maw Walker to report to the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; and inform him of the rebirth of the Winter Queen's sigil.\nEternity's End.\nSometime later, Ysera witnessed Tyrande's meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where Tyrande received the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;, which had become a vessel of renewal, and that the night elven souls who had been saved from the Maw rejected the eternal tranquility in the boughs of Ardenweald by becoming a new beginning for their kin, with the seed thus embodying the cycle of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath, Tyrande, Shandris, and Ysera spoke about the seed, to which Ysera revealed that it had been touched by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;the Dream&lt;/a&gt; as well, making it a symbol of the crucial balance between life and death. She thus revealed that the seed should be brought to her daughter, as &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; should know where it should be taken. When Shandris questioned if Ysera would return to Azeroth with them, Ysera revealed that as she is bound to Ardenweald, she would not able to leave without a great sacrifice, rejected Tyrande's offer for aid as she felt that the kaldorei needed them, and stated if &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; willed then she would soar Azeroth's skies again.\nDragonflight.\nAs Ysera carried out her tasks in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, her grandson &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt; had devised a means to return her to life, and had recruited &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in this task.\nMeanwhile back on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; through the trickery and deception of &lt;a href=\"Rymek\"&gt;Rymek&lt;/a&gt; were able to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portal upon the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, successfully claiming the area and preventing the defenders from being able to breach the ice barrier around them. Though Rymek's magic prevented them from entering the grove, Merithra realized that there was a way in from death. &lt;a href=\"Somnikus\"&gt;Somnikus&lt;/a&gt; blaming himself and in intense grief from his son's death made his way to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where he informed her of the troubles faced and offered to take her place, so that she could defend the dream. However as he did not have a connection to Ardenweald, and thus could not take her bond with the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, he was unable to take her place.\nThough eager to defend the Dream, Ysera would not dare ask anyone to take her place, unless they would accept the consequences, as she did. Thus she was silent in the face of Tyrande's pleas, while Malfurion realized that he alone would have to make the switch with her. Though initially against it, Malfurion was able to convince Tyrande of the matter. With their agreement made, Ysera instructed Somnikus to inform &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; that once they reached the Dream, they would make way for the defenders. Following his departure, she and the others went to the Winter Queen, who was initially hesitant but ultimately agreed and switched her bounding from Ysera to Malfurion.\nWith the trade complete, she and adventurers made their way into the Emerald Dream, where they found it under attack by the Primalists. As they faced them and secured the path to the Ancient Bough, Ysera reflected that her connection to the Dream felt different. After reaching Azeroth, she took the fight to the Primalists, while directing adventurers with weakening the barrier and liberating the imprisoned dragons, the latter of which allowed her to reunite with Gerithus, who informed her that Rymek was at &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt;. As Ysera prepared to break the Primalists barrier, she revealed that while the Dream must be restored, it was her that had the power to do so. Following the barrier's destruction, Ysera was reunited with her daughter, Merithra, who noted that she was different, that she had been touched by Death.\nWith Ysera returned to them, the green dragonflight moved as one to save the nascent World Tree from being destroyed by Rymek. Before they departed Merithra revealed to her mortal allies that &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt; must be secure in order to eradicate the Primalist from the Emerald Dream, and that an ancient artifact within would have the power to expel their enemies all at once. However, she admitted that she didn't know if her mother had the power to use it and command it anymore but that it was something they would have to deal with once Rymek was stopped. For her part, Ysera declared that she was no longer connected to the Dream as she had once been and that someone new must arise to take her place.\nFollowing Rymek's death, mother and daughter turned their attention towards healing the Dream. When the time came to activate the power within Lunedane, Ysera encouraged her daughter to step out of the shadow of her wings and spread her own. Merithra initially refused, pointing out that the Dreamer had always been Ysera and that she wasn't ready for it. In response, Ysera remarked that few ever think they were ready, when the time came, and gave her daughter one last encouragement. Thus Merithra stepped forward, activating the power within the Lunedane, destroying the Primalists forces, and securing her place as the new Dreamer.\nFollowing this, Ysera admitted that from the moment she reentered the Dream, she knew things were different, and that it was only fitting that her daughter would be the one to ascend after she had taken care of the flight since her death, that she must in fact lead the Emerald Flight. Thus when Merithra offered to return \"The Dreamer\" mantle back to her, Ysera refused, and declared that Merithra was the leader of the green dragonflight and that when they reclaimed their full powers, she would be the Aspect. With that declaration Merithra accepted the position, pledging that she would do her best as leader of the green dragonflight and do whatever it takes. Following this mother and daughter took to the skies and flew together once more.\nAppearance and abilities.\nYsera is green, and her skin glitters with countless emeralds for scales. Her physical form is ghostly, ethereal, like watching a living dream or vision. The Emerald Dream is a place where all living beings dream when sleeping. It is a place of where sentient beings have dreams of hope, and faith for a better tomorrow. From the Emerald Dream, Ysera can observe all lesser races. Her eyes are always closed, although you can see her pupils move constantly below her eyelids as if watching many dreams at once.\nThere are only a few recorded moments in history where Ysera has opened her eyes. When she does, a person can see the eyes of many colors, like a rainbow. The eyes of every sentient creature can be seen at once through her eyes. Ysera opened her eyes during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; after seeing &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; dead, and again when addressing &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; on his druidic prowess. She opened them another time during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, when he tried to convince her to help free Alexstrasza. Ysera also opened her eyes after she regained her powers during the fight against Deathwing. Ysera fought alongside the other Dragon Aspects against the evil of Deathwing while &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Demon Soul. She regained her full powers once the Demon Soul was destroyed. (This story is told in the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\".)\nYsera can assume the form of a female from any race, which she chooses depending on whom she is talking to. Often she wears a dress of emerald green, emerald jewelry, and has emerald-green hair.\nYsera avoids and dislikes combat, especially in her realm. When angered, she is terrible, paranoid and impulsive. She keeps herself isolated in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;Eye of Ysera&lt;/a&gt; within the Emerald Dream and is rarely seen in the real world. When she does visit the living plane, she shapeshifts into a humanoid form, covered by a green hood, and her eyes are always closed.\nWhen in combat, she attacks with a greenish breath (which Malygos recalled as a breath weapon akin to that of Galakrond's, if not so debilitating), to put her opponents to sleep, and rarely strikes to kill. She prefers to neutralize her enemies and banish them away from her realm.\nYsera can travel from mind to mind to travel anywhere she wishes by entering the dreams of any living being sleeping. She may enter the dreams of a target to communicate with or warn the sleeping creature. Ysera has the ability to planeshift between the real world and the Emerald Dream.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;Though Ysera's physical form stands in front of you, her consciousness appears to shift between this world and another.&gt;\nShadowlands.\nGreeting\nFarewell\nGossip\nGossip after &lt;a href=\"Winter%27s%20Sigil\"&gt;Winter's Sigil&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;Ysera smiles warmly at you.&gt;\n&lt;Ysera's spirit is weak and strains to reach you. She is fading.&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nYsera, the Queen of Dreams, is one of the three Great Dragons who fought against the demons during the War of the Ancients. It was partly this war that convinced her to leave Azeroth and make her home in the unspoiled Emerald Dream. From this plane, she observes Azeroth but rarely interacts with its people. She does intervene when events require her presence, such as during Krasus\u2019s effort to defeat Deathwing\u2019s scheme to conquer the world.\nYsera is a guardian of nature and absolute shepherd of all that exists within her home plane. She is a highly intelligent, virtuous being who detests combat, but does not shy away from doing battle where necessary.

It had obsidian fangs and iron-like scales. It was so huge that when it stretched to its full length, its tail disappeared over the horizon, and it was capable of devouring a dozen vrykul at once. The creature is speculated to have either been one of &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Keeper Freya&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;animal followers&lt;/a&gt;, gone mad with rage, or a thing far more ancient and unspeakable, a nightmare born in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;era of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vrykul eventually defeated it, taking out its eyes and blunting its fangs, but were unable to vanquish it for good. Odyn himself seized the gigantic serpent's tail, and with a mighty swing, hurled the beast skyward. The serpent flew so high that it passed across the sun and made day into night. Ysildar sailed through the sky for days until it finally landed in the sea and sank into the depths. The serpent was never seen again.\nSpeculation.\nYsildar might be the reason serpents and serpentine creatures are associated with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and their corruptive influence, like the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;."}

Even the lowliest of fighters has living expenses that must be met. Their armor must be oiled, their bows strung, and their weapons kept in clean condition. In short, these armies require Upkeep. In \"\", Upkeep takes the form of a tax on your &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; mining that is automatically deducted from all Gold you gather. As you produce more units, the tax on your Gold income increases.\nThere are three levels of Upkeep:\nIn \"Reign of Chaos\", the Upkeep levels are decreased by 10 (No Upkeep is 0-40, Low is 41-70, High is 71-90).\nUpkeep has been included to improve tactical management for players while fostering a more aggressive style of gameplay. Players are more aggressive and turtle far less in their bases, and it gives players real strategic decisions to make about how many units they wish to control with pros and cons to each. Upkeep is also instituted to focus the game on smaller numbers of units. The more units that are allowed in the game, the less powerful &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; will be relative to your army. This is simple math. High Upkeep is MEANT to be very punishing. Players should not be in it for long, but &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; didn't want to set the harsh unit cap at 80.\nDuring play, it is wise to stay in Low Upkeep, and only move to High Upkeep when there are enough resources to maintain your army. Try not to enter High Upkeep unless you have 2-3+ Expansions.\nIf you find you are not collecting enough Gold, try to drop to a lower level of Upkeep or gain control of additional &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gold Mines&lt;/a&gt; to counter the reduced income."}

It does a Mortal Strike, reducing healing by 10% per stack, stacking very quickly. Tanks should taunt Stinky around every five stacks of Mortal Strike.\nThe Plague Stench raid wide AoE is pretty heavy and healers should keep a sharp eye, mostly before and after a Decimate.\nStinky gives 150 points toward the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nStinky and Precious have a mechanic which temporarily greatly increases &lt;a href=\"weapon%20skill\"&gt;weapon skill&lt;/a&gt; to ensure Mortal Wound will land.

Once inside, locate the remains of &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; and his mount and perform the ritual to claim it as your own.\nDescription.\nWe must now purify the barding by both material and immaterial means. For the material, we need to travel to Stratholme.\nWhen it thrived, before the plague, it produced &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; capable of cleansing even the darkest of magics. There still may be caches of it lying untouched there that we can use.\nThen it's just a matter of imbuing enough holy power into the barding to make sure it overcomes the will of Rivendare's mount, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmane\"&gt;Shadowmane&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Service%20Entrance\"&gt;service gate of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; when you're ready.\nRewards.\nYou will learn: &lt;a href=\"Highlord%27s%20Golden%20Charger\"&gt;Highlord's Golden Charger&lt;/a&gt;\nYou will also receive: \nProgress.\nYour mount is within our reach, Highlord. I only pray Stratholme still has an ample supply of holy water.\nCompletion.\nThat was quite the encounter, wouldn't you say Highlord &lt;name&gt;? Reminds me of my glory days.\nNevertheless we'll be keeping a more watchful eye on Stratholme from now on. But that's not important right now.\nWe should move on to the ceremony and have you claim your prize!\nNotes.\nSpeak with &lt;a href=\"Defender%20Sterius\"&gt;Defender Sterius&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Eastwall%20Gate\"&gt;Eastwall Gate&lt;/a&gt; to enter the scenario.\nStage 1: Choose Your Allies.\nLeave &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to find a group of paladins awaiting your instructions. You can only choose two to assist you for this scenario.\n\"Indicated by the title Hand of Salvation.\"\n\"Indicated by the title Hand of Protection.\"\n\"Indicated by the title Hand of Retribution.\"\nGenerally, the safe bet is to have one paladin each for the other two class specializations different from your own. (Example: Player is retribution, so they choose one paladin each from holy and protection.)\nStage 2: Search the City.\nBegin your search by mounting up and leaving the safety of &lt;a href=\"Elders%27%20Square\"&gt;Elders' Square&lt;/a&gt;.\nKill the group of skeletons and collect your first Holy Water from the nearby cache, then head to the first &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt; straight ahead. The shadowy figure will summon some more skeletons, all of which you must kill before Osseine will be summoned.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Rebuke\"&gt;Rebuke&lt;/a&gt; when Osseine begins casting its Bare Bones, which inflicts AoE damage. Osseine will also pick a random party member to use Bone Cage on, which stuns and causes shadow damage for 20 seconds. Bone Cage cannot be interrupted, but you can use &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Blessing of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; if one of the NPCs was targeted.\nOnce the mob is dead, head inside the ziggurat to rescue your first paladin.\nHead back out and be sure to loot your second Holy Water. Travel to the ziggurat west to continue your search.\nSlay all the ghouls, but do so without pulling all at once unless you're a tank.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Cleanse%20Toxins\"&gt;Cleanse Toxins&lt;/a&gt; on yourself or a fellow party member as needed when Pestulon uses its Pustule Plague ability. If Pestulon lives long enough to cast Summon Plague Zombies, be ready to focus the adds. Once the encounter is over, go into the ziggurat to rescue the second missing paladin.\nHead out once more and grab your third and fourth Holy Water nearby, then go through the portcullis to the north. Travel the northeast ziggurat on the map, where the shadowy figure will this time summon a pack of &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Geist\"&gt;Rotting Geist&lt;/a&gt;s. They don't hit as hard as the ghouls from before, so it should be safe to AoE them all down.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt; to stop Rotmouth's Consume Rot, which heals the geist. Interrupt its Rotting Noose to prevent being stunned. Travel inside the ziggurat after dealing with the creature to rescue the final missing paladin.\nLeave the structure and grab the remaining two Holy Waters in the area to progress to the next stage.\nStage 3: Return to Grayson.\nReturn to &lt;a href=\"Elders%27%20Square\"&gt;Elders' Square&lt;/a&gt; and speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker.\nStage 4: Imbue the Barding.\nInteract with the Blessed Mount Barding.\nStage 5: Ride to Rivendare's Crypt.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20Square\"&gt;Slaughter Square&lt;/a&gt; and enter the &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20House\"&gt;Slaughter House&lt;/a&gt; to confront the shadowy figure.\nStage 6: Defeat Raemien.\nInterrupt the Drain Life, keep yourself cleansed, and free your party NPCs when they are stunned.\nFinal Stage: Speak With Grayson.\nSpeak with Grayson."}

Since he was a young cub, he was eager to learn everything he could about cooking. Many folks who were passing by helped him to along with few words of advice or a recipe or two.\nHe is encountered by players first as a boy in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Some years later, now as a grown pandaren, Nomi becomes a cook in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nMists of Pandaria.\nNomi is a boy who is ready and willing to learn &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;teacher&lt;/a&gt; when summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20School%20Bell\"&gt;Cooking School Bell&lt;/a&gt;. He offers a series of daily quests to help improve his cooking, beginning with Lesson 1 and eventually progressing to Lesson 5. Once Nomi has completed his learning, he will give a one-time quest to thank his teacher. From thereon, the adventurer will have access to the daily quest which rewards an &lt;a href=\"Ironpaw%20Token\"&gt;Ironpaw Token&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goodies%20from%20Nomi\"&gt;Goodies from Nomi&lt;/a&gt; (contains a random skill level 600 food).\nNomi and &lt;a href=\"Andi\"&gt;Andi&lt;/a&gt; know each other. Afraid of &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Fung\"&gt;Farmer Fung&lt;/a&gt;, Nomi is of the opinion that he eats cubs.\nLegion.\nOnce Nomi got old enough, he tried adventuring for a bit, but found cooking to be his passion. Now a teenager, he caught up with his old master in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; with an offer to work together once again. Soon after, Nomi got work at a kitchen in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe's also not very good at hunting or fishing. \nBattle for Azeroth.\nNomi serves as the host of the &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20Impossible\"&gt;Cooking Impossible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Brawl\"&gt;PvP Brawl&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Micah%20Broadhoof\"&gt;Micah Broadhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Nomi was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; to assist in producing &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt; put him in charge of gathering ingredients, a task he was ill-suited for as he simply fell asleep in the orchard. When &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the vineyards to help with production in the hopes of allowing the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; to join the Horde, they reassigned Nomi to the more suitable role of creating the recipe for the wine. In order to make the arcwine appeal to the diverse palates of the Horde, Nomi made some slight changes to Iltheux's recipe and sent the adventurer to gather &lt;a href=\"Fermented%20Firebloom\"&gt;firebloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silkwing%20Fibers\"&gt;moth fibers&lt;/a&gt; for the task. When the finished wine was brought to Iltheux, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; praised it and stated he could not have done better himself.\nDragonflight.\nNomi traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; where he is found at the &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s%20Market\"&gt;Artisan's Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nYou are my favorite teacher ever!\nIn Hearthstone.\nNomi appears as in the ' expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".
