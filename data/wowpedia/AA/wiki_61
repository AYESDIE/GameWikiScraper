{"id": "61531", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=61531", "title": "Ghaz'an", "text": "Ghaz'an is an &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; boss of the &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Historians have long disagreed about whether the immense hydras of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; share a common ancestor. What is clear, however, is that these ruthless creatures have existed on both realms since ancient times. Ghaz'an is one of the most infamous and fearsome hydras on Outland. Under the control of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, this ravenous fiend has stormed the lower reaches of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; to terrorize the region's denizens.\"\nStrategy.\nThis boss walks onto the center platform when you enter his chamber. There is a wall of vertical pipes to the right and many tanks place their backs against this. The important thing is that the tank doesn't move the entire fight so that the rest of the group can stand to Ghaz'an's sides. If you are in front of him you will be hit by his nature breath attack and behind he will tail swipe you off the platform. If you get swiped off you can swim to the ramp and run back up but you will be out of the fight for approximately 45\u201360 seconds. Other than the Nature breath attack and tail swipe, Ghaz'an has no special abilities and is easily dispatched if everyone is positioned properly. An easy way to think of this is setting it up similar to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Another, maybe easier, way is to have the ranged DPS looking at the ramp from the side, and the Tank can then go to Ghaz'an and pull him all the way down the ramp (the ramp that's leading to him) so the tank can have his back up against the wall - Ghaz'an's back will point towards the center of the room where he started - that way the DPS can stand on the side DPS'ing him down without thinking about tailswipes and falling off the edge. Very effective.\nGhaz'an's Acid Breath is the main problem in this fight. It is a binary resist (meaning you can fully resist it or it can do full damage) and stacks up to 10 times on players. Each applications of the Acid Breath deals 155 damage every 3 seconds and refreshes the duration of the debuff, so a tank with 10 applications will be taking 1550 damage every 3 seconds in addition to the 1500-2000 instant damage each time Acid Breath hits. For this reason Nature Resist for the main tank can make this fight a cinch and lack of Nature Resist can make it very difficult. Shamans should place their Nature Resistance totems or Hunters can use Aspect of the Wild.\nNo one other than the Main Tank should be hit by acid breath. If you are hit by it, you are too far in front of Ghaz'an and should move closer to the rear of him (just not into tail swipe range). Assuming proper position, the fight is a tank and spank with no surprises.\nHeroic mode.\nGhaz'an appears to hit from anywhere between 1700-2600 on moderately geared tanks, and can sometimes get a string of up to 3 attacks in a row. Besides this, the only other significant change appears to be a moderate increase to the Acid Breath damage.\nIf you have light healing, an alternate strategy is kiting. He moves very slowly, and will follow you all the way to the instance entrance. A combination of warlock + ranged dps works.\nNOTE: in heroic mode, this boss has around 70-110k hp. You can burn him down between a time frame of 20 to 30 seconds with a good group. Should you lose anyone in the water, the fish die along with the boss allowing safe resurrecting.\nNOTE: This boss moves quite slow, making it easily soloable by a warlock or priest by running and dotting. The platform from the first boss can be used to circle the boss around and run him back to his start point and repeat. This takes around 4 minutes.\nTrivia.\nIn the Burning Crusade beta and for a short time after release, &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Tidewrath\"&gt;Overseer Tidewrath&lt;/a&gt; was a part of this encounter."}

Mortal &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s usually go to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, but ghosts roam the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt;, the trackless wastes between the Shadowlands and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical world&lt;/a&gt;, trapped between the realms of the living and the dead, seeking release from their eternal suffering. They are made of &lt;a href=\"ectoplasm\"&gt;ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsually unable to realize that they are no longer alive, they are not necessarily evil, but their hunger for physical contact often causes great harm to any living beings they touch. Spirits do not usually become ghosts, as the normal death process is the soul's release to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. However, following a traumatic event, or suffering from a magical spell, or a curse, or else, it is possible for spirits to return as ghosts.\nThe term \"ghost\" is sometimes applied to any &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; incorporeal being.\nIn the RPG.\nGhosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered.\nGhosts are the spectral impressions of individuals who died due to the plague or due to some incredibly traumatic incident. Often, those who contract the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; attempt to end their own lives rather than join &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s armies; this attempt is not always successful and often results in the creation of a spirit which is independent of Ner'zhul's influence, but not completely dead.\nGhosts are often angry spirits, robbed of their lives through circumstance or will. They resemble their corporeal shape, but are completely intangible. These creatures haunt the site of their death or some other location integral to their past and are often violent and dangerous. They hate life, and the feeling of having warmth and hope near them is enough to drive ghost into a murderous frenzy. Because most ghosts are completely insane, it has not proven worth Ner'zhul's time to capture and enslave them for his own uses. Ner'zhul no doubt has some ghosts in his employ \u2014 singular creatures that are powerful enough to be useful but not powerful enough to cause Ner'zhul followers any trouble keeping them dominated. These creatures are extremely vengeful, expending their rage upon any opponent they can find and using their ghostly powers to shred any opposition and break any unfortunate soul that crosses their path.\n\"Ghost\" is an acquired template in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Distance yourself, take out the ghosts and get their ghost-o-plasm\u2014that's what we'll sell to the Magram.\nReward.\nYou will also receive:\nProgress.\nWhere's my ghost-o-plasm, &lt;name&gt;? \nCompletion.\nThere it is! Looks like you got some of it on you too. Kinda slimey, eh?\nWell, thanks a lot for all the trouble, &lt;name&gt;. This stuff will be worth a fortune... if I can convince the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s what it is! \nGains.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nNotes.\nHorniz is just to the southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Graveyard\"&gt;Kodo Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. Run east, then south to enter the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Valley of Bones&lt;/a&gt; from the north (and not the west\u2014&lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt; is a pain to get through). At the southern end of the valley are the two &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Goliath\"&gt;Dead Goliath&lt;/a&gt;s. Stand in between them and drop the &lt;a href=\"Crate%20of%20Ghost%20Magnets\"&gt;Crate of Ghost Magnets&lt;/a&gt;. Then get a few yards away from it.\nInitially neutral &lt;a href=\"Magrami%20Spectre\"&gt;Magrami Spectre&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn and walk to the magnet.\nAfter a few seconds within 5 yards of the magnet, the spectres will turn hostile.\nKill them to loot their &lt;a href=\"Ghost-o-Plasm\"&gt;Ghost-o-Plasm&lt;/a&gt; then head back to Horniz."}

It was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to open a rift into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. The pieces of the helm continued to play a role in subsequent events until they were reforged into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument intended to be the helm's opposite.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe Helm of Domination and &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; were crafted at the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; (who was actually the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;), who was forced against his will to do so by &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer intended to use the Helm and Frostmourne to establish his influence on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, thereby allowing him to claim his \"final prize\", a secret that the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; sought to hide.\nReign of the Lich King.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who pretended to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; bore the two vessels of Domination across the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; and bound the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to them. The helm, and Ner'zhul's spirit, were both sealed within the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; from which the Lich King would control the Scourge telepathically. Frostmourne was originally also sealed inside the Frozen Throne, but Ner'zhul cast it from the throne so that it would eventually find its way to &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; attempted to destroy the Frozen Throne and the Lich King at the order of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul used the helm's powers to command Arthas\u2014having become Ner'zhul's greatest &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; after taking up Frostmourne\u2014to journey from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to aid him. After Arthas defeated Illidan, Ner'zhul also had Arthas himself shatter the Frozen Throne in order to free Ner'zhul from his prison. Arthas would then don the helm, merging his soul with Ner'zhul's spirit and become the new Lich King.\nYears later when Arthas was killed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; the helm was passed to &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; who became the new Lich King in order to prevent the Scourge from running rampant. Following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; yet a few years later, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; ventured to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; after having abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and fought against Bolvar atop the Frozen Throne. While the helm made Bolvar immensely powerful, Sylvanas still managed to defeat him and seized the helm after winning the battle. Assuming she intended to become the Scourge's new master, Bolvar remarked that the helm's power would be her prison, however, Sylvanas countered that the world itself was a prison and split the helm in two, thereby piercing the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe shards of Domination.\nDespite being broken, the &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Domination\"&gt;shards&lt;/a&gt; of the Helm retained the power of Domination and, therefore, incredible power over the souls of the dead. The shards were used to enter the Shadowlands and pursue Sylvanas and enslave souls for information on how to escape the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, before being placed on the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20Map\"&gt;Shadowlands Map&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in order to establish a tether with Azeroth. Bolvar subsequently used the Helm to peer into the Maw and Torghast. However, this was not without cost, as the continuous gaze allowed for the Jailer to gaze back and finally strike through the helm in an attempt to gain control of Bolvar. However, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; were able to sever the connection between the helm and the Jailer.\nAs the Maw Walkers and their allies prepared to face the Jailer in the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, they needed to find a way of resisting his Domination magic. Bolvar asked his daughter &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; to bring the intact half of the helm to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The helm's creator, the Primus, pointed out that Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be resistant to Domination and that using the helm might allow the heroes to find the source of their resistance. The Maw Walker first used the helm on a volunteering &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that it retained its powers, after which the Primus tasked them with testing the object on some of Zereth Mortis' native creatures. The Maw Walker eventually learned from &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Eru\"&gt;Elder Eru&lt;/a&gt; that the automa's resistance to Domination stemmed from the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, phrases of which were buried in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Bolvar, Taelia, and the Maw Walker worked together to retrieve these &lt;a href=\"Inscrutable%20Phrase\"&gt;Inscrutable Phrase&lt;/a&gt;s and infuse them into the intact half of the crown, while also using it to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; occupying the area. Bolvar stated that he hoped this was the last time the helm was used as a weapon.\nNext, the heroes brought the shards of the helm's other half to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, where those who had overcome Domination in the past could draw out the memories of their resistance and willpower and infuse it into the shards. Although it was not easy, Bolvar, Darion, Sylvanas, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; completed this ritual one by one and infused the shards. With the broken half augmented with the language of the First Ones and the shards carrying the heroes' memories and will, the Maw Walker and their allies met up with the Primus in the Runecarver's Oubliette\u2014where the vessels of Domination had once been created\u2014so he could reforge the helm and allow the heroes to draw upon the combined power for themselves. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; asked what was to stop this new helm from being used to enslave others like its predecessor, to which the Primus replied that it was to become \"something greater\"\u2014an instrument of free will\u2014and Sylvanas added that a Lich King would never again reign in Icecrown. Combining the First One phrases and memories, the Primus transformed the helm into a new object, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, which would be the key to the Jailer's defeat by making the Maw Walker and their allies resistant to Domination.\nIn the RPG.\nAs long as the Lich King is alive, any creature donning the helm is slain immediately by a surging overflow of power. Only divine beings are not slain, but they still cannot command its powers if the Lich King is alive.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Plate%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Plate of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, which is described in the \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" to be combined with the Helm of Domination, makes the wearer nearly invulnerable.\nIn the TCG.\n&lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; is crafted to look like the Helm of Domination."}

{"id": "12652", "revid": "30741107", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12652", "title": "Warrior", "text": "Warriors are &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; fighters highly trained in the arts of weaponry. These mighty warriors, strong and quick on the battlefield, depend on their heavy &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; armor, shields, and battle prowess to defend themselves and ensure enemies don\u2019t focus on their softer-skinned allies. Weapon mastery is a staple of warrior training, and they are capable of delivering high damage with enormous two-handed weapons or by wielding two weapons. As warriors deal or take damage, their &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; grows, allowing them to deliver truly crushing attacks in the heat of battle.\nWarriors are usually leading the charge into battle, tearing across the battlefield and using furious shouts and terrifying banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether striking down opponents with mighty two-handed weapons, tearing into packs of enemies in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors excel at battle with a range of powerful attacks and battlefield maneuvers, as masters of both skillful strikes and devastating blows.\nA warrior is a living weapon, an embodiment of burning rage that can take down a hundred enemies in one battle without feeling wounds or fatigue.\nWarriors equip themselves carefully for combat and engage their enemies head-on, letting attacks glance off their heavy armor. They use diverse combat tactics and a wide variety of weapon types to protect their more vulnerable allies. Warriors must carefully master their rage \u2013 the power behind their strongest attacks \u2013 in order to maximize their effectiveness in combat.\nWarrior talents can improve their already considerable defenses with a shield, increase their deadliness with two-handed weapons, or bolster their savagery while dual-wielding.\nClass overview.\n\"Warriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.\"\nGame guide.\n\"For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. The warrior\u2019s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel.\"\n\"Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"Warriors train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Though they come from all walks of life, they are united in their singular commitment to engage in glorious battle. Many warriors serve as mercenary soldiers, while others become adventurers and danger-seeking fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough, and exceptionally violent.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Combining a mastery of weapons and prowess in battle, Warriors storm fearlessly into the front lines of any fight.\"\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heimir%20of%20the%20Black%20Fist\"&gt;Heimir of the Black Fist&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the training of the first mortal warriors of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRaces.\nThe warrior class can be played by all available races.\nRacial advantages.\nEach race comes with unique special abilities or powers, known as &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s, or simply racials. While each race has its advantages, certain racials are of particular benefit to certain classes. Players may wish to take these advantages into account when selecting which race/class combination to play. Some of the most useful racials for warriors are:\nRage.\nA warrior's attacks and abilities are fuelled by rage. By controlling and focusing their rage, warriors can unleash an array of devastating attacks, harden themselves into unassailable defenders, or even draw strength and healing from their anger. Rage can be generated in a number of ways, depending on the warrior's &lt;a href=\"%23Stances\"&gt;stance&lt;/a&gt;: it can be generated by the warrior's auto-attacks, by taking damage, or simply by being in combat. Certain abilities can also be used to generate rage regardless of the warrior's stance.\nBy default the rage bar is empty, and when out of combat, rage drains or depletes at a constant rate. Warriors have a maximum of 100 rage, but by choosing &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Unending%20Rage\"&gt;Glyph of Unending Rage&lt;/a&gt; can raise this cap to 120.\nWarriors need to be in combat or use a rage-generating ability to generate rage. The longer the battle, the more rage a warrior can accumulate. This often leads the warrior to the strategy of \"filling up\" their rage bar on a weaker foe before moving on to a more powerful enemy. A warrior with a full rage bar can quickly unload a large amount of damage.\nAbilities.\nDamage dealing.\nWarriors deal damage almost exclusively through melee attacks. Each spec has one or two primary attacks that generate &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;, while most other attacks consume it. Warriors have a few ranged attacks (&lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Throw\"&gt;Heroic Throw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Bolt\"&gt;Storm Bolt&lt;/a&gt;), but are largely unable to deal damage or apply crowd control unless within melee range. The majority of a warrior's attacks are intended for single targets, but they also have some options for dealing AoE and multiple-target damage.\nCrowd control.\nWarriors make use of snares and root effects such as &lt;a href=\"Hamstring\"&gt;Hamstring&lt;/a&gt; to keep their targets within range, and can use &lt;a href=\"Intimidating%20Shout\"&gt;Intimidating Shout&lt;/a&gt; to fear and disrupt enemy attacks. Warriors can &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt; casters into silence, and have a limited choice of stun, root and interrupt effects available via talents. The warrior's main mobility skill &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; also stuns enemies.\nWhen targeted by others' crowd control effects, a warrior can transform themselves into an unstoppable &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt; (if talented), tearing their way out of roots and snares, while &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt; can be used to prevent or counteract many forms of crowd control. Warriors can also &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt; enemies away from weaker targets, or mock whole armies with &lt;a href=\"Mocking%20Banner\"&gt;Mocking Banner&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuffs and debuffs.\nWarriors are known for their shouts, whether intimidating and disrupting their enemies, or inspiring and uplifting their allies. &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Shout\"&gt;Battle Shout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commanding%20Shout\"&gt;Commanding Shout&lt;/a&gt; are the warrior's main group buffs, while &lt;a href=\"Rallying%20Cry\"&gt;Rallying Cry&lt;/a&gt; can be life-saving if used at the right time. Warriors can also inspire their allies with their &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Banner\"&gt;Skull Banner&lt;/a&gt;, or demoralize their enemies with &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Banner\"&gt;Demoralizing Banner&lt;/a&gt;, similar in effect to their &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt;. Warrior attacks can also apply &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Wounds\"&gt;Deep Wounds&lt;/a&gt; to targets, rend their armor with &lt;a href=\"Colossus%20Smash\"&gt;Colossus Smash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;, weaken their enemies with &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt; or simply &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; them. \nWarriors also have a number of self-buffs that can be used to increase damage dealt or greatly reduce incoming damage. &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28warrior%20ability%29\"&gt;Enrage (warrior ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Recklessness\"&gt;Recklessness&lt;/a&gt; significantly increase damage dealt, while various other effects improve specific abilities. The warrior's &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt; is also a form of self-buff.\nMobility.\nWarriors are known as a highly mobile class, charging and leaping about the battlefield, and fiercely intervening between their allies and those that would attack them. To be effective in the heat of PvP combat, warriors may need to use every one of their abilities to stay within range of their targets, as they rely on being in melee range to make use of their abilities. \nThe warrior's main mobility skill &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; stuns opponents and generates rage, and can be improved by talents to be available very frequently. &lt;a href=\"Intervene\"&gt;Intervene&lt;/a&gt; allows the warrior to leap to the defence of an ally, or simply use their teammates (or Banners) to launch themselves back into the fray. &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt; allows the warrior to leap down upon their enemies or, if necessary, to flee quickly out of range of attacks, and additionally deals some AoE damage.\nDefence and self-healing.\nWarriors have a number of debilitating debuffs and crowd control abilities that can be used to weaken or interrupt their enemies' attacks, as well as some defensive cooldowns. Protection warriors are masters of defence, with a range of options for mitigating incoming damage (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20Barrier\"&gt;Shield Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Block\"&gt;Shield Block&lt;/a&gt;), be it physical or magical, primarily through the use of their shield. While focusing primarily on dealing damage, Arms and Fury warriors are also capable of defending themselves, with abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Die%20by%20the%20Sword\"&gt;Die by the Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Although the mark of a Protection warrior, all warriors can equip a shield to take advantage of abilities like &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt;. Talented warriors can achieve &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Mass Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; without the need for a shield.\nAlthough not the most gifted of healers, warriors can regenerate substantial amounts of health through &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Rush\"&gt;Victory Rush&lt;/a&gt; as well as one of the tier 2 talents: &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Regeneration\"&gt;Enraged Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20Wind\"&gt;Second Wind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Impending%20Victory\"&gt;Impending Victory&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecializations.\nThere are three Warrior &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s: Arms, Fury, and Protection.\nArms.\n A battle-hardened master of two-handed weapons, using mobility and overpowering attacks to strike &lt;his/her&gt; opponents down.\nArms warriors are seasoned veterans, using might and ponderous weapons to deal colossal blows to their enemies. Preferring power over speed, Arms warriors specialize in powerful burst damage and control, and can become an unstoppable force, tearing opponents down in just a few mighty blows. Smashing opponents with powerful attacks, Arms warriors are capable of dealing immense amounts of damage in a small space of time.\n\"Across culture and kingdom, men and women who demonstrate great physical aptitude are transformed into mighty warriors through tests of strength, endurance, and fighting capability. Their friendships are forged not in the classroom, tavern, or workshop, but in the dueling pits and on the arena floor. As a childhood of sparring defines a warrior\u2019s destiny, so too does one\u2019s choice of weapon determine their role on the battlefield. Arms warriors gravitate toward two-handed weapons instinctively. It\u2019s more than a matter of preference\u2014it speaks to the character of the wielder. Arms warriors are patient in a fight, waiting to capitalize on moments when an opponent is left exposed. Two-handed weapons allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies\u2019 weaknesses.\"\nFury.\n A furious berserker wielding a weapon in each hand, unleashing a flurry of attacks to carve &lt;his/her&gt; opponents to pieces.\nFury warriors are &lt;a href=\"dual-wield\"&gt;dual-wield&lt;/a&gt;ing berserkers, dealing a rapid succession of wild attacks with each weapon. While all warriors rely on &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their attacks, Fury warriors focus their anger in a different way, allowing the heat of battle to send them into a bloodthirsty rage, empowering them and unleashing their most powerful attacks. Fury warriors' mastery further rewards these crazed berserkers.\n\"On the battlefield and in the arena, the most feared combatants are often the furious berserkers who lust for battle and thirst for blood. Through a lifetime of training and sparring, these merciless warriors have become masters of carnage\u2014often wielding a weapon in each hand to maximize the destruction. Even without the protection of a shield, the fury warrior leaves little opportunity for an opponent to strike without suffering grievous wounds in return\u2014delivered in a whirlwind of blades that dooms anyone its wake. Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray.\"\nProtection.\n A stalwart protector who uses a shield to safeguard &lt;himself/herself&gt; and &lt;his/her&gt; allies.\nProtection warriors are stout, dauntless defenders. Using a sturdy shield both to soak up foes' attacks and to dish out damage of their own, Protection warriors can take an immense amount of damage, able to withstand the most powerful of blows. Taunting and demoralizing their enemies with a range of shouts and devastating attacks, Protection warriors are formidable &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s, leading their allies to victory against the mightiest of adversaries.\n\"Like their counterparts, protection warriors are virtually bred for physical dominance, having been raised in the art of close-quarters combat\u2014but their measured approach to battle is what distinguishes them from their comrades-in-arms. They demonstrate an uncanny knack for blade and shield, nullifying an opponent\u2019s advances and creating opportunities for counterattacks. For the protection warrior, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulnerable to the enemy\u2019s attack. Stalwart defenders are integral to the success of any military campaign\u2014the protection warrior seeks to be an unbreakable wall.\"\nStats.\nThe primary warrior attributes are &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Agility\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; is also useful while levelling as &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike%23Critical%20Strike%20Rating\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; on gear is rare until later levels. Warrior-oriented gear found towards end-game provides a wider range of attributes. Gear oriented specifically to damage dealing warriors may include &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike%23Critical%20Strike%20Rating\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"haste%23haste%20rating\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;, while gear oriented to warrior tanks usually includes &lt;a href=\"dodge%20rating\"&gt;dodge rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parry%20rating\"&gt;parry rating&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"hit%20rating%23Calculating%20miss%20rate\"&gt;Hit rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"expertise%20rating%23Expertise%20and%20Expertise%20Rating\"&gt;expertise rating&lt;/a&gt; are also commonly found on gear and can be useful for warriors performing either role. It can be difficult to find rings or cloaks with the relevant attributes. As such, warriors may improvise; for example, damage dealing warriors may seek \"rogue\" items that contain agility and attack power in place of elusive items containing strength. \nIn the RPG.\nAs long as war is waged on Azeroth, there will be men and women who fight those wars. The warrior is no mere sword-swinger. Warriors are skilled combatants, combining strength of arm, knowledge of weaponry, and practiced maneuvers to slice or bludgeon their foes into little red bits. Warriors are the most versatile of the combat classes, and they supplement their fighting prowess with the ability to rally their allies and spur them to victory. Warriors charge into the heart of the battle, take several lives, and live to tell the tale. All races fight, and all races boast many warriors in their ranks. Warriors are common among dwarves, Forsaken, humans, and orcs, but are less so among the other races. Masters of swords, spears, and weapons of all kinds, warriors share a common way of life on Azeroth. Using their abilities to deal pain and cause bloodshed, warriors are deadly adversaries and welcome friends in violent times (which seem to be all the time in recent decades).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It occupies the easternmost section of Darnassus, located at the main gate leading out into the greater &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; region.\nThe district protects Darnassus from violent incursions. Patrollers on nightsaber mounts guard the city's impressive gates.\nThe Warrior's Terrace is accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Craftsmen's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in the north, the &lt;a href=\"Tradesmen%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Tradesmen's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in the south, and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Gardens\"&gt;Temple Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in the west. In addition to the large military presence, the terrace also hosts a large number of low- and high-level &lt;a href=\"Training%20Dummy\"&gt;training dummies&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; training and supplies.\nHistory.\nThe Warrior's Terrace would be the venue for a garden party hosted by the aristocratic &lt;a href=\"Taylenne%20Sweetsong\"&gt;Taylenne Sweetsong&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.

Previously, instant melee attacks did damage based on the damage range of the weapon, plus a bonus for the player's attack power. This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks. Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, the attack power bonus is now multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table:\nAs a direct result of this, many weapons have shifted position in their relative power. In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons. \nThis change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons. \nPlease also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, and Overpower. "}

{"id": "130517", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=130517", "title": "Warrior races", "text": "This article lists the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to become &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and the lore and speculation regarding each. Technically speaking, any race can become a warrior, it only takes effort and practice with melee weaponly after all.\nAlliance.\nHuman warriors.\nWarriors are common among &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The art of battle has been practiced and refined since the time of barbarian warlords and human tribes. The most popular place for a human to be is in melee combat with a sword or mace in his or her hand. &lt;a href=\"Footmen\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt; are warriors who serve as basic infantry in armies of the human nations. Comprising the bulk of the Alliance army, the footman is the heart of the war machine for elves, humans and dwarves. Fighting in close formation, they use proven tactical methods: Advance slowly with shields raised, then draw swords and close to melee range. The grim, mud-slogging &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt; initially appears to be a grizzled veteran, until you get a glimpse of his young face. His weapons and armor look worn, like they were scavenged from a battlefield. Footmen like to travel in small groups and form ranks. They are attuned to formation fighting, and coordinate their attacks. They're capable of bringing down well-armored opponents.Aside from champions, the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; is the elite warrior of humanity, the best of the normal troops. They typically form ranks and charge to devastating effect on the battlefield. Even the lowly &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;, the most humblest of origins for humans, can learn to to use both pick and axe for their own defense if threatened. Ever since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, human peasants and farmers were roused by tales of the orcish atrocities in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; to train themselves as rag-tag militias should their towns be attacked.\nDwarf warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in particular have a long tradition of combat training, and many dwarves train extensively with axe and hammer. &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20king\"&gt;Mountain king&lt;/a&gt;s are the elite of the Ironforge warriors, imposing &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s who tap into mystic powers to become true champions of their race. Another famous dwarven warrior is the Dwarf &lt;a href=\"Sharpshooter\"&gt;Sharpshooter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;\nGnome warriors.\nEvery time someone makes a comment about how no &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; warriors exist, he runs the risk of being hamstrung the next time he is in a tense situation. These gnomes are the kind who deny that they are small, every other race is just too big. The gnomes that become warriors are fierce, but are often placed in defensive positions, guarding either artillery or battle magi. Being small is an advantage, making warrior gnomes difficult targets in the midst of melee.\nNight elf warriors.\nExtremely agile, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; warriors combine their speed with good tactical knowledge and deadly fighting style. The most well-known warriors of night elf society are the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, who fight with &lt;a href=\"moonglaive\"&gt;moonglaive&lt;/a&gt;s as melee or thrown projectile weapons. The night elf &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s typically fight with the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Crescent\"&gt;Umbra Crescent&lt;/a&gt; and have hidden knives they throw as projectiles. There are some night elf warriors such as some of the &lt;a href=\"warrior%20trainers\"&gt;warrior trainers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, who do not seem to be directly associated with other groups such as the Sentinels.\nDraenei warriors.\nThere are no famous draenei warriors as very little is known of their lore, though there have probably been many a draenei warrior-hero in the past. It could be possible that younger draenei have a lesser feeling of responsibility to worship and show gratitude to the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, at least not in learning the arts of the paladin, but possibly still in thoughts and personal religious actions outside of battle. Draenei warriors could also be individuals who want to achieve fame and glory only through physical skill and training, instead of relying on magic or the favor of the Naaru.\nWorgen warriors.\nWorgen warriors are likely common as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; had many footmen and &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike the half naked wild worgen who fight like animals with teeth and claws, the Gilnean worgen fight like men, wearing plate and mail and armed with steel swords and polearms.\nHorde.\nOrc warriors.\nWarriors are common among &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Orcs have a long history of warfare; their race has been battling various creatures for generations. In the past, many orcs embraced their demon-born bloodlust and became &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s. In recent years, the orcs' discovery of their spiritual and shamanistic path traditions has allowed orcs to focus and refine their savagery. Many orcs still become barbarians, but the way of the trained warrior - becomes more and more common. The iconic orc warrior is garbed in chain mail or leather and plate. He carries a mighty battleaxe and wears a horned helmet. He crouches in a battle stance, axe at the ready, as he evaluates his opponent...then, with a fearsome yowl, he strikes in a blur. Such warriors can be found among the common &lt;a href=\"Grunt\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; or the venerated &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt; riding &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA warrior clapping someone's wrist is a sign of their approval.\nTroll warriors.\nSavage berserkers, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; warriors rarely think about self defense. They prefer to make an enemy think about it, unleashing their primal fury on their foes. Though there are not many pure warriors among trolls, they usually combine it with their hunting and throwing skills or some dark voodoo rituals. &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Zanga\"&gt;Berserker Zanga&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior trainer would seem to indicate troll warriors are representing berserkers. The addition of &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Throw\"&gt;Heroic Throw&lt;/a&gt; would also support this.\nTauren warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; warriors are calm and self-sufficient, not given to boredom and despair like many low-ranking &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s. In large skirmishes, tauren warriors serve as shock troopers and front-line &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s; in small warbands, they might serve as leaders or &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s as well. A tauren warrior's muscles ripple under his brown hide. His compact frame hints at tenacity and endurance, while his scarred armor tells of many past battles. Tauren warriors form the backbone of tauren military forces. These versatile warriors excel in melee combat, plus they can track, scout, and forage for food. A tauren warrior is wise enough not to lose his head in the heat of battle. He flanks with his allies, positions himself to make the best use of his Cleave feat, and obeys his superior's orders. A tauren warrior uses \"Power Attack\" to its fullest effect at the start of combat, but stops if he misses twice in a row. Even with the lowest totem-bearing warrior, tauren exemplify the Horde's strength...Tauren are strong-willed and cunning.\nUndead warriors.\nWarriors are common among &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Forsaken warriors in their previous life could be brave knights as well as cruel bandits, so their style can be very different.\nMost Forsaken warrior NPCs are known as Death Guards.\nBlood elf warriors.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; become warriors (or scouts or hunters) \u2014 especially those seeking to be spell breakers, demon hunters, and rangers. In the aftermath of the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; took a group of the strongest blood elf warriors and spellcasters and joined the Alliance against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; (most of these later joined him in Outland). Although non-playable blood elf warriors do exist, most are in service of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; (or at least Kael'thas). There is also a group of blood elf and draenei warriors who form part of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Warrior\"&gt;Shattered Sun Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe return of war veterans from Outland and Northrend probably led to blood elf Warriors becoming a playable race/class combination in \"Cataclysm\", as they started training new recruits.\nGoblin warriors.\nThough &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s often rely on &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hobgoblin\"&gt;hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s for muscle, it is not uncommon for goblins to practice the ways of the warrior. Many goblin warriors are known as &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s and enforce the rules of goblin towns such as &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their small size goblin bruisers are very strong, employing the use of nets and high powered rifles.\nIt was also said by &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;The War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; that goblins are much stronger than their size would indicate.\nNightborne warriors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; warriors have primarily been seen combining both &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic and the martial arts, though many have also been seen simply using mundane weapons. The &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; employed many warriors as the primary peace-keeping force in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful magical swordsmen are sometimes called spell-fencers or spellblades. Aside from normal swords, some use large double-bladed swords wielded with one hand, usually with a shield in the other, that can be used to channel magic.\nOther warrior races.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt; warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s are common brutes and raiders, though not many are memorable.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; warriors.\nDue to their brutish nature most &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; are warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;Quilboar&lt;/a&gt; warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;Quilboar&lt;/a&gt; males grow taller, heavier, and stronger than females. For this reason, only males take up the path of warrior. Females feel no resentment over this fact, and, indeed, the males do not see themselves as superior. Female quilboar possess such strong tribal instincts that most do not even desire to follow the males' path. On occasion, a female child displays such unnatural strength that the shaman deems her a man. She then trains as a warrior and lives in all ways like a male, even taking female mates. Tribal legend holds that such unions have occasionally produced an exceptional quilboar warrior (though no scholar has confirmed the tale), so there is little or no stigma attached to such situations.\nQuilboar warriors fight with a single-minded ferocity. Given a strong leader or an ancestral enemy, they will fight to the death, sacrificing themselves to destroy even one opponent. Quilboar warriors favor the flail, but they will make use of any weapon, even an impromptu weapon, that presents itself.\nNotes.\nThe warrior was the first class to be available to every race. However the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" added blood elves who did not have warrior as an option (though they did in early beta). With \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" introducing blood elves warriors, the class was once again available to all races. The original limitation was due to a cap Blizzard set on the number of classes avalibe to each race. Once they added more combinations of old classes and races in \"Cataclysm\", this limit was lifted and blood elves acquired warriors.\nBlood elf warriors are a standard class for blood elves in the RPG. Some blood elves become warriors (or scouts or hunters) \u2014 especially those seeking to be spell breakers, demon hunters, and rangers. In addition, there were High Elf Swordsmen in the Undead campaign in ' and Blood Elf Warriors existed in the \"Burning Crusades early beta, so blood elven warriors have technically \"always\" been justified."}

It is located near the area where &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s chopped away huge swaths of forest during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Despite disagreements from Thrall and the shamans, some orcs have remained in the vicinity, continuing their deforestation to fuel the Horde's expansion. They call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who have begun a massive push to retake the forests of Ashenvale, are now focusing their attention on ridding their land of the Outriders once and for all. And so, the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; have answered the call and sworn that they will not rest until every last Orc is defeated and cast out of Warsong Gulch.\nWarsong Gulch is a 10v10 &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt; battleground. Each side tries to take the opponent flag and \"cap\" (score) it at their own base. You can only \"cap\" the flag if the enemy isn't carrying yours. The winner is the first team to achieve 3 caps, or the team with the most caps when the allotted time expires.\nOfficial overview.\n\"The gleaming purple-and-emerald forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; are more than just pleasant woodland. To the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who name themselves Outriders, they\u2019re a prize cache of building planks; to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night-elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, they\u2019re home. Where the turned soil and tree stumps surrounding Horde lumber mills start to encroach on Ashenvale\u2019s timberlands, these two factions clash.\"\n\"Each group recruits heroes from far and wide \u2013 the Horde to batter back the defenders and clear the forests, and the Alliance to shatter the aggressors and stop the disappearance of their precious land. Capturing flags might seem like an unorthodox method of settling this dispute, but it\u2019s symbolic (and hardly without bloodshed). Whoever holds their defeated foes\u2019 banner will show all who look upon the forest that their claim is the strongest \u2013 and dictate the future of one of the most important, ancestral lands of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDescription.\n\"A valley bordering Ashenvale Forest and the Barrens, Warsong Gulch hosts a constant battle between the Horde and Alliance. As a 10 vs 10 capture-the-flag battleground, the first faction to capture three flags is victorious. Eager to aid their allies, members of every race in Azeroth rush to the Gulch to lend sword, or spell, to the conflict.\"\nJoining the battle.\nAs with all &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, players of sufficient level (in this case level 10) can queue for Warsong Gulch through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, found on the &lt;a href=\"micro%20menu\"&gt;micro menu&lt;/a&gt;. Players can also queue by speaking to &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"capital%20cities\"&gt;capital cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarsong Gulch also has its own heavily guarded entrances in the game world, one for each faction. Originally, these served as one of the only ways to join the battleground. However, with the advent of the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3.0.2\"&gt;3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, these now serve mostly a decorative purpose.\nAlliance.\nThe Alliance entrance is located in &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Grove\"&gt;Silverwing Grove&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Outpost\"&gt;Silverwing Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and Fallen Sky Lake in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; Forest. The Silverwing Outpost is near the junction of the main road through Ashenvale and the road south to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Be very careful if you are below level 20; in the area around the Silverwing Grove are many spiders with strong venom.\nHorde.\nThe Horde entrance is on the mountainside to the west of &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Mor'shan Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; at the northern end of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nMechanics.\nWarsong Gulch is a 10v10 &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;Capture the Flag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;, with a duration of 20 minutes. The object of the game is to capture the enemy team's flag, while defending your own against capture.\nThe game ends when one team has scored 3 captures, or after 20 minutes. After that time, the team with the most flag captures wins. If this would result in a tie, the team that captured the last flag wins. If neither side has captured a flag, then the game ends in a tie. \nEach team has one flag in their flag room. Players see the enemy's flag as a clickable &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking on it causes the player to pick it up. To score a capture, the capturing team must have their own flag at its base and bring the enemy's flag to that same spot. If both flags are being carried, neither team can complete a capture. After a capture, both flags will reset to their original locations after 20 seconds.\nWhen both flags are held, after a short while the flag carriers will receive a stacking debuff, increasing their damage taken by 10%. Every few minutes the flag carriers will receive an additional stack of the debuff, increasing the effect. The debuff stacks up to 10 times for 100% increased damage taken.\nCertain actions will cause the flag carrier to drop the flag. These include that player being killed, summoning a &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;, entering &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; (including via &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;), receiving a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt; (\"bubble\"), and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;. The carrier can also drop the flag by clicking on their own flag buff (received while holding the flag). Actions that do not cause the flag to drop include shapeshifting (cat, travel, ghost wolf), &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Protection\"&gt;Divine Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and using battleground power-ups. Also, picking up the flag breaks stealth.\nWhen the flag is dropped, it becomes a clickable object where it was dropped. A capturing team member can pick it up again and keep running, but the player who dropped it will not be able to personally pick it up again for 3 seconds. Or, a defending team member can click on it and it will instantly teleport back to their base (this is called \"returning\" the flag). If no player picks up or returns the flag for about five seconds, it will return itself.\nTactics.\nThere are at least four different strategies commonly used in Warsong Gulch; Split into O and D, Mid Control, All Escort the FC, and Zerging. The final is most common in PUGS and least likely to produce a victory while any of the first three can be made to work depending on the composition of the given team. \nThe key to victory is communication with the other players in your faction. Take the time before the game starts to agree on what strat you will be using but be prepared to change if you need to as events develop. By communicating, your teammates will have the edge and be able to anticipate your enemies' position and movements. It is useful to know, for example, if the opposing faction has characters camped at your graveyard. When allocating parties within a raid group, attention should be focused on not only the classes and abilities of the players involved but also their levels. For example, it is foolish to send in some level 25 characters when you know that the enemy flag is guarded by multiple level 29s. It is important to keep in mind abilities that can root or snare a player, as well as speed enhancements, and the ability to successfully get away from a group. As in any PvP situation, the key ability to develop with your character is the ability to adapt.\nYou are much more powerful in &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s when you are at the higher levels of your bracket. If you're playing in a 25\u201329 Battleground you will be more effective in direct combat as a level 29 than a level 25-28 because you will be much stronger, have more powerful spells, and stronger, higher leveled weapons with more &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;. You will also notice the other faction attacks you depending on your level because a level 29 will know a player two or more levels below them is an easy fast kill and takes only a few hits.\nRemember, Totems are a lifesaver! When you are on your way to capturing the flag, lay a couple of totems, this will make a powerful escape route for you and your allies.\nTeam Buffs are essential for flag capturing! Aspect of the Pack can speed up your team as they protect the flag, also Blood Pact is great for EVERY ally. Defending, Healing or Attacking. \nHunters, lay a Freezing Trap just on the flag. If an enemy captures it, they'll be \"sticking around\" for a while. Also, lay another damaging trap above to add insult to injury.\nNEVER LEAVE THE FLAG CARRIER ALONE. Have at least one person with him/her at all times.\nCommunicate effectively and efficiently. Don't spam the battleground chat with things not necessary to PvP.\nPower-ups.\nThere are three types of power-ups found in Warsong Gulch. To use them, simply walk up to one. They will respawn after a short period of time.\nHonor rewards.\nThe game awards bonus honor to everyone on your side of the match for reaching certain goals. Those goals are:\nOther scored events do not grant bonus honor. These include: killing blows, picking up the opponent's flag, and returning your flag to your base. Honor is awarded for honorable kills as normal. Losing a complete match (0 captures and a loss) also gives you no bonus honor. \nWhile it is possible to lose a match and still accumulate honor from honorable kills, a careless attitude about losing is generally frowned on, and considering that a winning match grants a substantial honor bonus, winning matches allows for accumulating honor points much more rapidly.\nDuring the Warsong Gulch &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20battleground\"&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt;, completing the battleground will earn players bonus &lt;a href=\"Honor\"&gt;Honor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe winning team receives an 18 Honor Point bonus for each capture the opposing team is prevented from completing. This means every capture below 3, up to a maximum of 54 bonus Honor if the losing team had 0 captures.\nWarsong Gulch items.\nWarsong Gulch items are available by spending honor accumulated with &lt;a href=\"Illiyana%20Moonblaze\"&gt;Illiyana Moonblaze&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Kelm%20Hargunth\"&gt;Kelm Hargunth&lt;/a&gt; (Horde). Though some of the Sentinel and Outrider factions items have different names and artwork, their bonuses and equip effects are identical. More powerful versions of some items can be purchased as you gain levels, allowing higher level players to receive faction rewards with better equipment bonuses. However, the quality bracer rewards are only available from level 40, and the quality leggings are only available at level 60.\nUseful terminology.\nDuring the course of playing, you may hear the following frequently used acronyms and terms used by players to give out directions:"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; battleground implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/warsong-gulch.html\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/warsong-gulch.html&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nWarsong Gulch.\nThe calm over &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; was pierced by the shriek of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s grinding into motion, tearing into trunks. &lt;a href=\"Gorshaka\"&gt;Gorshaka&lt;/a&gt; grinned as she wheeled the &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt; around and gestured to two others with her &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;. Together the trio rode confidently across the plain toward the enemy base.\nA quick look around the entrance ramp confirmed it was deserted; with weapons ready, the attack party followed warily behind their leader as she strode into the lair of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;... \n\"Just a few steps closer...\" &lt;a href=\"Aron\"&gt;Aron&lt;/a&gt; thought, his breath held as he kneeled on a perch overlooking the flag room below. The stench of unwashed &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s drifted through the corridor long before they showed themselves. The filthy creatures were sauntering into the stronghold as if they owned the place!\nThe orc wench and her two lackeys strode in, closing in on the battle standard displayed proudly in the main hall. He unsheathed his daggers. The time was right.\nAron jumped down from his hiding place behind the trailing orc and shouted, \"NOW!\" He stabbed swiftly at the unprotected back of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and the orc quickly fell to Aron's poisoned blades. Two other night elves appeared from concealment, weapons drawn and springing into action. \nGorshaka whipped around, eyes wide. A trap! She shoved the remaining orc forward. \"Grab the flag,\" Gorshaka yelled, as she drew her sword.\nThe young orc stumbled blindly toward the flag, too terrified to notice the menacing &lt;a href=\"%3AFreezing%20Trap\"&gt;:Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; set in his path. Instantly he was caught in its teeth, unable to move or to scream. The trap's owner took aim and let fly three arrows in rapid succession, and Aron and the remaining night elf pounced on the stunned orc with vengeance in their hearts.\nRealizing she was caught fighting a losing battle, Gorshaka turned and fled down the hallway, leaving her &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt; to his fate. All too soon, trailing shouts in the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;alien elf-tongue&lt;/a&gt; echoed behind her. Pursuit was not far behind.\nShe'd seen something on her way in... there! Off to the side, a &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Speed\"&gt;strange magical rune&lt;/a&gt; of some sort. The swift elves were closing in on her. The &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; grabbed the rune in desperation, her chances of escape quickly fading. The rune burst in her hand, and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; flooded into Gorshaka's body, strengthening her legs. She felt renewed, recharged. Glancing back once at the angry throng just behind her, the orc dashed away at speeds rivaling her worg at full charge. The defenders were left far behind as she left their compound and fled to the safety of the lumber mill.\nGorshaka slowed to a walk as she entered her own base. The night elves were trickier than she had assumed. She would be ready next time - that base, and the whole of the forest, would belong to the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; in good time."}

{"id": "161385", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=161385", "title": "Warsong Gulch strategy", "text": "The following is a curated list of different strategies players may attempt to perform in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttack strategies.\nTurtle Breaker.\nThis strategy is specifically designed to break a turtle defense. The strategy is based around pulling the defense away from the spawn point with one flag carrier followed by another carriers's true capture attempt. If executed correctly as few as two people may break even a ten man turtle. You need two people for this job, but the more the merrier. The first one will enter the Flag Room (FR), usually from balcony, and immediately snatch the flag, and then exit the FR as quickly as possible through one exit. This Flag Carrier (FC) should expect to die due to the large defense, but try to get as far as possible beforehand. If all goes well most or all of the defense will follow that FC, leaving the second player free to enter and camp the flag spawn. When the flag is returned he/she will instantly snatch the flag and exit from the other exit which should now be free of defenders. This will probably take a few tries, but keep pulling back and forth - sooner or later the turtle will break enough to run home with the flag. There are many variations of this strategy, but this is the basic concept which can be carried out by all classes.\nHow to counter.\nSimply not let them get away with tricking your team away from your flag, instead of sending all of your team to return it, just send enough to return it and leave the rest to deal with the next one coming.\nSoloing.\nSince only one can carry the flag at a time, you also only need one to enter the base. The best way to enter is via ramp as it is usually less guarded than tunnel, although tunnel does have advantages as well. What you want to do when carrying out this strategy is to dodge all opposing players, in other words not engage in fighting at all on your way to pick up the flag. Often the easiest place to stay out of sight while approaching the base is to hug the right wall (west for Alliance and east for Horde) and then enter through the hole in the fence by the ramp. Once inside the base it will often be smarter to enter from balcony as you are then better able to handle any potential defense. Grab the flag and exit in a way where the chance of getting detected/intercepted is the least. Remember you can only exit by ramp (go left), tunnel (middle) or graveyard (go right), where tunnel is usually the riskiest of them, but provides the shortest run. Remember that all classes can do this, but rogues and druids can stealth in for an even easier entry, and then use sprint/dash to outrun potential defenders. Once you're out you should either run home or to support, depending on the situation and your team.\nHow to counter.\nPut a defender or two on defense whose main job it is to slow/cc/kill anyone coming solo to get flag. If they manage to exit make sure your team know where to intercept the flag to return it. While they are running do your best to slow/cc/kill that flag carrier while you wait for your team to show up.\nZerging.\nThis a relatively common strategy and it's based around the idea that as long as we are more then them we will kill them, and thus succeed. The basic concept on how to carry this strategy out is to keep all of your team together and alive, moving in the same direction and doing the same thing. Where you enter using this strategy is irrelevant as you'll probably have more people than they have defending anyway, thus you are able to both kill them and grab flag without problems. On the other hand it is important to remember that you don't actually have to kill anyone to grab a flag, and you don't need everyone killing either. What is possible is to start general chaos by attacking defenders and have someone exit with the flag in the confusion that arise, then have your team follow the flag while peeling of attacking defenders/returners.\nHow to counter.\nSimply let them have your flag (loosing a flag is not the end of the world), you can get it back later when it is easier to deal with them, instead go get their flag which will prevent them from scoring and do your best to prevent the zerg intercepting your flag carrier as he/she will most likely die fast should he/she run into them.\nDuoing.\nThis strategy is very similar to soloing the flag, but you bring along a support to help with the job. Usually there will be a tank like character and a class with healing capabilities in such a group, however there is nothing wrong with other combinations if that's the intention. The attack itself is fairly similar to the solo attack, but the supporter (you should decide up front which character will carry the flag) should be ready to heal/dispell/cc/dps at all times. It is possible to do more attacking when two, if there are opposition chances are they are alone and can then be worth taking out. However remember that you don't have to kill anyone to get the flag, thus you should only start with killing opposition if it seems smarter than simply CCing them and running back home.\nHow to counter.\nIf the supporter is a healer you need to remember that any good healer left alone will be able to heal through most damage done in pvp, thus you cannot leave him/her alone. On the other hand he/she will then most likely start healing him-/herself leaving the FC free to dps you. The best way is usually to stun/sheep/fear/etc. the healer and take out the FC when it's without it's support. If the supporter isn't a healer, you can simply focus fire on the FC for a quick kill.\nAttack from high ground.\nSince both bases have different levels, but defense tends to all stay in flag room you can use this to your advantage. The entrance to either roof or balcony is very often poorly defended, if defended at all. By attacking from high ground you choose when the fight is initiated, and you also have the advantage with them being unable to run directly to you. Keep in mind though that all range can be used from the flag room and up to you if they have you as target, but if you then simply back out of line of sight you cancel their attack possibilities. AoE attacks are often very good for this attack. If you appear to be solo you can very often pull rogues/warriors/paladins out of the flag room if you attack them like this, leaving you open to jump and get flag with no defense. Another possibility is having a mage jump in from roof with 2-3 healers spam healing him/her while the mage AoE kill everyone in sight.\nDefensive strategies.\n5 men defense.\nUsing this strategy you will be using 5 people inside your flag room. The aim is to prevent anyone of the opposing force to get to your flag and you will be killing everyone. There should be at least one hunter who frost/ice trap the flag, and other people in stealth doesn't hurt either, leaving defense with the advantage of surprise.\nPros.\nIt is a relatively strong defense against narrow minded attackers.\nYou have potentially a lot of damage dealing capabilities and possibly even some support.\n7-9 men defense.\nVery similar to a 5 man defense, but using more people to do it. Your goals will be the same as when using 5, but now you have more people to do it which might make you able to cover more of your base and/or use scouting. You should still have a hunter (or several) trap the flag and people in stealth can help you as well. (if you decide that 10 people on defense is the way to go remember that you are no longer in any position of getting their flag, thus you are doing nothing but waiting to loose)\nHow to counter.\nThis is a large turtle and the best way is to use a turtle breaker, but you could possibly overpower them if your team is good enough/well enough geared. Keep in mind though that if you try to overpower them you leave yourself open for retaliation.\n1-2 men defense.\nUsing this strategy you will have one or two people on FR defense (and the rest elsewhere on the map) who's main job is to prevent anyone ninjaing your flag. Whereas they will never stand up to an attacking zerg, they will be able to provide information about the status of your flag and/or deal (up to) considerable damage to their flag carrier and/or hopefully kill/cc FC supporters. When/if a flag leaves your base with this strategy it is the defense's responsibility to tell the rest of the team where your flag is heading. In theory you could have any class on defense here as everyone can tell where the flag exit, but classes with high damage burst potential and/or slowing abilities are arguably better at this job. Stealth also works wonders here, meaning that classes like rogue and hunter are very well suited for this job (one very viable choice for alliance is a NE hunter with a cat in stealth). Remember that this strategy base itself around the assumption that someone will get your flag at some point.\nHow to counter.\nSimplest is to use more people than they have and just take the flag, but considering that their team does probably have a strong midfield it might be hard to get a large force inside their FR making it harder to overpower them.\nYou can use a variation of the turtle breaker, since this strategy more or less assume that the flag will be caught, they will most likely follow whoever gets the (first) flag to return it, leaving you open for a quick repick, OR you can cc/kill them on your way out while your FC take a beating.\nNo defense.\nBy opting for this strategy you free up all your team to be able to do other tasks, but you will also at the same time leave yourself wide open to even the lowest level and poorly geared beginner. However if your midfield is good, there are no reason why it shouldn't work. As most people simply aren't good enough and/or motivated enough to enter the opposing base solo, chances are you don't have to worry about your defense at all. Keep in mind though that having no defense you cannot provide any information about whether it is safe for your FC to enter your FR on his/her return. Also keep in mind that there are little to no point in defending your FR if you have already lost your flag, though if you know that the flag will be returned shortly it might be worth defending an empty FR.\nHow to counter.\nSimply sneak in 1-2 people to snatch flag, if their midfield is too strong for simply dodging them you can stealth past them."}

Once led by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he sent an army of &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s to cut a quarry down into the tundra to make the walls and towers; which became the &lt;a href=\"Mightstone%20Quarry\"&gt;Mightstone Quarry&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong the road from Garrosh's Landing to Warsong Hold, a village including &lt;a href=\"Torp%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Torp's Farm&lt;/a&gt; sprang up to house the peons working on the fortress.\nHistory.\nBefore they built up Warsong Hold, the Horde had &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Garrosh's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, named after &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; since he led the fleet of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Orc%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s that landed at the coast. They used it as their main port after they decided to build their fortress inland, as they required a base of operations, a location to house their troops, as well as a place for formulating strategies to further the Offensive's hold in Northrend.\nAn army of &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s were sent from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to build this large keep. They began digging into the cold stone surface of the tundra and carved out massive blocks of stone. With the aid of cranes, they began positioning the blocks atop the hill they dug around. After a short time, the fortress itself was completed. Once the Hold was completed, the peons began work on an outer line of defenses; a series of towers and gates around the outer edge of the &lt;a href=\"Mightstone%20Quarry\"&gt;Mightstone Quarry&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAll however has not gone according to plan for &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and their keep. While they were building, the peons broke through into the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; tunnels and had their people snatched up by the &lt;a href=\"Nerub%27ar\"&gt;Nerub'ar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; nerubians. Unwilling to let them take down Warsong Hold's defenses, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Razgor\"&gt;Overlord Razgor&lt;/a&gt; sent Horde forces on the offensive against them. Seeking to stop the attack on Warsong Hold, &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Holgoth\"&gt;Quartermaster Holgoth&lt;/a&gt; sought to destroy the sinkholes that the Nerub'ar used as tunnels and passages within the quarry. The Nerub'ar forces attacking Warsong Hold ultimately retreated before the dedicated efforts of the Horde.\nAt the same time, the peons who have moved to Warsong Hold were being housed in small shelters around the base of the keep, which have been taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. They ravaged the village and began creating more undead minions for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nThe Shattering.\nSome months before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Warsong Hold to meet with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. With the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as good as over, Garrosh was recalled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to experience a hero's celebration, in honor of the Horde's victories under his leadership. It was then revealed that &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, his second-in-command, would remain within the hold as part of the Horde's Northrend skeleton crew and as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. While Garrosh and Cairne were taking the majority of both the fortress and Warsong Offensive's troops back to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; attacked again, but they managed to escape by ship.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the fortress looks to still be holding, but it's half-covered in webs like a thing of nightmares.\nTravel connections.\nBeing one of the first places that &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers can come, Warsong Hold is an important travel hub.\nFlight paths.\nTo get to the flight master, adventurers must take an elevator from the second floor (where most of the profession trainers are located) to the top of the fortress.\nZeppelin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; lands at a small raised platform inside of the fortress itself.\nOccupants.\nAdventurers seeking training for Leatherworking and Skinning at the Grand Master level must travel to &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le%20Village\"&gt;Taunka'le Village&lt;/a&gt; to the north east and speak to &lt;a href=\"Awan%20Iceborn\"&gt;Awan Iceborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiponi%20Stormwhisper\"&gt;Tiponi Stormwhisper&lt;/a&gt; respectively."}

These quests have significantly better rewards than other repeatable quests. Daily quests come in many different flavors, and many are for reputation, professions, seasonal events, and pet battles.\nDaily quests are denoted by blue exclamation marks and question marks () appearing over the quest giver's head, as compared to regular quests, which have yellow marks ().\nReset times.\nThe exact reset time for daily quests (that is, the time the next \"day\" begins) is the same across the region (North America, Europe, Oceanic, etc...), selected to be early in the morning local time. These times are fixed, although local times may increase or decrease by an hour at two points in the year due to changes. The reset times for each region are:\nTimes are given in , since many different time zones may be playing in each region. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc\"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; displays the current UTC, along with the offset from the local time zone.\nHistory.\nBefore the introduction of daily quests, the sole means of gaining high levels of standing with the various &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;reputation factions&lt;/a&gt; was constantly &lt;a href=\"grinding\"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt; mobs, either for direct standing gains from kills, or from special items looted from mobs that could be turned in to a &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20reputation%20quest\"&gt;repeatable reputation quest&lt;/a&gt; giver. This was a long, slow, and arduous process, especially if players were trying to reach standing with \"any\" of the factions.\nDaily quests were introduced during \"\" in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1\"&gt;patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; factions, with a system-enforced limit of 10 daily quests completed each day. The same few daily quests were available every day for the factions, and this quickly led to complaints about the repetitive, grindy nature.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, Cooking daily quests were added and offered one quest from a pool of several in an attempt to ease the monotony. This concept was also used for the daily battleground, dungeon and Heroic dungeon quests added at the same time, and for future profession daily quests.\nThe daily limit was raised to 25 in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, as the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; series of daily quests alone provided up to 19 more quests to do each day. The Shattered Sun quests suffered from the same problem that the other faction daily quests did in that only the same 19 daily quests were available each and every day. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, added during \"\" in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2\"&gt;patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, was after progressing far enough, the first daily quest hub to offer at least some variation from a couple of the quest givers.\nDaily dungeon, Heroic dungeon, and battleground quests were all removed during &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3\"&gt;patch 3.3&lt;/a&gt;, owing to the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; tool and the Random Battleground system being implemented.\nWith the launch of \"\" in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard finally provided quest hubs on &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tol Barad Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; that did not offer the same quests each and every day\u2014the quest givers provided players six quests from a pool of 22.

He believed that he was the rightful Warchief of the Horde due to lineage, and sought to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, he allied the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. The two used their combined resources to create the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which they hoped to unleash upon the world. His mount was a massive chromatic drake named &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;Gyth&lt;/a&gt;. Commanding legions of orcs, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, along with backing from the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Rend was considered to be a great threat to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually slain.\nBiography.\nRise of the Horde.\n6 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; sought to convince &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Chieftain Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; to take up the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To help convince the chieftain, Gul'dan taught some of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; in the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic and how to rapidly grow adolescent orcs to adulthood by imbuing them with fel power. Blackhand was astounded by the results and ordered the shaman to transform his young sons Dal'rend and Maim into \"proper soldiers\". After coming of age Dal'rend served as a member of the Horde, participating in the &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;savage war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the siege of &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; was offered the city as a reward for leading the raid on it. When Durotan turned it down, Blackhand and his family were more than happy to take Telmor as their own, even going so far as wearing the clothes and sleeping in the beds of the draenei they had killed. This ended when the whole of the Orcish Horde was moved to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to better carry out the orders of Blackhand. After this, Dal'rend alongside Maim accompanied Blackhand into &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, where an alliance of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and orcs was made. Eventually, both sons drank the &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst War.\nDal'rend and Maim ultimately became leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, an offshoot of the Blackrock, and accompanied their father through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. After Warchief Blackhand was killed by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend and Maim continued ruling over the Black Tooth Grin.\nTides of Darkness.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend served as lieutenant to the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. He and his brother &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; often questioned Doomhammer's orders, as Orgrim killed Blackhand the Destroyer and took his place as Warchief, but they never disobeyed any of his orders. However, Orgrim allowed the insubordination both because he knew any explanations he gave would filter back to the rest of the Horde and because the two brothers were leaders of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. Later Dal'rend and his brother were amongst the army who &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend was ordered by Doomhammer to have his clan break off and chase after the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken to the sea in search of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He and his army battled against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but once they learned that Gul'dan had perished within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; they retrieved his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; from one of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; before sailing back east and returning to Doomhammer.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt;s dispatched by &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; found the Black Tooth Grin's vessels and delivered word of the Horde's retreat to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend and Maim ordered the Black Tooth Grin to alter course and sail to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. That region was still under Horde control, and from there they could reach Blackrock Spire by land. However, near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde fleet was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s Alliance navy, which was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Dal'rend and Maim's ship and a few other vessels survived intact, but most of the Horde fleet was sunk by Proudmoore's superior forces and the dragon riders scattered in all directions.\nDal'rend and Maim later personally fought &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, only to flee when it became evident that the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; had the upper hand.\nWhile most of the rest of the Horde was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the Second War, Dal'rend and Maim evaded capture and took control of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; along with other Horde survivors, with Dal'rend declaring himself Warchief of the weakened Blackrock clan. Dal'rend and Maim despised Orgrim for having killed their father and blamed him for the Horde's defeat, and the brothers now planned to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;reforge the Horde&lt;/a&gt; as they saw fit. They gradually reached out to other large groups of survivors, trying to rally them under their new banner. While the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; ignored them, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; pledged their support and offered to give some of their enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; to Dal'rend and Maim's forces if they were ever needed.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nAbout two years later, the Dark Portal reopened and emissaries from &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, were immediately sent to Dal'rend and Maim asking them to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and to ask to borrow the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s held captive by the allied &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. Dal'rend only laughed and refused. Not only did he call Ner'zhul a coward for staying safe in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; while he fought the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, but that Ner'zhul would fail in time. Unable to enter an agreement, Teron left the warchief to his bidding, with Dal'rend gleefully awaiting Ner'zhul's fall so that he could gather up the remnants of the Draenic orcs into his own army.\nNot long after, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, sent by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, came to Blackrock Spire. The &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; had sided with the Horde of Draenor, and Nefarian quickly took command of the Blackhand brothers and the forces under their control.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn Year 25 after the defeat &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; turned her attention to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; that occupied the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. She knew that the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; had entered an alliance with the orcs and conducted experiments to create &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;draconic monstrosities&lt;/a&gt;. Her spies made sure that word of that reached &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde was infuriated. Horde champions sent by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Blackrock Spire and defeated both &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Dal'rend Blackhand and his master, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, taking the head of the dragon with them to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of his followers scattered.\n\"The following part was made incorrect and non-canon by the release of that confirmed the canon death of Dal'rend.\"\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, it was mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt; under Dal'rend Blackhand were wreaking havoc beyond Grim Batol.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend was targeted by &lt;a href=\"Acride\"&gt;Acride&lt;/a&gt; who sent adventurers to kill him.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Rend and his brother Maim were the two who killed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s father &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. They were traitors to their race, as they collaborated with the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; system for gold and favors. They paid a fortune for the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s to create the &lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt; which would keep the orcs pacified, and were about to make a blood pact in agreement to aid &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Lieutenant Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; with the forces of their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall interrupted the meeting by setting the room ablaze, and Rend and Maim were trapped between the fires, confronted by the orc whose family they had murdered. Rend, reduced to begging, tried to claim he was forced to by his father, but Thrall failed to fall for Rend's lie, and used their blood mixed together to kill them with the \"Eternal Damnation\" spell, causing their flesh to melt and their souls being sent to hell for all eternity.\nRend was described as the brains of the two by Thrall, a description that still seems to apply in modern lore.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; swarmed up and tried to destroy the Dark Horde. The Dark Horde fought back, and Maim was killed in savage battle. His sacrifice, plus Rend's alliance with the Black Dragonflight, allowed them to drive back the Dark Irons and maintain their hold on Blackrock Spire."}

However, he can be pulled using ranged attacks without aggroing the guards immediately next to him. Once a path to him has been cleared, he can then be pulled to a clear spot to fight; the small patch of shore just south of the entrance to the fort is ideal.\nDalan deals melee damage, and will use Heroic Leap if his target strays more than 15 yards away, inflicting damage as well as closing the gap, so stay within 15 yards. Dalan's auto-attacks deal a surprisingly large amount of damage, and he will steadily apply cumulative stacks of Sunder Armor to targets, increasing that further. His most important ability is Cracking Blow which deals heavy damage in a line in front of him. Players should watch carefully for this, and take great care to strafe or run out of the line of this attack. This ability is not only deadly and very fast, but its range is surprisingly large; even standing several yards behind Dalan is not always enough to avoid taking heavy damage. Players having trouble getting out of the way in time can begin strafing or circling Dalan pre-emptively; since he uses his Cracking Blow every few seconds, it's not too hard to anticipate, and the reliable avoidance of his main attack is well worth any loss in damage output. The direction of the Cracking Blow is determined by his orientation at the beginning of the cast, and Dalan takes a little while to come round after each use."}

After the second expansion, the area was replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; since the city had then been added in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe city contains areas that are faction-specific in the same manner as Shattrath City is divided amongst the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;. Certain parts of the city can only be reached by Alliance players (&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt;) while others are strictly for Horde use (&lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;). The majority of the city remains neutral.\nIt acts as the neutral &lt;a href=\"sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; city for the continent, similar to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and can be accessed via the &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20to%20Dalaran%20Crystal\"&gt;teleport crystal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Stand\"&gt;Violet Stand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, or through a flight path. &lt;a href=\"Portal\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt;s are located within the Alliance and Horde districts of the city, connecting to the factions' &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital cities&lt;/a&gt; and Shattrath City. There is a portal trainer at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Gate\"&gt;Violet Gate&lt;/a&gt;, and there are battlemasters and an arena master in the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;Underbelly&lt;/a&gt; sewer system. Like &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaran has its own instance within the city: the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike Shattrath City, there were originally no class trainers - with the notable exception of &lt;a href=\"mage%20trainer\"&gt;mage trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, given the city's history - nor an Auction House (&lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; introduced an Auction House for &lt;a href=\"Master\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s with the addition of Steam Powered Auctioneers to the &lt;a href=\"Like%20Clockwork\"&gt;Like Clockwork&lt;/a&gt; engineering shop, while &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; made the auctioneers usable by everyone and added class trainers). &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Master\"&gt;Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; trainers for each profession are available in the city.\nIn-game, the city of Dalaran was originally a &lt;a href=\"no-fly%20zone\"&gt;no-fly zone&lt;/a&gt; below a certain altitude (slightly higher than the rooftops), with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, where the flight point is located, and the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;Underbelly&lt;/a&gt;. This was to help maintain the atmosphere of the city, but with Cataclysm, the rule was lifted.\nCataclysm.\nThe portals to the Alliance and Horde major cities were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; and replaced by class trainers. However, the portals to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; were restored in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;. The formerly engineering-only auctioneers \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Brassbolt%20Mechawrench\"&gt;Steam-Powered Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Arcfire\"&gt;Steam-Powered Auctioneer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 now serve anyone and flying is now allowed.\nFor information about getting out of Dalaran and getting around the Old World without the portals to the major cities, &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20travel%20guide\"&gt;Cataclysm travel guide&lt;/a&gt; will prove useful. Note that, while it has been explained that Outland and Northrend take place within the time frame their storylines occurred in, the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; in the old world remains empty.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the purge, Dalaran had already left Northrend and was in motion. However, for game purposes, Dalaran remains unchanged after the questline is completed (see &lt;a href=\"%23Notes%20and%20trivia\"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;).\nLegion.\nDalaran was moved to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion in order to protect the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. It then teleported to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; where it served as the capital city for Alliance and the Horde players. During the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; sent Legion ships to destroy the city.\nThe city's layout was overhauled for \"\" with notably the Underbelly being expanded and the center of the city becoming a portal hub.\nFactions.\nIn the Dalaran present in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", there are three major &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s players can deal with. These are:\nGetting there.\nGetting to Dalaran in Northrend.\nDalaran is located in the north-central region of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, floating above the western side of &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Boats\"&gt;Ships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s departing from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; provide access to Northrend from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you are in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, there are a number of ways to reach Dalaran:\nGetting to Dalaran in the Broken Isles.\nAll players arrive in Dalaran over the Broken Isles on the quest &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Blink%20of%20an%20Eye\"&gt;In the Blink of an Eye&lt;/a&gt; and receive a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Dalaran Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to teleport to Dalaran once every 20 minutes.\nIn addition, every &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Class Hall&lt;/a&gt; has a portal to Dalaran. There are also portals in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the same portals previously used to get to Dalaran over Karazhan for &lt;a href=\"Calling%20of%20the%20Council\"&gt;Calling of the Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, at level 110, mages can learn a portal to Dalaran over the Broken Isles from a portal trainer, allowing them to teleport other players there. And like its Northrend version, Dalaran over the Broken Isles has &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;s who allow players to set their regular &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; there.\nTravel connections in Northrend.\nPortals.\nWhen \"Wrath of the Lich King\" went live, Dalaran supplanted &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; as the major hub for player activity, due to easy access to the capital cities in the southern continents, to Outland via Shattrath, and to the high-level content in Northrend. Those portals were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, but portals to Orgrimmar and Stormwind City were added in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel connections in the Broken Isles.\nTeleport circles.\nEvery class hall has a portal to it located in Dalaran, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, which has a special, instant-arrival flight, effectively a teleport\nIn Hearthstone.\nDalaran is the major setting of , being invaded by the . The Bank of Dalaran (or Dalaran Bank), the Violet Hold, streets of Dalaran, the Underbelly, and Kirin Tor Citadel are areas of battle. At the end of the heist, the League steals the entire city, flying it to &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; to set up ."}

It is ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital, also called &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, was recently moved to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and then to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounding and early history.\nDalaran was one of &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;several city-states&lt;/a&gt; that emerged as the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was in decline. Long ago, most human magicians lived in &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; but eventually many fled leaving the restraining confines of Strom behind and traveled to Dalaran, where they hoped to use their new powers with greater freedom, wanting a place more suited to extensive use and study of magic. There, these magicians used their skills to build up the enchanted spires of the city and reveled in the pursuit of their studies. More wizards followed, and the city became a haven for magi and a center of arcane study. The citizens of Dalaran tolerated the magicians' endeavors and built up a bustling economy under the protection of their magic-using defenders. With the mages of Dalaran protecting the inhabitants who weren't magic-users with powerful protection spells, Dalaran became a decadent, extravagant paradise. Later it was found that Dalaran had been built atop a massive &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet, as their numbers and influence grew with more and more magi practiced their arts, the fabric of reality around Dalaran began to weaken and tear. The wizards' overuse of magic with no proper protection or regulation acted as a beacon for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, luring them back to Azeroth. Demons slipped through the gaps in reality, terrorizing the locals until the ruling &lt;a href=\"Magocrats\"&gt;Magocrats&lt;/a&gt; were forced to turn to the elves for aid. The &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; sent high elven wizards who quickly realized what had happened. Though not a prominent thread, they warned that if humanity continued to wield magic the demons would never be completely eradicated. The Magocrats, unwilling to sacrifice their power, instead proposed selecting a group of powerful magic casters to protect them from the Legion. Thus, the Magocrats and the elves would formed a secret order known as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. It would form a secret defense for the world, with a Spearhead as their main acting weapon. The elven lords decided to reveal them the history of ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the Legion. At the same time, the Magocrats sent some of their number to research and catalog all human magic. These wizards would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a specialized organization that was charged with cataloging and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known at the time. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; became the rulers of the Kirin Tor, and eventually replaced the Magocrats at the head of Dalaran.\nUnder the vigilant watch of the Order, Dalaran became the chief center of learning for magicians throughout the land. Dalaran, though not a large city, was a beautiful place of towering spires and glittering streets, and the people there were happy and well protected. The Kirin Tor's headquarters was the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, an impressive building so named for its stone walls which gave off a faint violet light. The building had many libraries, research chambers, testing rooms, classrooms, meeting alcoves, and bedrooms. At some point, the &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned in Dalaran. He was raised in the orphanage and, becoming a student of the Kirin Tor, showed a great affinity towards frost magic.\nDalaran's prosperity eventually made it inundated by reckless spellcasters. Their abuse of magic inadvertently tore open rifts in reality. Through one such rift, &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; clawed his way into Azeroth. The demon found Dalaran ripe for upheaval. Many of the city's non-magic users were superstitious, and they viewed spellcasters with thinly-veiled unease. Kathra'natir used &lt;a href=\"%3AApocalypse\"&gt;:Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; to inflame these fears. He tainted Dalaran's water supplies and food stores. Gruesome plagues ravaged the city, which the common fold believed had originated from the magi. The Council of Tirisfal tried to defeat the demon but lost their Spearhead, &lt;a href=\"Aertin%20Brighthand\"&gt;Aertin Brighthand&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; and Alodi came up with the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. As such, Guardian Alodi banished the dreadlord and saved &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and Dalaran from destroying themselves.\nDalaran established a friendship with &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, which while tested, would stand for over two thousand years to come. Although predominantly a human city, some elves, including their own crown prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, would study, live, and even &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran at one point or another. According to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, some of these elves were among those who had taught humans magic to begin with. Some gnomes, dwarves, and even goblins would also come to reside in Dalaran.\nApproximately five hundred years prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, former prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to bring down the Kirin Tor with a curse that left all the wizards in the city unable to use their magic. Her scheme was foiled in part by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, consort to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and when Sintharia was defeated, most believed her to be dead when her own magic had been turned on her.\nThe Kirin Tor mages and leadership took interest in &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian, and around the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, they sent &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to Karazhan to act as his apprentice. Several mages asked Khadgar to learn various details regarding the tower or the Guardian. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Guzbah\"&gt;Guzbah&lt;/a&gt;, who studied demon lore. He was the first victim of strange demon killings across the Eastern Kingdoms.\nAs the First War started, the &lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;wizards of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; were first intrigued and then terrified by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' appearance, and sent many letters with information and then requests for aid to Dalaran as the situation grew more dire for them. The northern mages appreciated the orcs' danger but thought them little more than a local nuisance, confined to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;that continent&lt;/a&gt;, and as such didn't do much to help.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaran pledged to support the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and gave large amounts of aid, magi and sorcerers to the war effort. It was home to the four towers, sanctum to the lands' greatest sorcerers. During the conflict some of its citizens were captured by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and the city itself was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; at some point, and so the wizards had to focus their magics in a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in order to rebuild it to its former glory. Some fallen spires were as such raised back.\nThough the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, in the aftermath of the Second War the Kirin Tor noticed that a rift remained that connected &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; together, and so they build up the &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the other nations of the Alliance in order to watch over the rift. After the war, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, aided by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, were able to successfully enter the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Vault\"&gt;Arcane Vault&lt;/a&gt; located in the city of Dalaran and steal the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from it. Deathwing was aware of the danger Dalaran represented for his disguise and hoped that he could sow distrust among the wizards and toward the other Alliance members. His plans were ultimately thwarted following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; which forced Deathwing into hiding, causing &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; to mysteriously vanish from the royal court of Lordaeron.\nThe Kirin Tor also developed an interest in the defeated orcs' strange lethargy. Although Dalaran remained loyal to the fractured Alliance in the war's aftermath, it was noted for being politically aloof and secretive - magi of the Kirin Tor did not get involved in \"ordinary\" politics, and outsiders were rarely welcome in Dalaran, even visiting royalty.\nThird War.\nDalaran was the home of an incredibly large library of books and tomes, in addition to many of the greatest sorcerers of the day including &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the site of the vault where the staff of Medivh, &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, was kept after the master mage's death. At this time, most contemporary &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; mages bowed to the sovereignty of Dalaran and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nTutored in the Halls of Magic at the mystical city of Dalaran, &lt;a href=\"Sorceress_%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s diligently study their mysterious arts within the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctum%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;arcane sanctum&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began, some of the aspiring geniuses of the magocracy were allured by the dark arts and forsook their very souls, becoming &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s in service to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. When King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; fell, magi from Dalaran went to the ruined &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; along with other Alliance soldiers to deal with the rampaging undead army, but soon found themselves overwhelmed. Powerless, Antonidas instructed Jaina Proudmoore to take a number of citizens and flee to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Scourge directed itself on the violet city, the majority of the civilians were evacuated, leaving only a small but powerful resistance. The &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;arcanic defenses&lt;/a&gt; and the magical guilds in the city tried to defend it but they, alongside the powerful Archmage Antonidas, fell to Arthas in battle shortly after. Arthas acquired the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;spellbook of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; utilized to summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the city in merely seconds. The great demon single-handedly laid waste to the city by creating a magical effigy out of the dust, which he then crushed; the mighty towers of Dalaran fell simultaneously. People died trapped under the rubble of the fallen city, unable to be reached in time by their comrades. The city remained only partially under the control of the Kirin Tor, and its remnants went to chaos, with &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Mutant\"&gt;mutants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Reject\"&gt;experimental rejects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wizard%23Renegade%20wizards\"&gt;renegade wizards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20Elemental\"&gt;berserk water elementals&lt;/a&gt; roaming the streets.\nSoon after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and as parts of the city were contested by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and later by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; forces, human efforts began to rebuilt the ruined city as Dalaran's ruins were taken over by &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Remnants\"&gt;Alliance Remnants&lt;/a&gt;, who were battling the Scourge in Lordaeron. Parts of the city were still infested by the undead but also its tunnels and dungeons under it. Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his brethren had also arrived to join forces with Garithos, but his animosity toward the elves led to the prince and his army being detained in Dalaran's dungeons and sentenced to mass execution. With effort, they escaped to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Dalaran behind them. What power the surviving Kirin Tor members had in Dalaran around this period remains vague, although some (such as &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt;) are believed to have been present. \nFollowing the death of Grand Marshal Garithos at &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining human &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s still surviving in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; started retreating to Dalaran. Many of them were intercepted by the Scourge and slain.\nAt some point, the pets of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; fought and killed a lot of Dalaran wizards. It could have happened when the city was still infested by demons.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, the surviving wizards of Dalaran returned to the ruins and constructed a vast, magical dome around the heart of their city. Some believe it was for protection from the violence of these times, others say they merely wanted solitude, to study and plot. The shield was opaque and completely impenetrable by any known means warding off any new attack while the magi slowly regained their strength. Archmage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to lead the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and led the reconstruction of Dalaran and its defenses. The area and ruined outskirts of their city was patrolled by the wizards and their elemental slaves, but the dome is powerful enough to destroy creatures that venture too close.\nThe region was was also the site of a guerrilla war between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The thieves of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Artifacts\"&gt;Bloodstone Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kegan%20Darkmar\"&gt;Kegan Darkmar&lt;/a&gt; were granted asylum from the Forsaken and the relics were quarantined in the &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Internment%20Camp\"&gt;Lordamere Internment Camp&lt;/a&gt; by the wizards. &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Belamoore\"&gt;Warden Belamoore&lt;/a&gt; then spent days studying the bloodstones.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; also have forces stationed in &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Internment%20Camp\"&gt;Lordamere Internment Camp&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Dalaran also has a strong presence in Outland. Dalaran's army is largely responsible for the survival of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; power in Silverpine; without the aid of the magi, the town of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; would have fallen to the Scourge long ago. All travelers in southern Silverpine will note the massive presence of Dalaran's troops. The city is the northern-most state with a sizeable force after the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; designed the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;Antonidas Memorial&lt;/a&gt; statue.\nRelocation.\nEventually, the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, was magically moved by the Kirin Tor to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, floating above the &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 close to the border with &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; is located. In its original location, a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt; was left.\nShortly after the city of Dalaran, which was raised above the skies of Northrend to counter the growing threat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, was attacked by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who laid open siege to the floating city, led by their leader, the fallen Aspect of Magic, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. Archmages &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; combined their efforts to hold off the assault, magically creating a massive shield around the city and, despite the initially unfavorable odds and &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;treachery from within their ranks&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor eventually manage to drive away Malygos and his flight.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThough traditionally barred from Dalaran, the Horde was accepted into the city through the efforts of Archmage &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the aid of his people back in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the Kirin Tor.. With this decision, Dalaran declared itself a neutral city during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and became a place where all were welcome, so long as they behaved themselves.\nOne thing to take into consideration is that three of Dalaran's best wizards: &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, have had positive dealings with &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; individuals in the past. Also, &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; studied the effects of the orcs' lethargy extensively enough to know that orcs could be reasonable in the absence of their demonic bloodlust. The Horde's allies, the blood elves, have been allies and productive members of the Kirin Tor for over 2,000 years and have vouched for them. The inclusion of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; within the Kirin Tor's ranks and the Horde supporter &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; ensured the Horde a sanctuary within the city, though Rhonin's wife &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was opposed to this notion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; are the ones to preside over the magical city of Dalaran, though only &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and its leader &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; are seen within the city. As base of operations, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was given the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; which was the base of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. For the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they were given the base of the blood elven &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. \nEvidently, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, declared &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on all mortal magic-users including the magic city of Dalaran and all its denizens. From up above the skies of &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the main factions located in the city, stand in defiance against the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; entered the city in order to find anyone capable to fight in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; against the Emerald Nightmare and the Nightmare Lord. He found most of the mages, including Rhonin and Vereesa, trapped in their nightmares. Modera and her comrades, however, were holding against the shadowy attackers, despite their exhaustion, so they did not join him in the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterlude.\nBetween the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaran remained in Northrend.\nThe nation was invited by the leadership of the Alliance to send a representative to their diplomatic meeting in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, though declined to do so, citing its desire to retain its neutrality and continue to help bridge the gaps between the Alliance and the Horde.\nTides of War.\nAfter a desperate &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; goes to Dalaran for aid in seeking the stolen &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin sends him to Jaina Proudmoore in the hopes that she might be able to aid him in his search. However, as Jaina and Kalecgos soon learn of Garrosh Hellscream's ambitions to conquer the whole of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, starting with a brutal attack on Jaina's own stronghold, Jaina herself visits Dalaran on Kalecgos's advice, requesting for assistance in staving off the impending Horde invasion.\nDespite Rhonin's initial reluctance to involve the neutral Kirin Tor into a conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; ultimately agree to provide limited assistance to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Sunreaver agent&lt;/a&gt; was a part of the Horde's attack on the city, though Aethas later denies responsibility and vowed to atone for Thalen's treachery. During the attack, Rhonin sacrificed himself in an attempt to localize Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; detonation, sparing Jaina from death. Following his death, the Kirin Tor, while refusing to launch an attack on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for Theramore's decimation, chose Jaina as Rhonin's replacement and as the new leader of the Council of Six, with Kalecgos also joining the Kirin Tor. Both of them moved to the city, though the dragon felt the distrust from the other mages and thus found excuses to go out of the city.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWhile the Alliance and the Horde were clashing in Pandaria, Jaina discovered that &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; had helped &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; by using Dalaran portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, which lead to the conception of the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed her city. Jaina mobilized the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge&lt;/a&gt; the Horde from Dalaran. Though Aethas Sunreaver claimed he knew nothing of Garrosh's scheme, Jaina nonetheless chose to incarcerate him and his Sunreavers after Aethas refused to order his people to leave the city peacefully. Those that surrendered were imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; while those that resisted were put to the sword, after which Jaina pledged the Kirin Tor to Varian's war cause, effectively bringing Dalaran back into the Alliance. The purge also put an end to Dalaran's alliance with &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, which had stood for over 2,000 years.\nDuring the purge, Dalaran had already left Northrend and was in motion. However, for game purposes, Dalaran remains unchanged after the questline is completed (see &lt;a href=\"%23Notes\"&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;).\nLegion.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the local forces of Dalaran in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; are trying to reconstruct the remaining ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt;, overseen by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeadwind Pass.\nRight after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, that marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arranged for Dalaran to move to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid in the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Dalaran was hovering over &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; and more particularly &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entire city had been moved by a giant &lt;a href=\"%3ABlink\"&gt;:Blink&lt;/a&gt; spell, and all the shops were ordered to close down because of the various troubles created by that sudden transportation. Some &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Citizen\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt;s were now suffering from dizziness and nausea, while others were re-materialized at the wrong place and were &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Legs\"&gt;stuck&lt;/a&gt; in walls or in various other objects. Some of them were even fleeing because of unstable energy running amok in the city. Several recovery specialists such as &lt;a href=\"Fanny%20Frizzlepop\"&gt;Fanny Frizzlepop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brilda%20Dopplegink\"&gt;Brilda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grindle%20Dopplegink\"&gt;Grindle Dopplegink&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the nurses at the &lt;a href=\"First%20to%20Your%20Aid\"&gt;First to Your Aid&lt;/a&gt; clinic, were trying to fix their problems. The content of the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Merchant%27s%20Bank\"&gt;Dalaran Merchant's Bank&lt;/a&gt;'s coffers had been thrown out, and several &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Guardian\"&gt;Kirin Tor Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s had to protect the bankers while they were working on fixing the situation. &lt;a href=\"Jepetto%20Joybuzz\"&gt;Jepetto Joybuzz&lt;/a&gt; himself was stuck on a &lt;a href=\"Zippelin\"&gt;toy zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; flying around the city. The entrance to the city sewers were shut and &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; was damaged by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy.\nBelieving that the Kirin Tor needed the help of both the Alliance and the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to vote on letting the Horde back into the city. While Jaina and Ansirem were completely against it, the vote was carried and passed. Feeling betrayed, Jaina, outraged, teleported out of Dalaran, leaving Khadgar effectively in charge. Together with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar then searched &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and Karazhan for means to stop the Legion's advance and close the portal in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered that such a feat would be possible with the help of five &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;ic artifacts called the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, which laid scattered over the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroken Isles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; then launched an attack on the city. With that confirmation they had the right objective, the Council cast a spell to teleport Dalaran to the southern shores of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in close proximity to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, so it would once again serve as a hub for Azeroth's heroes at the front lines in the renewed war against the Legion when countless forces pour from the Tomb of Sargeras.\nWith Jaina's departure, Kalecgos and &lt;a href=\"Vargoth\"&gt;Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; filled out the Council of Six's membership. Aethas was allowed to return to Dalaran, although not as a member of the council.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Pilgrim\"&gt;Crimson Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;s have appeared in Dalaran. Due to their choice of attire, they may be former &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; members.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; is providing secret protection for the city at the request of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shieldbreaker%20Murdonn\"&gt;Shieldbreaker Murdonn&lt;/a&gt; broke through the outer defenses of Dalaran, and made it all the way to Krasus' Landing where he was taken out by the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe tallest spire atop the Violet Citadel is actually a weapon used for the defense of the city but has been sabotaged by the Legion. The dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, helpless and imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, has his power siphoned to re-power the weapon.\nAfter the death of Kil'jaeden and Illidan's use of the Sargerite Keystone, Argus appeared in the sky of Azeroth. Dalaran's citizens grew worried, especially as &lt;a href=\"Validated%20Doomsayer\"&gt;doomsayers&lt;/a&gt; started to spread panic.\nPeople and culture.\nFactions.\nDalaran has been a hub for the Alliance and the Horde in their wars against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Three main factions have the most influence over the city.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the city was also inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerers%27%20League\"&gt;Sorcerers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%27%20Guild\"&gt;Mages' Guild&lt;/a&gt;, two Alliance-aligned &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;-factions that fought alongside the Kirin Tor against the Scourge. As they haven't been mentioned since then, they were possibly either destroyed or fused with the Kirin Tor. With the Horde being purged from Dalaran, the Sunreavers were forced to leave the city, but their &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, among other blood elves, were shown to rejoin it in \"\".\nGeography.\nOld location.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;large, gaping crater&lt;/a&gt; has replaced the old location of Dalaran, with a weakened shield in place of the opaque dome, though there is some purplish smoke around the site \u2014 possibly residue from magic dome or the city's (literally) earth-shaking exit. It was located near the southern shores of the &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;, north of the Hillsbrad Foothills. As of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the local forces of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; are trying to reconstruct the remaining ruins, overseen by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city itself currently hovers over the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; after having moved from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nSettlements.\nThe other major settlements under the magocracy's rule were &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, all of them have been lost or destroyed in recent years. \nHowever, during their campaigns, the magocracy of Dalaran established outposts and bases of operations on different continents of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and even beyond. In &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, they took up a position in the &lt;a href=\"Transitus%20Shield\"&gt;Transitus Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Ledge\"&gt;Amber Ledge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Stand\"&gt;Violet Stand&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, they landed and created the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, they set up &lt;a href=\"The%20Overlook%20%28Stormwind%29\"&gt;The Overlook&lt;/a&gt; as an encampment situated on a plateau overlooking &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Khadgar's Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;.\nDalaran in Warcraft II.\nLeader: \"&lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;The Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNation Color: \"Violet\"\nBackground: \"Dalaran is a small, &lt;a href=\"Magocracy\"&gt;magocratic&lt;/a&gt; nation ruled by a conclave of &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s known as the Kirin Tor. The capital of Dalaran is the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cross%20Island\"&gt;Cross Island&lt;/a&gt;. This nexus of &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;supernatural&lt;/a&gt; forces is home to the four great towers that are sanctum to many of the land's greatest &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s. The Kirin Tor are strong supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and to its cause have devoted the knowledge contained within their voluminous libraries as well as the power of their awesome &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn the RPG.\nDalaran was one of the original city-states founded during the Arathorian Empire. Since its inception, the city has served as a hub of magical knowledge and experimentation in Lordaeron and the world. A multi-racial wizards' council called the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; ruled the city for centuries, overseeing Dalaran from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a great, slender spire in the city's heart that housed the most extensive libraries and greatest laboratories in the world.\nThe traitor Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; laid siege to Dalaran in the Third War. He murdered its citizens, including the great archmage Antonidas, and broke into the city's heart. His ally, the lich Kel'Thuzad, then summoned Archimonde, the Burning Legion's leader. Archimonde wielded foul magic to topple the city's towers and sunder its walls. Shortly after Dalaran's fall, the undead abandoned the city to the wind and mist. Months later, a resistance force led by the surviving Dalaran wizards arrived and laid claim to the ruins. Pooling their magical power, the wizards covered Dalaran in an opaque magical sphere. It is unknown what occurs beneath the dome and the wizards warn others not to get too close. The magi are certainly working on something \u2014 but none can discover what it is.\nDespite its hardships during the Third War, the Kirin Tor refused to abandon their home. After returning to the ruins, they destroyed those few undead creatures that remained and reclaimed their city. They erected a glowing dome around the entire city, powerful enough to destroy anyone who touches it, while they worked to rebuild their fallen city long the headquarters of magical study in the world of Azeroth. The dome was impenetrable, violet and opaque \u2014 nothing could be seen beyond it. Located on Lordamere Lake's southern shore, the original location is a low-pressure region. The environment creates mists and clouds, the air is cool and damp. A rise to the city's east marked where the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; used his magic to shatter the city's spires. There were a few wrecked houses, with empty streets. Not much there.\nToday, the Magocracy of Dalaran continues to rule its nation, the city. Despite the destruction of its capital, Dalaran has remained an important member of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The exact number of people living within Dalaran's protective dome is unknown, but believed to be around 3,000 or so and only 120 of them are members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly wizards and their conjured or created guardians inhabit Dalaran, and the city possesses few real citizens. A couple hundred troops probably dwell within and can be mustered when the call to arms is sounded. Wizards are often seen outside the dome. In particular, Archmage [[Ansirem Runeweaver]] constantly moves about the dome's periphery. The archmage seems to be in charge of Dalaran and leads a conclave of fellow wizards in their vigil of the dome. The mages hold no love for the Scourge. They would see it destroyed.\nThe fortified outpost of [[Nethergarde Keep]] and the surrounding area in the [[Blasted Lands]] is under control of Dalaran and [[Stormwind]].\nRelations with other kingdoms.\nThough Dalaran had been an [[independent]] nation at some point after the [[Third War]], it has recently pledged itself to the [[Alliance]]. Dalaran considers all Alliance nations to be their allies. They are officially at war with the Scourge, although they have driven the Scourge far enough away from their borders for this to not be a real war any longer. Dalaran is also opposed to the [[Syndicate]]. They openly support war with the [[Qiraji]] of [[Silithus]]. During the [[Nexus War]], Dalaran was at war with the [[Blue dragonflight]]. With [[Malygos]]' death, tensions appear to have ceased but mortals are still wary of blue dragons due to their participation in Malygos' schemes.\nThe Violet Citadel does not support the [[Scarlet Crusade]] openly, but accept their movements and operations as long as they continue to cause disorder among the undead. They had also been at open war with the [[Forsaken]] and did not have much dealings with the [[Horde]], having been invaded by them during the [[Second War]].\nFilm universe.\n[[File:Dalaran (film) gryphon flight.jpg|thumb| flies toward Dalaran.]]\n[[File:Dalaran (film).jpg|thumb|The flying city of Dalaran.]]\nHistory.\n travels to Dalaran to meet with the .

This can also be done as the second boss before &lt;a href=\"Wrath-Scryer%20Soccothrates\"&gt;Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Before she was imprisoned by the naaru, Dalliah was one of the most vicious and aggressive warriors within the Burning Legion. Spending so much time as a cellmate to Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates did not improve her disposition either.\"\nWhirlwind and Heal.\nAfter about 30 seconds into your attack, she'll do a whirlwind attack. At that time, all melee attackers and the Main Tank need to clear her Whirlwind quickly to avoid getting hit for about 1800. After her whirlwind attack, she'll break into a 2-second heal. At this time, Rogues should kick, mages counterspell, warriors can Intercept and Shield Bash or Pummel, druids can Feral Charge, and shamans can Wind Shear. She is immune however, to any effect that will silence her, stun her, incapacitate her, or otherwise any normal effect that most bosses are immune to. \nTo increase the chances of interrupting her Heal, Curse of Tongues can be used to increase the cast time of her heal, allowing for easier interruption. However, it has a high chance of being resisted and may not be worth trying to be honest.\nGift of the Doomsayer.\nPeriodically she will cast a debuff on the party member highest on her aggro list. The debuff icon looks similar to the Shadow Protection buff, but with a red box. The debuff description reads: \"Chance to heal enemy target when healed\".\n\"When healed\" means any method of gaining HP, such as direct heals, heals over time, potions or &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure when you begin the fight that, if you have a shadow priest, vampiric embrace is not active for this reason. The priest shield does not trigger the debuff, since there's no HP gain. Affected party members should right click on, and remove all still active HoTs.\nIt is possible to keep the target alive with the priest shield. Another method would be that the tank targets a group member prior to receiving a heal (as the debuff heal the tank's target. A theoretical sound method but not very useful practically, as this require very good coordination between the tank and the healer, and even if done correctly, the tank's threat generation suffers. Therefore, it is easier to simply out-dps this heal).\nDalliah has no mana. No mana leech ability will work, though previously this was a viable strategy.\nRogues' &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt;, hunters' &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt; and Arms warriors' &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; will make a great impact on the amount that is healed.\nThis as well as the aforementioned whirlwind and heals, can be Wind Sheared by Shamans to prevent them from being cast.\nFeral Druids can use Feral Charge while in (Dire) Bear form to interrupt this heal on normal and heroic difficulty."}

Both of them will fight at the same time when aggroed.\nThe kill order in this fight does not matter, however when one dies, a spirit version spawns which is untargetable and behaves exactly like it would when it was alive. This means they should both die at roughly the same time. The best strategy is to DPS Skarvald down to 10%, kill Dalronn, and then finish off Skarvald. This is because Skarvald will randomly charge players, and when his spirit spawns it will do the same, usually towards the healer. Since the spirit has no aggro table, he may stay on the healer until the fight finishes.\nGrounding Totem can be employed even after he is untargetable to eat up his Shadow Bolts while you continue to burn down Skarvald."}

{"id": "24173", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24173", "title": "Damage (role)", "text": "Damage dealers, as the name implies, are players who are responsible for dealing damage in the group. The term is almost always abbreviated as &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; (Damage per second) or DPSer in-game. Each class can play as DPS with the right spec in the right gear. \nThe role of DPS is perhaps the most obvious of all; they focus on dealing damage to the party's targets. While the tank holds the attention of the enemy and healers keep everyone alive, it is up to the DPS to actually deal the damage which will result in victory for the party. Compared to players in other roles and specs, DPS can deal damage very quickly and sustainably. \nHowever, good DPS must learn not only how to deal damage, but how to do so without drawing the fire of the target; dealing too much damage too quickly may lead the target to turn its wrath upon the DPS, leading to a stressed tank, a mana-drained healer, or simply a dead DPS. Most DPS specs have aggro control abilities which can help with this, but must still take care not to exceed the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;'s capabilities for holding &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;. DPS often have additional responsibilities within the group, such as &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupting&lt;/a&gt; critical abilities and applying &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, and may also be called upon to assist with healing or &lt;a href=\"off-tank\"&gt;off-tank&lt;/a&gt;ing. \nDPS tends to be the most numerous role in any group, with at least half of the group typically being DPS, and is usually also the least critically responsible. A tank who fails to taunt quickly enough, or a healer who fails to notice a target taking damage can quickly lead to the death of members of the group; the DPS usually have a greater degree of latitude in performing their role. \nHowever, the DPS must still pay close attention to the fight; not only are they often responsible for critical interrupts and other situational elements, but should the DPS fail to deal sufficient damage in a period of time, the group will usually wipe, whether because of a boss's &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer or the healers simply running out of mana. It is therefore the responsibility of the DPS to deal damage quickly enough for the group to triumph.\nDPS specs.\nAs mentioned above, all classes can be DPS. Among these, four classes are exclusively pure damage dealers no matter which specs they choose: &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, each of their specs has different damage dealing potential and function, so it is still important for players of those classes to choose the right specs.\nEach of the remaining classes can be DPS with the right specs: shadow &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, balance/feral &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, elemental/enhancement &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, fury/arms &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, retribution &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, windwalker &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, and frost/unholy &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;\nTypes of DPS.\nFor the sake of simplicity, hunters and casters are often collectively called \"ranged\" DPS in contrast to \"melee\" DPS. It is not necessary for casters to stay at range during a fight, although it is usually advisable to do so.\nGroup Function.\nPrimary function of DPS.\nThe primary function of DPS is dealing damage to the mobs and interrupting enemy casters, the latter of which is a consequence of game balance where most of the class interrupts are exclusive to DPS specializations. A good DPS will significantly increase the clear time of a group by both killing mobs and interrupting disruptive mechanics. Running instances with a group full of bad DPS means prolonged time will be needed for the fighting and completing the instances. The risk of the need to deal with &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; will also be higher. Besides, prolonged fighting increases the risk of the healers running out of mana, resulting in a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; of the party.\nFurthermore, almost all boss encounters in recent expansions have an &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; mechanic, either a \"hard\" enrage where the boss will wipe the raid after a set period of time (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;), or a \"soft\" enrage mechanic making the fight more and more difficult as it goes on (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Spine of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;). If the rate of damage output is too low in these situations, the party is going to wipe when the bosses enrage or the bosses/adds are too difficult to handle eventually.\nSecondary Functions of DPS.\nMany DPS classes can also perform secondary functions in the group:\nIn conclusion, dealing damage is unquestionably the primary job of DPS in group, especially with the advent of recent expansions, where almost all bosses have hard or soft enrage mechanics and a &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; component.\nHowever, their secondary functions should not be forgotten. No matter how good their damage output is, a hunter who does not know how to trap or misdirect, or a mage who always forgets to re-sheep does not deserve a spot in a raid.\nImproving Damage Output.\nDespite the fact that damage dealing is the primary job of a DPS class, people who join &lt;a href=\"Pug\"&gt;PUGs&lt;/a&gt; a lot, or join casual guild raids, know there are a lot of damage dealers with low damage output. Despite this, it is very easy (and common) for the DPS as well as their groupmates to be unaware of their poor performance. In a 5-man instance group there are (usually) three DPS. If the other two DPS are doing excellent job, the group can still clear the instance without any problem. (The same is true in 10-man or 25-man raids. The low damage output of an individual is not easy to notice, unless someone has damage measuring addons installed (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Recount%20%28Addon%29\"&gt;Recount (Addon)&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Any DPS who care about their own performance, as well as the raid leaders who want to check the performance of everyone should have at least one of those addons installed.\nNevertheless, the interpretation of the result of those addons should be careful. Depending on the design of the addons, damage output can be underestimated significantly. For example, if the addon does not record pet damage of a beast mastery hunter, his reading can easily drop to the last of the DPS, despite the fact that he and his pet may have actually done the most damage. Moreover, some classes/specs are not meant to do as high damage as the others, yet they are still valuable to the group for their utility (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Replenishment\"&gt;Replenishment&lt;/a&gt;, raid-wide damage enhancements, debuffs on mobs).\nIn order to monitor damage output it is important to install one of these addons to see how one is doing and what sort of improvements are workin. There are many things a DPS can do to increase damage output:\nTalent.\nHybrid classes need to focus their talent points on talents that helps their job as damage dealers. Even for the four pure DPS classes, some talents are good for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; but useless in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;. You can refer to the individual class guides for optimized talent builds. Inspecting the talent builds of more experienced players, or asking for the others' criticism of your build on the class forums are also useful.\nItemization.\nBy &lt;a href=\"itemization\"&gt;itemization&lt;/a&gt;, it does not mean trying your best to get yourselves more &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; gear. It means the way you gear up yourselves. For example, I have two chest pieces of the same quality and similar item level. Which one will give me more damage improvement? What should I enchant/gem it with to give the best outcome? Such questions are frequently ignored by new players, as they usually think they will be better once they have more epic gear. This is only partially true. It is possible that an epic gear does not have the best stats for damage, so a good blue gear concentrated on damage stats will be a better choice. It is even harder to decide when both of the items are epic from sources of similar level. In that case, knowing the damage stats priority of individual is important.\n\"Casters\".\nIt is EXTREMELY common to see new or casual-player casters neglecting the most valuable damage stat: &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;hit rating&lt;/a&gt;. For any casters joining raids, their spells have 17% chance to miss the bosses (i.e. level-based misses as bosses are always treated as 3 levels above the player, not elemental resists). 17% of extra hit from talents and gear is needed before reaching the \"hit cap\". Hit rating is normally the most valuable damage stat because each point of hit rating produces more increase in overall damage than each point of &lt;a href=\"spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; before the hit cap. (As a side note, DPS classes usually should max accessible talents that improve the hit chance of their primary type(s) of damage, unless they have very good gear that provides enough hit, or a talent budget is so tight that you need to sacrifice hit talents for other vital talents.)\nFor casters with zero extra hit chance from talents, 1742 hit rating is needed to reach the hit cap at level 85. Note that Draenei have &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Presence\"&gt;Heroic Presence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;) which will reduce the necessary spell hit cap to 1640. Certain talents such as &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Faith\"&gt;Twisted Faith&lt;/a&gt; can also allow casters to convert spirit into hit.\nAfter the hit cap is reached, generally &lt;a href=\"spell%20haste\"&gt;haste rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"spell%20critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; are the stats to stack next. &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; indirectly improves damage output by increasing spell critical rate. Which one of the above is more important depends on the class and spec in question. Please refer to the respective class guides for details. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20penetration\"&gt;Spell penetration&lt;/a&gt; is normally not very useful in PvE.\n\"Melee/Ranged\".\nFor DPS classes dealing mainly physical damage, weapon is the most important determinant of the damage output. First of all, you need to make sure you have the correct type of weapon! Rogues are always &lt;a href=\"dual-wield\"&gt;dual-wield&lt;/a&gt;. Those invested heavily in Assassination Tree want daggers, while combat rogues usually use swords or fist weapons according to which weapon they are specialized at. Arms warriors usually use 2-hand weapons they specialized at and fury warriors dual wield. (Note: mace specialization of both rogue and warrior is for PvP in general, so PvE players normally do not spec it.) Ranged weapons for rogues and warriors are mainly chosen for their stats, so any ranged weapon with good damage stats will do. Enhancement shamans typically dual-wield because it gives much better damage output than using 2-hand weapons. Retribution paladins will be fine with any 2-hand weapons. For hunters, any bows, crossbows or guns will do. Their melee weapons are chosen for their stats. Generally, the overall stats of a 2-hand weapon are better than the sum of two 1-hand weapons. Death knights can use 2-hand weapon or dual-wield for damage dealing depending on their specs. Lastly, humans, dwarves, orcs and trolls have some small benefit from their &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt; for specific types of weapon.\nHaving chosen the right type of weapon, the next step is to look at the details of the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Damage%20per%20second\"&gt;Damage per second&lt;/a&gt; (dps) of the weapon is usually the most important factor. However, some specs benefit more from faster weapons, while others need slower weapons. Besides, for dual-wielders, it is preferable to use the one with higher dps with the preferred speed on mainhand. If both weapons have similar dps and speed, the one with &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt; should be mainhand and the one with only +stats offhand.\nConcerning other stats of weapon as well as other gear, &lt;a href=\"expertise%20rating\"&gt;expertise rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hit%20rating\"&gt;hit rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"haste%20rating\"&gt;haste rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"critical%20strike%20rating\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt; (and ranged attack power for hunters) are all important. Some classes/specs also need &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;. Their priority of important is different for different classes/specs, some of those still remain controversial. Therefore, please refer to the specific classes guides or forums for details.\nAttack/Spell Rotation.\nThere are at least five to six damaging skills for each DPS classes/specs. If one only uses those skills randomly or in a suboptimal order, he is probably doing lower overall damage than his full potential. Every class/spec have their own optimal attack/spell rotation. For example, a fire mage spell rotation against bosses is typically: \"Scorch x 5 &gt; Fireball x 7-8 &gt; Scorch x 1 &gt; repeat Fireball and Scorch\". For a beast mastery hunter with attack speed of 2.0 or less, simply spamming Steady Shot and refleshing Serpent Sting occasionally is enough. On the other hand, marksmanship hunters need to add Chimera Shot in their rotation to produce the maximum dps.\nPositioning.\nPositioning is very important for melee classes but unfortunately many new players do not know this. Melee DPS should attack from the back of the mobs whenever possible. It is because the mobs cannot parry or block attacks coming from their back. Besides, it also helps your tanks because if you attack from the front and the mobs parry, their next attack will be faster. During boss fights, if several melee DPS attack from the front, the combined increase in boss damage to the tanks can be significant! It should be noted that when fighting bosses with the ability \"tail sweep\", typical those dragon bosses, people who stand directly behind the tail of the boss will be hit frequently by the ability. Fortunately, you are considered as \"attacking from back\" as long as you are within the 180 degree half circle behind the bosses, so when fighting those tail sweeping bosses, melee DPS can safely attack the bosses standing at left or right side of the tail.\nFor caster/ranged DPS, usually staying out of melee range is advised. This not only helps to reduce the chance of being affected by the mobs' AOE abilities, but also potentially improves damage output. The reason is a player in melee range will pull aggro from tank when his threat is greater than 110% of the tank, while one outside melee range will need more than 130% of the tank's threat to pull the boss. See next subsection for how threat can affect damage output.\nHandling Threat.\nThe above few subsections only talk about the \"potential damage output\" possible in theory. In reality, this can be limited by another important factor: threat. All the damaging abilities generate threat. If the threat produced by a DPS is so high, the mob will turn to attack that DPS instead of the tank. Aggroing the mob from the tanks must be avoided as much as possible, as this frequently means death of that DPS. Even if the healers can spam healing to keep that DPS alive, they will need to spend a lot more mana doing so. Without any help to reduce threat generation, out-threating the tank will be common, which means the DPS will need to reduce their damage output or even hold back their attack in order to avoid this.\nFortunately, DPS classes have many passive talents as well as active abilities to reduce threat generation. Usually it is good to max the passive talents that reduce threat generation of your primary damaging abilities. For active abilities, some remove the players from mobs' aggro list temporarily (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt;), some reduce the players' threat temporarily (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;) and some reduce threat permanently (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soulshatter%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Soulshatter (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cower\"&gt;Cower&lt;/a&gt;). Those temporary abilities should only be used when the DPS players have already aggroed.\nOn the other hand, classes with permanent threat reduction abilities can use them immediately when aggroed, but during boss fight, it is more preferable to use them before drawing aggro. In the old time, when to use them was mainly guess work. Now we have a few addons that give fairly accurate estimation of the threat generated by everyone: Omen or KLH Threat Meter. During boss fights, rogues, mages and warlocks should watch the threat meter closely and cast Vanish, Invisibility and Soulshatter respectively when their threat is high. With the best threat reduction talent in the game, hunters may want to use Feign Death earlier and whenever its cooldown ends, until it is certain that the threat will not catch up with that of the tanks for the rest of the fight. For the rest who do not have any of the above threat reduction abilities, temporarily lowering the damage output when the threat is high is the only choice.\nLastly, as mentioned in the last subsection, caster/ranged DPS should try to stay out of melee range whenever possible so that they will not pull aggro unless their threat is more than 130% of that of the tanks (compared with 110% if within melee range).\nMana.\nMana management is important for mana-using DPS classes. Mana should not be a problem during trashing clearing if you ensure good amount of mana before every pull. However, during long boss fights, running out of mana (oom) can be a problem. The damage output of most of the mana-using DPS classes drops drastically when oom, so we should try to avoid this. Use abilities like &lt;a href=\"Evocation\"&gt;Evocation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Aspect of the Viper&lt;/a&gt; when needed. Always bring some mana potions to boss fights. Having a reasonable amount of &lt;a href=\"mp5\"&gt;mp5&lt;/a&gt; (or spirit for some classes) from the gear is important. How much is enough varies among classes and specs. You will probably need some trial and error before finding out the amount you need.\nStaying Alive!\nA dead DPS produces zero damage. To maximize your total damage output, the important of staying alive cannot be emphasized enough.\nFirst of all, make sure you have reasonable health for the particular fight. This is especially important for fights that everyone is certain to receive some damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt; fight).\nSecond, walk out of danger ASAP. Many bosses have AOE abilities that do high damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Keli%27dan%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Keli'dan the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;) or cause instant death (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;'s Enfeeble and the AOE followed). Melee (and sometimes caster/ranged) DPS need to learn what emote/debuff to look for and run out immediately. There are also many fights that circles of damaging zone forms under the feet of random players regularly (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Nethekurse\"&gt;Grand Warlock Nethekurse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt;). Make sure you run out of it right away, even if this means canceling a spell you are casting.\nThird, don't be cheap and drink a healing potion if your health goes too low. Sometimes your healers maybe busy enough at healing the tank, so use your bandage as well if you know you are not getting any healing soon. Hybrid DPS such as Enhancement/Elemental Shamans or Retribution Paladins should also heal themselves if possible, both for survivability as well as eliminating the risk that the healer draws aggro from casting a heal on you.\nGroup Synergy.\nAlthough not much can be done for a 5-man instance group, synergy between different classes in raid can produce significant improvement in performance. For example, melee DPS love to have a enhancement shaman inside their group because of the &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Totem\"&gt;Windfury Totem&lt;/a&gt;; Balance druids (moonkins) have an aura that gives 5% increase in spell critical chance to group members. Concerning the whole raid, if there are a lot of mana-using DPS, having a shadow priest help a lot with mana regeneration; if the group is melee heavy, warrior's &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt; or rogue's &lt;a href=\"Expose%20Armor\"&gt;Expose Armor&lt;/a&gt; debuff helps a lot.\nAbove is just a general overview of DPS classes. For details about specific classes/specs or specific fights, please refer to the respective articles or forums."}

{"id": "14247", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14247", "title": "Damage over Time", "text": "Damage over Time, generally abbreviated as DoT or simply dot, refers to inflicting some damage on one's foe which will be applied at a regular interval for a limited duration. Abilities and debuffs that inflict damage over time are referred to as DoTs. Some &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; effects also deal damage over time.\nTypically in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the damage from DoTs is applied every X seconds, in ticks. Every X seconds the DoT will 'tick', dealing damage. Ticks usually deal a regular amount of damage, but in some cases (such as &lt;a href=\"Agony\"&gt;Agony&lt;/a&gt;) this amount increases, with later ticks dealing more. Each DoT has a base number of ticks and a base tick frequency, which multiply to equal the total duration of the effect. &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; can increase the speed of ticks, causing damage to be dealt more quickly and adding extra ticks to the end of the DoT to maintain the same duration. In this case, the final tick will usually be a \"partial tick\"; its damage starts low and increases with haste until it reaches the amount of a full tick, at which point a new partial tick will start. This means that a DoT's damage increases smoothly with haste, rather than having haste breakpoints.\nDoTs may be applied using a variety of methods\u2014from a spell, a trap, a weapon, a poison, or some other form. Most DoTs are target specific, but some are also used as &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; (AoE) attacks.\nWhile all damage dealing classes have some form of DoT, the &lt;a href=\"warlock%20abilities%23Specializiations\"&gt;Affliction Warlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"priest%20abilities%23Specializiations\"&gt;Shadow Priest&lt;/a&gt; are the most reliant on DoTs as the backbone of their DPS rotation.\nDiscussion.\nDamage over Time effects are most effective when they are allowed to run their full course. Also, DPS based on multiple DoTs has a significant ramp-up time as it takes several &lt;a href=\"Global%20cooldown\"&gt;Global Cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; to apply them all to a target. As such, DoTs provide sustained DPS, without the \"burst damage\" of an equivalent &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Damage\"&gt;Direct Damage&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nDoTs in PvE are most effective in extended fights against one or more long-lived targets, and least effective in short trash pulls where the targets are downed quickly, or fights that require frequent switching to new targets. Specs relying on DoTs often lack burst capabilities, or may have to use an alternate rotation (often not involving DoTs) when burst damage is required. DoT-reliant specs must decide early on whether DoTs will be required for dealing with any given target; applying them to a target that is quickly downed is a waste of mana and potential damage output, while failing to apply them to a target that takes a more significant time to defeat will usually result in similar waste of mana and damage output, due to the substitution of less desirable damage-dealing abilities. DoT-reliant Warlocks and Priests can find it hard to maintain competitive DPS against trash without high-end gear, and will often fall back solely on &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; spells in those situations.\nOne significant advantage of most DoTs is the ability to apply them to an unlimited number of targets. This allows these specs to deal huge amounts of damage on multiple targets, albeit relatively slowly and in a manner that is often easy for healers to respond to with multiple-target heals. In PvE, on so-called \"council fights\", where two or more boss targets share a health pool, this effect can significantly amplify DoT class DPS. This technique is referred to as \"multidotting\".\nIn PvP, DoTs are vulnerable to being dispelled, but have the advantage of continuing to cause damage if the caster is silenced, out of range or even dead. This leads to tactics such as the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s infamous \"dot, dot, dot, fear\". The target has no chance to dispel the DoTs until they have broken the fear, while the caster is free to heal, run away or cast further offensive spells while their opponent takes damage from the DoTs. To compensate for their vulnerability to being removed before they have fully affected a target, some DoTs will also cause additional damage or other effects if dispelled. For example, the Affliction warlock DoT &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Affliction\"&gt;Unstable Affliction&lt;/a&gt; will damage and silence the dispeller for 4 seconds.\nOne limitation of DoTs is their ability to break &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects, such as &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;. Some crowd control spells can be modified - such as with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Polymorph\"&gt;Glyph of Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; - to remove all DoTs from the target, preventing this conflict.\nAs of patch 4.0.1, all DoTs can crit, and all spell DoTs and some physical DoTs innately scale with &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike prior implementations of DoT haste scaling, DoTs do not lose duration when affected by haste. This functionality was further updated in patch 6.0.1. Between patches 4.0.1 and 6.0.1, the DoT's duration would be the sum of the number of DoT ticks that leaves the final duration closest to the original duration as possible, meaning the duration would fluctuate around the original duration by up to half the tick interval as haste values changed. In 6.0.1, all DoTs retain their normal duration regardless of haste levels. The game engine will fit in as many full ticks as possible within that duration, and then finish the dot with a partial tick representing the portion of a normal tick proportional to ratio of the remainder time to the normal tick interval. For example, a 15 second DoT that normally ticks every 3 seconds ticks 5 times. With 25% haste, it will have a tick interval of 2.4 seconds. It will thus tick 6 times during the 15 seconds, over 14.4 seconds. At the end of the 15 second duration, a 7th partial tick will occur for (0.6 / 2.4) = 25% of a normal tick, resulting in an effective damage equal to 6.25 tick (5 * 1.25), representing the 25% damage increase per time interval from haste. As a result of this change, DoTs no longer have any haste breakpoints and now have a continuous increase in both their damage per second and damage per cast.\nAlso as of patch 4.0.1, DoTs no longer can be 'clipped'. Previously, if a DoT was refreshed before it had expired, the tick timer was reset, causing a delay of up to double the normal time between ticks between the last tick that occurred and the first tick of the refreshed DoT. Now, the tick timer is constant. If a DoT is refreshed before it expires, the duration of the DoT will be extended by up to the full normal duration of the DoT, and ticks will continue to occur at the prior interval. Between patches 4.0.1 and 6.0.1, this functionality only allowed DoTs to be \"clipped\" by a single tick before duration was wasted, requiring DoTs to be refreshed between the second-to-last and the last tick to maintain uninterrupted DoT ticks while optimizing duration gain. Patch 6.0.1 extended this period to 30% of the DoT's normal duration. For example, a 15 second DoT can be extended when it has less than 4.5 seconds remaining at no duration loss (the full normal duration is added to the remaining duration). This also applies to many short-duration buffs like &lt;a href=\"Slice%20and%20Dice\"&gt;Slice and Dice&lt;/a&gt;."}

DPS is a more practical measure of damage output than plain &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, as it allows characters of differing levels and classes to effectively compare their damage output.\nThe term dps is also sometimes used to describe the act of applying damage to a target (as in \"all dps on the boss\" or \"stop all dps\"), or to refer to a class whose primary role in a group is dealing damage (as in \"&lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; group needs one more dps to roll\"), i.e. &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;. There are UI modifications which enable players to track their DPS.\nBurst DPS.\n\"Burst DPS\" refers to damage dealt over a relatively short period of time. High burst damage is the preferable form of damage against targets at/with relatively low &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. Most classes have at least a few spells or abilities that generate high damage very quickly. This type of damage is preferred in PvP environments, but is usually too expensive or has too long a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; to be sustainable.\nSustained DPS.\n\"Sustained DPS\" refers to constant damage dealt over an extended period of time. High sustained damage is the preferable form of damage against targets with relatively high &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.

Hunters, Mages, Rogues, and Warlocks tend to have the highest sustained dps, as \"pure\" dps classes.\nWeapon Damage Per Second (DPS) Formula.\nThe general formula for your weapon's &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; is:\nIndividual Spell DPS.\nThe DPS of a single spell can be calculated as either (Damage / Cast Time) or (Damage / Cast Interval). The former, also referred to as \"damage per cast time\" (DPCT) is the amount of damage dealt over time spent casting the spell. The latter is used to express the spell's damage contribution over the total combat time, a figure used to express its damage contribution relative to other spells. For most calculations, an instant spells' cast time is treated as the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;GCD&lt;/a&gt;, 1.5 seconds / (1 + Spell Haste). Some spells have a reduced GCD as affected by talents.\nformula_1\nwhere \"HI\" is the spell hit percent, \"D\" is the base damage, \"P\" is spell power, \"CP\" is the spell power coefficient, \"B\" is the critical damage bonus, \"SC\" is the critical strike percent, \"HA\" is the spell haste percent, and \"T\" is the base casting time."}
{"id": "19681", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19681", "title": "Damage reduction", "text": "Armor reduces physical damage done against you by a certain proportion. It depends entirely on the level of the monster (or player) hitting you and your own armor. Your level doesn't matter. By hovering your mouse over Armor on your Character screen, you can see the percentage value of this reduction for damage done by enemies that are at your current level. This percent reduction will actually fall as soon as you gain a level if you're still wearing the same armor. You haven't lost anything, it's merely showing you that your armor isn't as effective against monsters one level higher than you used to be. \nThe most important thing to remember about armor is: An X% increase in armor means an X% increase in armor's contribution to the amount of damage you can take.\nThe formula for the base armor value is:\nGear armor is the armor value from the gear you are wearing. Magic armor is the extra armor from buffs such as scrolls, mage armor, armor kits etc.\nNote that talents which give a percentage bonus to armor (like druid bear form) do not include magic armor in their boost to the armor rating. This is especially important for druids since bonuses received from armor kits, sets and green effects in general are not affected by Bear, Moonkin, or Tree Form or armor-increasing talents.\nFor enemies from level 1 to 59, the reduction to physical damage, as a percentage, is given by the following formula:\nFor enemies from level 60 and up, the reduction to physical damage, as a percentage, is given by the following formula:\nFor level 80 and raid bosses, this simplifies to:\nNote that the maximum damage reduction is capped at 75%. The 15232.5 and 16635 numbers in the denominator are often confused. The constant is based on the attacker's level, not the target's level. Use 15232.5 for your attacks (outgoing) and 16635 for damage received. \nFor level 83 bosses, as described below, armor caps at 49905. The Diminishing Returns on armor as you approach the cap are rather harsh; both functions are graphed below.\nDamage Soak.\nAlthough the character sheet tooltip gives the amount of damage that the armor absorbs, it is more useful to think of how much more damage the player can take.\nIn general, the armor reduction formula can be written as\nIf the enemy is lower than level 60, X = 85 * Enemy_Level + 400. If the enemy is level 60 or higher, X = 467.5 * Enemy_Level - 22167.5 Therefore, the amount of damage that the player takes after their armor's damage reduction is applied is:\nSo the ratio of damage dealt to damage taken is:\nTherefore, the \"increase\" in the amount of damage the player can take compared to having no armor at all, as a percentage, is:\nTherefore, an X increase in armor (compared to 0 armor) means an 100% increase in the amount of damage the player can take. e.g. For a level 70 enemy, X = 10557.5. So a player with 10557.5 armor attacking a level 70 enemy would be able to take 100% more damage. A player with 31672.5 armor would be able to take 300% more damage than a player with 0 armor (which is the maximum).\nArmor required to get X% damage reduction.\nTo calculate the amount of armor needed for maximum mitigation against a lvl 59 or below enemy, one can use the following formula:\nThus a lvl 59 character who wants to achieve 75% reduction vs. lvl 59 mobs would need 16245 AC. Note that this changes beyond lvl 59, as the formula to calculate damage reduction for levels 60 and up requires much more armor to get the same mitigation. Despite the much higher armor values required for 75% reduction at levels 70 and higher, it is currently possible for a well-geared &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; to reach this point (see ).\nOr a more general formula. The amount of armor needed for a specific reduction is:\nAgainst a level 59 and less:\nAgainst a level 60 and up:\nArmor required to get 50%, 60%, 70% and 75% damage reduction against lvl 60, 63, 70 and 73 mobs.\n%Reduction Formula\nThat EXTRA armour that I need - General formulae.\nThis section is written to answer the question \"What's the amount of extra armour that I should add in order to gain extra 5% or 7.3% or 27.4% or whatever EXTRA percentage that I wish to gain in damage reduction?\".\nThe most straightforward/obvious solution is to use the \"armour-damage-reduction\" formulae given in the section above. However, there is an exact general formula to find the answer for each case - either against a level 59 or lower mob or against a level 60 or higher mob. The formulae are given below the example of straightforward solution.\nExample of straightforward solution: (you may skip this part)\nIf your current total amount of armour provides you with 35% in damage reduction and you wish to add extra 10% to get a total of 45%, what is the amount of extra armour that you should add?\nAgainst a mob with level no higher than 59, you could do the following subtraction:\nExtra armour = new armour - current armour\n\"Current armour\" is the total amount of armour that you currently possess. \"New armour\" is the new total amount of armour that you want to have in order to gain that extra percentage in damage reduction.\nFrom the previous section, \"new armour\" = (400 + 85 * Enemy Level ) / ( 100 / 45 - 1) and obviously you get the value \"current armour\" by summing the amount of your equipments armour. Then, by doing the subtraction you get the amount of \"extra armour\" you need in order to gain extra 10% in damage reduction.\nNote though, that you need to calculate your current percentage in damage reduction by solving the armour formula with your current armour value.\nThe general formulae.\nBefore looking at the formulae, please note the following representations:\nA = current amount of armour&lt;br&gt;\nformula_1 = extra amount of armour that you need to add to your current amount of armour to get certain extra percentage in damage reduction&lt;br&gt;\nR = current percentage in damage reduction provided by your equipments, buffs, etc&lt;br&gt;\nformula_2 = extra percentage in damage reduction that you wish to add to your current percentage in damage reduction&lt;br&gt;\nL = enemy's level\nPlease also note that these formulae are derived based on the equations given in the previous section which are still lacking in citation.\nAgainst a level 59 or lower mob:\nAgainst a level 60 or higher mob:\nThese formulae are in fact more general than the formulae given in the section above. In addition to using these general formulae to calculate difference, if you take R to be 0, these general formulae are in fact the same as the formulae given in the previous section.\nExample:\nFrom the table in the previous section we have the following figures:\nIf your current armour provides 50% in damage reduction against a level 63 mob, you have 7285 armour. However, if you want to add another 25% on top of your 50% to get 75%, you'll need 21855 armour. So the EXTRA amount of armour that you need to add is 21855 - 7285 = 14570.\nLet's see if we can get the same extra amount of armour (14570) by using the formula given above (note: please punch the numbers into your calculator carefully or use wolfram alpha). For level 60 or higher mob, we have:\nA = 7285&lt;br&gt;\nR = 50&lt;br&gt;\nformula_2 = 25&lt;br&gt;\nL = 63\nProofs.\nWarning: college level calculus is required.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//img849.imageshack.us/img849/8297/proof59andlow.gif\"&gt;proof: against lvl 59 and lower&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//img39.imageshack.us/img39/4944/proof60nup.gif\"&gt;proof: against lvl 60 and higher&lt;/a&gt;\nThere are only two steps in each of the proofs.\n1. Differential&lt;br&gt;\n2. Integrate both sides with the following limits:&lt;br&gt;\n a) The limits for the first term on the right are L and L. This is because while your character is fighting against one enemy, you don't expect the enemy to level up or down.&lt;br&gt;\n b) The limits for the second term on the right implies if you add armour you also add extra percentage in damage reduction.\nExternal links.\nNot a reference, since this forum post is not from an official source:\nUp to date calculator:"}

{"id": "152054", "revid": "42038977", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=152054", "title": "Damage tax", "text": "The damage tax refers to an old side-effect of the &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Fireball\"&gt;Improved Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Frostbolt\"&gt;Improved Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; talents for the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; class. The damage tax lowered the amount of &lt;a href=\"spell%20damage\"&gt;spell damage&lt;/a&gt; that effected &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; by 2% per point in the respective talents. The damage tax was introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.6\"&gt;patch 2.0.6&lt;/a&gt; and removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach of these talents reduces the casting time of the associated spell by 0.1 second per point. This effectively increased the &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; of those spells, making them must-have talents, as Fireball and Frostbolt are primary damage spells (depending on talent build). Blizzard developers may have felt that mages were doing too much damage compared to other classes, thus the damage tax was introduced to lower overall damage output. With the damage tax, the Improved Fireball and Improved Frostbolt talents still increased damage per second, but not by nearly as much as without it. As another side effect, the damage tax lowered &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20mana\"&gt;damage per mana&lt;/a&gt; or Fireball and Frostbolt, making the talent a tradeoff between damage output and efficiency. For example, each talented Fireball would deal less damage than an untalented Fireball, but more could be cast over a period of time, yet the mana cost remained unchanged.\nFormulas.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"spell%20damage\"&gt;spell damage&lt;/a&gt; coefficient is normally 81.4% of total Frost spell damage, while &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;'s spell damage coefficient is normally 100% of total Fire spell damage. The spell damage penalty from the damage tax is multiplicative, and is applied after the additive spell damage bonus of \"Empowered\" talents, &lt;a href=\"Empowered%20Fireball\"&gt;Empowered Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Empowered%20Frostbolt\"&gt;Empowered Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith 5 points in Improved Frostbolt, the coefficient is (81.4% * 90%), or 73.3%. The following formula will compute the spell damage coefficient for Frostbolt with points in both talents, where X is the number of points in Improved Frostbolt and Y is the number of points in Empowered Frostbolt:\nThe following formula will compute the spell damage coefficient for Fireball with points in both talents, where X is the number of points in Improved Fireball and Y is the number of points in Empowered Fireball:\nNote that the cast time reduction does not affect the base damage coefficients, Fireball it is still based on a cast time of 3.5 seconds and Frostbolt is still based on a cast time of 3.0 seconds.\nUsing Improved Fireball as an example, and ignoring Empowered Fireball for now, taking into account only spell damage, the following equation computes the &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; of Fireball. In this equation, d is the amount of Fire spell damage, B is the base Fireball damage, and X is the number of points in Improved Fireball.\nSolving this equation for zero points and five points in the talent gives:\nThese two examples illustrate that before talents, each point of spell damage adds 0.2857 DPS to Fireball, while after talents each point adds 0.3000 DPS, meaning that Improved Fireball with the damage tax is an overall DPS improvement regardless of the spell damage penalty. The same calculation for Improved Frostbolt shows the same result:\nWith the damage tax removed, the equation for Fireball DPS becomes:\nA mage gains 0.3333 DPS per point of fire spell damage, compared to only 0.3000 DPS with the damage tax in place. For Frostbolt without the damage tax:\nA mage gains 0.3257 DPS per point of frost spell damage, compared to only 0.2931 DPS with the damage tax in place.\nIn conclusion, the damage tax lowered DPS but never lowered it compared to not taking the \"Improved\" talents at all."}

Though highly aggressive, gnolls are notorious for being extremely unintelligent and prone to infighting, and love to let others do the hard work for them.\nHistory.\nGnolls are one of the younger races of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that the gnolls may be descendants of a hyena &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, though for the moment this is only a theory.\nAround the year 2,700 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, gnolls were among the threats that early &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; settlers faced in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gnoll War.\nThough normally a disorganized and brutish race, 75 years prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; the gnolls became a major threat to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of the cunning packlord &lt;a href=\"Garfang\"&gt;Garfang&lt;/a&gt;, the gnolls began attacking farmsteads, convoys and villages, until they even began launching full-scale attacks upon &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. The so-called &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; came to a close when King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, thereafter known as \"the Adamant\", rode with a small party of knights into the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and killed Garfang. Without a unified leader, the raiders fell to infighting, allowing King Barathen and his soldiers to decimate the gnolls and scatter them across the land.\nRecent history.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a half-starved pack of gnolls pillaged a &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farmhouse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alicia%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Alicia&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, stealing livestock and kidnapping a young boy named &lt;a href=\"Little%20Timmy\"&gt;Timmy&lt;/a&gt;. They took him to their hideout in the forest and caged him. Fearing they would eat him, Alicia asked Prince Arthas to rescue Timmy. After Arthas found the hideout, defeated them and released Timmy, Alicia arrived to the hideout and took Timmy home.\nThe cunning gnoll packs of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; have notoriously plagued the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms alike. Recent times, however, have seen the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt; of gnolls became a more ominous threat, raiding farms and human villages throughout &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Many speculate that the historically dimwitted gnolls have conspired with &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;another force&lt;/a&gt;, which is equipping them with weapons, tactical leadership, and magic. Though it is unclear what the gnolls are after, the Stormwind marshals have now realized that the creatures pose an obvious threat to the kingdom and must be eradicated.\nA force to be reckoned with in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; on the Dragon isles are a savage clan of shamanistic gnolls that have harnessed the power of &lt;a href=\"decay\"&gt;decay&lt;/a&gt;, darkening their wetland home with vile pockets of thorns and roots.\nDescription.\nIndigenous to both the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Range&lt;/a&gt; far to the south, the &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;-like gnolls are extremely aggressive and are often found quarreling amongst themselves. Though relatively intelligent compared to most beasts, they are not very bright by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; standards. They have been known to manipulate each other into fights over ridiculous things like \"whose shadow is larger\". It has often been stated that the gnolls would be quite a fearsome race, if they ever stopped tearing each other to pieces long enough to organize themselves into an army.\nGnolls are brutish and belligerent creatures who value strength over everything else and are fierce and formidable in battle, but are not the most intelligent of races. Gnolls have been employed as mercenaries, but their penchant for vicious fighting and their limited intelligence require constant supervision. Gnolls are unfortunately as resilient as they are brutish and stupid.\nHowever, not all gnolls are as stupid as they seem, for there's animal cunning even among them. The gnolls run as a pack, and every pack has alphas: The biggest, strongest, and most ruthless members that claw their way to dominance; they're the ones giving orders.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; once managed to gain the favor of a gnoll clan leader in Redridge by performing a simple spell \u2014 the kind taught to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s school children. For a day, the gnoll became very friendly to the sorcerer, until he forgot the trick and sicced his hunters on the mage. Before that, the Kirin Tor member discovered that \"when they can be bothered to pay attention long enough\", gnolls tend to focus on elemental &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism.\nMales and females alike stand at an average of 5 ft. tall once adults, but even as teenagers they stand at around 4.5 ft. Some gnolls can stand at over 6 ft. tall. Gnolls are known to be able to leap to great heights with their powerful legs, and tend to run on all fours when chasing prey or fleeing battle.\nDespite being warlike, they can be traded with and even befriended. They are able to laugh. Their friendly interaction with other races starts after they fight with them and eventually laugh together.\nCulture.\nThough most clans are not open for trading, those that are require a show of strength and respect before trading can begin, usually through combat with the singular gnoll or the leader of the gnoll clan. It is common tradition that when a gnoll dies, the members of his/her clan devour the body. To a gnoll, meat is meat, and they will even go so far as to kill and &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalize&lt;/a&gt; outcasts who return to their territory. Gnolls have been known to enslave &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the cave-dwelling creatures into a life of neverending drudgery.\nFemale gnolls exist and hold co-leadership roles as Matriarchs, but sometimes control &lt;a href=\"Grimtail%20clan\"&gt;whole clans&lt;/a&gt;.\nA gnoll's favorite food of all time are hardboiled chicken eggs pickled in brine. They absolutely hate &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; meat, however.\nSome gnolls share the same name as their parent.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many gnolls were armed with &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s. This is still true among the gnolls of the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nSome common gnoll utterances include:\nLocations.\nGnolls' main stomping grounds are the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, they have also been seen in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, though usually under the employ of one of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; cartels or pirate groups, although a few independent gnoll tribes have been seen in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. A gnoll seer named &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt; travels with the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; as well. He gives out fortunes and different buffs based on how you answer his questions.\nGnolls were first seen in \"\". &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; leaves his home after a dream tells him to meet with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;a stranger&lt;/a&gt;. He destroys a camp of gnolls, and levels up. The gnolls in question were most likely &lt;a href=\"Mosshide%20tribe\"&gt;Mosshide&lt;/a&gt; gnolls, due to their location and coloration.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Hogs%27%20Studded%20Collar\"&gt;Hogs' Studded Collar&lt;/a&gt; is a reward from &lt;a href=\"That%27s%20Whack%21\"&gt;That's Whack!&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nGnolls are known for their beastly cunning, their ferocious tempers, and their penchant for infighting. Though more intelligent than beasts, they tend to lack the finer reasoning of other sentient races. They enjoy fighting \u2014 almost too much. Gnolls make their home in Lordaeron in the Alterac Mountains and the Redridge Mountains, but they have spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, even to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where they compete with other aggressive humanoids for hunting grounds. Their tendency to challenge each other over petty matters (such as who is the tallest) prevents them from achieving any real unity and thus lessens their overall threat. This is fortunate, for their numbers are such that they could easily overrun other races of equivalent strengths. Occasionally, gnolls hire out as mercenaries, either as individuals or in small packs of two to five warriors.\nGnolls are hyena-like humanoids standing about 7 feet tall. Gnolls of the same tribe tend to share a similar appearance, with either a reddish-brown, black, greenish-gray, or yellow mane. Eyes range in color from pale blue to bloodshot red and are typically small and close-set in the head. In wet conditions, they give off a distinctive musky odor. As carnivores, gnolls consider all creatures as food, including members of their own race. Hunger, not gold or magic, is what motivates them. They have no love for other races, preferring to eat rather than work with them. Any alliances made will last only as long as the gnolls are well-fed or are cowed with displays of force. Gnolls, being lazy and feral, have little natural industry. They are capable of limited crafting, but no metal work. They do not mine or farm, relying instead on a nomadic existence and hunting.\nGnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers, using group tactics and their physical strength to overwhelm and knock down their opponents. They show little discipline in battle unless they have a strong leader; at such times, they can maintain ranks and fight as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, gnolls do use ambushes and try to attack from a flanking position. They always take special care to seek the most favorable conditions possible (such as darkness, cover, or some other form of advantageous condition or terrain) when laying ambushes.\nGnolls are known for their habits as raiding marauders or hired soldiers. Though they have average intelligence, they are easily duped by promises of food or treasure.\nSociety.\nGnoll society is organized entirely around might. The strongest and deadliest gnolls ascend in the tribal order to become the leaders, while the weaker gnolls soon become food for the rest. This lifestyle means the average gnoll tribe is always in a state of tension- the slightest sign of weakness in those leading can cause the tribe to turn upon itself in a frenzy of violence. It also prevents the gnolls from organizing for very long into anything more than a tribe. Gnoll society displays a limited specialization. Brutes are the largest and nastiest gnolls, made stronger by their privileged position in the food chain. Gnoll assassins are noted for their intelligence and use complex weapons such as bows and poisons. Gnoll poachers act as scouts and hunters for the gnoll tribes and use weapons taken from prey. Gnoll wardens have developed a magical connection with nature and use their powers to keep the other gnolls in line.\nGnolls do well as hunters or warriors. Their inborn aggression and decidedly cruel nature drive them to pursue their quarry for the sheer pleasure of the capture and, usually, the kill. Gnoll spellcasters tend to be shaman with strong elemental and warlike tendencies. Occasionally a gnoll might join an adventuring party in pursuit of a common enemy. Sometimes a gnoll is ousted from gnoll society and must make his way in the world outside. Adventuring bands who value aggressive, persistent hunters and warriors may allow a gnoll to join them. Gnoll characters may take up with either Alliance or Horde, depending on which group has been their primary enemy. (More often than not, though, they join the Horde.) A few operate independently, hiring themselves out as mercenaries to the highest payer. Gnolls are strong-limbed and fierce, but they are poor planners with little forethought and deficient leadership qualities. The Defias Brotherhood have been known to ally with Gnolls occasionally.\nGnolls are extremely violent creatures. They have been known to pick lethal fights with each other over such insane arguments such as who has the longer shadow. Many wonder how these pugnacious creatures ever stand each other long enough to breed. They only gather in large groups when the opportunity for battle or plunder arises. They make vicious, if unreliable mercenaries, as they will go anywhere they can be offered a good fight. It is believed by some that if the gnolls were ever to put aside their differences long enough to band together into a single group, they would make a formidable army.\nLazy and feral, gnolls prefer to pillage and steal what they want rather than working for it. The largest, strongest gnoll in a group is known as the Brute. He is the de facto leader of the tribe, and all others submit to him. Brutes are allowed to take the best loot from raids, leaving what they don't want for the others to fight over.\nThere is a possibility that gnolls eat other sapient races (see &lt;a href=\"Little%20Timmy\"&gt;Little Timmy&lt;/a&gt;) and gnoll mobs sometimes say the line \"More bones to gnaw on.\"\nWhile most gnolls use melee or ranged weapons, some can use shamanistic or even warlock magic. Their favored weapons are maces (or other blunt weapons) and crossbows. They prefer blunt weapons because they break bones, as marrow is considered a delicacy, and because they are easy to make. When dealing with magic, gnolls prefer the nature and lightning schools. Smaller gnolls and runts are used as assassins and scouts because of their agility.\nGnolls are known to build small settlements with permanent structures (&lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20Hut\"&gt;Gnoll Hut&lt;/a&gt;s) and to mine gold. Gnolls have been seen using complex mining techniques such as railcarts and have been seen in extremely remote and dangerous locations mining gold. They have been sighted in the &lt;a href=\"Jangolode%20Mine\"&gt;Jangolode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, allied with the Defias brotherhood. \nMany gnolls can be seen wearing a round crest with a paw print in the middle. This symbol is seen in many tribes and its exact meaning is unknown to other races. Gnolls are known to wear leather and metal armor and always wear clothes.\nLanguages.\nGnolls speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, though some speak with a broken &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Gnolls learn the languages of those they interact with. These are the languages spoken by the races most likely to interact with gnolls: Common, Darnassian, Orcish, Thalassian, and Zandali. The language Gnoll is a language known by the skeletal mage, &lt;a href=\"Chauch-eta\"&gt;Chauch-eta&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is apparently no longer spoken by gnolls or is another name for their dialect of Low Common. A few gnolls knew Common as a primary language , or least a broken Common. However, this appears to be uncommon in recent times."}

{"id": "464662", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=464662", "title": "Gnoll War", "text": "The Gnoll War was a major conflict fought between the relatively young and small &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and an unusually unified faction of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; packs, around 75 years prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The war was the result of incursions by unified gnoll packs under into lands belonging to the Kingdom of Stormwind, mainly the regions of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The war quickly turned into one of attrition, where the forces of Stormwind began to become overwhelmed by the sheer number of gnolls invading their lands. With uncharacteristic strategic thinking, the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s successfully pinned down the majority of human forces in and around the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;capital of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, leaving other regions, such as the bountiful Westfall, open to attack. As a result, a large portion of human towns and lands were vigorously pillaged during the course of the conflict.\nThe war dragged on until of Stormwind made a daring and desperate gamble in launching a small, elite assault on the relatively undefended base of Packlord Garfang in &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where he succeeded in slaying the gnoll leader. This led to widespread infighting among the gnoll forces and a subsequent breakdown in the continuation of the war effort. With minor effort, King Barathen then successfully drove out the remaining gnolls, forcing them back deep into the Redridge Mountains. The outcome of the war successfully established the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; as the dominant force in the mid-southern region of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nFollowing its founding in the southern region of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Stormwind, smaller and more isolated than the other human nations to the north, began to expand rapidly from Elwynn Forest through the neighboring regions, including Westfall, the Redridge Mountains, and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt; (presently known as Duskwood). The humans of Stormwind subsequently began to develop these regions, creating many farmsteads and towns. Although this period was largely undisturbed by conflict, threats soon emerged to shatter this peace.\nAs the borders of the kingdom expanded, the humans eventually came into conflict with the packs of &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt; who also inhabited that part of the continent. Though they regularly launched vicious raids on human towns and convoys, the threat was kept under control through the deployment of heavily-armed groups of soldiers and knights, who would patrol and guard Stormwind's territories and frontier regions. Many of those initially displaced by the gnoll incursions found sanctuary and comfort in the kingdom's capital of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Order%20of%20Northshire%20Clerics\"&gt;a strong religious presence of priests and clerics&lt;/a&gt; began to provide spiritual closure to the kingdom and its citizens. Although any form of major bloodshed by the gnolls subsequently became very rare, their presence still represented a constant danger.\nThe kingdom under siege.\nDuring the reign of , however, the situation began to quickly spiral out of control. The frequency and severity of gnoll incursions began to increase dramatically, to the point where even the walled capital of Stormwind itself suffered attacks. Forces thus had to be pulled back from many of the kingdom's other regions to protect the heart of the nation in Elwynn. The consequences of this were most severe for those living in Westfall, which provided much of the grain that fed the kingdom. Without sufficient forces to protect it, packs of gnolls rampaged through Westfall, pillaging and destroying all that they came across, and razing many towns and settlements to the ground. Though costly, the gnolls continued to assault Stormwind in such numbers that few and fewer resources could be spared to combat the threat in Westfall.\nThe organization and tactical skill with which the gnolls prosecuted this war was highly unusual for their race, which generally adhered to a rigid structure of tribal packs and minor warlords. The reason for this strange, but highly successful, change in strategies was the result of the emergence of a new and intelligent leader among the gnolls. , alpha of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge pack&lt;/a&gt;, had spent recent years steadily conquering packs in the surrounding regions, until he possessed an army of organized raiders, as well as the knowledge to use them effectively. Within a year of the first attack, it is said that almost a third of all human settlements belonging to the Kingdom of Stormwind had been raided. In response to the dire situation that he and his kingdom now faced, King Barathen sent emissaries to the other human kingdoms in the north, beseeching them for aid against the gnolls' onslaught. Despite the pleas, the other kingdoms refused to send assistance, seeing no benefit to aiding a rural and self-sufficient nation with whom they could not trade as a result, in addition to viewing Stormwind's spiritual tendencies as quaint and outdated. Thus, Stormwind would have to face the threat alone. Shocked and enraged by the refusal of the other human kingdoms to aid them, King Barathen decided on a bold course of action in order to quickly and decisively bring the war to a conclusion.\nKing Barathen's gambit.\nUnder the cover of night, the king and a small party of elite, armored knights set out from the city before the next assault on the walls. When the gnoll assault commenced, Barathen and his forces made their move, not towards, but \"away\" from the massing gnoll army. The group made speed towards the Redridge Mountains, where they discovered that king's gamble had paid off. As expected, Garfang had deployed all the forces at his disposal in the assault and, as such, left himself relatively undefended, with only a small unit of his personal guard. The human and gnoll troops battled for a day and a night before King Barathen himself personally sank his blade into the packlord's neck. Though over half his knights had been slain, and the rest wounded, King Barathen had successfully dealt a major blow to the gnoll forces. Upon learning of Garfang's demise, the majority of gnolls turned on each other, as numerous would-be packlords vied for supremacy, thinning their own numbers in the process. The infighting subsequently rendered the gnolls unable to launch any further large incursions against the kingdom. Pressing the advantage, King Barathen then proceeded to rally his forces and attacked the fragmented gnolls in Redridge, defeating and annihilating the vast majority of their remaining forces. Although groups of gnolls would remain active in the region, they would never again pose a threat to the kingdom itself.\nAftermath.\nHailed as a hero, King Barathen, now being called 'King Barathen the Adamant', proceeded to lead Stormwind into an age of unrivaled economic, political, and social stability and prosperity, which lasted for several decades to come. Having rebuilt and repaired the parts of the nation destroyed by the war, the kingdom subsequently began to expand even further, occupying new territories and settling new regions. The great victory they had achieved \u2014 without the aid of others \u2014 further cemented a sense of independence and self-sufficiency among the citizens of the kingdom. As a result, Stormwind would continue to become even more distant from the other human nations, confident that they were capable of successfully dealing with any danger that arose to threaten their security; &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;though this soon proved to be tragically over-optimistic&lt;/a&gt;."}

They wear the best armor and use shields plucked from the bodies of their victims. Scraps of armor cover their thick yellow-green fur, and a wicked-looking flail is held in one hand. Gnoll brutes expect deference from those around them and have no concept of fear. They take the pick of the food and loot and leave the rest behind for others to fight over. The idea of subtlety is lost on a gnoll brute. A brute will charge into combat with the nearest opponent and pound away until it falls down. Gnoll brutes do not hold notions of single combat or honor and will generally team up and surround a single foe until it is dead."}

Gnoll wardens rely on their mystic abilities in combat to give them an edge. They avoid melee when possible, but are not afraid to mix it up and break bones if necessary.

They were originally descended from &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, metallic &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, who were afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The early gnomes eventually found their way to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, where they founded the capital of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and became allies with their nearby &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; cousins. For years the gnomes were based in Gnomeregan, providing technological support to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, until a &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt; invasion and &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;treachery&lt;/a&gt; from within irradiated Gnomeregan and killed as much as eighty percent of the gnomish population. The gnomes were forced into exile in &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; in the dwarven capital of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, until, following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes launched a partially successful recapture of Gnomeregan, and are now based in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;. After reconciling with the long-isolated &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; became the king of all gnomes, their people finally reunited after centuries.\nIntroduction.\nThe eccentric, often-brilliant gnomes are one of the most peculiar races of the world. A race of diminutive beings, gnomes have made their mark on Azeroth through the application of collective intelligence and ambition overshadowing that of their larger peers. Gnomes are renowned mechanics, engineers, and technicians, widely respected for their knowledge of the scientific facets of the world and their ability to transform said knowledge into surprising tools, vehicles, armor, and weapons. Much of gnomish philosophy is focused on forward-thinking, inventive concepts; little thought has ever been given to history or non-scientific records. With their obsession for developing radical new technologies and constructing marvels of mind-bending engineering, it is a wonder that any gnomes have survived to proliferate.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe first gnomes that came into existence were \"&lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s\", small, metal clockwork-creatures created by the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28titanic%29\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, apparently as servants and caretakers, much like the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, the mechagnomes in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; watched over and maintained the facility alongside a small number of earthen that remained out of stasis. As &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; became obsessed with curing the Curse of Flesh and retreated into the lower chambers of Uldaman and settled into long periods of hibernation the mechagnomes and earthen were left to manage Uldaman themselves. With the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; the remaining active earthen went into stasis and only the mechagnomes remained. Yet they too succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; and the affliction had them degenerate into beings later known simply as gnomes. They lost all sense of purpose and abandoned Uldaman 3,000 years before the opening of the Dark Portal.\nThe first generation of gnomes carved out an existence in the snowy mountains west of Uldaman. They struggled to survive against the harsh elements, &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s and other dangers that roamed the land. As generations passed they dedicated themselves to technological advancement; these would be the means of sustaining themselves in a savage world. In only a few generations the gnomes lost all knowledge of their titan-forged heritage. What they gained was a new society. The gnomes carved out a series of highly fortified dwellings deep within the cold mountains of what would become known as &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history.\nLittle is known concerning gnomish history previous to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 even among gnomes themselves. Much of gnomish philosophy is focused on forward-thinking, inventive concepts, and little thought has ever been given to history or non-scientific records. It was not until centuries after their transformation into flesh-and-blood beings that gnomes were recognized as a viable and important race. The &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were impressed with the ingenuity and quickness of their smaller \"kin\" (for they had also been &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-forged and similarly &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt;, though this was not known at the time and merely based on their close physical dimensions), and they assisted the gnomes in constructing a capital city, &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, in the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; near the dwarves' own capital of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomes are remarkably adept &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s. Pound for pound, they are some of the most potent casters the world has ever known, and have always had a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Gnomish society was already in contact with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2,600 BDP. A notable gnome of this time period was &lt;a href=\"Indus\"&gt;Indus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was followed much later by another gnome named &lt;a href=\"Erbag\"&gt;Erbag&lt;/a&gt;, also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, during the early days of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. He was already inducted eight hundred and forty-four years prior to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28History%20of%20Warcraft%29\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Erbag was described as being highly talkative as well as rather impatient with Aegwynn.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; was the last king of the gnomes, who 400 years ago led his followers in search of a &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;mystical land of technology&lt;/a&gt;. He left no clues where he was headed and over time his tale became a legend. Gnomes have not had kings or queens since; although &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; has the title \"King of Gnomes\", he was elected and his position is officially called &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt;. Having a personally-chosen title is simply a perk of the job.\nThriving within the wondrous techno-city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes shared the resources of the forested &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; peaks with their dwarven cousins. Though dwarves also have a propensity for &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; and engineering, it is gnomes who provide the critical, visionary designs for most of dwarven weapons and steam vehicles.\nThe First, Second and Third War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; rushed out from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and caused the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the various &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms decided to forge &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;an alliance&lt;/a&gt; in order to drive them back. This alliance also included the dwarves and the gnomes who after witnessing the orcs' attack upon Ironforge decided to strike back. The gnomes did not have their own representative in the meetings between the different factions and were instead also represented by the delegate from Ironforge.\nEarly in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; started pushing north into &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves and gnomes failed to stop the advance of the orcish army. The Horde pushed longer into &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and besieged both Ironforge and the city of Gnomeregan, but were held off at both places by the ingenuity of the &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s, whose booby traps and rigged explosives claimed many orcish lives while Gnomeregan itself was shielded by an impenetrable iron gate. Eventually after weeks of fruitless siege, Horde &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; called off the attacks and ordered the main army to move on to do battle with the humans in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; would stay behind to ensure that no gnome would leave Gnomeregan and keep the dwarves occupied at Ironforge, hoping that Kilrogg would eventually conquer the two cities while the warchief handled the armies of Lordaeron. The &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Gnomeregan\"&gt;defenders of Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and Ironforge held off the orcs long enough for Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Bleeding Hollow clan from behind, liberating both the dwarves and gnomes who announced their full support for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s cause. While the gnomes were not seen on the front lines as foot soldiers, they still provided invaluable support in machinery, weaponry, and vehicles. &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20flying%20machine\"&gt;Gnomish flying machine&lt;/a&gt; scouts swept the air, and their &lt;a href=\"Submarine%23Gnomish%20submarines\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; vessels provided much needed naval support, helping the Alliance achieve victory in the end. In many ways, they were the counterpart to the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s which supported the orcs with their own inventions. This &lt;a href=\"Goblins%20versus%20gnomes\"&gt;technological battle&lt;/a&gt; between gnomes and goblins has survived to this day and has recently been fueled by the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; joining the Horde. \nStrangely, the gnomes refused to send any personnel to aid their allies during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Though their designs also helped turning the tide against the Legion, both the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and the Ironforge - and Wildhammer - dwarves were shocked by Gnomeregan's decision to withhold their courageous troops and pilots.\nDespite this, the gnomes from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; military went with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;force&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Third War ended, the Alliance discovered the reason for the gnomes' sudden withdrawal. Apparently, a barbaric menace \u2014 &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 had risen from the bowels of the earth and invaded Gnomeregan. Knowing that their allies' priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the gnomes decided to make their stand alone against the troggs.\nThough they fought valiantly to save their beloved city, Gnomeregan was lost and nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race was wiped out during its fall. The ragged survivors fled to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. There, they made a new home in &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath of Gnomeregan's fall.\nCommitted once again to the cause of the Alliance, gnomes spend their time devising strategies and weapons that will help them retake their ravaged city and build a brighter future for their people. Currently, gnomes can be seen living in numerous Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt; cities such as &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. Many gnomes could also be found at the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, competing with their goblin rivals, before that area was flooded. (Its replacement, &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; is co-owned by gnomes.) One can also spot the occasional gnome hovel in places like &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe ruling council of the gnomes has reunited in Ironforge at &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, gnomish encampments have begun to appear at the fringes of the world, including &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gearmaster%20Mechazod\"&gt;Gearmaster Mechazod&lt;/a&gt; a mechagnome that was found by normal gnomes in the Tundra during the building of the airstrip removes the Curse of Flesh from some of the gnomes turning them into mechagnomes. While the motive behind their activities in Outland is unclear, the gnomish force in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; is tasked in establishing a forward base for the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes' leader, High Tinker &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, led an . The Gnomeregan exiles were priming their forces at &lt;a href=\"Steelgrill%27s%20Depot\"&gt;Steelgrill's Depot&lt;/a&gt;, the staging grounds for the Gnomeregan offensive and the production site of the gnome's &lt;a href=\"mechano-tank\"&gt;mechano-tank&lt;/a&gt;s. After the preparations were made, Gelbin led a full assault to wrest control of Gnomeregan's airfield, surface command post, and ultimately underwent a raid into the tunnels of lower &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Gnomeregan exiles' best efforts to reclaim their techno-city, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; detonated a radiation bomb in the city; forcing Mekkatorque's forces to hastily teleport to the surface to escape the re-irradiated city. It was a successful first maneuver, but there will be much more bloodshed before the entirety of the gnomeland is liberated. In the ongoing effort to reclaim Gnomeregan from Sicco Thermaplugg and his twisted cohorts, the gnomes have carved out a tenuous foothold in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, near the techno-city's gates.\nMechagon Island.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;, King Mechagon decided that the time had come to remove the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; from all &lt;a href=\"Titan-forged\"&gt;titan creations&lt;/a&gt;. He was busy creating the &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt;, a machine he'd been perfecting in order to achieve his goal. Not wanting to see his father's plan come to fruition, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; began to secretly plan a revolt against him. His plans were unfortunately discovered when the elderly gnome adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Kervo%20Cogpipe\"&gt;Kervo Cogpipe&lt;/a&gt;, single-handedly found his way to the legendary lost island and told the king of his betrayal. With no other choice, Prince Erazmin fled to &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; with all those who supported him, leading to a civil war between the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcforged\"&gt;Arcforged&lt;/a&gt; loyalists.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; was formerly home to a number of gnomes, but one day they abruptly vanished. To get to the bottom of this, the gnome &lt;a href=\"Parin%20Tinklocket\"&gt;Parin Tinklocket&lt;/a&gt; began investigating the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Junkheap\"&gt;Abandoned Junkheap&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, a place containing a &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vault\"&gt;large locked vault&lt;/a&gt; and various haywire gnomish machines. Though &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s helped him survey the area and gather serial plates from the robots, Parin didn't find anything indicating where his fellow gnomes went. He stated that he would send the serial plates to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and that he would contact the adventurers again if he found anything interesting.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.2.0\"&gt;Rise of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the vault door was opened. Inside, adventurers will found a transmitter using technology the likes of which no one has ever seen, sending a radio signal for help. The gnomes and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s jumped at the chance to discover where the signal pointed at and in turn discovered Mechagon. In the &lt;a href=\"Junker%20Wastes\"&gt;Junker Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, both the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were beset by death robots but also befriend the wastes' &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt;, from whom they learned more about their culture. Ultimately, the Alliance and Horde helped the mechagnomes break back into their city and fight their way into &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;'s palace to face the ruler himself.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.3.0\"&gt;Visions of N'zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the mechagnomes, grateful for the aid given to their people for reclaiming Mechagon, have rejoined with their non-mechanized brethren, thus becoming a part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nGnomes are a race of ambitious folk that celebrate creativity and craft and whose lives are validated by a masterful command of the scientific laws of the universe. This outlook on life makes them feel that to be pitied is unbearable, even insulting, though they know their allies do not do this intentionally. They have been more of a race of scholars throughout their history, generally focused on &lt;a href=\"Escape%20Artist\"&gt;escaping and avoiding&lt;/a&gt; conflict, being also known to offset their lack of physical strength with ingenuity and daring. However, the loss of Gnomeregan and years of hardship and survival amongst increased association with the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have made the gnomes stronger and more comfortable with their physical prowess, giving them a combatant edge. Gnome melee fighters have become more common, and are in general more willing to talk back to Tall Folk than ever before.\nUnlike many other races such as the dwarves, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the gnomes had no history of internecine violence prior to the fall of Gnomeregan. Generally speaking, gnomes simply do not fight gnomes. In a world of hostile creatures and Tall Folk, it goes without saying that gnomes have to rely on each other. This is why gnomes don't need primogeniture and why they abandoned monarchy centuries ago, instead electing their leaders by common consent based on their work's benefit to the race as a whole. It is unthinkable for a gnome to act in a selfish manner in spite of the cost to their people, which made &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal all the more shocking.\nAs noted above, much of gnomish philosophy is focused on forward-thinking, inventive concepts, and little thought has ever been given to history or non-scientific records. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, no gnome can turn down a puzzle.\nLittle is actually known about gnomish culture. Though what gnomish life really revolves around is unclear, it is perceived by most to be about striving towards the next levels of &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; and knowledge through experimentation and tinkering (this is corroborated by the comments and clothing of gnome NPCs).\nFrom that is known, gnomes do value and follow the hierarchy, but they also understand the hierarchy as the masters' duty over the servants, to care for them and help them. Some senior gnomish engineers may actually have less parts, metals and similar resources than an ordinary engineer, as they tend to share them with the followers. Also, the higher rank is most easy to earn by teaching others, while this, of course, requires to be a master on a subject. When goblins say they hate hierarchy as the master first cares about himself (so who would want to be the servant), they seem talking in two completely different languages. Gnome groups are small and form with difficulty over a long time. However when once established, they usually last for life, and a gnome reasonably expects much more support and cooperation from the team-mates than a goblin would. When goblin children leave the family at maturity and go their own ways, gnome families tend to stay together over generations and usually run some shared business.\nIt is not known what social norms may exist for gnomish marriages, though &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Wobblesprocket\"&gt;Marvin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tamara%20Wobblesprocket\"&gt;Tamara Wobblesprocket&lt;/a&gt; provide at least one example of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and gnomes intermarrying. Whether or not half-gnomes might be produced from such unions is unknown. If once created, gnomish family usually lasts for life as gnomes feel duty to stay together not just after the love goes away but even if they already totally dislike each other.\nBrewing.\nGnomes have recently started to venture into the field of brewing. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Cask%20of%20Gnomenbrau\"&gt;Gnomenbrau&lt;/a&gt;, \"a light beer with a big head\", and the upstart &lt;a href=\"Short%20and%20Stout%20Brewery\"&gt;Short and Stout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brewnall%20Village\"&gt;Brewnall Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaith.\nThe gnomes have had an interest in the Light since they joined the Alliance, but they were so focused on technology and, later, the retaking of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; that studying the Light didn't feel necessary to them; the dwarven priests and paladins of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; served as the only connection to the Light they needed. Now that the gnomes have reclaimed a foothold in Gnomeregan and begun rebuilding their culture outside of Ironforge, however, they've recognized the importance of having followers of the Light in their own ranks. In addition, researching new methods of purifying irradiated gnomes has led to radical advances in Light-based technology!\nJust like the dwarves of Ironforge, some gnomes have now adopted the values \u200b\u200band philosophy of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, becoming followers and practitioners of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. They are able to become &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and while priests among the other races may play the roles of &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s and prophets, gnome priests refer to themselves as doctors, medics and surgeons. In fact, the gnomes practice holy magic as a form of &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;first aid&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany gnomes are oppositely dark enough to become &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s or even &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, having no problem with ordering around minions which are several times larger than themselves.\nRelations.\nEver since their first meeting, gnomes and dwarves have been strong friends and allies, with dwarves having taught construction and stoneworking to the gnomes, helping them to lay the foundations of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, while gnomes taught them sciences and engineering in return. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the two races worked together to defend themselves against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, with the gnomes offering new weapons and technologies to their cousins, until the Horde forced them to take refuge in their respective capitals. Later &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; would welcome the gnomes in Ironforge after the loss of Gnomeregan, and the dwarves have been the gnomes' main support into taking their capital back.\nThey had however an antagonistic relationship with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who were enemies of their &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; allies, and who seem to have been allies with &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; at some point with an ambassador and several agents being found in the irradiated Gnomeregan. Even after the Dark Iron's reunion with their Bronzebeard and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; cousins relations still seemed to be tense as &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; and his men had a fight with &lt;a href=\"Drukan\"&gt;Drukan&lt;/a&gt; and other Dark Iron envoys during an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; submit at &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; though things seem to have cooled off since.\nWith the Second War gnomes became close allies with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who liberated them from the Horde &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Gnomeregan\"&gt;siege of Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, with the gnomes vowing a debt of gratitude toward the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for their liberation, with them equipping human forces with their inventions and weapons such as cannons, gunships, tanks or gyrocopters. Gnome mages have also worked with humans for a very long time with many gnomish mages having come to live in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, they always had a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Several gnomes having been members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Indus\"&gt;Indus&lt;/a&gt; who was one of the founding members of the council.\nGnomes in &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; territories are tolerated, despite the high number of gnomes who work with arcane forces and their use of and love for technology which clashes with the Night Elves' distrust of arcane and technology. The gnomes believe that with their use of arcane magics and &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; they offer something that night elves lack in defense. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;cataclysmic&lt;/a&gt; arrival of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, gnome engineers and sappers from &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; came in in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to help create cannons and bombs for the night elves in their fight against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile they tend to find &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; strange, gnomes usually get along well with them. Gnomes have also expressed great interest in and fascination with the technology of the draenei.\nLike their human and dwarven allies, gnomes have been victims of the Old Horde's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and as such still strongly distrust the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies to this day, though they are generally more forgiving than their allies.\nEver since the Second War gnomes have had a rivalry with &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who supplied the Horde with their technology and weapons similarly to the gnomes with the Alliance, a rivalry that has been only refueled by the joining of the Horde by the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and the renewed conflicts between the Alliance and the Horde. The two races are in competition with each other over which race is the smartest and most advanced technologically, with gnomes generally seeing goblin technology as crude and inferior, though the degree of seriousness of this competition varies according to the individual, with some gnomes being hostile to goblins while others are friendlier to them.\nLanguages.\nGnomes speak &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Gnomish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechagon mechagnome.\nThe gnomes of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt; are now calling themselves mechagnomes, like their &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, because of their mechanical augmentations.\nMechagon mechagnomes are descended from the regular gnomes of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. They span a variety of different types. The higher-caste gnomes lived in an advanced, aristocratic society inside a huge vault, where they had dedicated themselves to their ruler &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; and his vision to turn anyone of flesh into more pure robotic parts. In this society, the more robot parts one had, the higher one's social standing was.\nHowever, another group of mechagnomes rejected this and dwelled in the outside &lt;a href=\"Junker%20Wastes\"&gt;Junker Wastes&lt;/a&gt; where they were beset by death robots. These mechagnomes had fewer mechanical parts and tended to be partially deteriorating. As the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Mechagon, they befriended the latter group in an effort to break into the mechagnomes' city and stop King Mechagon. These mechagnomes seemed to have a &lt;a href=\"mechanocat\"&gt;mechanocat&lt;/a&gt; racing and customizing subculture inspired by the American , complete with sweet pompadours.\nAppearance.\nOn average, female gnomes are 3'4\" tall while males aren't much larger, typically standing at close to 3'6\" in height. Some gnomes do not grow to more than a \"shortish\" height of 2'6\". They have four fingers (three fingers, one thumb) on each hand, and five-toed feet. Although it can and has been a bit nebulous in Warcraft art throughout the years, in \"World of Warcraft\", the gnome model is noted to have large, rounded ears in proportion to their head.\nWhile it's unknown exactly how long gnomes can live, the 22-year old &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt; was considered to be a teenager by her people's reckoning of age. While preparing to enter the &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Vault\"&gt;Rusted Vault&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Junkheap\"&gt;Abandoned Junkheap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; imagined that he might end up rescuing King Mechagon himself, indicating that he expected there was a good chance that the last king of the gnomes was still alive 400 years later.\nGnomes have a high metabolism.\nDespite the gnomes' size, they exude great resilience and survivability both in and out of combat.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; incident, some gnomes (such &lt;a href=\"Gnoarn\"&gt;Gnoarn&lt;/a&gt;) had earned a reputation for themselves by wearing an eccentric hairstyle known as a \"gnomefro\".\nThanks to their extremely small size, in \"World of Warcraft\" gnomes can be a hard target to click, making it harder for enemies to target you using their mouse. This is especially helpful in the event the gnome is a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. Gnomes who specialize in melee weapons are also particularly hard to target due to their acrobatic fighting styles combined with their small size. Their small size can also be advantageous to people who like to explore; gnomes are the shortest race and can go to certain places where character height keeps other races from going.\nIn the RPG.\nGnomes are a diminutive, wiry race of &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s who live underground. In the Second War, they built gadgets and vehicles, such as &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s, for the Alliance to combat the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They are great mechanics and inventors, renowned for their knowledge and eccentric natures. The gnomes had a city, Gnomeregan, built into Ironforge Mountain, but invading &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s destroyed it and slaughtered its citizens. Many survivors now live with the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; dwarves, a few traveling with their dwarven friends to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The gnomes are still reeling from the destruction of their home city and are loath to leave the safety of the dwarven tunnels.\nHistory.\nUpon the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and were invited to &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost gnomes on Kalimdor remain secluded in &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Even after the decimation of their race and the destruction of their city, gnomes are an amiable and kindhearted lot. They make and keep friends easily; other races often find disliking a gnome to be difficult. Gnomes are long-lived and take a fatherly approach to other races, particularly humans. Gnome society is loosely organized, with most living in Khaz Modan and mixing freely with the dwarves, sending representatives to speak to the dwarven king on their behalf. Those few gnomes who traveled to Kalimdor live in a similar fashion in &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Gnomes are gifted tinkers, and have a penchant for creating radical technology and innovative designs. They often work together with Ironforge dwarves, developing the blueprints and concepts from which the dwarf smiths draw their inspiration.\nNo one knows much about the gnomes' history before &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; discovered them; not even the gnomes know much of their own history prior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first widely recorded interaction between gnomes and dwarves occurred a little over 200 years prior to . As the story goes, a dwarven explorer came across a small gnomish village. He was shocked to discover that while dwarves had just discovered gunpowder, the gnomes already had a fully automated village with such novelties as mechanical chickens. Contact between the two races grew, and soon, they became quick allies, and the dwarves allowed the gnomes to build their capital city, &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, in the foothills of Dun Morogh, near the Dwarven capital, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nGnomes are small, slight and nifty. They somewhat resemble dwarves, but are even shorter, not as stocky, and have large heads in proportion to their bodies. They have large noses and ruddy skin, their ears are large and rounded, and their hair color varies wildly, some even having pink or green hair. They are often seen with goggles, tool belts, and other items related to their technological inclinations.\nRelations.\nGnomes are great friends of the Ironforge dwarves. They have been allies for generations and often exchange ideas and inventions. Their bond is so great that they live in many dwarven settlements including &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; itself. Gnomes have fought and died alongside human soldiers and have been readily welcomed in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with open arms. They are wary of the high elves, but so is everyone else, so they don\u2019t feel too bad about that. They battled the Horde in the Second War and have a bit of a grudge against orcs, but gnomes are a kindly and forgiving lot and are willing to give the orcs a second chance. Gnomes and goblins have always been rivals \u2014 though whether this rivalry is friendly or brutal depends on the individuals involved. Gnomes have not been on Kalimdor long enough to form proper opinions about its denizens. Tauren and night elves both seem rather rustic for gnome sensibilities \u2014 but they can make friends with anyone.\nGnomes know the languages of their friends and their goblin rivals.\nFaith.\nGnomes place their loyalty in themselves, in their friends, and in their inventions. A few follow a loftier path and pay their respects to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Ironforge dwarves' recent discovery of their titanic origins, the gnomes think that they too may be products of the Titans. Some female gnomes have been known as members of the &lt;a href=\"sister%20of%20steel\"&gt;Sisters of Steel&lt;/a&gt; that have shown abilities to turn their flesh to stone or steel.\nTechnology.\nGnomes tend to design fairly complicated devices that are relatively safe. Gnomes are in many ways commensurate organizers: a gnome can spend as much time (or more) organizing and planning a project as they do actually working on it. If the design fails, they try to learn why, and fix it if they can. If they meet with success, they will continue to tinker with it and improve the design, often for years afterward. Thus, many gnomish designs feature a high degree of complexity and a low chance of failure, the exceptions being those that dabble with chaos energy \u2014 but even then, they take steps to ensure the worst that could happen is a brief, non-fatal failure.\nGnomes overplan new projects, producing blueprints and schematics that can take longer to make than the device itself. While this cautious attitude results in higher quality products and a greater success rate, it often takes so long that cost overruns creep in. While a goblin would scream and flee at the mere thought of a cost overrun, a gnome simply shrugs and presses on. If a project fails to work correctly the first time, a gnome will continue to tinker with it, while a goblin would usually give up and move to something else. Thus, gnomish items have very low failure rates compared to goblin items.\nGnomes are innovative thinkers and are responsible for a vast variety of inventions, including more than a few that are commonly attributed to dwarves. Although a diminutive people, gnomes think big, often producing designs far too complex to ever be realized. To gnomes, technology is a way of life. Even gnomes who take on other trades often tinker in their spare time. Because of their innate curiosity, they produce a wide variety of devices that are interesting or amusing but otherwise useless or impractical. While others might shake their heads at such folly, the gnomes value all invention, no matter how unimportant it might seem. Among the well-known gnomish devices are the world enlarger, net-o-matic projector, and harm prevention belt.\nMany gnome machines last for a long time, making a significant capital for generations. Even after new, better machines are built for replacement, the older versions are usually good enough to be stored in the mountain caves, reactivating them when necessary. While goblin can build a more complex and powerful machine for the same price, a really complex machine may break for him before it could be finished. Hence the most advanced systems like &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; are still of gnomish origin. Gnome schematics are such that machines and devices can be build as initially thought hundreds of years ago. However, this does not mean they are easy to read or easy to use. Goblin engineers keep saying they suffer strong headaches while reading the stolen gnomish schematics and tend to break out of the middle of specification by finishing the device how they themselves see fit."}

During Warcraft II, the gnomes were, in effect, building weapons and lending designs to the Alliance \u2014 but they were staying out of any direct fighting. In Warcraft III and Frozen Throne, and even in World of Warcraft, it becomes clear that the gnomes have had internal problems of their own for several years. As of World of Warcraft, they still offer support to the Alliance in terms of building tanks, designing weapons, sending flying machines, and so on. But they had a problem at home that has recently been discovered \u2014 an ancient menace from the depths of the underground, called Troggs. The Troggs invaded the gnomes' city of Gnomeregan and wiped it out. The gnomes decided not to let the rest of the Alliance know about this because they figured that they could deal with it on their own. But Gnomeregan fell, probably thanks as much to the gnomes' own actions as to those of their enemies \u2014 they likely blew themselves up with whatever failsafe devices they used to defeat the threat. After the destruction of their homeland, the gnomes fled to the safety offered by their nearby allies the dwarves.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "268385", "revid": "41574628", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=268385", "title": "Gnome Punting", "text": "Gnome Punting is a sport enjoyed by all walks of life in Azeroth. It is a test of skill, strategy, testosterone, manliness, cunning, guile and strength. Members of the Horde as well as the Alliance compete in this daring sport, often times against each other.\nBasic Game Play.\nThe goal of the game is to punt a gnome as far as possible, usually at a predetermined target. This target is usually a solid rock face, making &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; popular locations for matches due to the presence of high rock faces and vast, relatively flat fields, with &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; as popular practice and training grounds.\nAt the start of the game, both teams punt a gnome to see who can punt farther. Whichever team wins the \"punt-off\", chooses either to defend or punt first.\nEach team fields 25 players (5 groups) and each team has a designated Punter. No one but the Punter may handle the gnome. A team may change its Punter after every other round to shake things up.\nAt the start of each round, both teams start huddled at their respective starting zones. The punting team with the Gnome in the middle of them, sometimes everyone holding the hapless gnome to throw off the other team as to who the Punter is for that round. At the start of the match, both teams break and start moving.\nPunting Team.\nThe Punting team starts at the predetermined distance from the target rock face, usually around 100-200 yards. The punter is then given the Gnome and the entire team charges towards the target, and the other team. The goal of the punting team is to try to punt the gnome at the rock face, without the Punter getting KOed by the defending team. Should the defenders successfully take out the entire punter without punting the gnome, the punting team receives zero points that round. The other 24 members are their to defend the punter and take out the enemy team.\nShould the punting team punt the gnome, points are awarded (see scoring below).\nDefending Team.\nThe defending team sets up at a predetermined distance from the target rock face, usually somewhere halfway between the punting team and the rock face. The goal of the defending team is to take out the punter before he/she has a chance to punt the gnome.\nReversals.\nShould the Gnome be coming down after a punt, the Defending Team's punter can \"reverse it\" by catching the gnome before it hits the ground and immediately punting it back the other way. Should the gnome land and not be reversed by the Punting Team's punter, then the defending team is awarded 1 point per yard from where the gnome landed to where the punter was standing at the time of punt. A Punting Team's punter can reverse it in a similar fashion.\nNo special abilities (such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt;) can be used on the gnome if it is considered \"live\". Only on Undead Gnomes.\nVolleys.\nA volley occurs when the gnome is being continually reversed by the two punters. Managing a volley requires skills. Should the defending punter find himself being slowly backed up towards the rock face, he/she may want to consider shortening the punt to get way he can and avoid the running the risk of the other team hitting the rock face. A similar scenario exists for the Punting Team should the punter find him/herself getting farther from the rock face.\nScoring.\nFor each yard that the gnome travels in the air, the team is awarded one point. For every yard the punter runs towards the rock face whilst holding the gnome, half a point is subtracted, unless the the gnome hits the target rock face, in that case, the team is awarded full points for the round, which is equal to however many yards are between the punting team and the rock face. Should the gnome hit the ground and bounce forward a few yards, those yards are added to the total as well, if the gnome bounces backwards a few yards, then forward progress is given.\nExample.\nIf the punting team is 200 yards away from the rock face, runs 50 yards before punting, and punts the gnome 80 yards, the team is awarded 80-25 points or 55 points.\nStrategies.\nWinning a game of Gnome Punting is more then brute strength. Cunning and guile factor into it as well. Below are some of the more common strategies used by teams to make sure the gnome hits the rock face for maximum points:\nBubble-feint.\nA tactic favored by Paladins. Before the match, a Paladin punter will set his or her hearthstone to somewhere outside the general area of the match (and if possible, behind enemy lines). When the two lines engage, the punter will &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Hearth\"&gt;Bubble Hearth&lt;/a&gt; away and proceed to return to the match through conventional means. This throws the defense off as they have to co-ordinate as to where the Paladin will be returning, often splitting their forces, allowing the other side to take them down.\nOne of the most famous instances of Bubble-Feinting was done by Rupert \"Goldshire\" McGardenhose of the Sentinel Hill Footpads in a match against the Crossroad Manglers (a Horde Team). After a wild night in Goldshire, McGardenhose accidentally set his hearthstone there instead of &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, which would have made a flawless tactic as the match was being held at Shimmering Flats, with the punting team punting to the south. McGardenhose's team could have easily kept the other team distracted long enough for him to slip back into the area and punt the gnome. Alas, because he found himself in Goldshire, he had to scurry back to the game, by which time, the Footpads were already down and out and the surviving Manglers were more then ready and in position to take on one Paladin.\nThere are those who argue that instead of taking the traditional path of Goldshire to Stormwind to Irongforge to Menethil Harbor to Theremore to Gadgetzan to Shimmering Flats, he should have instead gone to Ratchet, and run through the Barrens, arriving in Thousand Needles from the North. This would have allowed him to sneak back into the field and at least gotten SOME points by punting from his team's starting position. The opposite side to this argument claims it would be moot point since a Paladin carrying a gnome running through the Barrens would have garnered the attention of Barrens Chat, and the Manglers could have prepared that way.\nDespite this, the Bubble-Feint remains a popular and effective tactic, provided the Paladin in question does not have too good a time in Goldshire the night before.\nSummoning.\nSummoning is a useful tactic, but has risks. The basic strategy calls for a warlock and two other to create a summoning portal somewhere outside of the field of vision of the defending team, but close to the target. The summoners then summon the Punter who slips back in and punts the gnome into the wall. The risks involved are that if the defending team notices that lack of players, they will immediately alter their tactics to compensate, often by feigning ignorance, but it might become obvious to the defenders when a handful of people start backing off from the melee.\nBlinking.\nA hazardous ploy of using a Mage as the Punter to Blink past the enemy lines.\nRecent Changes.\nIn recent times, with the advent of countless strategies, such as Bubble-feigning or summoning, and Punters escaping en mass, teams have had a high rate of success in hitting the target rock face. As a result, matches would go on for days with neither side getting ahead of the other. To shake things up, bulls-eyes have been erected at popular playing fields to offer a greater challenge. Punters still get the full points for making the gnome impact the wall, but by adding the bulls-eye, the punter now has something to aim for, and a well-executed play which gives the punter ample time to line up the punt, now speaks more then a hasty punt as the defenders barrel towards the hapless punter having just arrived after a Bubble-feint which saw his team get annihilated before he could get back. Hitting the target closer to bulls-eye is like archery: more points for getting closer to the middle.\nGoblins.\nWhen it became known that Goblins would eventually be joining the ranks of the Horde, several potential Alliance teams that were hesitant to harm their Allies petitioned the AGPC (Azerothian Gnome Punting Committee) to allow for the use of Goblins as well as Gnomes. At the behest of several well-entrenched Horde Teams, the committee passed the resolution allowing Goblins to be used as well. And it was changed that a team can use either a Gnome or a Goblin as their projectile. As a result, almost a dozen new Alliance teams organized overnight and began practice. Some of the Horde teams have even begun practicing with Goblins to see if the scrawny creatures are more aerodynamic and thus fly farther than the chubby gnomes.\nRumours exist that Deathwing prefers Punting Goblins to Gnomes, and the real reason why the AGPC agreed to include Goblins was because Deathwing threatened to incinerate them otherwise. Due to Deathwing's preferance of punting Goblins, Goblins shall be coming out in Cataclysm along with Deathwing.\nCriticism to the Sport.\nSeveral people have protested the game due to the Astronomically high fatality rate of Gnomes, and proposed creating hoops to punt the gnomes through instead of solid rock faces. This was immediately shot down and the protesters were used as projectiles for next championship game, even though some of them were not gnomes (some Blood Elves, Night Elves and Humans were among the protesters). It was decided there that anything except gnomes (and now goblins) make terrible projectiles."}

In a desperate attempt to kill the troggs, their ruler, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, on the advice of his advisor &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, ordered the gnomes to open the pressure valves of their giant, grinding machines and released toxic radiation throughout the city. Though the radiation killed some of the troggs, it empowered others. Meanwhile, the radiation killed the gnome people just as quickly. Nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race died within days, while others were transformed into horrific, mindless, evil-doing &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, who still live there. A few loyal gnomes still left in the city fought desperately to keep the troggs at bay. Their ruler, thought by certain gnomes to have abandoned them, eventually sent a rescue force of adventurers on a recon mission.\nThe city is currently a &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28instance%29\"&gt;mid-level dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally, when the first &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s left &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; under the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, they dwelt in mountain caves in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing purely on survival and expanding their technological knowledge, the early gnomes eschewed any form of record keeping and thus forgot their heritage. When the transformed &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; from Uldaman, now being fleshy creatures called &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in Khaz Modan, they discovered the gnomes in their mountain caverns. Enthralled by their technological knowledge, and sensing a kinship between the two species, the dwarves aided the gnomes in laying the foundations for what would later become Gnomeregan. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; tried to siege the city. They were defeated by the ingenuity of the &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s, whose booby traps and rigged explosives claimed many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish lives while the city itself was shielded by an impenetrable iron gate. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; called off the attacks after weeks of fruitless siege. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, who controlled Khaz Modan, would ensure that no gnome would leave the city.\nFollowing the conflict and until the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, from their wondrous techno-city, gnomes provided invaluable support in weaponry, vehicles, and energetic troops to the Alliance of dwarves, humans, and high elves. When &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fell, the gnomes mysteriously withdrew all their aid. It would be only after the Third War that the rest of the Alliance would learn the reason: Gnomeregan had come under attack by the brutish &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s that emerged from the earth after having been awakened by the dwarves digging around &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. The creatures were attracted the gnomish machinery and built tunnels to breach the lowest reaches of the city. In order to avoid drawing Alliance troops from the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the north, High Tinker Mekkatorque decided that the gnomes would defend Gnomeregan alone. For five years, the gnomes fought the troggs, but were overrun. The troggs simply dug around their defenses and breached into their engineering quarters. To defeat them, Mekkatorque agreed to the plan proposed by &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, which involved bathing the lower levels of the city in radiation. To his horror, the bomb affected not only the troggs, but also the gnomes, and made the troggs even more violent. The few survivors fled their city. Seeking refuge in Ironforge, the gnomes debated on their next course of action. Some advocated retaking Gnomeregan immediately, but Mekkatorque declined in favor of supporting the Alliance.\nIn Gnomeregan's heyday, &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;inventors&lt;/a&gt; would compete for status by pitting their creations against one another.\nOperation: Gnomeregan.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes, with help from the Alliance, launched an assault on Gnomeregan in an effort to liberate its lost capital, code name: . The operation was successful, as they were able to recapture Gnomeregan's surface and part of the city, an area they have named &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;. The gnomes seem to be gaining ground in the city as new gnomes assist in the defeat of the lepers on the surface of the city and the killing of one of Thermaplugg's most important lieutenants.\nCut Short.\nGelbin has determined that after the city has been retaken, it will be due for a major remodeling to make a more open, airy layout.\nCataclysm.\nThe city is turned into a war zone between the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan Exiles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnomes&lt;/a&gt;. Gnomeregan is now the &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and its quests will be centered around reclaiming the city and trying to force all of Thermaplugg's forces out. The &lt;a href=\"G-Team\"&gt;G-Team&lt;/a&gt;, a gnomish organization, with the help of adventurers, finally succeeds in eliminating Sicco. New gnome players start out as irradiated, and through a series of quests they cleanse themselves before permanent damage can be done.\nThe dungeon itself is largely the same, but most of the original quests have been removed. Instead, players assist the &lt;a href=\"S.A.F.E.\"&gt;S.A.F.E.&lt;/a&gt; organization in a new quest line that is obtained from within the instance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; detected some strange spikes of electric usage in Gnomeregan. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to investigate the situation and worked with chief &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Micro%20Zoox\"&gt;Micro Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, who is in charge of keeping the &lt;a href=\"robot\"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt;s in Gnomeregan under control. While in the &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Bay\"&gt;Launch Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which was overtaken by erratic &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, they found that all of the defensive mechanisms were activated, with &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Bot%20%28Gnomeregan%29\"&gt;Bomb Bots&lt;/a&gt; and critters filling the corridor to the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Court\"&gt;Tinkers' Court&lt;/a&gt;. The Court itself was guarded by the Gnomeregan Defense Force, consisting of mechanical inventions. A suspicious night elf teleported in, stunned the hero, stole something from the &lt;a href=\"Pulverizer%20Bot%20Mk%206001\"&gt;Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001&lt;/a&gt; and was teleported out of the city. After the adventurer defeated the Pulverizer, Micro scanned the area and stated that the defensive mechanisms were now disabled and normal.\nStarting area.\n&lt;a href=\"S.A.F.E.\"&gt;S.A.F.E.&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Nevin%20Twistwrench\"&gt;Nevin Twistwrench&lt;/a&gt;, are organizing an effort through the &lt;a href=\"Train%20Depot\"&gt;Train Depot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dormitory\"&gt;Old Dormitory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loading%20Room\"&gt;Loading Room&lt;/a&gt; to save survivors and keep irradiated gnomes in.\nIn the RPG.\nGnomeregan is built into &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. When the troggs invaded, they destroyed the city, forced the Ironforge gnomes to move to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Now in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Rockjaw\"&gt;Rockjaw&lt;/a&gt; troggs, the city is little more than a ruin. The troggs use the city as a base to stage attacks against Ironforge patrols, merchants and other travelers."}

Once a &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; based in their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes have since resorted to democratically electing their &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt;s. Under the leadership of current High Tinker &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes lost their capital city and sought refuge within the neighbor allied &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, where they have remained until the launch of . Still in the process of retaking their ancient home, they are now based in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; while still engaging in major Alliance operations across the globe and beyond.\nThe nation later reunited with their brethren, the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; aided in saving Mekkatorque's life. Electing to merge societies, rather than work as partners, Erazmin ceded leadership of the mechagnomes to Gelbin; dubbing him the true successor of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; as the first King of the gnomes since the now defeated tyrant. With this, the gnomes and mechagnomes both live within &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt; as a united people.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nOriginally, when some of &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;'s first &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s left &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; under the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, they dwelt in mountain caves in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing purely on survival and expanding their &lt;a href=\"Technology\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; knowledge, the early gnomes eschewed any form of record-keeping and thus forgot their heritage. When the transformed &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; from Uldaman, now being fleshy creatures called &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered the gnomes in their mountain caverns. Enthralled by their technological knowledge, and sensing a kinship between the two species, the dwarves aided the gnomes in carving into the stony foothills in western Dun Morogh thus laying the foundations for what would later become the marvelous subterranean techno-city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBased in Gnomeregan, the gnome kingdom was founded and evolved in seemingly eternal industrialization. The alliance between the gnomish and dwarven kingdoms proved highly beneficial for both parties, as they were sharing the resources of Dun Morogh and in unison improved their mechanical constructs. 400 years ago &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; of Gnomeregan led his followers in search of a &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;mystical land of technology&lt;/a&gt;. He left no clues where he was headed and over time his legend faded into history. The kingdom have not had kings or queens ever since, turning into a democracy run by an elected &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; would continue their successful invasion of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and push north into &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. After losing territory, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; called for the aid of Gnomeregan. The gnomes answered the call and the two races pooled their resources to establish defensive positions across Khaz Modan. Despite this, the defenders of Khaz Modan couldn't stop the orcish army. The Horde pushed longer into &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and besieged both Ironforge and the city of Gnomeregan, but were held off at both places by the ingenuity of the &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s, whose booby traps and rigged explosives claimed many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish lives while Gnomeregan itself was shielded by an impenetrable iron gate. Eventually, after weeks of fruitless siege, Horde &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; called off the attacks and ordered the main army to move on to do battle with the humans in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; to stay behind in Khaz Modan to ensure that no gnome would leave Gnomeregan and keep the dwarves occupied at Ironforge, hoping that Kilrogg would eventually conquer the two cities while the warchief handled the armies of Lordaeron.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Gnomeregan\"&gt;Defense of Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and Ironforge held off the orcs long enough for Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Bleeding Hollow clan from behind, liberating both the dwarves and gnomes who announced their full support for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s cause.\nThe gnome nation would be represented at Alliance meetings through the Ironforge dwarf delegate. Gnomeregan provided invaluable support in weaponry, vehicles like &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s, and energetic troops in the Alliance war effort. In many ways they mirrored the inventive &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the Horde, and these technological battles would spark a &lt;a href=\"Goblins%20versus%20Gnomes\"&gt;racial rivalry&lt;/a&gt; that has survived to this day.\nIn the aftermath of the war, the victorious allied nations helped each other rebuild, but King Magni was irritated with the long pace it took for Ironforge workers to reach Stormwind and requested a faster solution from Azeroth's most esteemed engineer at the time, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;. Mekkatorque, in his office at &lt;a href=\"Sector%2017\"&gt;Sector 17&lt;/a&gt; prepared the schematics for the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;, a subterranean train traveling from the &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Even after completion gnomes would work on it daily to keep it running.\nAt some point before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Gnomeregan electorate chose Gelbin Mekkatorque as their new High Tinker. Meanwhile, Mekkatorque's best friend, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, worked up the system and gained favor among the intellectual elite, eventually winning the seat of advisor to his friend, the High Tinker. A brooding but imaginative &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;, he served as &lt;a href=\"Mekkatorque\"&gt;Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;'s chief advisor for many years, continuing to covet the role of High Tinker with jealousy that would slowly eat away his sanity.\nThird War.\nPrior to the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque and Thermaplugg had designed a prototype of the dwarven &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;, should another war arise. The gnomes continued to provide technological aid to their allies abroad in the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against enemies in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, on the onset of the Third War, when the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven digging operations around &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; awoke the brutish &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, which were attracted to the gnomish machinery and built tunnels to emerge from the deep underground, breaching the lowest reaches of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Unprepared for the trogg invasion, Mekkatorque withdrew his troops fighting for the Alliance cause to instead help rescue their homeland, temporarily seceding his nation from the Alliance. In order to avoid drawing troops from the important battle with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the north, he decided to keep the Gnomeregan crisis a secret to the other allied nations, defending his city alone.\nFor five years, the gnomes fought the troggs but were overrun. The troggs simply dug around their defenses and breached into their engineering quarters. Mekkatorque's friend and advisor &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;'s secret obsession with becoming High Tinker had gotten to the point of no return. Thermaplugg devised a plan to eradicate the entire city, planning to kill thirty percent of the population with a gas and framing it on Mekkatorque. Knowing very well the heavy cost of lives it would have, but lied to the High Tinker that he had tested the radiation levels of the gas claiming to have evidence of its terminal effects on the troggs, and had shown Gelbin falsified numbers on its density and volumetric weight. According to Thermaplugg's calculations, the gas should have stayed in the quarantined thoroughfares and lower sections of Gnomeregan, poisoning the invaders as they emerged from the depths while the gnomes waited safely sealed away in the upper urban tunnels, kept away from the population by Thermaplugg's Kleen Wind Domiclic Filters.\nThe urgency to deal with the invasion, and the confidence his trusted friend showed made Mekkatorque agree to the desperate attempt proposed by his advisor, and ordered the gnomes to open the pressure valves of their giant, grinding machines and released toxic radiation throughout the lower levels of the city, believing it was the best course of action.\nGelbin Mekkatorque could only watch as the plan failed catastrophically, and Thermaplugg too was surprised that his gas was way deadlier than he had anticipated. Rather than securing the death of the troggs, most shambled through the gas, becoming enraged and some were even empowered by it. The filters failed, going straight through them into the homes of Gnomes, killing them as they waited in their homes thinking they were safe. Nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race died within days.\nMekkatorque's attempt at rescuing the city proved futile, leading to the tragic downfall of Gnomeregan and its people. Unable to take any more deaths or hold back the Troggs, Mekkatorque swallowed his pride and led the surviving gnome population to seek refuge in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with their old dwarven allies. King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; granted them asylum and cleared out the entire Tinker Town district of his city for them to reside in, which Mekkatorque was already familiar with because of his previous work with the Deeprun Tram. The rest of the Alliance learned the reason for the gnomes' absence in the Third War and welcomed them back into the Alliance with condolences.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the ruling council of the gnomes reunited in Ironforge inside the &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt;-district, the gnomes debated on their next course of action. Some advocated retaking Gnomeregan immediately, but Mekkatorque declined in favor of supporting the Alliance, and sent gnomes to Alliance battlegrounds all across Azeroth.\nA few loyal gnomes still left in Gnomeregan fought desperately to keep the troggs at bay. Their ruler, thought by certain gnomes to have abandoned them, eventually sent a rescue force of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on a recon mission.\nThermaplugg's treachery was only discovered after the evacuation when Thermaplugg apparently remained behind, and the details of his underhanded plans slowly became public. Thermaplugg locked himself away in the deepest reaches, taking in the irradiation along with much of the gnomish population. While Mekkatorque originally assumed his former friend had perished, voyages and observations of the city proved otherwise, as well as revealing the disturbing fate of some of the gnomes who were left behind. Those who survived mutated into horrific, mindless, evil-doing &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, including Sicco Thermaplugg himself. The disease warping their minds, which led to a now mutated and insane Thermaplugg taking over the leper gnomes, ruling them with an iron fist of madness.\nThermaplugg was branded a traitor and &lt;a href=\"The%20Grand%20Betrayal\"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt;. A band of heroes took up the mission to kill him and returned with a tale of victory, but after analyzing the claim, Mekkatorque realized that the mechanized overlord defeated in the depths of the city was likely nothing more than a cleverly engineered facsimile of Thermaplugg. It became clear that retaking Gnomeregan would take more than just a small team, rather a large force of Gnomish and Alliance might. Mekkatorque, who had been High Tinker for 7 years at this point, continued to devise a plan as the years passed, watching as his people's seclusion slowly dissipated as his people intermingled with other members of the Alliance.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nGnomes of Gnomeregan lead by &lt;a href=\"Toshley\"&gt;Toshley&lt;/a&gt; were sent to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in &lt;a href=\"Sylvanaar\"&gt;Sylvanaar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but their machinery quickly got unpopular with their &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; hosts, and so they left to establish &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt; close by. &lt;a href=\"Razak%20Ironsides\"&gt;Razak Ironsides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razak%27s%20Roughriders\"&gt;his Roughriders&lt;/a&gt; were set in charge of defending the station from herds of &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nGnomes of Gnomeregan lead by &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Fullthrottle\"&gt;Fizzcrank Fullthrottle&lt;/a&gt; set up &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, helping the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; establish a forward base. However, most gnomes in the airstrip would shift their attention to protecting themselves from the &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Gearmaster%20Mechazod\"&gt;Gearmaster Mechazod&lt;/a&gt; who intended to transform all of them into pure mechanical beings, removing their &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ambrose%20Boltspark\"&gt;Ambrose Boltspark&lt;/a&gt; lead a delegation of Gnomeregan representatives in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation: Gnomeregan.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque launched , an assault on Gnomeregan in an effort to liberate the gnomes' lost capital with help from the Alliance. The Gnomeregan exiles were priming their forces at &lt;a href=\"Steelgrill%27s%20Depot\"&gt;Steelgrill's Depot&lt;/a&gt;, the staging grounds for the Gnomeregan offensive and the production site of the gnome's &lt;a href=\"mechano-tank\"&gt;mechano-tank&lt;/a&gt;s. After the preparations were made, Gelbin led a full assault to wrest control of Gnomeregan's airfield, surface command post, and ultimately underwent a raid into the tunnels of lower &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Gnomeregan exiles' best efforts to reclaim their techno-city, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; detonated a radiation bomb in the city; forcing Mekkatorque's forces to hastily teleport to the surface to escape the re-irradiated city. It was a successful first maneuver, but there will be much more bloodshed before the entirety of the gnomeland is liberated. In the ongoing effort to reclaim Gnomeregan from Sicco Thermaplugg and his twisted cohorts, the gnomes have carved out a tenuous foothold in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, near the techno-city's gates.\nAfter having secured a large portion of the techno-city, Mekkatorque ventured into his own old office at &lt;a href=\"Sector%2017\"&gt;Sector 17&lt;/a&gt; only to be lured into a trap by his arch-nemesis. However, Mekkatorque outsmarted Thermaplugg cutting the latter in half. A barely surviving Thermaplugg escaped the sector and Mekkatorque walked back out with restored hope.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Gnomeregan had turned into a constant war zone between the Gnomeregan Exiles and the leper gnomes. Led by &lt;a href=\"Nevin%20Twistwrench\"&gt;Nevin Twistwrench&lt;/a&gt;, young &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurous&lt;/a&gt; gnomes would assist the &lt;a href=\"S.A.F.E.\"&gt;S.A.F.E.&lt;/a&gt;-organization in reclaiming parts of the city like the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dormitory\"&gt;Old Dormitory&lt;/a&gt;, and trying to force all of Thermaplugg's forces out, including killing of one of Thermaplugg's most important lieutenants - &lt;a href=\"Razlo%20Crushcog\"&gt;Razlo Crushcog&lt;/a&gt;. While thankful for the generosity of the dwarves for providing the gnomes shelter in time of need, the gnomes were now trying to once again seek independence from the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, but it would prove difficult without the dwarven &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, especially when trying to cure the radiation of &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and thus the nation of Gnomeregan adopted the faith in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Covert%20Ops\"&gt;Gnomeregan Covert Ops&lt;/a&gt; dealt with both the nearby &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; threat of Dun Morogh, and also sent &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, to negotiate trade agreements with &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; between Gadgetzan and Gnomeregan.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; invited Gelbin Mekkatorque to represent Gnomeregan at a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and deliver their vote whether or not the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; should be accepted into the Alliance. Gnomeregan voted to accept &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance.\nSome time ago at the end of the Third War, the gnome &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Brassbolts\"&gt;Fizzle Brassbolts&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; on his own personal initiative to meet with the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and settle the old &lt;a href=\"goblins%20versus%20gnomes\"&gt;goblins versus gnomes&lt;/a&gt; dispute - by setting up &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;a raceway&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; together with the rival goblin &lt;a href=\"Pozzik\"&gt;Pozzik&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Fizzle's team on the &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; would finally officially be considered representatives from the nation of Gnomeregan. They now participate in water races sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Engineers%27%20Guild%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;MEGA&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"A.C.E.\"&gt;A.C.E.&lt;/a&gt; were sent to join the Alliance war effort on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, rivaling the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"S.H.A.R.K.\"&gt;S.H.A.R.K.&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter the catastrophic &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Gelbin was once again at the High King's table helping with a strategy to counter the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; was a high-ranking Gnomeregan representative in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; who also took part in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, along with Mekkatorque himself who arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; to fight &lt;a href=\"War%20Master%20Kragg\"&gt;War Master Kragg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; guards. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Gelbin was invited to attend his trial at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDun Morogh was &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the Gnomeregan Covert Ops were among the defenders.\nWith the events about to unfold on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, High Tinker Mekkatorque commanded his people to get outfitted and ready for battle \u2014 any way they know how, leading to the creation of gnomish &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Mekkatorque and a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Tinkerer\"&gt;Gnomeregan Tinkerer&lt;/a&gt;s accompanied &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s vanguard on the assault on the Broken Shore. Mekkatorque fought at the Broken Shore in his own &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt; and used it to call in air support from the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" at the High King's command. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance forces were left vulnerable by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s unexpected retreat. The Alliance tried to retreat on the \"Skyfire\" but was impeded by a summoned &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;. Through his steam armor, Gelbin caught a falling Stormwind soldier by their cape. The Alliance forces watched helplessly as King Varian Wrynn sacrificed himself by distracting the Burning Legion forces so that the Alliance forces could fly to safety. In the aftermath of the battle, Mekkatorque attended the funeral of Varian Wrynn.\nGelbin is also around in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by newly coronated King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the adventurer for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGelbin Mekkatorque, accompanied by his advisor &lt;a href=\"Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;Tread Sparknozzle&lt;/a&gt;, was present in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. He wondered whether &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; could heal herself. He also received &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; samples to study and chose &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; to go to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Covert Ops team, including Steelspark, were sent to assist &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"G.E.A.R.\"&gt;G.E.A.R.&lt;/a&gt;, an elite unite of Gnomeregan aerial rangers, was formed during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;. \nMekkatorque and his forces joined the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who created a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; portal to transport both his gnomish troops and her own &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom his airship \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Strider\"&gt;The Strider&lt;/a&gt;\" Mekkatorque led an attack on the Horde's &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; mining operations in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, using an army of remote-controlled robots. &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"G.M.O.D\"&gt;G.M.O.D&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde's reprisal, and then confronted Mekkatorque and his own mech suit in the sky only for the G.M.O.D to run out of fuel, giving Mekkatorque the chance to knock Gallywix out of the sky. Once the G.M.O.D was operational again, Gallywix attacked \"The Strider\" above &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; to draw out Mekkatorque. As they fought \"The Strider\" began to fall apart and so Mekkatorque fled, leaving Gallywix to wonder how to break through his mech's Proto Layered Optimal Titan Armor.\nMekkatorque sailed with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, on a mission to secretly plant explosives on the ships of the enemy &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. The explosives were successfully put in place and once a majority of the Horde's forces were lured to &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; began their invasion. Just as Mekkatorque was about to remotely detonate the explosives with his remote detonator machine, Gelbin's floor collapsed from the impact of one of the Golden Fleet's &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt; missiles. Gelbin fell below the deck of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;Jaina's ship&lt;/a&gt; and pulled himself out of the rubble so he could rush to re-position his remote detonator. Once the remote detonator was upright again, Gelbin pushed the detonator button and blew up the entire Golden Fleet stationed there, allowing the Alliance navy to invade &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; with little resistance. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Siege of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque dueled Gallywix, once again defeating him. He was seriously injured during the battle but escaped using an escape pod. However the escape pod placed him in suspended animation, and neither &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; nor Stormwind's priests know how to help him recover from his injuries, while &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; referred to him as being dead.\nOrganization.\nPeople and culture.\nGenerally speaking, gnomes simply do not fight gnomes. In a world of hostile creatures and Tall Folk, it goes without saying that gnomes have to rely on each other. This is why gnomes don't need primogeniture and why they abandoned monarchy centuries ago, instead electing their leaders by common consent based on their work's benefit to the race as a whole. It is unthinkable for a gnome to act in a selfish manner in spite of the cost to their people, which made &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal all the more shocking.\nBefore the fall of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, to most of its citizens, Gelbin Mekkatorque resembled the ideal gnome: Ambitious, inventive and caring for his peers. The loss of Gnomeregan and years of hardship and survival amongst increased association with the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have made the gnomes stronger and more comfortable with their physical prowess, giving them a combatant edge. Gnome melee fighters have become more common, and are in general more willing to talk back to Tall Folk than ever before.\nGnomeregan's heyday is a friendly competition between &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s where they pit their creations against one another.\nThe close relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; has mixed their cultures and gnomes have recently started to venture into the field of brewing. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Cask%20of%20Gnomenbrau\"&gt;Gnomenbrau&lt;/a&gt;, \"a light beer with a big head\", and the upstart &lt;a href=\"Short%20and%20Stout%20Brewery\"&gt;Short and Stout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brewnall%20Village\"&gt;Brewnall Village&lt;/a&gt;. It is also only natural that &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; rides out to the festival grounds and taps the keg each day during &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gnomeregan%20Run\"&gt;Great Gnomeregan Run&lt;/a&gt; is a gnomish &lt;a href=\"micro-holiday\"&gt;micro-holiday&lt;/a&gt; event where gnomes run from &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical structure.\nGnomeregan used to be a kingdom, but since &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;'s departure about 400 years ago, the nation has evolved to a somewhat democratic republic, in which the Gnomeregan electorate elects a &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt; who will serve as the head of state and of government for a set term in office, being in charge of both the legislative, executive and judicial powers. The High Tinker has advisors, assistants, a security team, &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Court\"&gt;a court&lt;/a&gt;, a war council and the ruling council to help them run the nation. Notably, despite the previous information is &lt;a href=\"Lawyerbot%202000\"&gt;Lawyerbot 2000&lt;/a&gt;'s conclusion that High Tinker &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; possesses no legal authority whatsoever - over gnomes or otherwise; thus acting as a figurehead. Notably, the nation is sometimes still referred to as a kingdom and &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; styled himself as the King of Gnomes.\nAs the head of state, the High Tinker represents the gnomes at meetings and ceremonies with the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; and leaders of other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; nations with a vote worth as much as anyone else at the High King's table. Gnomeregan voted to accept &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance and have taken part of numerous strategical talks. Previously, the gnomes would be represented at &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; meetings only through the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; dwarf delegate, but an equal distribution of the political power between Alliance nations seemingly rose with High King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s return.\nThe war council consists of the High Tinker, &lt;a href=\"Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;their advisor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Clickspring\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Covert%20Ops\"&gt;Gnomeregan Covert Ops&lt;/a&gt; key member &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hinkles%20Fastblast\"&gt;Hinkles Fastblast&lt;/a&gt;. Following the reunion of the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagon mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; and the gnomish people, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; appears to serve as a key leader for the gnomes as well. In addition to this, the monarchy was restored, with Gelbin officially declared as the successor to the throne of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruling council, presumably consisting of most of the previously mentioned ranks close to the High Tinker along with &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt;, contains the power to banish citizens from the nation. After the fall of Gnomeregan, the ruling council debated whether to focus their resources on trying to retake their city or aid the Alliance with global issues. According to &lt;a href=\"Oglethorpe%20Obnoticus\"&gt;Oglethorpe Obnoticus&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling council of Gnomeregan used politics to ostracize him because they viewed him as an intellectual threat.\nThe Tinkmaster is the chief architect for modern gnomish engineering principles, a highly prestigeful rank within Gnomeregan society."}

This solo &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; involves returning to &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; to investigate a surge of electrical activity within the city's depths.\nLore.\nAfter the events of &lt;a href=\"Cut%20Short\"&gt;Cut Short&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes continued to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. For some time things were calm\u2014until &lt;a href=\"Tizzy%20Gearjolt\"&gt;Tizzy Gearjolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radek%20Fuselock\"&gt;Radek Fuselock&lt;/a&gt; began receiving reports of electrical usage spikes throughout the city. Both reached out to &lt;a href=\"Micro%20Zoox\"&gt;Micro Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, a chief &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; in charge of keeping things \"under control\" in Gnomeregan, and he offered his help in finding the source of the surges. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Gnomeregan to help Micro with the investigation.\nWhen the adventurer arrived, Micro seemed panicked over the situation. He explained that the city's defenses were on high alert, and that in the past few days, his Mayhem Detection Device had been giving mayhem readings beyond anything he'd ever seen. The two braced themselves and teleported into Gnomeregan.\nAs they arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Bay\"&gt;Launch Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Zoox noted that all of the defense mechanisms in the area had been activated. One by one, the adventurer defeated them all: a &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Annoy-O-Tron\"&gt;Prototype Annoy-O-Tron&lt;/a&gt; which blocked the adventurer's way off the platform; three &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s down below, born from the chemical remnants all over Gnomeregan; three robots probably intended to contain those chemicals; a hallway full of &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Bot%20%28Gnomeregan%29\"&gt;Bomb Bots&lt;/a&gt;, handily crushed by Micro's &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Crusher%205000\"&gt;Bomb Crusher 5000&lt;/a&gt;; a handful of irradiated critters, including a giant &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Leper%20Rat\"&gt;Bloated Leper Rat&lt;/a&gt;; and the city guard bots who protected the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Court\"&gt;Tinkers' Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally inside the Tinkers' Court, the adventurer found &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Mekgineer Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;'s latest creation left as the last bastion of defense for Gnomeregan, the &lt;a href=\"Pulverizer%20Bot%20Mk%206001\"&gt;Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001&lt;/a&gt;... and saw as a suspicious &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; teleported in. The adventurer attempted to confront the night elf, but he stunned them and laughed at their efforts, jeering that they would never figure out he and his allies' plans. The night elf then approached the Pulverizer Bot, swiped a schematic from it, deactivated all of its safety protocols, and left the adventurer to its mercy.\nWith no other option, the adventurer fought and defeated Thermaplugg's creation. An overjoyed Micro celebrated by taking a &lt;a href=\"S.E.L.F.I.E.%20Camera\"&gt;S.E.L.F.I.E.&lt;/a&gt; with the formerly-fearsome pile of scrap.\nGetting started.\nTalk to either &lt;a href=\"Tizzy%20Gearjolt\"&gt;Tizzy Gearjolt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hook%20Point\"&gt;Hook Point&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Radek%20Fuselock\"&gt;Radek Fuselock&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Beasts%20%28Dazar%27alor%29\"&gt;Hall of Beasts&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the first quest: &lt;a href=\"Trouble%20in%20Gnomeregan\"&gt;Trouble in Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nScenario.\nStage 1 - Automated Defenses.\nThe automated defenses of Gnomeregan have been activated!\nStage 2 - Out of Control Elementals.\nDefeat the Living Elementals.\nEach elemental will have two accompanying pets, randomly chosen from the following: &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Spider%20Tank\"&gt;Automated Spider Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Drilling%20Machine\"&gt;Automated Drilling Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Rocket%20Chicken\"&gt;Gnomish Rocket Chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Accelerated%20Defrosting%20Unit\"&gt;Accelerated Defrosting Unit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cockroach%20%28Gnomeregan%29\"&gt;Cockroach&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Leper%20Rat%20%28Gnomeregan%29\"&gt;Leper Rat&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 3 - Pull the Correct Levers.\nUse the correct sequence of levers to activate the Door Control Console.\nIn this encounter, the Door Control Console serves as a \"pet tamer\" that must be defeated.

It does not actually use a specific dictionary. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true Gnomish. \nNaming.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\".\nThe many gnome NPCs in \"World of Warcraft\" give a good illustration of the naming habits of gnomes, as well as the kinds of names usually used by them. A few examples are listed below. For a full list, see .\nCharacter creation screen.\nThe following names are offered as suggestions when creating characters on the character creation screen. Note that this list represents a sample of the many possible suggestions. \nIn the RPG.\nGnome parents name their children at birth. Gnomes have family names that represent an honored ancestor\u2019s achievements, but they only keep these names until some time in their thirties. At this point, gnome society expects them to have made their own achievements, and thus the gnome invents a new name that represents his own accomplishments. This name then takes the place of his family name.\nSpeculation.\n\"Gnome\" as a language term has an apparent connection to D&amp;D derived generic languages, which apparently can be found in D&amp;D rule books."}

The chicken's level is based on your engineering skill divided by 5 (starts as level 46 at 230, scaling up to level 75 at 375 engineering and to level 90 at 450 engineering.).\nAfter it is &lt;a href=\"equip\"&gt;equip&lt;/a&gt;ped, there is a 30-second delay before it can be used. When activated, it summons a Battle Chicken &lt;a href=\"Pet%23Guardian%20Pets\"&gt;guardian pet&lt;/a&gt; that fights for the summoner until either it is killed in battle or 1.5 minutes have passed. The trinket isn't consumed in either case, but there is a 20 minute &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; before the trinket may be used again.\nSource.\nThis item is created with &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnome Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (230); taught by trainers.\nIn the RPG.\nThe gnomish battle chicken is an oversized mechanical chicken. It may look silly, but it is one tough customer. Starting an inert battle chicken involves cranking cranks, pushing buttons, turning little knobs, and speaking into flared tubes. Once started the chicken obeys the voice commands of the individual who started it, attacking his enemies and doing anything else he asks. The chicken only understands simple commands.\nNotes.\nIts &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attack is fairly weak, but its saving grace is its Battle Squawk, a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; that increases the &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; of everyone in the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; by 5% for 4 minutes (which is longer than the Chicken will be around). Unfortunately, it's hard to predict when the Chicken will cast Battle Squawk, but it's worth a try.\n[note: It doesn't always buff]\nTactically, a Battle Chicken would be good to use in any fight where the Battle Squawk buff would be helpful and where the Chicken would have a good chance of surviving to Squawk. If you're a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; or are grouped with one or more, an attack speed buff is especially powerful; the same is true of &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. It's unlikely that a mob would &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; on the Chicken, as it doesn't do much damage itself, but against mobs with &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; attacks or mobs that randomly pick an enemy and charge at it, the Chicken will probably die before it Squawks. So use the Chicken if you're grouped with melee combat types, but don't bother if you're going up against mobs with AoE attacks or bosses that randomly charge (unless you're using the Chicken as a red cape to decrease the chances that the boss will charge a party member).\nIt sometimes casts a self-buff, Chicken Frenzy, which increases its attack speed and damage dealt by 100%."}

A gnome &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014subsequently referred to as \"Commander\"\u2014was chosen to lead the unit's test team, which was assembled in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;Captain Tread Sparknozzle&lt;/a&gt;.

No aerial unit would be complete without the latest in &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; technology, so Tread sent the Commander into &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve an &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Arcane%20Engine\"&gt;experimental engine&lt;/a&gt; needed to power the unit's &lt;a href=\"First%20Squadron%20Prototype\"&gt;prototype bomber planes&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Commander was delving through Gnomeregan, New Tinkertown received a distress signal from the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. Sparknozzle sent G.E.A.R. along with the bombers to investigate the situation. Upon arriving, the rangers found the airstrip under attack from an army of &lt;a href=\"Ironbound\"&gt;Ironbound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s that had emerged from the north. The Commander cleared out the troggs on the ground with the help of one of the bomber's prototype guns before taking out the trogg leader, &lt;a href=\"Krugg%20the%20Smart\"&gt;Krugg the Smart&lt;/a&gt;. A communication device carried by Krugg revealed that the troggs were under the command of the &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Telzo%20Sparkspanner\"&gt;Telzo Sparkspanner&lt;/a&gt;, a former assistant of &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; who planned to use his trogg army to decimate all of gnomanity.\nTinkerbow tracked Sparkspanner's signal to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, but the planes were forced to land on the &lt;a href=\"Foot%20Steppes\"&gt;Foot Steppes&lt;/a&gt; when the signal tracker started going haywire. The Commander took the opportunity to kill some more Ironbound while Tinkerbow recalibrated the device, after which the rangers relocated to a spot on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Terrace of the Makers&lt;/a&gt; closer to the signal's source and confirmed that Telzo was in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt;. They also found that the leper gnome had taken control of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;'s exterior defenses and rewired them to see G.E.A.R. as intruders. Winklespring and the Commander took to the skies in one of the bomber planes and used its newly-installed guns to decimate Sparkspanner's army of troggs and reprogrammed constructs. The rangers then headed into the Halls of Stone to confront Sparkspanner himself. At the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, the rangers battled Telzo and his mech\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Smasher%20X900\"&gt;Smasher X900&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and managed to kill him, thereby saving gnomanity and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from a threat they didn't even know existed. The Commander returned to New Tinkertown to report to Captain Sparknozzle, who congratulated the rangers on their successful mission, stated that the Alliance would surely call upon the unit in the future, and finally gave the Commander a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20Gnomeregan\"&gt;G.E.A.R. uniform&lt;/a&gt;."}
