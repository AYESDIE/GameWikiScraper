Through her, the race has deep ties to nature. They believe that she is responsible for weaving the strands of fate, and that just as they are all born of her, they will all return to her in death. The &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt; are an order of tauren &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who revere \"the wisdom of the Earthmother as illuminated by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMythology.\nCreation of the land.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Memory\"&gt;Age of Memory&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had night or day, the Earth Mother roamed the emptiness of the world. Alone, she braved the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt; and whispers that rose from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old Ones&lt;/a&gt; trapped in the depths, and they could not sway her. However, she was with child and knew she could not labor with nothing to safeguard her newborn from the darkness. She searched for a haven where she could safely give birth to \"the light of her heart\" but found none. She decided to craft one herself and began shaping the world, starting with forming the land and mountains. She created the first sparks of fire by grazing her nails against the mountain peaks, and her fingers cut grooves in the earth from which flowed the first waters and oceans. As she laughed at the antics of these three elements, her breath loosed the winds, which restlessly cut across the land and whipped up the newly laid dust. To show them how to be more gentle, the Earth Mother breathed upon the fog they'd created and sent it spiraling into the heavens, where it became clouds that gave off the first rains. The earth drank the rain and offered up the grass, swamps, and forests in return. Having learned their lesson, the winds danced softly through the newly-born plants. A simpler version of the tale states that the creator breathed upon the golden mists of dawn to create endless fields of wheat and barley that became the basin of her works.\nThe birth of Sun and Moon.\nAll of the wilds were the Earth Mother's creation and sanctuary. She grew to love the elements and told them that they would make fine companions for her children, and the elements loved her in turn, providing her with warmth, water, and music when she desired it. Everything was brimming with her essence enough to keep the darkness at bay, and she decided she could now give birth to her children. With the elements' help, she labored until she brought forth a radiant son she named &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and a gentle daughter she named &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, whom the elements called Sun and Moon. An'she and Mu'sha formed close bonds with the elements and steadily grew in power until they were able to influence the elements themselves. The Earth Mother was overjoyed by this and gently guided her twins through the ages, but she remained ever vigilant against the Old Ones and their shadows.\nThe Earth Mother eventually grew tired from her work and constant watch and knew that she needed to rest. In order to keep her children close and safe while she slumbered, she pressed them into her eyes\u2014first An'she, causing a peaceful night to fall on the land and calm her spirit, and then Mu'sha. After telling the elements to guard against the shadows, she fell asleep, resting first with one eye shut and then the other, since her children's light was now too powerful to fully contain. When her right eye was open, An'she gave warmth and light to the land. When her left eye was open, Mu'sha gave peace and sleep to the creatures of the dawning. The Earth Mother's restless watch, where she was never fully asleep, and her twins' consequent absence from the world caused the land to grow cold and created the first winter. When she awoke, she nearly wept at how the elements had changed. However, as her twins' light returned, the cold faded and everything went back to how it had previously been. The elements consoled the Earth Mother and showed her how her time of rest had allowed new plant and animal life to thrive, and so she named the seasons in her time of work (summer) and her time of rest (winter). She then showed An'she and Mu'sha how to guide the elements through these new seasons and eventually how to bring about the accompanying changes to the land at will from beneath her shut eyes in her times of rest.\nThe shu'halo and the sorrow.\nHer children's growth filled the Earth Mother with love and happiness, a feeling she wanted to share with the twins. The next time she slumbered, she stretched over the land so that the beating of her heart dug into the earth, saturating it with \"the song of life\". When she awoke, she was surrounded by new life. She sprinkled wheat over these first children of the plains and named them &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;shu'halo&lt;/a&gt; (tauren). An alternate version of the tale has it that the Earth Mother created the tauren by spreading her hands out across the plains of the dawn, with the shu'halo arising from the soil wherever the shadow of her arms passed. On their mother's request, An'she and Mu'sha taught the shu'halo everything they knew\u2014how to work with the elements, build homes, acquire food, sing, dance, ferry the rivers, and hunt wild beasts. The shu'halo gave thanks to the elements, to Sun and Moon, and especially to the Earth Mother. They prayed to their mother and swore to bless her name until the ultimate darkening of the world.\nHowever, as the elements turned their attention to aiding the tauren, the Old Ones in the depths watched and waited. The next time the Earth Mother slept, the Old Ones stretched their influence across the land and corrupted many of the still young and vulnerable tauren with their whispers, teaching them of war and hatred, and causing them unleash the elements against one another. The distraught An'she and Mu'sha woke their mother so she could see what had happened. Upon seeing how the world she'd shaped had fallen into chaos, she wept a single tear. She realized that since she was forever connected to the lands and unable to leave them, she might one day also succumb to the darkness and thereby endanger her children. She wiped away her lone tear and then wrenched An'she and Mu'sha free from her skull, her fingers digging so deeply that their light could never return to her again. Sun and Moon tried to console their mother, but she lay paralyzed by sorrow. The twins decided to set off to hunt down the source of the corruption.\nWord of the Earth Mother's sorrow and the twins' journey was carried on the winds. The siblings soon encountered a group of uncorrupted shu'halo, who presented a radiant blue infant that the twins realized had been born from their mother's tear. The group was suddenly attacked by the shadows, and though Sun and Moon held off the attack, An'she sustained a wound that Mu'sha was unable to heal. She sent a plea on the wind that reached the Earth Mother and stirred her from her grief. Though she could no longer see, she found her way to Sun and Moon with the elements' help. She hugged her children in relief and told Mu'sha that her presence was keeping the bleeding An'she alive. Upon being presented with the infant, the Earth Mother felt a slight joy once more and named the child &lt;a href=\"Lo%27sho\"&gt;Lo'sho&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Earth Mother's sacrifice.\nKnowing that the remaining shu'halo would draw the shadows to them, the Earth Mother decided to sacrifice herself to contain the darkness. The twins protested, but she quieted them and told them to take permanently to the skies, from where they'd be able to chase away any shadows she could not hold. She told them to always stay close to each other so Mu'sha could tend An'she's wounds, and gave Lo'sho to Mu'sha while telling the twins to teach the infant everything they knew. Although heartbroken, the twins obeyed her words and took their eternal post in the skies with Lo'sho, while the Earth Mother summoned the elements' aid for the last time and stretched herself across the world. She threw her arms wide to create paths the shu'halo could follow, bent her ear to the winds so she could hear the prayers of her children, and pressed her chest to the earth so that the beating of her heart dug deep once more. She rooted herself and held the shadows fast, giving all of herself for her creations, never to walk the land again, all to make the world safe for her creations. Seeing their mother's sacrifice, Mu'sha guided the tides and the winds so the shu'halo would always be able to hear and follow their mother's voice while An'she shone across the land so the way would be clear, all while Lo'sho listened to their lessons.\nThe tauren believe that the Earth Mother's essence still cradles the world under the now ever-present glow of the Sun and Moons, listening to all that happens, and that her love and wisdom will always be there to guide them. When the murderous &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; horde came from the &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;black lands of the west&lt;/a&gt; and the Earth Mother's blessed ones could not defeat them, the tauren were forced to leave their ancestral holdings behind and become nomads forever after. However, it was held that one day the scattered shu'halo tribes would find a &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;new home&lt;/a&gt; under the loving arms of the Earth Mother.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Earth Mother is the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; ideal of all the spirits of nature. She is the benevolent goddess of the tauren, who believe that the deity is responsible for all the natural beauty of the world. They see her smiling face in the sky, the stones, the sands, and the seas.\nShe lives in the rivers, trees, plains and mountains of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. She is the embodiment of nature. All lesser nature spirits come from the Earth Mother, and return to her upon death. The Earth Mother represents all the animistic forces of nature. River-spirits, sea-spirits, tree-spirits, rock-spirits, and animal spirits all reflect one facet of the Earth Mother.\nIn a sense, tauren see the Earth Mother as a sort of universal consciousness. While individual spirits represent a particular location, animal or object, such as the spirit of a single tree or the spirit of a valley, the Earth Mother represents the land. She is everywhere life and nature is. The only spirits separate from the Earth Mother are the spirits of sentient creatures. Tauren ancestor spirits live in harmony with the Earth Mother, but are not part of her.\nTauren religion teaches to respect and love the Earth Mother by treating her body, the land, and her children, the plants and animals of the world, with respect. Tauren disrupt the natural balance of the land as little as possible. They take only what they need from the land and eschew mass logging and mining. They respect the animals they hunt and never wastefully discard animal carcasses.\nThe shaman and priests of the Wildhammer dwarves entertain the people on cold nights with myths of nature and the Earth Mother.\nPriests of the Earth Mother can gain access to the Animal, Elements and Spirits domains.\nA theory contends that the Earth Mother is &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the Lifegiver, of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nName.\n&lt;a href=\"Gaea%20Seed\"&gt;Gaea seeds&lt;/a&gt; are a type of seeds which &lt;a href=\"Tammra%20Windfield\"&gt;Tammra Windfield&lt;/a&gt; imbued with the blessing of the Earth Mother in order to use them to regrow the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"Gaea\" is also found on items such as &lt;a href=\"Gaea%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;Gaea's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaea%27s%20Raiment\"&gt;Gaea's Raiment&lt;/a&gt;.

Their domain on the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; is known as &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and the leader of the earth elementals is &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Lord\"&gt;Stone Lord&lt;/a&gt;s rule Deepholm under Therazane. Each of their personalities seems to embody a different aspect of earth. Not all earth elementals are minions of the elemental lords and princes, some are minions of the elemental spirits of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nTo keep &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; safe from these threats, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s underground and banished the savage &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to the titan-constructed &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, a secure dominion where the elementals could dwell without harming Azeroth. Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a rough domain known as the &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, is home to the Earth elementals. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony.\nPrincess Theradras and the centaur.\nCenturies ago &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, the only daughter of &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20the%20Stonemother\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, first son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, began a relationship. The offspring of their time together became known to the people of Kalimdor as &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, who promptly slew their father for his part in their misbegotten creation. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, the grief-stricken Theradras sequestered her dead lover's body in her secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of &lt;a href=\"Terramok\"&gt;Terramok&lt;/a&gt;, where she watches over him to this day.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. After witnessing the devastation Deathwing and his followers caused her realm, Therazane treated all outsiders with open hostility. After the heroes convinced Therazane that they would indeed leave Deepholm once the World Pillar had been repaired, a battle took place between the Twilight Cultists and Therazane's earth elementals. Therazane picked out the most dangerous foes, smashing them into pieces before moving on to the next. Ultimately, with the help of the elementals of the earth, the World Pillar was repaired.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; and her forces were under attack by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, which rallied an army to conquer &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. In order to rally the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Deepholm and helped the earth elementals to defeat the forces led by &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for their help, the Stonemother pledged her support to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; against the invading &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, and later sent her servant &lt;a href=\"Avalanchion\"&gt;Avalanchion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to represent her.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Unleashed\"&gt;Tempest Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;, many earth elementals were summoned alongside the &lt;a href=\"Rumbling%20Earth%20Lord\"&gt;Rumbling Earth Lord&lt;/a&gt; to cause chaos across the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, hostile earth elementals were among the enemies encountered there. A number of them were also called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a shaman pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; are able to cast an &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Earth Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; that calls forth a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Greater Earth Elemental&lt;/a&gt; to protect the caster and his allies. \nIn the RPG.\nAn earth elemental is a hulking mass of rock which bears a humanoid torso, a flat head with glowing eyes, and two muscular stone arms encircled by giant copper bracers. Its torso trails away into a pile of formless rock that floats along the ground. Earth elementals, the strongest of all elementals, are beings of destruction. They use their tremendous strength to batter their enemies. They move through stone as easily as a human walks along the ground, and while they look like they might fly, they always remain in contact with the ground. Larger and larger earth elementals favor grappling attacks, as their size and strength give them a significant advantage over most enemies. When possible, earth elementals bull rush their opponents into walls or off cliffs. An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A \"move earth\" spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, usually stunning the creature. They speak &lt;a href=\"Terran\"&gt;Terran&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "15159", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15159", "title": "Earthen", "text": "The earthen (sometimes referred to as earthen dwarves or early dwarves) are stony &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; beings that were created by the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Titanic Keepers&lt;/a&gt; to help shape the subterranean regions of the world during the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Succumbing to the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;, most of the earthen became mortal creatures of flesh and blood known as &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. There remains a sizable population of earthen in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nFollowing the war with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;titan keepers&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; to create new &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; races to help them reshape and order the world. Yet their first designs proved too complex and overambitious. Rather than making the perfect servants, they had created stone-skinned savages known as &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt;. The keepers quickly refined and perfected their designs. The craggy, kindhearted earthen were the next generation of titan-forged to emerge from the Forge of Wills, created from &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al, living stone. The keepers were troubled by the troggs, but they could not bear to destroy them. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; built a small subterranean vault known as &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; that would act as a stasis chamber for them. Other new titan-forged races were the clockwork &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, the stone-skinned &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the iron-skinned &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the chiseled &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. The earthen would specialize in crafting mountains and carving out the deep places of the world.\nCreated by the titans themselves, &lt;a href=\"%3AVal%27anyr%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;:Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt; was given to the first earthen king, &lt;a href=\"Urel%20Stoneheart\"&gt;Urel Stoneheart&lt;/a&gt;. With the hammer, he was to create and give life to the rest of his brethren. Val'anyr was eventually shattered during the &lt;a href=\"first%20war%20between%20the%20earthen%20and%20the%20iron%20dwarves\"&gt;first war between the earthen and the iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nExiled from Ulduar.\nKeeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; had fallen under the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s sway, and taken control of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and Ulduar's servant &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. But he had banished a great number of his servants to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and sealed the fortress of Ulduar. For many ages after Loken's betrayal the titan-forged who were exiled from Ulduar spread across northern Kalimdor, with the earthen tunneled into the deep places of the world, where they fought for dominance against the misshapen and brutish troggs. And so after the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;'s departure, the earthen were largely unconcerned with the affairs of the surface-dwelling races and longed only to plumb the dark depths of the earth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt; the massive Winterskorn army marched first against the good-natured earthen, storming their underground lairs. The earthen foes were led by fire giants &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ignis\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt; and consisted of the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and newly molded powerful molten golems and iron constructs designed by the fire giants. The earthen were unprepared for such an organized force, entire caverns were massacred to the last living creature. A small group of survivors escaped and sought out &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; who had eluded Loken's wrath. Tyr and his allies immediately journeyed in aid to the earthen's cavernous home, and in time the earthen and their allies drove back the Winterskorn. The fire giants next enslaved entire flights of &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with enchanted snares with which the Winterskorn army shattered the earthen's defenses and scattered them across the icy mountain passes. The earthen were hunted by vrykul and golems on the ground and proto-dragons from the sky. Even Tyr was forced to flee, knowing that he and his allies could not defeat the Winterskorn alone he called on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; for help. The Aspects enraged by these events unleashed their power on the Winterskorn's iron ranks and brought a decisive end to the conflict.\nWith the Winterskorn defeated the titan titan-forged were still divided, Tyr and his allies Archaedas and Ironaya stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Loken and gathered great numbers of titan-forged who dwelled around Ulduar and whom they saw as innocent victims of Loken's treachery. Most of the surviving earthen, a large group of peaceful vrykul afflicted by the curse of flesh, and many of the mechagnomes agreed to flee with them southward in preparation for their next move. They traveled for weeks until they reached what would one day become known as the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that Tyr sacrificed himself fighting a &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; monstrosity in order to allow the rest of the titan-forged to flee further south. The vrykul were so moved by the keeper's deeds that they decided to settle at the battle site and stand vigil over his grave until the end of days, while the earthen with Archaedas, Ironaya, and mechagnomes continued south until they reached the easternmost titan-forged vault on Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. The keeper and the giantess expanded the site, carving out new chambers.\nCurse of Flesh and hibernation.\nAs years passed, some of the earthen in Uldaman exhibited signs of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing that the effects would only worsen, they asked to be placed in hibernation until a cure could one day be found. Archaedas agreed, promising to rouse them at some time in the future. He sealed his followers within the vast subterranean vaults. The mechagnomes, however, remained awake. Even though they knew the curse would one day overtake them as well, they heroically vowed to watch over the facility and maintain its wondrous machineries. A small number of the earthen had chosen not to be placed in stasis as well, deciding that they would watch over and maintain the facility alongside their mechagnomes companions.\nThe earthen largely kept to themselves. They were unconcerned with the activities of the world's other races as new civilizations arose across Azeroth. Some earthen remained isolated underneath the icy mountains of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Those who came south with Keeper Archaedas and the watcher Ironaya continued to dwell or slumber within the catacomb vaults of Uldaman. Some of the earthen came to conflict against the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but were defeated by the military power of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;House of Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves came to use the derogatory term of \"dwarf\" to refer to those earthen.\nWar of the Ancients and Sundering.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, many other clans of earthen led by &lt;a href=\"Dungard%20Ironcutter\"&gt;Dungard Ironcutter&lt;/a&gt; were convinced to join the resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, or alternately by the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; when he traveled in time, even while &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; looked down upon other races. It was a reluctant truce, as the earthen were called in by Krasus in defiance of the xenophobic commander &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;. The earthen were initially put to the outskirts of the host, but after Stareye's demise, their warriors were put to their best use under the new commander, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; tore through Azeroth, many of the active earthen reeled from the catastrophe. They felt the pain of the broken world as their own. They tunneled deep within Uldaman and locked themselves away within the hibernation chambers alongside their sleeping brethren.\nOnly the mechagnomes remained to watch over the facility. Yet they, too, eventually succumbed to the curse of flesh, causing them to turn into fleshy beings later known as &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s. Physically and mentally debilitated, they lost all sense of purpose and left the halls of Uldaman. Only a handful of mechagnomes stayed in the facility, still driven by their titan-forged imperative. They gradually succumbed to the degradations of time until only one was left. This lone clockwork servant did her best to maintain Uldaman, until the curse of flesh began to chip away at her metallic form as well. Aware that she did not have much time left, the gnome worked to free the still-slumbering earthen. With her dying breath, she activated the hibernation chambers.\nAwakening as dwarves.\nThe awakened earthen found that they had changed dramatically. Their rocky hides had softened and become smooth skin, they had become mortal creatures of flesh and blood. Calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the earthen left the halls of Uldaman and ventured out into the waking world. They found themselves drawn to the west, where a range of majestic stone mountains towered into the clouds. Settling in the snowy region of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, and still lulled by the safety and wonders of the deep places, they founded a vast kingdom under the highest mountain in the land and named their land \"&lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"Mountain of Khaz\", in honor of the titan &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. They delved into the heart of Khaz Modan's tallest mountain and crafted an immense forge, around which they built a proud city called &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nThe earthen's design maximizes strength and stamina without sacrificing cognitive processing power. The earthen's physical features are that of a smaller stature humanoid, though their composition is that of Azeroth's various stone core compounds. As such, they do not bleed. Their skin and musculature are nearly impervious to physical damage, and with very minor modifications the earthen display a remarkable resiliency to unwanted magical forces. Despite this, they are still capable of being mortally wounded. Their beards are actually an intricate series of mineral growths. Some of them like to smoke pipes.\nGroups of earthen.\nUldaman.\nThe Uldaman facility is one of the facilities that the earthen were sealed in. It came to contain destabilized earthen, and the original stony variant. The stone earthen remain there to this day. The facility also contains the &lt;a href=\"Stonevault\"&gt;Stonevault&lt;/a&gt; troggs.\nUlduar.\nUlduar is one of the ancient titan cities where the earthen first took shape and form. It is said that after the War of the Ancients earthen reeled with the pain of the earth itself and lost much of their identity and sealed themselves within the city's stone chambers. The earthen of Ulduar are currently led by &lt;a href=\"Bouldercrag%20the%20Rockshaper\"&gt;Bouldercrag the Rockshaper&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to be a subrace of earthen made of &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Earth\"&gt;Enchanted Earth&lt;/a&gt; (which may give them their unique look). These earthen are incapable of bleeding. They were forced out of their home by the &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they are at war. &lt;a href=\"Kurun\"&gt;Kurun&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt; leads the earthen in &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; in their war.\nIt is speculated that these earthen are the ones made by the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, and are immune to the Curse of Flesh.\nUldum.\nUldum is one of the ancient titan cities where the earthen first took shape and form. It is said that after the War of the Ancients earthen reeled with the pain of the earth itself and lost much of their identity and sealed themselves within the city's stone chambers. Earthen, like the &lt;a href=\"Sandstone%20Earthen\"&gt;Sandstone Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, exist in its &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; section, but no others can be found in the zone. See the Deepholm section below.\nStonetalon.\nBesides the ones near Uldum, only &lt;a href=\"Goggeroc\"&gt;Goggeroc&lt;/a&gt; has been seen in Kalimdor. The &lt;a href=\"Resonite%20Crystal\"&gt;Resonite Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Boulderslide%20Ravine\"&gt;Boulderslide Ravine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt; contain Earthen magic.\nDeepholm.\nEarthen, appearing similar to the Ulduar type, as opposed to the other earthen, can be found in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the elemental plane of earth. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Stonefather%20Oremantle\"&gt;Stonefather Oremantle&lt;/a&gt;, and are battling the &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe earthen and the stone troggs somehow found their way to Deepholm through Uldum more than fifteen thousand years ago. They've been warring ever since. They may have come through the portal to Uldum there.\nIn the RPG.\nThe titans created two caretaker races to watch over and help reshape the world. The dwarves are placed in charge of maintaining the earth, while the sea giants watch over the waters. The titans created the earthen to watch over the realms deep within the ground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s were the mistaken first attempt at crafting a mortal race of guardians from living stone for Azeroth. When the titans saw how brutal and misshapen the troggs were, they buried them in the northern vault of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; (and other locations). The titan scientists referred to the successful second race experiment as &lt;a href=\"Series%20Two\"&gt;Series Two&lt;/a&gt;. Series Two were the successful conclusion of the titan's experiments, called \"earthen\" in ancient times.\nLong thought to be merely myth, the troggs were the titans' first attempt at creating a race. The second attempt, entirely successful, produced the dwarves. Rather than destroy the troggs, the titans locked them deep beneath the earth where they slept for untold generations.\nBefore the War of the Ancients, the dwarves are just beginning to develop their traditions and make the earliest of the technological innovations that will revolutionize the world. Tinkers and even simple technology (phlogiston and gunpowder have yet to be discovered) are exceedingly rare in these days, found mostly among the dwarves.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves sealed the gates of their underground cities, leaving the Kaldorei to face the demons on their own. However, the night elves remember the dwarf race from their most ancient days, back before they were called \"dwarves.\" They know that although their two races never had much contact, the earthen fought against the demons in both the War of the Ancients. An underground war was fought by the earthen in the shadows to prevent the return of the demons to the world of the living. The Kaldorei were known to the earthen. In the early histories of dwarves, the Kaldorei are shadowy figures of dark perfection wielding incredible god-like powers.\nWhen the Well collapsed, it took the world with it. Even in their distant fortresses, far from the Well, the dwarves feared for their lives as the very rocks around them shifted and crawled as though they were living creatures.\nSomething happened to change the earthen, though, and they turned mortal, as they are now. Maybe it was the result of the War of the Ancients.\nThey emerged into the world and wandered about, searching for a home.\nThe race of dwarves awakened and emerged from the expansive titan-created city of Uldaman, located deep beneath the earth. They call their new civilization Khaz Modan.\nAt this point, the dwarves have \"awakened\" from ancient times, shaken deeply by the Sundering and forgetting much of what they were as a race. Emerging from beneath the earth, they begin to explore their surroundings. Yet they no longer have skin of stone, but are flesh like other races \u2014 losing all knowledge of their racial heritage, especially knowledge of the titans who created them and of their purpose (to shape the world).\nDwarven history tells little of this period. Except for occasional armed expeditions from one clanhold to another, they sealed themselves underground. They neither knew nor cared what went on outside their mountain homes.\nThey have stone hides (or \"rock skin\") and are more \"elemental\" in nature. They do not need to breathe and can tunnel around without shovels or picks. They are immortal.\n&lt;a href=\"Khaz%27Goroth\"&gt;Khaz'Goroth&lt;/a&gt; was the facility overseer of the facility near Bael Modan nearly 100,000 years ago. His scientists began the first series of experiments to create a race of stone, known as the \"earthen\". What was made here turned into troggs. When the titans saw how brutal and misshapen the troggs were, they buried them in the northern vault of the facility.\nMost pre-Sundering history was later forgotten as the earthen entered their slumber, and changed into the beings they are now. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; states in one of his books that when the humans first met the dwarves they just simply called them dwarves.\nBack when we created Ironforge we had no idea that anyone else existed in the world. We didn\u2019t even have a written language \u2014 everything was handed down by word of mouth. Naturally, facts became legends and legends became forgotten. The early dwarves were so busy mining and smithing their little hearts out that remembering the past just didn\u2019t seem all that important. They got very, very good at smelting ore and making things, but that was about it. However, from what we know of those early days, my people were happy.\nThen, one day, a couple thousand years ago or so, the first humans appeared at the gates of Ironforge. We know this because human written tales of the day tell of the race of short, stocky, bearded master smiths who shared a great love of crafting and storytelling. Dwarves, they called us, and thus we are known today, even though at the time we didn\u2019t know the word literally meant \u201cdiminutive.\u201d Ah well, it could be worse \u2014 they could\u2019ve called us \"beard-men\" or \"rockheads\" or something like that.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"frostborn\"&gt;frostborn&lt;/a&gt; use recolored earthen models. It is thus unsure if they are actually icy earthen, or dwarves who have adapted to their environment. They are however referred to as \"frost dwarves\" and, contrary to earthen, are capable of bleeding. Brann makes note that they originated from Earthen in his titan-forged chart, and the Frostborn also make note of their heritage."}

As the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the planet, the Ring traveled to places as distant as the waters of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; and the domain of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of healing the world and defending it from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;' followers. Those who assist the Earthen Ring find themselves rewarded with items that reflect the wisdom and primal power of the elements.\nHistory.\nContrary to what many have come to believe, the Earthen Ring was not established to counter the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;; that particular conflict arose later. The group was originally founded by &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; some time before the year -230 to lead their people with wisdom and maintain the harmony between the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. The spirits of the elements are by nature chaotic and prone to destructive outbursts, but equally are capable of forming symbiotic relationships with all other things. These intricate interrelationships constitute the very fabric of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and are what makes life on it possible. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who founded the Earthen Ring acted on a growing premonition that they had to begin to directly prevent the elements from entering states of great imbalance, or all life would soon face a mortal threat. After several meetings and pacts, these elder shaman founded what is now known as the Earthen Ring. While members of the organization have never been overly visible in the past, the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; caused by the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; severely weakened the barriers between the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20plane\"&gt;elemental plane&lt;/a&gt;s, and destructive elemental activity is rapidly increasing across the face of Azeroth. Today, the Earthen Ring has never been more vital to the world's survival, and its necessity stands as a testament to the foresight of its founders. Shaman connected to the Earthen Ring work tirelessly to keep the elementals pacified, attempting to ensure their feuds cannot destabilize the world beyond a critical threshold.\nThe Farseer.\nLong ago, the first Farseer of the Earthen Ring was given a vision of the elements. In the vision, she foresaw the arrival of a new Farseer, one who would lead them through a time of terrible crisis and unite the elements. &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; believes that the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is the Farseer of this prophecy, called to lead before they were ever born. &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; himself remembered the prophecy and, sensing the potential for great power within the Farseer, waited to see if it held true.\nShaman - past.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; (during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;) and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of the natural upheaval were felt as far as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor was also suffering from natural disasters ranging from earthquakes to the land shattering apart. &lt;a href=\"Oreg%20Earthfury\"&gt;Oreg Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the Earthen Ring who convened to discuss the effects of the natural upheaval and how to deal with the threat to their people. With the world being so chaotic, at times the elements had refused to answer the calls of the shaman, making the shamans\u2019 role in defending their people from the natural disasters difficult. While &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt; advocated that they take a more commanding role with the elements and force the elements to do as they demand, Oreg advocated for the Earthen Ring to follow their traditions of old and continue bargaining for and borrowing the powers of the elements. When the earthquakes hit a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; camp, Oreg and other shamans rescued some of the tauren. However, several such as Shotoa and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Kiche\"&gt;Kiche&lt;/a&gt;, were presumed dead when they fell into fissures.\nForsaken and the Horde.\nSometime after the tauren's induction into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Earthen Ring began inducting Horde shaman into their order. Due to the shared cultural reverance for the wisdom of shamanism between the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Trolls\"&gt;Darkspear Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, and tauren; the Earthen Ring became a highly regarded advisor in Horde politics.\nTo convince the Horde to accept the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; into its alliance, the undead ambassadors claimed that they merely sought a cure for their degenerative condition, which they said only the powers of shamanism and the life-giving energies of the earth could provide. In exchange for this healing aid, the Forsaken vowed to support the Horde in all of its ventures throughout Lordaeron and Azeroth.\nHaving done battle with the undead on many occasions, orc &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and tauren chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde were immediately suspicious of the Forsaken's motives. However, due to growing political tensions, the warriors acquiesced to a council of sages known as The Earthen Ring. The council argued that it was the Horde's duty to aid the Forsaken, who wrestled with inner demons just as the Orcs had for generations.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, the Earthen Ring awarded &lt;a href=\"Krog\"&gt;Krog&lt;/a&gt; with armor crafted by &lt;a href=\"Mosarn\"&gt;Mosarn&lt;/a&gt;. What for, is unknown.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAs the Horde reached &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to bolster their ranks within the Earthen Ring in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, the Spirit Mountain where &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s traveled for generations in search of shamanistic wisdom in connection with their ancestors and the Elements. As &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; are also now embracing shamanism, there are even &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and draenei shaman within the Earthen Ring. They originally started out as a group of Horde sages, but when some of them moved to Outland they incorporated Broken into their ranks. Their main goal is to heal Outland.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Earthen Ring collaborate with the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; of Outland to bring peace to the restless &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Lo%27ap\"&gt;Elementalist Lo'ap&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%20of%20the%20Water\"&gt;Watoosun of the Water&lt;/a&gt;, instructs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the destructive &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Spirit\"&gt;Lake Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s nearby and aids them with securing &lt;a href=\"Incineratus\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt;' blessing. With the fiery essence of Incineratus himself granted to the adventurers, Lo'ap tasked his agents to set fire to &lt;a href=\"Windyreed%20Village\"&gt;Windyreed Village&lt;/a&gt;, whose inhabitants had agitated the water spirits in their efforts to create a marshland in Nagrand. Meanwhile, Watoosun cleansed the water spirits of their corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. Lo'ap sent adventurers to purge &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%27s%20Polluted%20Essence\"&gt;Watoosun's Polluted Essence&lt;/a&gt; and its offspring, the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Surger\"&gt;Lake Surger&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordawg\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; also directs adventurers to kill tainted &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and destroying the one responsible for their corruption: &lt;a href=\"Gurok%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;Gurok the Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Morgh\"&gt;Elementalist Morgh&lt;/a&gt; also sent adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20Putrifier\"&gt;Murkblood Putrifier&lt;/a&gt;s, who have been using &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism to control air spirits.\nShaman - present.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Earthen Ring faced problems between their leadership.\nCataclysm.\nThe Earthen Ring journeyed to the place where &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; had burst into Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. His breakout had left a scar between the surface of Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. This instability cascaded over the world, stirring the elemental spirits into an even greater frenzy. Healing the rift that Deathwing made would prevent the destruction from unfolding across Azeroth. Deathwing's violent exit from Deepholm had also shattered the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, which bore the weight of all magnetic and elemental forces there, causing all of Deepholm to slowly collapse into Azeroth.\nSeveral members of the organization are also involved in the unfolding events in &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. Their task is to protect the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; and aid the servants of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; in their war against the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The organization's ranks were added to with the inclusion of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIts members are also present in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Old Gods' assault on &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, several members of the Earthen Ring that had interacted with players in previous zones may have died protecting &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as he transported the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to the Aspects in a scene that parallelled the Argent Crusade captains' encounter with &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Svalna\"&gt;Sister Svalna&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nAfter the death of Deathwing, Muln stepped down from his position as the leader of the Ring and Thrall became the main leader. Its members continued to heal the world from Maelstrom. Some time after the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; the task was finished.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Earthen Ring kindly requested that all plundered mail armor be divided equally among those who wear it. Otherwise, the elements might become displeased.\nLegion.\nDuring the battle at the Broken Shore, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring%20Shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the Earthen Ring accompanied Thrall and the Horde to battle. \nCampaign.\nAfter the battle at the Broken Shore, the four winds were sent by the Earthen Ring to seek the powerful shaman adventurer out. Once they were found in Dalaran, the Whispering Winds guided them to Thrall. Thrall explained that the defeat at the Broken Shore was decisive. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had now a foothold on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the best of their armies were retreating in tatters, and what was left of the Horde and the Alliance were at one another's throats. The elders of the Earthen Ring thus called an emergency council near the heart of the world, the Maelstrom. Thrall told the shaman that heroes like them were the world's last great hope, that their triumphs throughout Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; were the stuff of legend, and that they were needed now more than ever. He asked them to join him at the Maelstrom. The shaman accepted and met with Stormcaller Mylra, who took them on her gryphon.\nThe Heart of Azeroth.\nOn the way to the Maelstrom, Mylra explained that all around the world, their forces fell back, that it was a real massacre, and that unless they find a way to turn this around, Azeroth would fall. Approaching the Maelstrom, she pointed towards a rocky formation and said that what was left of the greatest shaman of Azeroth gathered below. They arrived in the middle of a conversation, where Thrall was claiming that shaman must strike back, but he didn't know how. Nobundo responded that they needed weapons capable of overcoming the Legion.\nThe shaman adventurer then spoke to Nobundo, who explained them that there was no more faction there, the few present were all that remained of the Earthen Ring. They had to struggle together or perish alone. Survivors continued to make their way here from the four corners of Azeroth. The shaman was thus tasked with seeing that their wounds were tended to. They needed hope if they were to rejoin the fight against the Legion.\nBut before that, Thrall was worried that the Legion would come for them. Nobundo pointed out that there were ancient safeguards there, and that they must use them, to which Rehgar replied that the Maelstrom Pillar had sat useless for ten thousand years. Erunak answered that it just needed \"a little boost\", turning to the shaman adventurer and asking them for a hand. The shaman channeled lightning into the Pillar, triggering it. Erunak commented that it was now working, and that the world would fight for itself if it was given the tools needed to do so.\nThe shaman then went to accomplish their duties. They revived Screech, Iain Firebeard's gryphon which was fading fast. Thanking him, Myra shared that the Highlands were completely overrun, and that the Wildhammers were scattered.\nThe shaman then approached a group of shaman, with Bath'rah the Windwatcher trying to light a campfire. Tribemother Torra asked him what kind of shaman could not light a fire, to which the troll replied that their hands were shaking and that the wood was wet. The shaman adventurer thus cast a flame shock on the pyre, allowing them to warm themselves. Torra thanked them, and explained that the Legion destroyed the tauren in the open fields, and that not even Thunder Bluff was safe from the infernals.\nThe Legion's return.\nUnfortunately, the Legion had followed the shaman to the Maelstrom, and infernals started raining down from the skies, led by the fel lord Geth'xun. Thrall charged towards the fel lord while he asked the shaman adventurer to take care of the infernals. After destroying them, the shaman used Torra's spear, guided by the winds, to bring Geth'xun's felbat, Falthus, down. The shaman of the Earthen Ring then gathered around the Maelstrom Pillar and focused their energy into it, powering up a powerful discharge. Geth'xun brought Thrall to his knees, ready to deal the final blow, when the shaman adventurer jumped on top of the Pillar and received the combined focused energy of all the shaman, which they unleashed upon the demon. Geth'xun was thrown into the Maelstrom, saving Thrall from a fatal blow, but so was the Doomhammer.\nThrall thanked the shaman and shared that he was weirdly outmatched. He confessed that his relationship with the elements had changed since the events on alternate Draenor. He told the shaman that he had some soul-searching to do, and that they must carry the Earthen Ring forward without him. He told them that they were the leader they needed.\nHe also explained that Nobundo was right: conventional tactics would not work against the Legion, the Broken Shore taught them that. They had to scour the world for weapons to use against the demons. He said that the Doomhammer, missing, needed to be recovered, and that Rehgar and Erunak had other suggestions as well.\nThe reforged Ring.\nThe shaman adventurer returned to the Heart of Azeroth, now equipped with a powerful weapon. Stormcaller Mylra told them to speak with Nobundo and take their place around the circle. The Earthen Ring would rise again, she said, with them as its leader. Within these stones stood the legendary Heart of Azeroth, which she suggested they could use as a base of operations. She believed that the power of their artifact could unseal the hidden chambers. The shaman thus spoke to Nobundo, who held the following speech:\nThe new Farseer of the Earthen Ring thus approached the Ancient Rockslide which blocked the way towards the hidden chambers, raised their weapon, and made it crumble, spawning two &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Stone%20Protector\"&gt;Immortal Stone Protector&lt;/a&gt;s to guard the entrance.\nOne with the world.\nNobundo asked them if they could feel the earth and wind and waves clash together here in the Heart of Azeroth as if one could speak directly with the world. He told them the artifact they wielded housed great power, but even greater potential. He told them to carry it below and seek out the ancient elemental altar overlooking the fury of the Maelstrom. From there, they could commune with Azeroth and imbue their artifact with even greater abilities. After doing so, the Farseer shared with Nobundo what they had learned. The latter sensed that the Farseer's work here had only begun. As they would get more familiar with their artifact, they would be able to continue augmenting its power. He explained that the others were watching them carefully, that he had become a symbol of hope in the Ring's struggle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nNobundo asked them to seek out &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Sevel\"&gt;Advisor Sevel&lt;/a&gt; just to the south, and locate the scouting map from which they could direct their champions. The Ring would also indicate on the scouting map various hot-spots around the Broken Isles that required the Farseer's attention. After they chose their first point of attack, Nobundo opened up an astral portal to Dalaran to help their people move quickly between their base of operations and the Broken Isles.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Earthen Ring joined the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to help heal the wound left by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Earthen Ring at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, with several members being &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Geomancer\"&gt;injured&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Rising.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Earthen Ring shaman sensed a disturbance in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;. The orc &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; was sent as a messenger from the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; to inform &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; about it and later went to a meeting with the night elf leaders in Nordrassil who claimed to have similar information from their priestesses.\nAfter the war, the Earthen Ring continue to look after the Maelstrom.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Earthen Ring makes its appearance in the shaman section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Mulric%20Boldrock\"&gt;Mulric Boldrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remaari\"&gt;Remaari&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hretar%20Riverspeaker\"&gt;Hretar Riverspeaker&lt;/a&gt; as shaman trainers.\nDragonflight.\nSeveral members of the Earthen Ring traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to act as consultants for the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Earthcaller%20Yevaa\"&gt;Earthcaller Yevaa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earthmender%20Govrum\"&gt;Earthmender Govrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earthmender%20Narvra\"&gt;Earthmender Narvra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Taiyang\"&gt;Elementalist Taiyang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rimblat%20Earthshatter\"&gt;Rimblat Earthshatter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; became a new far seer; appointed as such by the aging &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;. She later uses her new position to invite the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs &lt;a href=\"Artesh\"&gt;Artesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mallia\"&gt;Mallia&lt;/a&gt; into the Earthen Ring.\nReputation.\nReputation description.\n\"This gathering of the most powerful shaman of Azeroth seeks to maintain the balance between the world's elemental forces. Their main focus during the cataclysm has been to repair and stabilize the damage caused by Deathwing's arrival.\"\nGaining reputation.\nReputation can be gained by completing non-repeatable quests and by &lt;a href=\"championing\"&gt;championing&lt;/a&gt;. There are no repeatable quests available for earning reputation with the Earthen Ring. The non-repeatable quests are located in &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and in some of the dungeon instances in those zones (see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/faction%3D1135%23quests\"&gt;Earthen Ring quests&lt;/a&gt;). The Thrall quests added in 4.2 also give some reputation points.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Earthen Ring is the shaman organization of Azeroth. Its main goal is to maintain the balance between the world and the elementals that dwell upon it. Talking to and dealing with the spirits of the elements, members of the Earthen Ring try to keep the spirits pacified as well as prevent them from raising havoc on Azeroth. Relatively little of the Earthen Ring's time is spent on hunting down rogue elementals and cultists. However, elemental activity is on the rise on Azeroth, so the Earthen Ring is getting busier. Some believe that the role of the organization in the preservation of the world has become essential.\nHistory in the RPG.\nContrary to what some believe, the Earthen Ring was not created in order to fight the Twilight's Hammer; that particular conflict arose later. The group was actually formed to keep in check the elemental spirits. These spirits are by nature chaotic and destructive, but also capable of reasoning and clever actions.\nThe tauren have had shaman for quite a while now, but the Earthen Ring group itself is of more recent origin. People outside the group only noticed its existence about 150 years ago. The founding shaman believed that someone had to prevent the elemental forces from wreaking havoc; otherwise, the world would be in danger Thus, after several meetings and pacts, they founded what is now known as the Earthen Ring. With the passing years, the group, which was at first made exclusively of tauren, began to include a growing number of orcs. Each race now makes up about half the group.\nWhile members of the Earthen Ring have not been overly active in the past, the events of the Third War weakened the dimensional barriers all around Azeroth and elemental activity is now on the rise. Indeed, the Earthen Ring has never been more necessary. Agents of the group work hard to pacify the elementals, thus ensuring they do not cause trouble in the world.\nForsaken and the Horde.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; first asked to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; would have refused if it were not for the Earthen Ring's urgings. According to Thrall, a council of sages, known as the Earthen Ring, asked him to allow the Forsaken into the Horde. They claimed that the Forsaken battle demons that Thrall\u2019s own race is still fighting to this day. To turn his back on the Forsaken was to forget the horrors the orc race fought for generations."}

{"id": "773124", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=773124", "title": "Earthliving Weapon (Wrath Classic)", "text": "Earthliving Weapon is a weapon imbue for the shaman's own weapon, designed for healing. It provides a passive bonus to healing &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt;, as well as chance for healing spells to trigger a &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; (HoT) effect on the target healed. It is the standard weapon imbue for restoration shamans, and is learned at level 30. While the healing done by each tick of Earthliving is fairly small, the fact that it is triggered by most healing spells ensures that it contributes a very significant amount of healing over the course of a long fight.\nNotes.\nThe passive bonus to healing spell power is a fixed value at each player level. It applies only to healing spells, but is increased by effects that increase spell power by a percentage, such as &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20Totem\"&gt;Flametongue Totem&lt;/a&gt;. The heal over time effect scales just like any other healing over time spell, meaning it benefits from spell power (including the spell power granted by Earthliving Weapon itself), &lt;a href=\"critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike&lt;/a&gt; chance, restoration &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; (if you have enough to add additional ticks). The heal over time effect can trigger from any direct healing spell, as well as from each tick of &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Rain\"&gt;Healing Rain&lt;/a&gt;. It has a reduced chance per target to trigger from multi-target heals like &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; or Healing Rain. With the exception of Healing Rain, it does not trigger from heal over time effects, and so cannot be triggered by itself, &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Stream%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Stream Totem&lt;/a&gt;, or the heal over time component of &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;. Various non-spell healing effects such as &lt;a href=\"healing%20potion\"&gt;healing potion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lifeblood%20%28herbalism%20ability%29\"&gt;Lifeblood (herbalism ability)&lt;/a&gt; can trigger the effect, but this is most likely unintended.\nThe Earthliving heal over time effect has no &lt;a href=\"internal%20cooldown\"&gt;internal cooldown&lt;/a&gt; or target limit, and can be active on any number of targets. A target may only have one Earthliving effect active per shaman, meaning the spell does not &lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt; with itself if it triggers a second time on the same target. It counts as a normal heal over time spell for most purposes, and can trigger most &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s that can trigger from periodic healing. Each heal cast will then have a chance to trigger Earthliving from either weapon, although a target can only have one Earthliving per shaman.\nUnleash Elements.\nWhen used with &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Elements\"&gt;Unleash Elements&lt;/a&gt;, Earthliving Weapon triggers &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Life\"&gt;Unleash Life&lt;/a&gt;, which heals for a moderate amount and increases the healing done by the next direct healing spell cast within 8 seconds by 30%. In practice, \"direct heal\" means &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wave%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Healing Wave (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Surge\"&gt;Healing Surge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Greater Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; or Riptide. When used with Riptide, the initial heal will be increased by 30% and the heal over time component will be increased by 15%. Unleash Life affects spells when you finish casting them, so you have to finish casting the spell before the buff wears off for it to benefit. Due to server lag, this means that casting any healing spell with a casting time immediately followed by Riptide will cause both spells to benefit from Unleash Life, as it takes a split second for the buff to disappear after you finished casting the first spell."}

They went into hiding, terrified, and intimidated by the guards.\n&lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Shi\"&gt;Merchant Shi&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the mere to trade, but his caravan was instead attacked by the jinyu.

With his staff, he called upon an ancient ritual to purify mental corruption on the bodies of several fallen jinyu. The spell also caught the nearby &lt;a href=\"Swordmistress%20Mei\"&gt;Swordmistress Mei&lt;/a&gt; and the sha erupted from her. Upon seeing this, Gorai understood what happened to his kinsmen. Although he wanted to purify all of my corrupted brethren, he couldn't allow leaving the uncorrupted ones to go leaderless, so he decided to cleanse the mere itself, stopping the spread of the corruption.

In a broader sense, inns often contain many more defining amenities including &lt;a href=\"Drink%20vendors\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stable%20master\"&gt;stable master&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mailbox\"&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt;s, among others.\nMost &lt;a href=\"settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond contain an inn or tavern, and the more developed of these will have their own separate buildings for this purpose. An inn will generally act as a &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; area with some form of sleeping arrangement (bed, hammock, alcove, etc.) though this may vary greatly by location and culture. Additionally, inns normally have their own atmospheric music and &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; has published these songs in an album: \"&lt;a href=\"Taverns%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Taverns of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThese establishments can be distinguished from &lt;a href=\"Bar%20%28establishment%29\"&gt;bars and taverns&lt;/a&gt; by the presence of an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; and the availability of lodgings as opposed to just consumables; many establishments may act as both inns and taverns, or either one separately.\nDesign and variation of inns.\nInns come in a variety of styles and layouts. Generally, each &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; or culture has its own distinctive inn layout. For example, &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; inns tend to be large, spacious, and wooden. Inns, along with all other assets, also develop and change as new &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;s are released.\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", inns were aesthetically comfortable, welcoming places, while the inns of ' often seemed poorly equipped and bare by comparison, with some not even having a proper chair let alone a bed. This was in keeping with the theme of the expansion and the desolate world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. In ', happily, there were some newly-designed and large luxurious inns, a welcoming return to the feel of the original game. By the time of ', the old inns of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once again became those of the expansion, while in ', entirely new structures and styles based around &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; culture were introduced.\nWarcraft III.\nIn \"\", a tavern/inn was a place from which &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;es were hired and could be &lt;a href=\"revive\"&gt;revive&lt;/a&gt;d instantly for a price.\nIn the RPG.\nPoor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor near the hearth, plus the use of a blanket. Common accommodations are a place on a raised, heated floor, the use of a blanket and a pillow, and the presence of a higher class of company. Good accommodations are a small, private room with one bed, some amenities and a covered chamber pot in the corner."}

Lasts until cancelled.\nInner Fire vs Inner Will.\nInner Fire and &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Will\"&gt;Inner Will&lt;/a&gt; are mutually exclusive; the priest must decide which to have active at any given time. As both are free and last until cancelled, there is no reason not to have one of these abilities active at all times.\nAs Inner Will is not learnt until level 83, priests below this level should always have Inner Fire active.\nInner Fire provides an armor and spell power buff. This provides a very substantial improvement to the priest's defenses (increasing armor by 90% when improved with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Inner%20Fire\"&gt;Glyph of Inner Fire&lt;/a&gt;) and a reasonable boost to spell power, improving both damage dealing and healing. &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Glyph of Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; causes Inner Fire to also reduce spell damage taken, further improving the spell's defensive value.\nInner Will reduces the mana cost of your instant spells and increases your unmounted movement speed by a small amount. This makes it useful for priests who are concerned with their mana pool, especially those reliant on instants. The movement speed increase can be useful in a number of situations both in PvE and PvP, allowing the priest to outstrip pursuers or move within healing range of targets more quickly.\nInner Fire is therefore more directly beneficial to defense, healing and damage dealing; while Inner Will benefits mana-efficiency and movement speed. Priests above level 80 will have to decide which aspects to enhance at any given time. It is quite possible to change between the two buffs depending on the situation; as both are free to cast, the only cost is the use of a global cooldown to activate the chosen spell. \nWhen Inner Fire is the priest's preferred buff, Inner Will can be used to quickly escape AoE effects, or move swiftly between targets, following which the priest may choose to re-activate Inner Fire. When time allows, priests can also activate Inner Will in anticipation of casting one or more instant spells, saving 15% of the mana they would spend. It should be noted that many instants (such as ) benefit from spell power, and so, although 15% cheaper when cast during Inner Will, will be slightly less effective than if cast during Inner Fire. Inner Will can also be very useful when carrying the flag in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, although the priest may wish to re-activate Inner Fire should they come under attack. While many melee types will use snares, stuns or abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, the speed advantage of Inner Will can sometimes allow the priest to outstrip pursuers, especially when used following &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Inner Will is the priest's preferred buff, Inner Fire can be used in anticipation of taking damage (especially physical) or casting non-instant spells, taking advantage of its spell power buff.\nBackground.\nWarcraft III Manual Background.\n\"The mages of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; discovered a way to bring out the potential of the warrior\u2019s fighting spirit and essentially wreathe them in their own spiritual energies.

This effect had a 15-second duration and a 30-second cooldown and was free to cast. \nNotes.\nInner Rage is used to burn off excess &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;. Although both extremely rage-inefficient abilities, by reducing the cooldown on Heroic Strike and Cleave the warrior is able to expend rage very quickly. This makes it useful when the warrior is generating more rage than can possibly be spent even when already spamming Heroic Strike or Cleave. \nSince Heroic Strike and Cleave are generally the least useful ways of spending rage, it is not advised to burn rage in this way unless the amount generated is genuinely excessive. Rage should always be spent on other abilities first. When it is impossible to spend rage elsewhere, Inner Rage can be used to increase damage and threat output by allowing that excess rage to be converted into additional damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; are not on the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, allowing their use to supplement the warrior's other abilities. However, they do share a cooldown.\nInner Rage is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.\nInner Rage cannot be used at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Calm\"&gt;Deadly Calm&lt;/a&gt;."}

According to Fredrik, his brother always liked to play with swords and \"was good at it\u2014ever so much better'n me.\"\nThe Farley family has run the Lion's Pride Inn for years, since the time of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn I&lt;/a&gt;. Fredrik would eventually take over the family business, fell in love with &lt;a href=\"Verina\"&gt;Verina&lt;/a&gt; in their early twenties, and married her. Their daughter Anna would be born sometime before year 15.\nAs a caravan guard, Frandis ended up traveling to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; where he died to the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. Fredrik was devasted by the loss. He was unaware until years later that Frandis later became a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, a royal courier sent by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; arrived with a letter summoning him to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; in order to discuss a private matter. Upon hearing this, Farley was shocked, thinking that something bad about his inn will be discussed. Verina tried to calm him by telling him that maybe the king wanted to rent space in the inn for a celebration, although Farley pointed out that Anduin had an entire keep to do so if he wished. He then accompanied the courier back to Stormwind.\nWhen Farley arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Petitioner%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Petitioner's Chamber&lt;/a&gt; he was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Count%20Remington%20Ridgewell%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Count Remington Ridgewell\u200e&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the king, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; arrived. Farley was surprised to realize that Anduin was younger than Anna. Still nervous, they discussed his brother Frandis while having &lt;a href=\"Bottle%20of%20Peaked%20Dalaran%20Red\"&gt;Peaked Dalaran Red&lt;/a&gt;. Being a bit nervous, Fredrik gulped down his first swallow and mentally kicked himself for not taking the opportunity to savor the rare and expensive vintage. Anduin told him about Frandis' fate as a Forsaken and about his good acts. The king asked Fredrik whether he would want to meet Frandis if he were alive as a Forsaken. Being reminded by Genn that he would be a hideous undead, Farley still answered positively, much to Anduin's satisfaction and Genn's frustration.\nQuotes.\nWelcome to my Inn, weary traveler.

At this point, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; and his Kor'kron companions entered the inn. Grosk served them drinks and vanished. The Kor'krons asked the two about Vol'jin and Baine, but they denied they were in the inn. As Malkorok and his Kor'krons left, Kelantir and Frandis realized that Grosk was nowhere to be found and that they were in a trap.

He warns the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; that the Bloodtotem are about to commit something terrible, but vanishes shortly thereafter. The next time he is encountered, he has been taken to the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Blood%20Trial\"&gt;Cave of the Blood Trial&lt;/a&gt; to be killed in a Bloodtotem rite of passage, but when the player approaches the drogbar, &lt;a href=\"Marakhan\"&gt;Marakhan&lt;/a&gt; emerges from a portal and the Bloodtotem, revealing themselves to be allied with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, rename themselves the Feltotem and become corrupted by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies.\nAfter helping defeat Marakhan, Navarrogg transports himself and the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Navarrogg's Refuge&lt;/a&gt; to regain his strength and recover some of his lost resources \u2014 namely his &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20Focus\"&gt;Stonedark Focus&lt;/a&gt; and his three &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; minions, &lt;a href=\"Frag\"&gt;Frag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gravel\"&gt;Gravel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shard%20%28elemental%29\"&gt;Shard&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly thereafter, Navarrogg and the hero assault the Feltotem's stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Torok%27s%20Bluff\"&gt;Torok's Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, where they succeed in avenging the deaths of countless Stonedark by killing the Feltotem chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Torok%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Torok Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt;. After briefly returning with the adventurer to his home of &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20Grotto\"&gt;Stonedark Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, Navarrogg then journeys to the Highmountain capital of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; to declare his allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; to fill the vacuum left by the Bloodtotem's betrayal.\nWhen Dargrul sends his drogbar army to assault the &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt; east of Thunder Totem, the combined forces of Highmountain \u2014 Highmountain, Stonedark, &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 arrive to meet the Underking and his forces in battle. Despite this combined effort, Dargrul uses the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the nearby &lt;a href=\"Snowmane%20Village\"&gt;Snowmane Village&lt;/a&gt; before retreating into the drogbar capital of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. A group of adventurers, accompanied by Navarrogg and &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;, infiltrate the capital through a hidden side entrance and finally manage to bring an end to the Underking's life and reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. Navarrogg announces that with Dargrul's death, the drogbar have been broken and that the long task of reuniting their disparate tribes now begins, but that balance has been restored to Highmountain.\nLegionfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt; sends the hero to Navarrogg to take out a threat. It turned out that a Feltotem tauren named &lt;a href=\"Tugar%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Tugar&lt;/a&gt; that Navarrogg thought to be dead before the Legion's arrival survived during the invasion of Azeroth. Upon finding Tugar, a &lt;a href=\"Fel-Infused%20Worm\"&gt;Fel-Infused Worm&lt;/a&gt; comes from underground and traps Navarrogg and the hero in place. The drogbar gets freed and transports away from it. Eventually foaling Tugar's plans to raid &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;, Navarrogg begins the search of finding Tugar to end his existence while the hero returns to Dalaran. When he found the location of the Feltotem tauren, he and the hero stand at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Blood%20Totem\"&gt;Cave of the Blood Totem&lt;/a&gt;. It was blocked by a fel wall and Navarrogg told the hero to go after him and he'll catch up. When Tugar finally fell before the hero, Navarrogg arrives at the scene that they had all of the fun without him. He says that now the Feltotem should present less of a threat. Even now, he will keep an eye on those treacherous fiends until their Legion masters are defeated.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSometime following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Highmountain tauren joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Though Navarrogg declared allegiance to Mayla, it is unknown if he and the Stonedark followed suit in joining the Horde.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ebonhorn\"&gt;Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; sensed &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Ebony%20Scale\"&gt;something deep beneath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, Navarrogg and Ebonhorn journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, only to unexpectedly run into &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt; to the region. Seeking to investigate the matter, Ebonhorn had Navarrogg bring Ebonhorn and the champion directly to the source of the disturbance. After the pair defeated &lt;a href=\"Ma%27haat%20the%20Indomitable\"&gt;Ma'haat the Indomitable&lt;/a&gt; and claimed the essence, Navarrogg revealed to the pair that he had prepared an exit for them.\nQuotes.\nHighmountain.\nThe Bloodtotem have always been a treacherous tribe to deal with, but I never expected them to accept the offer of a demon. They must be stopped before they destroy all of Highmountain."}

When Nurakkir collapsed, Xennir and Vyn were the only members of the group who survived. Xennir was traumatized by the event and, according to her, her pet &lt;a href=\"deathroc\"&gt;deathroc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Twigin\"&gt;Twigin&lt;/a&gt; was the only thing she had left.\nXennir and Vyn remained at the ruined necropolis as it began being scavenged by members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, until the Eyes' baroness &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; allies returned to ask for the Eyes' help in stealing a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj's plan would require a well-coordinated crew, so Vyn sent the Maw Walkers to find Xennir on the other side of the necropolis and guide her through her grief so she could join them. Xennir told the outsiders that she would like nothing more than to serve as navigator again, but Twigin had been captured by &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Bony%20Spindles\"&gt;Bony Spindles&lt;/a&gt; and she refused to abandon her best friend. Xennir regretted having to kill the spiders, who were once servants of the House of Eyes, but stated that her skills would be useless without Twigin's direction. Once the Maw Walkers had rescued Twigin, Xennir joined Vyn and the others and helped them take control of Nurakkir by killing &lt;a href=\"Gorgantus%20the%20Gutter\"&gt;Gorgantus the Gutter&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after, the Maw Walkers and Eyes put Vashj's plan into action by infiltrating the House of Constructs' &lt;a href=\"Ossein%20Foundry\"&gt;Ossein Foundry&lt;/a&gt; to steal the Constructs' own necropolis, the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;. The group split up and Xennir and the Maw Walkers snuck into the foundry to rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Ansid%20the%20Mechanic\"&gt;Ansid the Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, but along the way they were discovered by the Constructs' &lt;a href=\"darkhound\"&gt;darkhound&lt;/a&gt;s and Xennir concluded that the Constructs were prepared for the Eyes' arrival. This was confirmed when Xennir and the Maw Walkers reached the rendezvous point and met with &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed that Ansid had been captured by the foundry's guards. The Maw Walkers swiftly freed Ansid, after which the group killed the foundry's overseer &lt;a href=\"Enforcer%20Borgulla\"&gt;Enforcer Borgulla&lt;/a&gt; and captured a mooring platform from which the Maw Walkers could travel to the necropolis' apex and use a keystone to take command of it. Vyn, Xennir, and the others quickly steered the Zerekriss away from the House of Constructs to have it patrol around Maldraxxus. Aboard, the Maw Walkers also discovered the &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20Fleshcrafting\"&gt;:Bindings of Fleshcrafting&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the armor pieces that once belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; himself\u2014and brought them back to the Seat of the Primus."}

In the ' expansion, Naxxramas was moved to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and retuned as an entry-level raid dungeon for level 80 players. Like all other &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt; raid dungeons, Naxxramas has both 10- and 25-player versions.\nHistory.\nYears ago, the crypt lord &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; led an army of undead warriors into the ancient nerubian ziggurat now known as Naxxramas. The Scourge forces overran the citadel, and under the will of the Lich King its corridors were transformed into a potent war machine. Dark magic tore the fortress from its subterranean home and lifted it into the sky. Hidden behind a thick layer of clouds, Naxxramas grew in strength. At the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s bidding, the burgeoning wrath within the necropolis was unleashed upon the world.\nIt was then used as &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s base of operations as he returned with it to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; where he spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources say &lt;a href=\"Obrahiim%2C%20the%20Traveler\"&gt;Obrahiim, the Traveler&lt;/a&gt;, a great skeletal architect, was pivotal in the conception of Naxxramas, hinting that it was altered or retooled. See the \"&lt;a href=\"Compendium%20of%20Fallen%20Heroes\"&gt;Compendium of Fallen Heroes&lt;/a&gt;\" for more details.\nDue to his fighting a war against the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the humans of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as constant incursions of adventurers from every race and nation into the Scourge-controlled Plaguelands on a daily basis, the forces of Kel'Thuzad have been severely taxed to maintain the security of the necropolis. But now the gates of Naxxramas are open, and Kel'Thuzad's new forces are rapidly sweeping away all opposition to the Scourge.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe entrance to the dread citadel of Naxxramas, a rune portal, was located in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, all attempts to enter had been stymied by the magical wards placed upon the rune portal. The Argent Dawn devised a way to gain entry via &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; cloaking - an old cantrip of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; with a few modifications of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Angela%20Dosantos\"&gt;Archmage Angela Dosantos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, which later led to an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; counterattack. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; recruited Alliance heroes who raided Naxxramas, defeating abominations, death knights, and even &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAbove the war-ravaged wastes of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, Naxxramas has returned with renewed fury during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;. As the Alliance fortress of &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was enough of a thorn in the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s side, he brought Naxxramas from &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; with Kel'Thuzad leading siege, once again seated in the frigid heart of the necropolis. As factions from around the world converge at the gate to Icecrown, the war against the Scourge enters its most pivotal hour. It is within Naxxramas that the tide of battle could turn against the Lich King or irrevocably in his favor.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers reported that Naxxramas still floated over &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; feeling as if the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; was waiting for something. Muradin was also worried about the fact that no one had been able to knock it down yet.\nGetting there.\nNo special access is required - simply fly to the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Fields\"&gt;Carrion Fields&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; not far from &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venomspite\"&gt;Venomspite&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Stone\"&gt;Meeting Stone&lt;/a&gt; and the instance line are at the bottom of the necropolis.\nSecrets of Naxxramas.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.1.5\"&gt;patch 10.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, a number of ancient secrets of Naxxramas have been revealed to players with an empowered &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Complete the &lt;a href=\"Wards%20of%20the%20Dread%20Citadel\"&gt;Wards of the Dread Citadel&lt;/a&gt; achievement (and the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Scholomance\"&gt;Memory of Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; achievement!) to unlock secrets account-wide.\nOnce unlocked, start by crafting a &lt;a href=\"Makeshift%20Grappling%20Hook\"&gt;Makeshift Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt; from parts found inside the instance, then find and wake up &lt;a href=\"Zackett%20Skullsmash\"&gt;Zackett Skullsmash&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Inconvenience%20Fee\"&gt;Inconvenience Fee&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nAfter that's done, find &lt;a href=\"Omarion%27s%20Second%20Handbook\"&gt;Omarion's Second Handbook&lt;/a&gt; to make progress on the &lt;a href=\"Putting%20Wilhelm%20Out%20of%20Business\"&gt;Putting Wilhelm Out of Business&lt;/a&gt; achievement, collect a frost resistance set for &lt;a href=\"Never%20Bothered%2C%20Anyway\"&gt;Never Bothered, Anyway&lt;/a&gt;, and feed a &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Delicious\"&gt;Rotten Delicious&lt;/a&gt; to earn the trust of the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20Valiance\"&gt;Reins of Valiance&lt;/a&gt;, steed of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Korth%27azz\"&gt;Thane Korth'azz&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoot.\nNaxxramas loot includes the &lt;a href=\"Tier%207\"&gt;Tier 7&lt;/a&gt; raid sets, which are based on the &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; raid sets that dropped in the original Naxxramas. There are two versions: The Tier 7 \"Heroes'\" sets from the normal mode 10-man, and the Tier 7.5 \"Valorous\" sets from the heroic mode 25-man. While these sets are inspired by the original Tier 3 sets, they have received significant model updates.\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, 10 and 25 player both drop a total of 185 &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nNaxxramas serves as the setting for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\"'s first adventure: \"\". The adventure feature encounters with each of the 15 bosses from the raid's second incarnation in both Normal and Heroic mode, offering in reward 30 new Naxxramas-themed cards for use in the rest of the game, featuring ghouls, zombies, nerubians and legendary minion versions of bosses such as Kel'Thuzad, Baron Rivendare and Feugen and Stalagg.\nAdditionally, the Naxxramas was rewarded for achieving Rank 20 in Ranked Season 4, which took place during July 2014. The flavor text reads: \"The gooey center is Ooze slime. Don\u2019t lick it.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It was a massive &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; and had the unquestionable honor of serving as the seat of one of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful officers, the dreaded &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe instance was regarded as the most difficult before the release of \"The Burning Crusade\", and should not have been attempted at level 60 without at least 40 well-equipped (preferably &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Nozdormu%20set\"&gt;Tier 2.5&lt;/a&gt; armor) players. Naxxramas was also the home of many of the most powerful items of the pre-BC era, and 60+ quests with rewards such as and all Tier 3 items available in the game. With the release of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", finishing this instance still required 25-30 well-equipped level 70 players. The dungeon was added in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, making it the last non-expansion instance added to the core game as well as the last 40 man instance.\nIn the \"\" expansion, Naxxramas was moved to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and retuned to be the introductory level 80 raid dungeon. Like all other &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt; raid dungeons, Naxxramas has both 10-man and 25-man versions.\nThe move is claimed by some to not be a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;, but a progression of the storyline. Naxxramas was indeed in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, but after Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt; was given to the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Father%20Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;Father Inigo Montoy&lt;/a&gt;, the lich was able to revive himself and make the transition along with his fortress. While at least &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;one boss&lt;/a&gt; does not return in the new Naxxramas, there is no explanation yet as to how the other bosses \"survived\" destruction during the original campaign led by the Argent Dawn.\nGaining entry.\nTo enter Naxxramas, you had to be attuned through the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; by completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Dread%20Citadel%20-%20Naxxramas\"&gt;The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, whose cost varied based on reputation level.\nAttunement costs.\nIf you chose to become exalted with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, you could complete the attunement for free; however, this required a great deal of work. The reputation reward for the entrance quest was 1000 rep for a character that was Honored or Revered at the time of completion.\nFor more information on the Naxxramas attunement quest or the Argent Dawn, see the following resources:\nTeleport spire.\nThe teleport spire in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt; was the only way into Naxxramas. After becoming attuned, one had to step onto the runic circle in the center of the spire to teleport into Naxxramas' center chamber. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the entire structure was moved directly underground, with another &lt;a href=\"Plague%20cauldron\"&gt;Plague cauldron&lt;/a&gt; added to its place.\nOriginal entryway.\nJust like &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; was originally entered from &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, Naxxramas was once intended to have its raid instance portal in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, outside the &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20Square\"&gt;Slaughter Square&lt;/a&gt;. Carefully using a flying mount to approach Stratholme from the outside shows that an old version of the necropolis is still flying near Slaughter Square, beyond a raid portal. The tunnel leads to an abandoned place where an invisible &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; is, which can be seen with a model viewer.\nThe minimap file for Naxxramas is also called \"Stratholme Raid\".\nDungeon information.\nStructure and layout.\nNaxxramas is structured like a giant wheel divided into four quarters (or wings), with each quarter connected by the &lt;a href=\"Outer%20Ring\"&gt;Outer Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Players enter the raid at the center of the necropolis, and may clear each of the four wings in any desired order. This allows for non-linear progression. Defeating the final boss of a wing unlocks a teleporter that places players back at the entrance of the raid. Clearing all four wings will unlock access to the &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm%20Lair\"&gt;Frostwyrm Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaxxramas is noted as being the only raid with no exit. Once inside, the only ways out are through a &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, use of a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; spell, or by resurrection via &lt;a href=\"spirit%20healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the Frostwyrm Lair also has no exit, sealing players off from re-accessing any other part of Naxxramas once inside.\nSeason of Mastery.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Mastery\"&gt;Season of Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, trash mobs in Naxxramas will drop deathstones that can be traded to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tarsis%20Kir-Moldir\"&gt;Archmage Tarsis Kir-Moldir&lt;/a&gt; for various items. Players can unlock additional items by turning in &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Deathstones\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; that also drop from trash mobs. One of these items, the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Fortune\"&gt;Rune of Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, will increase the difficulty of all bosses in the raid for the entire lockout, as well as making them drop an additional item when killed. This effect stacks if multiple runes are used.\nAdditionally, players who enter the raid will receive a buff noting that no players have died; naturally, it is removed when any player dies within the raid. It is believed that defeating &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; with this buff active will reward the &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20Mastery\"&gt;Tabard of Mastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nEncounters and bosses.\nBelow is the full list of bosses (in parentheses are the &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; armor part the boss drops quest item for).\nThere are fifteen boss encounters in Naxxramas. First full Naxx clear was done by the Horde guild on Magtheridon (EU) on September 7, 2006 (two and one-half months after Naxx came out on June 20, 2006).\nThe easiest wing is the Spider Wing, &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Razuvious\"&gt;Instructor Razuvious&lt;/a&gt; being the easiest boss (arguably comparable to Grobbulus, but Grobbulus sits behind a major &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;: Patchwerk). The Plague Wing bosses &lt;a href=\"Noth%20the%20Plaguebringer%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Noth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heigan%20the%20Unclean%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Heigan&lt;/a&gt; are on a similar level of difficulty of Anub'Rekhan, but in different aspects (Heigan is VERY difficult in the individual coordination aspect). Abomination wing bosses are in the middle (with the exception of very easy &lt;a href=\"Grobbulus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Grobbulus&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt; is commonly conceived as a hard &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt; and healer's fight. The most difficult bosses, in order of rising difficulty, are &lt;a href=\"Thaddius%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thaddius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loatheb%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Loatheb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gothik%20the%20Harvester%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Gothik the Harvester&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. (Thus, the wings below are listed in rising order of difficulty to fully clear.)\nResistances.\nNature.\nThe beginning parts of 3 of the 4 wings (Plague, Spider, and Abomination) are rich in Nature damage. This is good news for players who built up their nature resistance gear in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrost.\nPlayers will need a lot of frost resistance to fight the final bosses in Naxxramas. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; is a lich, but does not require a lot of frost resistance to defeat him. The &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; encounter requires a very significant amount of Frost Resistance (150-200), but is NOT frost-based like Ragnaros is fire-based. Frost resistance gear has proven to be rather scarce thus far, luckily, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; has made available several armor patterns that provide considerable frost resistance and bosses in Naxxramas drop very high-quality epic frost resistance pieces.\nTo help in this endeavor, the &lt;a href=\"Icebellow%20Anvil\"&gt;Icebellow Furnace&lt;/a&gt; was accessible.\nShadow.\nShadow is the third major resistance required. &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s use powerful shadow magic, and Kel'Thuzad has a few shadow spells as well. The final boss in the Plague wing, , uses shadow based damage also. Shadow resist gear can be found scattered throughout various instances, so this shouldn't be a problem.\nFire.\nCertain boss encounters need some fire resistance, like and the .\nLoot.\nNaxxramas loot included the &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; raid set.\nFor more details, see &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29%20loot\"&gt;Naxxramas (Classic) loot&lt;/a&gt;."}

Turning in the Phylactery allows players to choose from the following rewards:\nBoss Loot.\nIn addition to the listed loot tables, all bosses except &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had a chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"Splinter%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Splinter of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, of which 40 are required to form the &lt;a href=\"Frame%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Frame of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere were three &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; set tokens for each armor slot, organized by class: &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.

One or two loot tokens drop per boss, duplicate tokens can drop from the same boss.

The final wing boss drops two tokens. &lt;a href=\"Gluth%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Gluth&lt;/a&gt; could drop any one of the twelve feet, shoulder, waist or wrist set tokens. &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; drops shoulder enchants and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt; directly drops two &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt; rings, not loot tokens.\nBosses are listed in the order of:"}

He was originally the preeminent warrior of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrel commands the Horde forces of &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, a fortress in the world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Third War.\nNazgrel is the last living relative of &lt;a href=\"Kash%27drakor\"&gt;Kash'drakor&lt;/a&gt;, a famed warrior in orcish history. Nazgrel was one of the orcs liberated from an &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; after the Second War. Since then, he has become one of Thrall's most trusted advisors. He is distrustful of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrel guarded the orc base.\nThe Founding of Durotar.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall took his orcish brethren to an area of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, which he claimed as his own, naming it &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; after his father. Founding the capital of this new nation, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrel was placed in charge of its security.\nNazgrel despised the Alliance, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s in particular. He viewed Thrall's continued insistence that the humans can be reasoned with to be a weakness, and felt that victory through war was the only way that the Alliance would end their persecution of the Horde. However, Nazgrel was also completely loyal to his Warchief, and thus did not act on his opinions.\nDuring the construction of Orgrimmar, &lt;a href=\"Bloodfeather\"&gt;Bloodfeather&lt;/a&gt;, a harpy queen, assaulted the caravans of supplies coming to Orgrimmar, but Nazgrel was unable to leave the fledgling city to deal with her. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, a recent arrival to Orgrimmar, offered to assist Nazgrel, and was sent to dispose of her. Nazgrel was pleased when he returned with the harpy's heart, and rewarded him with items from the armory.\nNazgrel was uneasy as news of the humans' actions at the coast reached Thrall, but obeyed Thrall's command for peace, letting Rexxar handle them. But when they lost contact with &lt;a href=\"Gar%27thok\"&gt;Gar'thok&lt;/a&gt;'s outpost, Nazgrel accompanied Rexxar to investigate, and they found the outpost destroyed and human camps along the coast. Nazgrel, Rexxar and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to kill the humans to take revenge for their actions.\nCycle of Hatred.\nNazgrel noticed Rexxar and his bear &lt;a href=\"Misha\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt; carrying a wounded orc named &lt;a href=\"Byrok\"&gt;Byrok&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrel's men helped get the orc to Thrall in his throne room. He and &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt; had heard about a cult named Flaming Sword that was spreading between humans in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Its members were apparently behind the attack on Byrok. Later on, when human troops gathered at &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Burx ordered Nazgrel to ready orc's troops and sent them to the Barrens.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Durotar, Nazgrel has continued to serve Thrall unquestioningly. \nNazgrel has served as Thrall's general and chief of security. It was Nazgrel's duty to protect Durotar from internal threats and anarchy. He is a grim and fearsome orc, utterly committed to his warchief and the glory of the Horde.\nBefore the re-opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he could be found inside &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"orcish\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrel has relocated from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where he commands the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. He works as the major figurehead in the frontier town, similar to &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen new recruits arrived from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; he sent them to work with &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Shatterskull\"&gt;Sergeant Shatterskull&lt;/a&gt; in order to discover what the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was up too. He later sent Horde adventures to strike before the Legion had gotten the camp completed and running, to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Cannon%20MKI\"&gt;fel cannons&lt;/a&gt; at before they could be fired upon Thrallmar, to slay &lt;a href=\"Warbringer%20Arix%27Amal\"&gt;Warbringer Arix'Amal&lt;/a&gt;, and close the Legion gateway at .\nUpon learning of a plot to assassinate their envoy to &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt; Nazgrel instructed Horde adventures to kill the &lt;a href=\"Krun%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. When the assassin was discovered dead adventures decided to bring the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Stone%20Axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; that took his life to Nazgrel. After he received the axe a surprised Nazgrel became determined to contact whoever created the axe as they were familiar in the old ways. After tentative contact with the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; was established Nazgrel declared that the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; must be informed at once and sent adventures to report the news to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently ordered them to aid the Mag'har.\nHe personally ordered the death of &lt;a href=\"Force-Commander%20Gorax\"&gt;Force-Commander Gorax&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Kargath\"&gt;Hand of Kargath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arazzius%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Arazzius the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Head\"&gt;Magtheridon's Head&lt;/a&gt; Nazgrel revealed &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s death was a blow to both &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the Legion and that the siege of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; no longer had a purpose for the Legion. He then cast &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel%27s%20Fervor\"&gt;Nazgrel's Fervor&lt;/a&gt;, which granted 10% in Thrallmar reputation gains for two hours for every Horde character within &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and Hellfire Citadel.\nLegion.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Nazgrel can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde standing right next to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nDragonflight.\nNazgrel attended the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival on Azeroth, where he expressed gratitude to be away from &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; for a time and around other members of his clan. He was sporting new armor in this appearance.

Because orcs reach the size of an adult human by age six, he must be less than six years old here. \"Warlords of Draenor\" takes place around year -2, meaning Nazgrel was born no earlier than year -8. Assuming the prime Nazgrel was born at the same time as in the alternate universe, he would be between 33 and 39 years old when the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nAlthough \"Nazgrel\" is one of the random names for &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt;s in ', this is likely to be just a homage to the character from '.

Nazgrim was a recurring &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; quest giver and first appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; as a Sergeant. After the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he was promoted to Legionnaire and sent to &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;.

During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; later brought Nazgrim back into undeath as the first of the new &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nNazgrim was once one of the countless orcs held prisoner within the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; run &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s, and subsequently freed by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after his liberation, he joined the army.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrim had reached the rank of Sergeant, and was assigned to &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he met an adventurer after their correspondence with &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20Krenna\"&gt;Conqueror Krenna&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim was quite wary of Krenna's temper and attitude, and while she diverted all her attention on attacking the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrim focused on tackling the local threats, mainly the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. He retained his rank after Krenna was deposed by her more moderate sister, &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in Northrend, Nazgrim fought and slew plenty of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and he would never forget the blank looks in their gazes before they fell.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; campaign, Nazgrim received a promotion to Legionnaire. On the orders of the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrim joined an adventurer and led &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Vanguard\"&gt;Hellscream's Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to capture a key strategic island for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; from which to strike against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim was eager to show the world the might of the Horde, and unite them under its banner.\nNazgrim boarded a mercenary ship heading seawards, but the vessel was waylaid by a &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; attack. Nazgrim attempted to fight off the serpentine enemies, but was thrown overboard; his ship was subsequently destroyed by the great &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim survived the ordeal with the help of &lt;a href=\"Erunak%20Stonespeaker\"&gt;Erunak Stonespeaker&lt;/a&gt; and reunited with the adventurer and other survivors in short order. The group discovered that they were in the waters of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, in the midst of several conflicts and local oppression put into effect by the naga. Nazgrim and the party attempted to fight off a naga assault, however, they were captured in the process and brought into the naga-controlled &lt;a href=\"Nespirah\"&gt;Nespirah&lt;/a&gt;, where they were put to work as slaves. The adventurer and Erunak escaped this fate, and they freed Nazgrim from his predicament some time later. \nNazgrim and the Horde survivors regrouped in a cave named the &lt;a href=\"Legion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Legion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. With the group's original goals all but wrecked by their current predicament, the Legionnaire began to piece an escape plan together instead. After more conflict with the naga, Nazgrim was able to get a rescue flare-up, and Horde ships came to the party's rescue. Nazgrim relocated aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Bounty\"&gt;Stygian Bounty&lt;/a&gt;\", and aimed to jump back into the fray after some respite. The goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; brought a submarine, the \"&lt;a href=\"Verne\"&gt;Verne&lt;/a&gt;\", and Nazgrim took it back underneath the waves in an effort to locate &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;the beast&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the derailment of his mission.\nNazgrim accompanied the adventurer, Erunak, and the \"Verne\"'s crew in dealing with the naga's full force beneath the tides. Realizing that the entire realm was in danger, Nazgrim had the sub landed and rushed out to do battle with the naga and their &lt;a href=\"faceless\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; allies. After a struggle, Nazgrim witnessed Ozumat the kraken crash into &lt;a href=\"Neptulon%20the%20Tidehunter\"&gt;Neptulon the Tidehunter&lt;/a&gt; and flee the scene. Believing themselves victorious, the naga fell back, with a captured Erunak in tow. Unwilling to abandon him, Nazgrim remained behind to launch a rescue effort in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; and to kill the naga sea witch, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the deeds were done, Nazgrim congratulated the adventurer on their victory, coming to regard the adventurer as a friend and a comrade.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrim had received a promotion to General, and was seen in the first Horde-side cutscene. Nazgrim reported naval victories off the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, and informed Garrosh of a strange and uncharted land discovered during a battle with an Alliance vessel. Garrosh angrily lambasted Nazgrim for allowing the Alliance to get there first, and dispatched the general and an elite forward party (including &lt;a href=\"Shademaster%20Kiryn\"&gt;Shademaster Kiryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivett%20Clutchpop\"&gt;Rivett Clutchpop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Gorrok\"&gt;Sergeant Gorrok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer) to take over this &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;new continent&lt;/a&gt; and battle the Alliance there.\nUpon reuniting with Nazgrim, he recognized and reminisced with the adventurer he had encountered in Vashj'ir.\nNazgrim presided over the Horde's landing in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; from the sky, though his airship was shot down and the Horde forces were left to their own devices. Nazgrim was among the first to encounter the native &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, who gave the general an icy reception for having brought war to their homeland. Regardless, the pandaren gave the Horde forces exposition on the nature of the insidious &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, and some chose to take up the Horde's cause and grant them sanctuary. During his stay, Nazgrim took the stranded &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; into custody, identifying him as the crown prince of Stormwind and holding him as a prisoner of war. However, Anduin was eventually able to escape from his captivity. \nNazgrim went about compelling the local &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;Forest Hozen&lt;/a&gt; to serve the Horde war effort, with mixed results: though copious in number, their volatile nature worried him. Nazgrim eventually molded them into a decent fighting force and faced off against &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and his similarly-conscripted raid of &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;Pearlfin Jinyu&lt;/a&gt;. As the two clashed, the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt; erupted in a torrent of sha, and the Horde and Alliance forces were broken. Nazgrim and his entourage narrowly survived the outburst, though were heavily wounded and sent to &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt; to recuperate, along with Taylor and the surviving Alliance members.\nNazgrim awakened to find himself sharing a room with the Admiral (who was also heavily wounded in the battle), and the two nearly came to blows. With the adventurer's help, Nazgrim regained his strength and established a Horde camp named &lt;a href=\"Eastwind%20Rest\"&gt;Eastwind Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Vexed at the unreliable nature of the hozen, Nazgrim was certain that the pandaren would make finer allies and sought to convince them of the advantages of joining the Horde over the Alliance.\nLandfall.\nNazgrim and what remained of his vanguard joined the rest of the Horde when they arrived in force to Pandaria. He was stationed at the newly-constructed &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;Domination Point scenario&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked the base and Nazgrim, his vanguard team, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Bloodhilt\"&gt;Warlord Bloodhilt&lt;/a&gt;, and Horde adventurers successfully repelled the Alliance invasion.\nNazgrim served as Domination Point's main quest giver, though also found himself having to deal with a taste of politics. As adventurers furthered their reputation with the base, Nazgrim tasked them with various missions from Horde high command and Garrosh himself. During the storyline, Garrosh's disregard for &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; lives resulted in relations between Garrosh and the regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, becoming highly strained, culminating in Lor'themar contemplating removing his people from the Horde entirely. Nazgrim learned of this and was highly (and loudly) concerned with its implications.\nNazgrim was one of those aware of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; plot to steal the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; and instructed the adventurer to venture into &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to fetch it using a Sunreaver mage's portal. When it became apparent that the Sunreavers' involvement in the bell's theft had been discovered by Jaina, Nazgrim hastily sent the adventurer to rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and evacuate the Sunreavers as a whole from the city during the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nNazgrim ended the Domination Point plotline delivering a summons from Garrosh to the adventurer. However, Nazgrim himself was not present to witness Garrosh's use of the Divine Bell to infuse his soldiers with sha power, nor the Bell's destruction.\nEscalation.\nNazgrim was summoned by Garrosh to help put down the burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. He could be found at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, instructing &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen the defenses of &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; against a possible assault by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s naval forces.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nOn the cusp of the siege, Nazgrim was approached by former warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The two requested an audience with Garrosh in hopes to end the war, however, they were barred entry by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim ordered his men to fall back and allowed the pair to enter the city, but made no promises that Garrosh would heed their words at this late a juncture.\nNazgrim and his forces were tasked with defending the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;main entrance&lt;/a&gt; into Orgrimmar. Nazgrim faced off against &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from Orgrimmar's battlements, warning the two to cease their rebellion and assuring them that they couldn't win if they insisted on fighting.\nNazgrim's &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to deal with the rebels but was eventually defeated and destroyed. After &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her sentinels breached the city's gates, Nazgrim and his remaining Kor'kron brigade fell back to defend the entrance to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underhold\"&gt;The Underhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFiercely loyal to the Horde and bound to a rigorous code of honor and duty, Nazgrim held the line for his warchief until his dying breath.\nLegion.\nNazgrim's body was collected and given a burial at the graveyard in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, not far from Orgrimmar's front gate. At the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrim returned as the first newly raised member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. After being raised, he learned about the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and believed them to be consequences of Hellscream's pride and his loyalty, and due to them still itching at his mind, he tried not to think about them. Nazgrim then accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; and defended them while reviving the other Horsemen.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; calls out their champion and Nazgrim simply told him to watch his tone. After sweeping the courtyard of Witherbark trolls, Galen thanks them. However, he proclaims his kingdom is his alone and Nazgrim saw this a treachery. He asphyxiates Stromgarde soldiers outside the keep as the Deathlord hunts down the prince.\nUpon arriving in the court of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, Nazgrim once again Strangulates his foes.

Nazgrim tells the Deathlord (Highlord said in the audio) that they must do something before it's too late for Mograine.\nNazgrim participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;. He demanded that him and Thassarian continuously stop to &lt;a href=\"Strangulate\"&gt;Strangulate&lt;/a&gt; each individual demon in the \"Exodar\".\nLegionfall.\nNazgrim participates with his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;fellow Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, the Deathlord and &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt; mounted on &lt;a href=\"Daumyr\"&gt;Daumyr&lt;/a&gt; to battle the demons on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUnder Bolvar's command, the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; acquired fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with Nazgrim personally acquiring bodies from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and other Horde lands. He watched as the Horde overthrew &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and though he wanted to help them, he was forbidden to by Bolvar.\nFollowing the Fourth War's completion, he witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights being raised. Darion personally sent the new death knights to travel to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; if the death knight is &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; if it is &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and make a choice from the &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Call%20Board\"&gt;Hero's Call Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe Ride Forth.\nBelieving that Bolvar had fallen to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Darion attempted to kill him. However, Bolvar forcibly controlled the former's body and made him return to , while taunting him about requiring his fellow horsemen. Though wary of it being a trap and feeling something off about the situation, Nazgrim agreed to join his fellow horsemen in killing the Lich King, and decide who would wield the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; after Bolvar was slain. However, en route to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Four Horsemen, using their connection to the Lich King, discovered him locked in combat with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that this was all part of Bolvar's gambit to have the horsemen arrive and kill the winner of the conflict.\nNazgrim and the others were stunned when Sylvanas won and destroyed the helm instead of claiming ownership of it. With the Scourge &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;no longer under control&lt;/a&gt;, Darion ordered Nazgrim and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Bolvar, while he and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; fought to keep Acherus under their control.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began to rampage across Azeroth, Nazgrim and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; brought the wounded &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to . Following the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; he became the Ebon Blade's emissary to the Horde.\nNazgrim and the other horsemen accompanied Bolvar and the heroes of Azeroth during the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;s through the fortress' various levels.\nDragonflight.\nHe appears in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nThe final battle against the naga has begun.

Like &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, Nazja is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; language. As such, its writing resembles elven script.\nA &lt;a href=\"The%20Warlord%27s%20Treatise\"&gt;treatise&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kalithresh\"&gt;Warlord Kalithresh&lt;/a&gt; is written in the water-proofed alien script of the naga.\nIn the RPG.\nSailors speak of the mysterious and dangerous naga; some even claim to know phrases in the aquatic race's language heard on the wind as their ships sailed the seas. Such claims are often treated with a healthy skepticism. Nazja has evolved as its own unique language over 10,000 years, and has diverged from the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; tongue. Although Nazja shares common heritage from the Darnassian tongue, over the course of its linguistic evolution the meanings and definitions of terms the language are no longer the same. Because of this some naga choose learn the language of their heritage, in order to communicate with their cousins, the night elves.\nLinguistic mechanics.\nAccording to the lore, Naga mainly speak Nazja and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. However, Naga will often learn the languages of those they interact with. Because Darnassian is considered a different enough languages to pose communication issues with their cousins, some naga choose learn the language of their heritage (&lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;) so as to be able to speak with night elves. However they can also communicate with shared knowledge of Common.\nNames.\nNaga names have little in common. Some retain kaldorei traditions, taking surnames that speak to the strengths of their race. Others prefer more exotic names that may have some meaning in the naga tongue or in some other forgotten language. Still others adopt titles purely for their intimidation value, or to assert claims to leadership. Their names often include many sibilants, Z\u2019s and V\u2019s, although this particular trait must have started to develop before the Highborne's transformation into naga, since names like &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; all date back to the time before the transformation, and there don't seem to be any similarly-sounding names in modern Darnassian.\n\u2022 Male Names: Sakrasis, Shezril, Velrash, Zoniss.\n\u2022 Female Names: Anna, Asprah, Charib\u2019dishal, Scilla, Ursula.\n\u2022 Surnames: Darkscale, Rendclaw, Serpens, Stormbow.\nSpeculation.\nThere are known to be four elven dialects; Nazja may be one of them.\nSome fans who have tried to reconcile it in their own way, theorizing that for naga to communicate underwater, the naga vocal apparatus would have to be structured differently from that of an elf; as a result, saying a word, such as \"quel'dorei,\" or \"belore,\" would sound completely different, warped both by the new vocal apparatus and the water around the speaker. If this is the case, then Nazja might not be another language at all, just Darnassian spoken underwater, with a different vocal organ. This would account for the accent the naga have when speaking to surface dwellers, and why they could communicate with elves without difficulty."}

Thus, Nazjatar was created, and Azshara knew that one day &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;her empire&lt;/a&gt; under the sea would eclipse even that of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe naga of Nazjatar are masters of sorcery and natural dwellers of the ocean deeps.

With both sides reeling from the events and healing their wounds, the naga made their move and begin striking against the two. Taking any remaining ships, the Horde and the Alliance set sail and arrive in the ancient land of Nazjatar: the land of the naga and the location of Azshara's seat of power, her &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where they will face Queen Azshara herself.\nWarchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; devised a plan to finally destroy the Alliance and end the war. For that outcome, she sent a fleet to the high seas from &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.

The buildings' foundations merge with the walls of the Rift, though the structures themselves are oriented vertically, as normal (not horizontally; their foundations are on their walls). The place has a dark and sinister atmosphere, and naga swim among the buildings, conducting their nefarious plans. The buildings' colors are muted, usually tan or gray, and bear carvings of waves, &lt;a href=\"seahorse\"&gt;seahorse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, and more disturbing motifs: powerful naga &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, battling the &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, enslaving the &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;, and returning to the surface to exact revenge on their &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;ancient kin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, grown massive in size and in power, dwells in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt; in Nazjatar's center; this structure was &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;her palace&lt;/a&gt; in the Kaldorei civilization 10,000 years ago as well.\nGeography.\nNazjatar is found in &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;a trench&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; of the Maelstrom.

Their city is built into the cliffside and adorned with fantastic decorations. Nazjatar is in fact built upon the remains of the former &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as the naga changed with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and evolved over the millennia, so too did their city. In current times, many naga range out from Nazjatar. They prefer sea coasts and can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaga serve their own purposes and are united in their efforts to return their race to glory. All others \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and all the rest \u2014 are either tools to further this goal or obstacles that must be destroyed.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded it left behind residual energies, which twisted in the ocean depths near the naga's city. Over ten millennia these energies mutated the fallen &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, altering them even further to suit their new environment. The naga recast ruined Zin-Azshari into a new capital: Nazjatar. Ruling the naga was Azshara, now mutated into a terrible demigod.\nNaga history takes a breather for 10,000 years. What they did while they sat in Nazjatar, aside from mutate, is not known. They probably tamed some native creatures to use in warfare. Studied arcane magic, and probably clashed with the &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, whose capital &lt;a href=\"Mak%27aru\"&gt;Mak'aru&lt;/a&gt; is in close proximity. The makrura hate the naga and slaughter them on sight; in turn, the naga show no mercy to the makrura. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s fear Nazjatar's power.\nPeople and culture.\nOver the eons, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;ancient world&lt;/a&gt;, has grown in power and magnificence. To the naga, she is a living &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;, and they venerate her. Her presence in Nazjatar is a powerful motivating force for the naga, and in their minds Azshara, Nazjatar, and the naga are inextricably linked \u2014 perhaps the same thing, in a way. Naga pay homage to their heritage and their queen. The beings they once revered as kaldorei \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are nothing but shadows. The naga draw power from the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; influence around Nazjatar.\nWhile exceptions exist, naga men perform tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, while naga women take up intellectual pursuits. Men mine stone and coral for building, for example, while women draw the blueprints and create the strangely delicate frescoes that adorn Nazjatar's buildings. In military matters, men are warriors and guards, while women are generals and magi. As said, some exceptions exist, and male naga commanders are not completely unknown. Both men and women emphasize learning, from weaponsmithing to spellcraft. Naga know the value of knowledge. As far as anyone knows, the only real naga armies that currently exist are beneath the waves, in Nazjatar, and in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where a force of naga under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; works with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe naga have had millennia to adapt to their environment, and they make use of the surrounding areas and the native flora and fauna. Trained &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, and great serpentlike &lt;a href=\"tube%20wyrm\"&gt;tube wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s called &lt;a href=\"tidal%20guardian\"&gt;tidal guardian&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the waters around Nazjatar. Apparently, this rapport is not limited to creatures beneath the waves, for naga forces on land include trained &lt;a href=\"couatl\"&gt;couatl&lt;/a&gt; as well. The naga also work with a race called the &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;, who were once murlocs, but are now brutal, warped, and twisted due to the Legion's influence.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Named after their willingness to resort to &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt; in times of hardship, the Bonechewers were known for ornamenting themselves with the broken bones and ruined organs of their enemies. They were well respected by the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and inspired fear and terror in all who beheld them in battle.\nThe majority of the clan appears to have been turned into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, including their chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt;. The only remnant of their clan that may have been spared this fate were those who were left behind on Azeroth to defend the Dark Portal under &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;; though it is unknown if any of these warriors survived.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, some of the orcs who migrated out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; settled in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan&lt;/a&gt;, later known as Hellfire Peninsula. Though there was no shortage of wild game, Tanaan was tremendously perilous, filled with &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, poisonous plants, and venomous animals. Furthermore, there were dark caves and hollows that seemed to vibrate with sinister, shadowy power. Sometimes the orcs who tapped into this essence found glory, but other times they found madness. Tanaan's orcs adopted a savage, superstitious mindset. Those who kept their sanity called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, while those who truly lost themselves to the dark impulses of the wilds were exiled and, over time, formed another, smaller clan known as the Bonechewers. The two clans were never allies, but were also rarely at war. The jungle was a dangerous enough enemy for both.\nRise of the Horde.\nThe Bonechewers were present at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as the enemies of the orcs. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Bonechewers were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to another. Later, the clan was present during the drinking of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde had conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused many orcs to grow more agitated and turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. Several clans, among them the Bonechewers, completely lost themselves to the depths of madness. To protect the rest of the Horde, Blackhand banished the violent clans from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the remote areas of Hellfire Peninsula in order to preserve some of the Horde's dwindling strength.\nWhen the Horde prepared to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand ordered the troublesome clans to remain on Draenor, since he believed that they would become liabilities if allowed to participate in the invasion. He knew that the clans would grow restless on Draenor, but a few months of waiting while hearing only stories of the lush new world and seeing only scraps of the war spoils would force them to be on their best behavior. If the clans were still uncontrollable, they could stay on Draenor and rot, for all Blackhand cared. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; sent messengers to Draenor to call up the remaining clans in order to replenish the Horde's numbers, but the messengers later returned to inform the Warchief that the clans on Draenor had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun fighting with one another, allowing only a few orcs and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s to bolster the Horde.\nOver time, the Bonechewers moved to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. The region was one of the last of Draenor still being lush and green. Ironically, the Bonechewers preserved Nagrand somewhat, for in their battle-craze they had not bothered much with &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, as such not spreading more of the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; taint that had already ruined &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nBy the time that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to create the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Bonechewers were led by &lt;a href=\"Hurkan%20Skullsplinter\"&gt;Hurkan Skullsplinter&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy. One day, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the clan into the fold. The Bonechewers were known to be frightening warriors; to the point that many clans did not attack them out of fear of reprisal. Preparing his warriors; Grommash managed to counter their bloodthirsty recklessness with strategy; allowing him to cut through their ranks to find their chieftain.\nGrommash and Hurkan spoke; even as the latter mockingly waved around the arm of a dead Warsong orc he'd slaughtered. Hurkan was reluctant, but willing, to rejoin the Horde; desiring new conquest and enemies for his warriors to fight. When all seemed well, however, Grommash revealed he had also come for the Skull; Skullsplinter's prized trophy. Explaining that the skull had been retrieved by a warlock, who was in turn slain by a warrior, who was in turn slain by Hurkan (though Skullsplinter speculates there may have been more to that chain); the skull was his most prized possession and would not part with it. Seeing that Hurkan would not be swayed, Grommash attacked and killed Hurkan in order to claim the Skull for the Horde before offering the rest of the clan a choice between joining the Horde or being destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; stepped up and became the new leader of the clan in service to the Horde.\nTagar and several of the finest warriors of the Bonechewers were present as a group led by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; attempted to sway &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; to return their forces, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, to the Horde; as well as the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s they commanded. Rend immediately rejected this, claiming that Ner'zhul had abandoned them while Rend and Maim had rallied what remained of the Horde; and that he was now warchief. After being rebuffed, Tagar threatened to slaughter the Blackhand brothers, though was talked down by Gorefiend who pointed out that they had many guards. While departing from &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the group ran into a human on the road. After charging to slaughter the human, Tagar was left stunned as the human not only was able to hold his warmaul back with one hand, but repel him afterwards. This human was revealed to be no human at all, but the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;; who sought an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly afterwards, Tagar was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Several Bonechewers were viciously slaughtered by the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Guardians\"&gt;Tomb Guardian&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nAfter successfully retrieving the Scepter, Tagar was told by Gorefiend to divide up some of his warriors to remain behind on Azeroth with Grommash to defend the Dark Portal. It is unknown if any of these warriors survived, but if they did, they were likely rounded up by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and sent into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s or escaped into the wild with Grom and the Warsong clan. Tagar himself is later seen on Outland in \"The Burning Crusade\", meaning that he must have returned to Draenor.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA large number of Bonechewers were transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, and to this day they can be found scavenging used equipment in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, presumably to gather war machine parts for their masters in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Although these scavengers are the lesser of the fel orc clans, their strength is the match of any green-skinned orc. Tagar Spinebreaker himself can be found wandering near the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; in particular are filled with Bonechewers. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers were tasked with killing Bonechewers and collecting their blood for &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Zelana\"&gt;Apothecary Zelana&lt;/a&gt; so that she could research the origin of the fel orc taint.\nDespite the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Horde to stop the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; in Hellfire, a number of Bonechewers escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20Ruins\"&gt;Bonechewer Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They wasted no time in constructing fortifications and repairing the buildings, day and night. These Bonechewers were allies of the &lt;a href=\"Firewing\"&gt;Firewing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and were tasked with keeping the Alliance and Horde forces occupied while the Firewing completed their &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lisaile%20Fireweaver\"&gt;Lisaile Fireweaver&lt;/a&gt; was employed as a contact between the fel orcs and the Firewing, and she gave orders to the fel orc leader.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowstalker%20Kaide\"&gt;Shadowstalker Kaide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theloria%20Shadecloak\"&gt;Theloria Shadecloak&lt;/a&gt; were dispatched by the Horde and Alliance, respectively, to end the threat. They could both have informed their superiors about the situation and received reinforcements, but Theloria thought that asking the &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; officers to dispatch members of their garrison in an attack on the orcs would leave the stronghold too vulnerable to attack, while Kaide didn't want the extra attention that would result from informing Thrallmar. Instead, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were employed with thinning the Bonechewer ranks and hampering the fel orcs' part in the mana bomb project.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Halls of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Illidari Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt; are home to a large number of Bonechewers, with the former also being the lair of &lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft II.\nManual.\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt;\nColor: Green\nThe ravaging, &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalistic&lt;/a&gt; warriors of the Bonechewer clan are well respected by the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Ornamenting themselves with the broken bones and ruined organs of their enemies, the Bonechewers inspire fear and terror in all who behold them in battle.\nCampaign.\n\"The following events were &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned by the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\":\"\nThe Bonechewers stayed in Draenor when the orcs first crossed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and were spared the defeat that ended the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was preparing the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to reopen the Dark Portal, the Bonechewers were attacked by his clan, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt;, because one of their captains possessed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy. Their camp was obliterated and the skull reclaimed. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; decided to attempt a foray into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt;, rising to the challenge and succeeding where their predecessors failed. Ner'zhul refused their suggestions and their clans were slaughtered. Despite the clan's destruction, orc forces with Bonechewer colors were seen assisting the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28WC2x%20Orc%29\"&gt;retrieval of the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being part of the Horde of Draenor's forces in the human campaign."}

There are &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; bonecrushers. \nIn the RPG.\nBone crushers are mostly &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who thrive on pain (their own and others) and focus on the purity of combat. Already confident in just how powerful they are, a bone crusher trains to become a living, unstoppable force. Bone crushers use their heads in combat, literally. No brains needed here. Indeed, some bone crushers claim that they enter an almost meditative state in combat, focused on the smooth motion of their muscles, the speed of their reflexes, noting (occasionally) the blades that bite their flesh, but feeling nothing from them.\nThey are roaring giants that wade through their enemies, their foes unable to stop them. They do not need weapons; their fists are enough. Arrows and blades bounce off their impervious hide, as they simply ignore any attack aimed at them. Each blow sends their opponents flying into the air. They are bone crushers.\nThe bone crusher's abilities are, like everything about them, obvious and blunt. Bone crushers are beasts in combat, the ultimate manifestation of strength and raw power. A bone crusher is most dangerous when he charges or overruns an opponent, trampling lesser creatures into the ground or slamming them so hard they are sent airborne. A bone crusher's punches may become strong enough to shatter stone and bones with equal ease. A bone crusher's hide toughens as he grows in strength, and his mind pushes away pain, until he is able to ignore many wounds. Many a foe has lost a battle with a bone crusher when she dealt the beast a blow that would have felled any other combatant, only to have the bone crusher shrug and strike at her once again.\nA bone crusher is easily recognizable, even from afar. The bone crusher's body is littered with scars from battle, and he remembers receiving few, if any, of them. He forsakes armor, relying on his own personal strength and toughness to carry him through battle. Few bone crushers bother with weapons, relying instead on their massive fists. The few who choose to wield weapons prefer massive, two-handed weapons, most often bludgeoning or cleaving weapons. Finesse is a foreign word to these behemoths.\nThe average bone crusher is not much of a conversationalist, either, and is quick to put up his fists in any argument. A bone crusher is more at home in a bawdy tavern prone to bar fights than quiet discussions in a library. Bone crushers are reckless and hard to control, and even harder to stop once they start moving. Bone crushers balk at rules, or literally anything that holds them back. \"Less talking, more smashing\" is a motto to bone crushers, one that most others learn quickly.\nAs a character grows into a bone crusher, he learns to shrug off previous concepts of strength, lifting objects that would balk others. A bone crusher learns how to use his fists in combat to deliver powerful, ringing blows. The bone crusher shrugs off wounds that would cripple other characters. Once a skilled bone crusher starts moving, he becomes almost impossible to stop. The highly skilled bone crusher becomes almost invincible in battle, able to fight far longer than seems possible.\nBone crushers in the world.\nMost bone crushers reside in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; respects raw strength, and most of the Horde's races show the raw power that a bone crusher needs. Two races are particularly likely to be bone crushers: &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Bone crushers appear often among &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and occasionally among half-&lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Strength is respected among the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, and becoming a bone crusher represents the trial to never give up, to never die. Like all &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, half-ogre bone crushers wander the forests of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to prove their strength against increasingly mightier challenges, proving to be the greatest creatures of the wild. Among &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, bone crushers are brutal shock troopers, whose battle lust exceeds their immense strength. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; are rarely bone crushers, but occasionally an exception emerges, becoming a front-line warrior.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races, only &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Furbolgs\"&gt;Furbolgs&lt;/a&gt; show the strength to become bone crushers. &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; bone crushers are rare, but some seek the path, seeing the life of a bone crushers as the ultimate challenge. Many &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; also view the challenges of becoming a bone crusher as a connection to their titan strength, unlocking further mysteries of the universe. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; bone crushers are guardians of their tribes and creatures bearing the strength of nature.\nAmong &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, bone crushers are seen as the living avatars of &lt;a href=\"Nath\"&gt;Nath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; war god. In a society that prizes strength above anything else, a bone crusher is as close to a god as an &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; can get. Once an &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; achieves the power of a bone crusher, he soon rises to great political power as well, ruling his own clan and leading them to greater glories in battle. Only the strongest may lead the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and no one is stronger than a bone crusher.\nOutside of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, bone crushers are most often viewed as brainless muscle-heads, creatures who think only with their fists. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; bone crushers do not receive nearly as much respect as &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; bone crushers do. A bone crusher prefers to answer conflict with a head-on charge, which disgusts more thought-minded races, most noticeably &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, even the wisest and calmest of races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; cannot deny the sheer power that a bone crusher possesses, and those few bone crushers allied with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are used as guided bombs. A commander simply points at a target, and watches the bone crusher run through all opposition and demolish the desired object. Crude, but effective.\nMost bone crushers are barbarians or &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and respect anyone else who shows great strength and martial prowess. As &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; cultures view bone crushers as spiritual champions, and as &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; keep bone crushers strong and healthy, bone crushers look favorably on &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s. They are especially proud of divine &lt;a href=\"casters\"&gt;casters&lt;/a&gt; choosing to enter close combat, such as &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt;s. Bone crushers despise &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s however. &lt;a href=\"Arcanist\"&gt;Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s are book-bound cowards who hide in the back of the lines and fling &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; instead of risking their hides, while &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s are craven backstabbers who never stick their necks out for anyone. The only magic a bone crusher respects are those spells that make him stronger, allowing him to cause even more destruction and chaos. While a bone crusher tends to respect the strength of a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, most bone crushers consider &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s pompous and melodramatic.\nAlthough not referred to in the &lt;a href=\"WoW%20RPG\"&gt;WoW RPG&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; also happen to choose this path as seen in artwork."}

The site has been sacred to the tauren ever since.\nThe Bones of the Earth Mother are enormous bone-white columns of rock which jut out from the earth. The columns stretch into the air and curve like giant ribs. All around the columns stretches a hundred feet of black soil that looks rich and loamy, though no plants grow in the area. The bones of the Earth Mother occupy a circular area with a 100-foot radius. The twelve stone columns range from 30 to 50 feet high and from 10 to 20 feet in diameter.\nThe tauren claim that the Earth Mother's bones will never sink or vanish again unless the destruction of the entire world is nigh. Tauren shaman believe that undergoing a vision quest among the Earth Mother's bones can lead to incredible self-knowledge and power, but those who do so and fail run the risk of madness or death."}

She is among the oldest mortal souls in the realm and is known as the foremost expert on forging weapons and armor.\nHeirmir serves as a quest giver in the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus%20storyline\"&gt;Maldraxxus storyline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt; and is available as a &lt;a href=\"soulbind\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; to players who join the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHeirmir crafted &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s sword &lt;a href=\"Fatebringer\"&gt;Fatebringer&lt;/a&gt; after he was named baron of the House of the Chosen.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; discovered an &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Blade\"&gt;unfinished blade&lt;/a&gt; and a message from the Primus in the standing stone at the center of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; sent the hero to ask for Heirmir's advice on what to do. Heirmir recognized the Primus' make and decided that regardless of the Primus' intentions, a blade without a hilt was useless. With hide scraps from the land itself as raw materials and the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;-infused bones of &lt;a href=\"Marrowjaw\"&gt;Marrowjaw&lt;/a&gt; as the hilt, Heirmir forged the blade into a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;proper runeblade&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walker held off the soul guardians that emerged from the weapon. As soon as the weapon was finished, Heirmir was knocked away by a blast of energy and concluded that the Maw Walker was the only one meant to wield it.\nHeirmir later joined Baroness Draka and the rest of the Maw Walker's allies in defending the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and the forces of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; until the Maw Walker could use the runeblade to open the way into the Seat, revealing a message from the Primus within. Heirmir could subsequently be seen tinkering with &lt;a href=\"Hipokos\"&gt;Hipokos&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Salvaged%20Praetor\"&gt;Salvaged Praetor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Sanctum\"&gt;Covenant Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; version of the Seat of the Primus, Heirmir can be found in the laboratory in the northwestern part of the fortress alongside her assistant &lt;a href=\"Enceladus\"&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt;. The Bonesmith and &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt; helped defend the Seat by equipping &lt;a href=\"Ragewing\"&gt;Ragewing&lt;/a&gt; with a few \"surprises\" (plague vials and runed spears) which necrolord Maw Walkers could throw at the traitorous necrolord forces besieging the Seat.\nHeirmir partook in the joint &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and necrolord assault on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;. She accompanied &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt;, where she tinkered with a broken kyrian &lt;a href=\"goliath\"&gt;goliath&lt;/a&gt;.\nChains of Domination.\nHeirmir was among the covenant forces whom Maw Walkers rallied to charge into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; after they established a portal link between it and &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Korthia's &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s, later enlisted the aid of Heirmir and a Maw Walker to help him open the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; and obtain its contents before &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; minions did. The Bonesmith only reluctantly agreed, since she didn't want to linger in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; longer than necessary. In order for the vault to open, it needed to be fed by two anima conduits. Heirmir repaired the first one in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Contemplation\"&gt;Caverns of Contemplation&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walker held the Mawsworn off her, including a caster called &lt;a href=\"Xalvez%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Xalvez the Collector&lt;/a&gt;. Tal-Galan subsequently managed to recreate a message from the Primus himself, which revealed that the Mawsworn's objective was a &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; that the Primus had entrusted to Korthia after he disappeared from Maldraxxus. Forgoing her earlier reluctance, Heirmir became determined to find her old master. The group followed the trail of anima to the other of the vault's conduits, which was stuck on a floating island near &lt;a href=\"Hope%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Hope's Ascent&lt;/a&gt;. The Bonesmith used local animal bones to create a hookshot and several grapple points to get across and repair the conduit while the Maw Walker defended her from &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe group then headed to the Vault of Secrets, where covenant forces were holding off the Mawsworn. After carving a path through the attackers and rescuing some more attendants, the trio entered the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Sigil\"&gt;Chamber of the Sigil&lt;/a&gt;. Tal-Galan wanted to recover a few of the vault's other treasures, but Heirmir convinced him to focus on the sigil. They were interrupted by the reappearance of Xalvez the Collector, but proceeded to defeat him and take the sigil\u2014which the Primus had bound with the &lt;a href=\"magic%20of%20memory\"&gt;magic of memory&lt;/a&gt;\u2014back to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; suggested taking the sigil to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned in the Jailer's tower of &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; to see if he could untangle it. Heirmir volunteered to come along to see if the Runecarver's work was \"up to par\". When the Maw Walker gave the sigil to the Runecarver in &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;his oubliette&lt;/a&gt;, it unexpectedly caused him to regain his true form, revealing him to be none other than the Primus. Heirmir was astonished that her master had been trapped in Torghast the whole time, while the Primus was furious that she and the hero had brought his sigil right to the Jailer's lair. Before they could argue further, the Jailer arrived with an army of Mawsworn. Yelling that she couldn't lose her master again after only just getting him back, Heirmir helped the Maw Walker hold off the Mawsworn. As the battle progressed, however, the Jailer stunned Heirmir and the hero and used his vessel &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; to seize the sigil before teleporting away. The Primus and his allies returned to Korthia to discuss their next move, with Heirmir subsequently setting up shop at Keeper's Respite.\nSoulbind traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; members can &lt;a href=\"soulbind\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; with Heirmir after completing &lt;a href=\"Forging%20A%20Friendship\"&gt;Forging A Friendship&lt;/a&gt;.\nVendor.\nAfter the player accepts the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Primus%20Returns\"&gt;The Primus Returns&lt;/a&gt;, Heirmir sets up shop at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, where she deals with &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Shards of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter one character on the player's account has unlocked this version of Heirmir, all of their alts will gain access to a Vision of Bonesmith Heirmir\u2014functionally identical to the real Bonesmith\u2014as soon as they complete the objectives of the earlier campaign quest &lt;a href=\"Charge%20of%20the%20Covenants\"&gt;Charge of the Covenants&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Last Sigil.\nIntroductory portion:\n&lt;a href=\"Hope%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Hope's Ascent&lt;/a&gt; portion:"}

It was formerly led by the legendary &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash \"Grom\" Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, and later by his headstrong son, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; form the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;'s assault against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nRoughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s began to migrate out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. The Warsong clan migrated far to the southwest, deep into &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;'s open prairies, where they constantly had to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s to maintain their presence in the region. Some generations of Warsongs thrived more than others. The clan had a taste for battle, but provoking the ogres too much could lead to disastrous consequences.\nRise of the Horde.\n11 years before the First War, the Warsong were led by a bold warrior named &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and engaged in constant battle with the ogres of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;. The Highmaul outnumbered the Warsongs, but Hellscream's highly mobile wolf riders used hit-and-run tactics to raid ogre settlements, eventually shattering Highmaul's hold on Nagrand and seizing much of it for themselves. They pushed the ogres back within the walls of their stronghold, and Grommash became a legend among the clans.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Warsongs were among the clans that would make up the Horde's main fighting force, leading direct assaults on &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; settlements and forming the backbone of the orcish army.\nLater, Blackhand tasked the Warsong and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans with toppling Highmaul. Grommash and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; both took part in the siege, and both relished the opportunity to slay ogres.\nAfter the Horde had conquered much of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the threat of starvation caused the orcs to hunt most of Draenor's native creatures to extinction. The Warsong raiders turned on their wolf mounts and used them as a source of food. The famine also caused many orcs to grow more agitated and turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. Several clans, among them the Warsongs, completely lost themselves to the depths of madness. To protect the rest of the Horde, Blackhand banished the violent clans from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the remote areas of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve some of the Horde's dwindling strength.\nWhen the Horde prepared to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand ordered the troublesome clans to remain on Draenor, since he believed that they would become liabilities if allowed to participate in the invasion. He knew that the clans would grow restless on Draenor, but a few months of waiting while hearing only stories of the lush new world and seeing only scraps of the war spoils would force them to be on their best behavior. If the clans were still uncontrollable, they could stay on Draenor and rot, for all Blackhand cared. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; sent messengers to Draenor to call up the remaining clans in order to replenish the Horde's numbers, but the messengers later returned to inform the Warchief that the clans on Draenor had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun fighting with one another, allowing only a few orcs and ogres to bolster the Horde.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nLife on Draenor was stark for Draenor's orcs, as the world continued to die and the orcs continued being consumed by bloodlust and violence. The Warsong and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; clans, in particular, had insatiable needs for violence. Following the Horde's defeat on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul rallied the clans still left on Draenor, the Warsongs among them, under his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;new banner&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of opening portals to new worlds for the Horde to conquer. The gathered chieftains easily agreed to Ner'zhul's plans; having sat out the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and Second Wars, they thirsted for battle, and any chance to escape their dying homeworld was worth taking. Almost immediately after Ner'zhul reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Grommash led the Warsong, Shattered Hand, &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; in an invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; led a group of orcs and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s away from the Blasted Lands in search of the artifacts that would allow Ner'zhul to open portals to new worlds. When Gorefiend prepared to return to Draenor with the artifacts, he left behind a large number of soldiers, mainly composed of Hellscream's Warsong orcs as well as the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, to defend the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal from a potential &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invasion. When the Alliance did launch their invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; smashed through Hellscream's warriors and forced them to scatter into the far corners of the Blasted Lands. Possession of the Dark Portal then switched sides on several occasions and the Warsong was forced to retreat to a neighboring valley for periods of time.\nWhen the news later came that Draenor had been &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by Ner'zhul's reckless magic, Grommash was devastated, for his only remaining family \u2014 his son, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had still been on Draenor. Grommash put aside his grief and led the Warsong clan north to take shelter in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. He was not giving up, merely regrouping. He believed that there would never be peace between orcs and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and he wanted his fighters to be ready for battle.\nRevitalization of the Horde.\nWhile many of the orcs were captured by the Alliance and placed in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s, Grommash and the Warsong managed to evade capture, traveling to the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being constantly hunted by humans, Hellscream held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. He and his devoted Warsong continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of the orcs, but they never found a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, a young orc raised in an internment camp, sought out Grom and was inspired by the chieftain's idealism. Together with the former &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall set about liberating the orcs from the internment camps and revitalizing the Horde. Encouraged by his best friend and mentor, Grom Hellscream, Thrall worked to ensure that his people would never be slaves again.\nThe Third War.\nOne day, Thrall was instructed by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to sail west away from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. While Thrall was assembling the orcish clans, Grommash and the Warsong were captured by the Alliance and placed in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, Thrall's forces freed the imprisoned Warsong and set sail across the ocean. However, during the voyage the Warsong were separated from the rest of the Horde, and there was no sign of Grommash's forces during the initial landfall on Kalimdor, though a party of Warsong warriors and several catapults managed to find Thrall's forces shortly thereafter. When the Warsong were finally found, they were in the process of battling the human forces under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s command. Grommash directly disobeyed Thrall's orders by continuing to attack the humans, leading the Warchief to instead send the Warsong north to construct a settlement while the main force journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt; in search of the mysterious Oracle.\nOnce in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Grommash and his Warsongs built &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;, and came under constant attack by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the forest and even the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, leading Grommash to drink from a pool cursed with the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the very same blood that had once made the Horde slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Grommash transformed into a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and urged his warriors to do the same, and with their newfound strength they managed to kill Cenarius. Shortly afterward, Mannoroth himself appeared to bring the orcs \"back into the fold\", despite Grommash's meek protests.\nMeanwhile, Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina Proudmoore found the Oracle, who was revealed to be Medivh. He told the gathered leaders that Grommash had fallen to demonic influence and that he and all of the orcs would soon be lost forever. With the aid of Cairne and Jaina, Thrall's forces managed to lay siege to the Warsong encampment and capture Grommash in a soul gem, allowing him to be purified of Mannoroth's influence by &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. Together, Thrall and Grommash proceeded to face and slay Mannoroth in &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;a nearby canyon&lt;/a&gt;, finally freeing the orcs from demonic influence, but Grom was killed in the battle. The Warsong chieftain was buried in the canyon, and &lt;a href=\"Monument%20to%20Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;a monument&lt;/a&gt; was erected in his honor.\nModern history.\nThe Warsong orcs who name themselves &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Outriders&lt;/a&gt; continue to fight against the night elven &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; of Ashenvale, intending to claim the lumber resources of the forest. From their &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Labor%20Camp\"&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;lumber camps&lt;/a&gt;, the main forces of the Warsong continue their logging operations, but in their warring zeal cutting even more wood than they can possibly use, leaving it to rot while their blades bite into fresh trees.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, son of Grommash, spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as Overlord of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt; from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Garrosh having been overthrown at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, it is unclear who currently leads the Warsong. &lt;a href=\"Gargok\"&gt;Gargok&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Warsong Outriders, is present in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; during the prestige ceremony in which &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; commends a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer for their battles against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the Warsong became shattered by what he had become. At an unknown point in time, &lt;a href=\"Gargok\"&gt;Gargok&lt;/a&gt; seeking to make his family whole again reached out and invited &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt; to join him in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. After Gorgonna arrive she eventually proved her strength to all of the clan through &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, and became the clan's new chieftain, where she vowed to never let them lose their honor again. Thus she, accompanied by other members of the clan, represented the Warsong at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Gorgonna declared that Lok-Tar Ogar defined the Warsong, how the clan valued skill on the battlefield above all, how the clan was well known for their fearsome battle cries. However, she further stated that, they have learned the lessons of the past, and that they would never again sacrifice honor to achieve victory, with the fall of Garrosh ensuring that.\nShould the champion request to join the Warsong, Gorgonna was glad to hear it. She subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Gorgonna accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of the clan.\nCulture.\nOn Draenor, the Warsong roamed the prairies of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; as nomads, rarely staying in the same place for more than a few months. The riders of the Warsong were always on the move. In camp, a family's tent was marked with a long pike thrust into the ground, often adorned with the skulls of defeated enemies and sometimes branded with the names of key battles. Among individual warriors, it was tradition to wear a necklace of bones of their first kill, inscribed with their personal runes.\nRelying on shock and awe to overwhelm their enemies, the Warsong earned their name from their fearsome battle cries and thunderous drum marches. Ripping into every combat crying epic battle-hymns of blood and death, they were the most distinguishable of the Draenor clans. Their tunes were less about the words than about the rhythms, the pulse-pounding beats that fired their blood and at the same time made their enemies quail. A is an arm-length piece of rigid wood affixed to the end of a long rope and spun over the wielder's head to generate a droning noise capable of traveling long distances. The bullroarers used by the Warsong were grooved to emit a high-pitched whistling noise rather than the low hum used by most other clans. Holes carved into Warsong weapons caused them to howl and wail when swung through the air. This is notably the case with &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, the famous axe of the &lt;a href=\"Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; family.\nTo earn the status of &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;wolfrider&lt;/a&gt;, a Warsong had to go through a series of arduous trials. To prove themself worthy of the wolf, the orc had to first test their strength and tenacity by gathering a heavy stone from a quarry and carry it on their back into the lands of their enemy. After cutting their way through the enemy's ranks, the orc was to place the stone in a place of prominence and set upon it a trophy of their foe in order to display their strength for all to see. Once the display of strength was completed, the orc had to head to the wolves' hunting grounds and subdue the largest member of the pack in the presence of the beast's kin. If they survived the ordeal, the wolf would answer to the orc as its new master. Finally, the Warsong believed that it was not enough for a wolf to regard an orc as its master; instead, to ready the beast for riding, its will had to be broken completely. Once the aspiring wolfrider had subdued their beast, they would mount it and ride it to the top of the tallest peak in Nagrand. If the wolf was willful, the orc would be thrown to their death on the mountain slopes, but if they survived, the will of their mount would have been successfully broken. Then, the orc could finally call themself \"Wolfrider\".\nIt is expected that members of the Warsong wear the bones of his or her first kill, and inscribe them with personal runes. Members of the Warsong long hunted the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Bull\"&gt;bloodhoof clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; to user their crimson-hued skin for battle standards.\nThe Warsong clan is renowned for their spicy dishes, apparently so hot you can't help but belt out a battlecry. One such recipe is &lt;a href=\"Spicy%20Seared%20Talbuk%20Steak\"&gt;Spicy Seared Talbuk Steak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; steak cooked with ground &lt;a href=\"Peppercorns\"&gt;Peppercorns&lt;/a&gt;, flaked sea salt and &lt;a href=\"Gor%27gor\"&gt;Gor'gor&lt;/a&gt; roots, which is usually served with mashed tubers and &lt;a href=\"roc\"&gt;roc&lt;/a&gt;-blood gravy.\nIn Warcraft II.\nLeader: &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\nColor: Red\nRipping into every combat crying epic battle-hymns of blood and death, the Warsong clan is the most distinguishable of the &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt;. Led by the ravenous Grom Hellscream, the Warsong clan awaits &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s order to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and bathe in the blood of their enemies.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Warsong banner, a violet banner, is worn only by the chief of the Warsong clan. It provides the wearer with great physical ability and inspires those around him. As a gift to the orcs who rescued them, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s recently improved its capabilities."}

In the midst of this, [[Eitrigg]] sought to travel to the [[Draenor (alternate universe)|alternate Draenor]] and call upon the debt the Mag'har owed to the Horde for liberating them from [[Garrosh Hellscream]]'s meddling and the [[Burning Legion]]'s corruption.\nAs the entire Lightbound army was marching towards the Mag'har, Grommash ordered for the Mag'har to follow Geya'rah and fallback to Azeroth.

After their arrival on Azeroth, Overlord Geya'rah took her place as leader of the Mag'har and pledged the loyalty of her people to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner]] and the [[Horde]].\nCulture.\n[[File:Warsong concept.jpg|thumb|A Warsong warrior and archer.]]\nReferences.\n[[Category:Warsong clan| ]]\n[[Category:Alternate universe organizations\u200e]]\n[[fr:Clan Chanteguerre]]\n[[pl:Warsong clan]]"}

He forged this pair of swords for the mightiest of his storm-forged &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, but Helya stole the swords and infused them with a portion of her rage.

They would make a worthy choice.\"\nArtifact lore.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; Odyn believed the natural creatures of this world were too weak, too soft, and too short-lived to be trusted. You have already shown him his folly, and none of us has any doubt that you will continue to do so. Now you will carry Odyn's prized weapons in defense of Azeroth. Go forth and forge your legacy.\" \nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; believed that the mortal races were too weak to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He instead decided to create an army of &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; champions, known as the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, to protect the world. For the foremost among his Valarjar he decided to craft a pair of magnificent blades. Odyn sought out the greatest of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; smiths and asked him to \"focus not only on mere defense, but also on the poetry of aggression.\" Taking the keeper's words to heart, the smith forged perhaps the greatest weapons ever craft by a vrykul. Odyn then blessed the swords, imbuing them with his own power. Odyn then hung the swords in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and told his Valarjar to prove themselves worthy of wielding them.\nThe first to prove himself worthy was a renowned vrykul warrior named &lt;a href=\"Ingvar\"&gt;Ingvar&lt;/a&gt;. While leading a raiding party, Ingvar found a cave full of creatures corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. Ingvar and his warriors died fighting, but they slaughtered every last creature before Ingvar drew his final breath. &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; brought Ingvar's spirit to the Halls of Valor, where Odyn declared him the greatest of his Valarjar and presented him with the blades.\nWhen Helya turned against Odyn, sealing the Halls of Valor within a separate plane, Ingvar was one of the few Valarjar outside of the halls. Without hesitation he struck back at Helya, knowing he was unlikely to win. Though he fought valiantly, he was ultimately struck down. Helya claimed his swords and kept them as a memento of her victory.\nHelya began turning the vrykul spirits in her care into the undead &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. In time, one of the kvaldir--a powerful warrior named &lt;a href=\"Vigfus%20Bladewind\"&gt;Vigfus Bladewind&lt;/a&gt;--rose to prominence among them. In a further mockery of Odyn, Helya gave his blades to Vigfus and formed the &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt;, tasking them with hunting down particularly powerful vrykul and taking their souls before Odyn could lay claim.\nFor thousands of years Vigfus and the Helarjar raided the most heroic of the vrykul. Helya even added some of her own power to Vigus's weapons, that they might more easily claim souls for her. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn took a new champion: a mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. Wishing this champion to wield the blades forged for this purpose, Odyn sent the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;Tideskorn Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; to kill Vigfus Bladewind and recover them. The two fought a great battle, but in the end it seemed Odyn's champion would emerge victorious. Vigfus called out to Helya for aid, and she poured yet more of her power into the swords, but it proved insufficient; Vigfus was slain, and his blades--now empowered by both Odyn and Helya--were once more in the hands of Odyn's chosen warrior.\nArtifact traits.\nBase.\nHidden trait: &lt;a href=\"Gaze%20of%20the%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Gaze of the Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was fairly simple-minded, concentrating primarily on his tribe's quest for superiority among centaurs, but he also had a soft spot for gadgets and gizmos, his favorite being the Target Dummies crafted by &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was located near the base of the mountain range closest to the Magram settlement to the east, coordinates (74,68). He has been missing since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, most likely having been killed by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that invaded the area.\nBackground.\nForces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the uprise in centaur activity encountered Warug, who told them of the origins of the centaur through the union of &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;. Warug also told them how Theradras had empowered the centaur because she feared the Horde would drive them to extinction. The Horde allied with Warug and his &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt;, who held no loyalty to Theradras, unlike the other clans, to suppress the other tribes. They then entered Maraudon and slew Theradras. Their victory halted the spreading corruption in Desolace and stopped the violent bloodlust in the centaur. With the Horde's blessing, Warug and his Magram clan became the leaders of the united centaur and led them to an age of tranquility. Yet none knew how long they would stay on the path of peace."}
