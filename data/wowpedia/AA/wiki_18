They are members of the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breaker&lt;/a&gt; faction, descendants of the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; and the ancient &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s and are themselves the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the former of which worshipped their massive progenitors as gods. However, the gronn show little love for their ogre offspring, ruling over the ogre clans of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; with an iron fist.\nAdolescent gronn are known as &lt;a href=\"gronnling\"&gt;gronnling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAs the stone giant &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; battled the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s, pieces of the battling leviathans fell to the earth and gave rise to new types of creatures. From Grond came the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, while from the Sporemounds many unique beings arose, the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; greatest among them. After Grond's death at the hands of the Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, the colossals continued their war against the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and Botaan's minions for thousands of years, but over the millennia these battles took their toll on the stone giants. Just as the colossals had risen from pieces of Grond, new creatures called the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the remains of fallen colossals. After the colossals sacrificed themselves to kill Botaan in a massive explosion, spores from the plant creature's body, teeming with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, drifted back to Draenor's surface and clung to the hides of the magnaron, weakening their bodies. Some of the magnaron devolved into half-flesh, half-stone giants known as gronn. Due to the lingering effect of the spores, a small number of gronn continued to degenerate into the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and in turn the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and finally the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe magnaron, gronn, and ogron were known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, and though different in many ways, their common ancestry united them against the plant-like &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of the Sporemounds. For many long ages, the two factions engaged in sporadic battles with one another, neither side ever managing to destroy the other.\nThe Gronnslayer.\nBy the time that the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; empire fell, the children of stone had grown in number and spread across the land. Small populations of gronn roamed the world. They lived in solitude, for no place on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; could sustain the hunting needs for multiple gronn at once. When they met, they often fought to the death over territory. The ogron, who feared their gronn ancestors and viewed them as gods, frequently offered up the sick, weak and elderly members of conquered ogre clans as living sacrifices to appease the gronn and keep them from attacking ogron territories.\nOne day, a group of arakkoa led by &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt; sought to claim a ruined Apexis settlement in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, a place now occupied by ogron. As they found it impossible to barter with the creatures, the arakkoa instead began teaching the ogron's ogre slaves the arts of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic in the hopes that they would rebel against their masters. One of the first to master this new power was named &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gog&lt;/a&gt;. He strode forth, empowered, but not to fight the ogron: instead, he targeted the gronn, whom all ogres revered and feared as deities. Though stunned, the arakkoa could not argue with the results. Gog did not only kill one gronn with his magic but several. By his fifth, stories of his deeds were known to all captive ogres on Draenor, erasing their fear of both gronn and ogron and leading to a bloody war in which nearly every ogron tribe fell to their ogre captives. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was born.\nRise of the Horde.\nThousands of years later, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched across Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; tasked the orcish &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt;s with wiping out Draenor's gronn, ogron, and magnaron, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Chieftain Fenris&lt;/a&gt; and his Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies.\nOne of the few gronn to escape the onslaught was named &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, who far surpassed the rest of his kind in brute strength and cunning. He lorded over a small number of ogres and gronn in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, and from his remote lair in the mountains he fended off multiple Thunderlord assaults. Casualties grew so great that Fenris eventually abandoned the attacks.\nThe Dragonkiller.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his minions swooped down on Gorgrond in search of a safe place to store his eggs. However, Gorgrond was still home to Gruul and the gronn who had survived Draenor's slow decay. The giants were highly territorial, but the calamities that had befallen Draenor caused them to join forces in order to survive. Gruul and his followers had no intention of allowing intruders to conquer their home and ferociously fought back against the dragons. Deathwing saw them as little more than pests and ignored them while the rest of his dragonflight fought the giants, but while the Aspect was distracted, the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Gorgrond in search of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces were deeply unsettled by the battles between the gronn and the dragons, for Gruul and his minions had taken to impaling their enemies' corpses on spikes. The gronn nearly attacked the Sons of Lothar, but &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; convinced them that the Alliance was also the enemy of the black dragonflight and managed to strike a bargain with Gruul: he would give them safe passage through Gorgrond, and they would help him defeat Deathwing. The gronn and the Alliance prepared an ambush at the largest cache of Deathwing's eggs, and the Sons of Lothar destroyed as many of the eggs as they could. When Deathwing and his followers appeared, Gruul scaled Gorgrond's mountains to battle the Dragon Aspect with his bare fists. Meanwhile, Khadgar used his magic to rip apart the metal plates bolted to the Aspect's spine, causing him so much pain that he dropped the Skull of Gul'dan and was forced to immediately flee back to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. As the gronn and the dragons continued to fight each other, Khadgar and the Sons of Lothar collected the Skull of Gul'dan and hastily retreated from Gorgrond, fearing that Gruul would turn on them after the dragons were defeated. When the fighting in Gorgrond was done, Gruul reasserted his dominion over the land, and his battle with Deathwing would cause him to be known as the Dragonkiller.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nToday Gruul the Dragonkiller is worshipped as a deity by the ogres of Blade's Edge Mountains, the twisted remnants of Gorgrond after Draenor was shattered into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. His powerful sons ravage both the spires of their home and the plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Gruul's unparalleled strength and experience in battle would pose a serious threat if he ever chose to attack &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in Outland.\nAzeroth.\nSome gronn have since been brought to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skullcrusher%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Skullcrusher the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Chosen of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;\" served the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Gronn%20Brute\"&gt;Enslaved Gronn Brute&lt;/a&gt;s served the Twilight forces in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, the then-Warchief of the Horde &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; captured a &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; gronn named &lt;a href=\"Oggax\"&gt;Oggax&lt;/a&gt; and brought him to the &lt;a href=\"Brawl%27gar%20Arena\"&gt;Brawl'gar Arena&lt;/a&gt; in order to test the fighting prowess of the recently arrived &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn , the gronn have largely been enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; knew that the surest path to breaking the gronn lay in subjugating their great father, , who has been put to haul pallets of fuel to the furnace in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, one of his hands being replaced with a hook as a mockery of the 's warrior traditions. , Warchief of the Iron Horde, found a way to weaponize the gronn, strapping great cannons to their backs using harnesses engineered in such a way that the gronn hardly notices the weight and can fire the cannons at will. In &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs began capturing the gronn of &lt;a href=\"Daggermaw%20Ravine\"&gt;Daggermaw Ravine&lt;/a&gt; for the Iron Horde, while in , ogres of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; began enslaving gronn with pernicious magic, almost doubling the size of their army.\nA number of \"wild\" gronn still remain in the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where they fight alongside the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; in their eternal war with the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;. In Gorgrond, the resurrected several ancient gronn alongside &lt;a href=\"Gorgorek\"&gt;Gorgorek&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; alpha.\nDescription and culture.\nGronn are half-flesh, half-stone giants. During the early days of Draenor, these massive predators stalked the edges of the wilds, terrorizing lesser life-forms and devouring anything they could find. Though only moderately intelligent, gronn are exceptional hunters, using the jagged spikes protruding from their skin as weapons to kill their prey while their rocky plates function as armor to protect them from other dangerous creatures. Gronn are normally highly territorial and are not prone to living in close proximity with one another, though the gronn who served under &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt; joined forces in order to survive as a result of the calamities that befell Draenor.\nDescribed as monstrous, cyclopean and as \"terror incarnate\", the gronn show little love for their ogre offspring, lording over the ogre clans with an iron fist. Though they are not famed for their intelligence, it is undeniable that the gronn wield devastating power. The &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt;s are the only ogres known to retain some of the physical traits of their gronn progenitors, such as the bony, calcified protrusions on their head and back, as well as a portion of the gronn's immense size and strength.\nGronn blood is black in color."}

He declared war upon the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; but was eventually slain by the arakkoan king, &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\n600 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the saberon tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; delighted in preying upon the flightless &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; of arakkoan society. However, the Bloodmane tribe and its mighty young leader, Karash, grew bored with hunting the birdmen that were confined to the ground and instead made it a sport to bring down the arakkoa who could still fly. Karash trained his followers in the use of nets, ropes and harpoons and commanded his hunters to bring him ten thousand arakkoa feathers. The Bloodmane initially targeted scouts to hone their abilities without alerting the other arakkoa, but once he was confident in his tribe's abilities, Karash declared war upon the high arakkoa. Bloodmane fighters began ambushing and slaughtering large groups of the winged creatures and laid siege to the spires themselves.\nThe arakkoa were thrown into disarray, for they had believed themselves to be immune to threats from \"lower\" creatures, and the Anhari priests struggled to find an explanation for why their beloved goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly forsaken them. &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, Talon King of the high arakkoa, decided to take drastic action, launching raids on Bloodmane encampments by himself. He single-handedly turned the tide of the war, inspiring other arakkoa fighters to follow him against suicidal odds. After months of whittling away the Bloodmane, Terokk cornered Pridelord Karash and effortlessly slew him, ending the source of the saberon's tactical brilliance and winning the war. Satisifed that his message was clear, the Talon King left the Bloodmane to pick up the pieces of their broken tribe.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nKarash is encountered during a flashback in &lt;a href=\"The%20Talon%20King\"&gt;The Talon King&lt;/a&gt;, during which the player controls Terokk in his historical fight against the saberon.\nObjective of.\nHe needs to be killed during the flashback in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Talon%20King\"&gt;The Talon King&lt;/a&gt;."}

Priests use powerful healing magic to fortify themselves and their allies. They also wield powerful offensive spells from a distance, but can be overwhelmed by enemies due to their physical frailty and minimal armor. Experienced priests carefully balance the use of their offensive powers when tasked with keeping their party alive. Faith is the greatest strength of a priest and their toughest shield.\nWhile they have a variety of protective and enhancement spells to bolster his allies, the priests can also wreak terrible vengeance on their enemies, using the grand powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; to smite and purge them or the devastating powers of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; to decimate their minds. They can utilize their holy powers to restore their health and that of their comrades. By calling on mystic shielding and holy empowerment, priests can prevent incoming damage and improve their defenses and those of their allies. Priestly Shadow magic can deliver great amounts of immediate damage, or wracking pains that punish foes over longer periods of time. Their connection with the minds and spirits of living beings allows them to control and manipulate others. The priest is a diverse and powerful class, highly desirable in any group and capable of fulfilling multiple roles.\nPriest talents can strengthen their ability to heal the wounded, endanger their foes with the power of Shadow, or empower themselves and others with protective prayers.\nClass overview.\n\"Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. These masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest's command can also be turned against foes, smiting them with holy fury.\"\n\"As light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"After the lands of Lordaeron were corrupted by the undead Scourge, the surviving clerics escaped to Stormwind and attempted to salvage their holy order: combining their forces with those of the clerics of Northshire, the weathered healers founded a new priesthood to guide their people in trouble times. Obsessed with the notion that evil lurked within every mortal creature they set forth to purge men's' souls of corruption and darkness. Using strong mind powers and potent fear effects, these new priests were able to reestablish a strong hold over humanity's spiritual destiny. Though they are still able to heal wounds and cure the sick, priests are much more interested in dominating the weak and wretched in order to save them from themselves.\"\n\"Priests guide the spiritual destiny of their people. Through their unique insight into the mind, they are able to shape an individual's beliefs, whether to inspire or terrify, soothe or dominate, heal or harm. Just as the heart can hold both darkness and light, priests wield powers of creation and devastation by channeling the potent forces underlying faith.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Walking the line between Shadow and Light, Priests heal allies with powerful holy magic and sling sinister spells in tandem.\"\nBackground.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were the first known physical race to be associated with the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s were the first to discover the Holy Light on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and were responsible for passing on the religion to other races, most notably the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Humans built mighty &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es and cathedrals as places of worship and teaching of the Light. The &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; teaches its followers to be virtuous in life, and while the religion is more philosophical than theistic, its practitioners do believe their devotion connects them to a greater and mysterious force in the universe. Humans have produced great priests who have healed their allies or have used the powers of the Light to purge their enemies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; were human priests who served the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s served as healers on the battlefield, but were ill-prepared for the hazards of combat, and thus suffered heavy casualties. This order was largely destroyed, and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; saw fragile priests replaced on the battlefield by armored &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 established by the Church's leader Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nDespite the high elves' official departure from the Alliance, some elves still remained true to their former human and dwarven allies. The altruistic priests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; refused to abandon their roles as healers and agreed to remain in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; despite the edicts from their reclusive masters in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. The high elven priests used their Light-given powers to heal the wounded and bolster the spirits of Lordaeron's fighting elite.\n&lt;a href=\"Heretics\"&gt;Fallen Priests&lt;/a&gt; are wretched priests who were once counted as the most devout amongst the clergy of Lordaeron. But, after years of constant war and suffering, they have lost their sense of the Holy Light. Now, they exist only to spread their frustration and negativity to their fellow men and women.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; priests turned away from the Light and formed the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of the Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; based on the teachings of bishop &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt;. Though they turn to &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark energies&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish their goals, they believe there must be a balance between Light and darkness and members of the cult must know the Light as well.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; society saw the appearance of priests led by &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; and known as the &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt;, using the power of &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun god, in their spells like the tauren &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s named the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;. This is similar to how night elven priests use the power of the moon through their goddess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, instead of through the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. There have been tauren seers before, but their path has now either been enhanced with new magic or revitalized by new blood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s had an interest in the Light since they joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but they were so focused on technology and later the retaking of Gnomeregan that studying the Light didn't feel necessary to them. The dwarven priests and paladins of Ironforge served as the only connection to the Light they had. Now that the gnomes have reclaimed a foothold in Gnomeregan and begun rebuilding their culture outside of Ironforge however, they've recognized the importance of having followers of the Light in their own ranks. In addition, researching new methods of purifying irradiated gnomes has led to radical advances in Light-based technology. Gnome priests usually refer to themselves as doctors, medics, and surgeons.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the priests of Azeroth united against the Legion as the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;. In order to fight the demons, they obtained the legendary artifacts known as &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;. They also used the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters.\nAbilities.\nPriests bring a wide range of abilities to any party. Depending on their spec, priests may specialize in healing and protecting their allies, or dealing powerful shadow damage to their enemies. However, a priest's capabilities extend far beyond these roles. Priests can buff their allies' stamina, ward against fear, restore mana to their party, and even &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt; magical debuffs and diseases from their allies. They can terrify, silence and horrify enemies, and remove some of their most powerful buffs and immunities. They can defer aggro, grant substantial speed buffs to their allies and even pull heedless teammates out of the fire. Priests' innate power in manipulating others can allow them to see through the eyes of a distant target, or even dominate an opponent's mind, turning a foe into a friend, or sending them to their death at the bottom of a precipice.\nHealing.\nPriests have a range of healing abilities. Discipline and Holy priests are natural masters of healing and protection, and have additional capabilities in these areas, with spells ranging from direct heals and &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; effects to AoE abilities and on-damage procs. &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt; also allows Discipline priests to heal by dealing damage. While Shadow priests excel at wreaking havoc, they can still can contribute passive healing to their group through &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nDamage mitigation.\nAs well as an array of healing options, priests can choose to shield their allies from damage. This pre-emptive approach to damage prevention allows for rapid and lifesaving intervention, but can require skill to correctly anticipate incoming damage. is the priest's signature shield, absorbing attacks directed at the target and preventing &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt;. While all priests are capable of shielding themselves and their allies, Discipline priests are the masters of damage absorption, being able to shield multiple allies at the same time with &lt;a href=\"Rapture\"&gt;Rapture&lt;/a&gt;. Discipline priests can also protect their allies with . Each spec also has a powerful damage-reduction cooldown, from the direct avoidance of &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dispersion\"&gt;Dispersion&lt;/a&gt; to the self-sacrifing grace of &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardian Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.\nDamage dealing.\nPriests have access to two schools of magic - Holy and Shadow - and can deal substantial amounts of damage from either. Priests have a number of direct damage options, as well as a few DoTs and specialties. Shadow priests are without doubt the most damage-oriented of priests, but Discipline priests with &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt; come a respectable second. Even healing priests can contribute some damage by summoning their temporary pet - the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfiend\"&gt;Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mindbender\"&gt;Mindbender&lt;/a&gt; - to attack enemies.\nUtility.\nAs well as their obvious capabilities in healing and dealing damage, priests also have access to a range of utility spells, many of which are unique to the priest class. Abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Vision\"&gt;Mind Vision&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; can make the priest class fun to play, but are also capable of providing game-changing advantages if used correctly. Priests can also evade aggro with &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;. Priests can also cast &lt;a href=\"Leap%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Leap of Faith&lt;/a&gt; to pull other players to the priest and possibly save them from death.\nDispels.\nPriests are significantly capable dispellers. They can strip magical buffs and even immunities from their enemies with &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt;, while Discipline and Holy priests can also &lt;a href=\"Purify\"&gt;Purify&lt;/a&gt; their allies of magic and disease effects. Discipline and Holy priests can generally consider dispelling to be their most important duty after healing, while Shadow priests are also capable of contributing if necessary.\nCrowd control and mobility.\nPriests have a range of abilities to aid in escaping and incapacitating their attackers. &lt;a href=\"Body%20and%20Soul\"&gt;Body and Soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angelic%20Feather\"&gt;Angelic Feather&lt;/a&gt; provide speed boosts for the priest or their allies, while &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt; provides excellent &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, Shadow priests' &lt;a href=\"Dispersion\"&gt;Dispersion&lt;/a&gt; can be used to slip out of roots and snares.\nShadow priests have the most crowd control abilities, with &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; providing a 50% snare. Priests can also offer sustainable crowd control on undead targets with &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt;, while Holy priests can disorientate and interrupt opponents with . Priests can also take control of other players or creatures temporarily by using &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaces.\nPriests start with the following attributes:\nSpecializations.\nThere are three priest &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s: Discipline, Holy and Shadow. Discipline and Holy priests are powerful &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt;, with the former specializing in healing through damage-dealing (with a side-line in damage mitigation), and the latter excelling in sheer healing power, as well as a versatile range of healing options. Shadow priests are ranged &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; that assault their opponents' minds with shadowy magic, specializing in sinister &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; effects and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;. While all priests can use &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and the potent &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt;, Discipline and Holy priests are especially capable dispellers, with &lt;a href=\"Purify\"&gt;Purify&lt;/a&gt; allowing them to instantly cleanse an ally of all diseases and magical afflictions.\nDiscipline.\n Uses magic to shield allies from taking damage as well as heal their wounds.\nDiscipline priests are a powerful force on the battlefield, balancing the powers of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; to assail enemies and assist allies in equal measure. While capable of reactive healing, Discipline priests truly come into their own when able to proactively bless their allies with &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt; via , &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Mend\"&gt;Shadow Mend&lt;/a&gt;, or in anticipation of incoming damage. With their allies touched by the Light, a well-prepared Discipline priest is free to visit the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath%20%28priest%20ability%29\"&gt;Light's Wrath (priest ability)&lt;/a&gt; on their unfortunate enemies, using spells such as &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penance\"&gt;Penance&lt;/a&gt; to simultaneously damage foes and unleash powerful burst healing.\nThe combination of strong cooldowns and a focus on preemptive healing makes Discipline priests the preferred healing option for PvP. Their can be improved in multiple ways, becoming an efficient and powerful protection option, and Discipline's ability to damage and heal on the move is a powerful asset. Discipline priests anticipating incoming damage can stack protection with &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to protect their allies even when incapacitated, and their ability to utilize two different schools of healing magic sets them apart from other healers by allowing them to retain some casting ability even when interrupted.\n\"Some priests pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one's ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies\u2014always exercising immense discipline to keep themselves away from the brink of insanity. Many would say the ends justify the means; scriptures both virtuous and vile should be studied and understood to protect the congregation.\"\nHoly.\n A versatile healer who can reverse damage on individuals or groups and even heal from beyond the grave.\nHoly priests are versatile healers who possess a variety of tools to support their group. In contrast to Discipline, the Holy specialization focuses primarily on reactive healing. Holy priests supplement their powerful direct healing with &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; effects such as &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt;, , which attaches a powerful heal over time effect to the priest's initial heal. They also have access to impressive group effect healing such as &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt;, a preemptive healing spell that bounces between allies.\nHoly priests also have access to several powerful abilities with long cooldowns, including the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Word\"&gt;Holy Word&lt;/a&gt; abilities: , a powerful ground-targeted heal; , a truly massive single-target heal; and , a single-target nuke and crowd-control spell. Even death itself proves to be no match for the healing prowess of the Light, allowing Holy priests to save an ally from certain demise by invoking a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardian Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to protect them, or even heal from beyond the grave as a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Redemption\"&gt;Spirit of Redemption&lt;/a&gt; - for a time.\n\"After spending much of their lives in temples studying ancient doctrine, preaching the tenets of their faith, and pledging their full devotion to the divine powers they follow, the most adept priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds. And while most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice. They're also morally opposed to the use of Shadow and Void magic\u2014rather, they are exemplars of the incredible grace and power of the divine and the Light, and even death cannot fully stop their healing capabilities.\"\nShadow.\n Uses sinister Shadow magic and terrifying Void magic to eradicate enemies.\nShadow priests are born damage-dealers, instantly recognizable by their signature &lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt; - a distinctive aura that increases shadow damage. They tend to focus on afflicting multiple targets with potent &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; effects, such as and &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt;, as well as unleashing psychic agony on a single target with their &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Sear\"&gt;Mind Sear&lt;/a&gt; spells. Drawing on their dark powers causes Shadow priests to accumulate &lt;a href=\"Insanity\"&gt;Insanity&lt;/a&gt; and this, in turn, fuels potent spells such as &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Plague\"&gt;Devouring Plague&lt;/a&gt;, a grim mockery of the priestly ability to &lt;a href=\"Purify%20Disease\"&gt;Purify Disease&lt;/a&gt;. The height of a shadow priest's power is heralded by a massive &lt;a href=\"Void%20Eruption\"&gt;Void Eruption&lt;/a&gt; that twists their &lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Voidform\"&gt;Voidform&lt;/a&gt;, which further increases their spell damage, grants Mind Blast additional charges, and enables the use of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Void%20Bolt\"&gt;Void Bolt&lt;/a&gt; spell. Shadow priests can even call down beings from the Void itself, conjuring a &lt;a href=\"Shadowfiend\"&gt;Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mindbender\"&gt;Mindbender&lt;/a&gt; to assail their enemies.\nShadow priests also excel at &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, capable of using a &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt; to fear enemies, weaponizing the minds of their enemies with a &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Bomb\"&gt;Mind Bomb&lt;/a&gt; to stun them, or &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silencing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupting&lt;/a&gt; casters with the aptly named &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;. In the hands of a skilled Shadow priest, these abilities can be utilized to provide windows of opportunity that can prove fatal to even the most battle-hardened healer. Shadow priests also have a powerful survival ability in &lt;a href=\"Dispersion\"&gt;Dispersion&lt;/a&gt;, and can convert their damage into healing for their allies through &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large percentage of a Shadow priest's damage comes from damage over time effects, allowing them to deal damage simultaneously to multiple targets and to continue dealing damage even while the priest is incapacitated or hidden out of &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;. This tactic, known as multi-dotting, allows them to excel at &lt;a href=\"add%20fight\"&gt;add fights&lt;/a&gt;. While dedicated damage dealers, when need be, Shadow priests are also decent emergency healers; an attentive Shadow priest can potentially turn a disastrous wipe into an unexpected victory with a well-placed &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Mend\"&gt;Shadow Mend&lt;/a&gt; or .\n\"The Light in which many priests bathe is brilliant and effervescent, granting them immense divine power. But the brightest light casts the darkest shadow\u2014and from within this blackness, a rival power dwells. Shadow priests fully embrace this opposing polarity, their faith equally resolute as their holy counterparts\u2014but focused on shadowy magics and mental manipulation. Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship\u2014but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods. To truly understand such ancient, corruptive influence is to be driven mad. This is the state in which these dark priests thrive, embracing insanity and feeding off of the minds of their opponents to reach terrifying new limits.\"\nIn the RPG.\nThe priest &lt;a href=\"prestige%20class\"&gt;prestige class&lt;/a&gt; was eliminated from the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" and replaced with the priest &lt;a href=\"core%20class\"&gt;core class&lt;/a&gt;.\nPriests practice a complex, organized form of spirituality built around moral philosophy, the worship of a particular deity (such as &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;) in some cases, and/or idol worship, rather than around the reverence of the elements that shamans practice, or the close divine connection with animals and the wilderness that druids maintain. Priests serve not only as influential religious figures in their respective societies, but also as powerful practitioners of divine magic, which they use to heal and protect, or harm and weaken.\nDevotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many priests to the paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the Light of faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at work beyond the comprehension of the peoples who walk the land. Powerful &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s with an intimate connection to the divine, priests are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire need.\nPriests comprise quite a varied group in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. A female priest is called a \"priestess\". Many are followers, in some manner, of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Some priests choose to be &lt;a href=\"pyremaster\"&gt;pyremaster&lt;/a&gt;s or High Priest. There are also racial restrictions to some titles, such as &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; for trolls and &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; for night elf females.\nThere are also shadow priests among the trolls, they find Forsaken to be kindred spirits, supporting them because they are evil. There are also shadow priests that follow Kil'jaeden.\nEpic priest.\nThe epic priest is a paragon of his ideals, a vessel which his faith pools and spreads like wine overflowing from a chalice. He bolsters his allies to amazing heights and brings non-believers low with divine wrath. Where he walks, all feel his presence. He focuses on increasing his spellcasting potential. He knows that metamagic feats can make even low-level spells potent. Wisdom is, of course, his paramount ability. If he must improve himself, he improves his constitution. Constitution improves his staying power and charisma increases his turning capability."}

As of patch 10.0 (Dragonflight), every playable race, with the notable exception of the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, may follow the path of the priest.\nAlliance.\nThe majority of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; follow the &lt;a href=\"The%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;The Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who follow their own &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;unique religion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman priests.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were the first known physical race to be associated with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s were the first to discover it on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and were responsible for passing their religion on to other races, most notably the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The humans founded the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that has built mighty &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es and blessed cathedrals as places of worship and teaching of its faith. Their religion teaches its followers to be virtuous in life, and while it is more philosophical than theistic, its practitioners do believe their devotion connects them to a greater and mysterious force in the universe. Humans have produced great priests who have called on the powers of the Light to either heal their allies or purge their enemies - the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; served on the battlefield as healers during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Following heavy casualties, the most virtuous of the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were magically empowered by the clergy with holy powers, ordained as &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. The priesthood preaches against the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were once strongly perceived to be creatures of. In times of darkness and suffering, some human priests &lt;a href=\"Heretics\"&gt;lose their faith&lt;/a&gt;, and spread their frustration and negativity to their fellows.\nRather than the Light, the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; revere the sea and their priests are known as &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. They look to their patron goddess, the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;, to bless the ships of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, guide them out of storms, mend their wounds, and lay the spirits of their dead to rest. However, some tidesages gaze too far into the ocean's depths and fall to the whispers of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted this way, the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; overthrew him. Pike seems to have become the de facto leader of the tidesages once Kul Tiras formally joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenei priests.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; priests, like the natives of Azeroth, practice &lt;a href=\"The%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;The Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;; however the draenei were introduced to the religion by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, who with their Light-given powers, allowed the draenei to traverse &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;The Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; in search of a safe refuge from &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;The Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion's leaders, &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;the eredar&lt;/a&gt;, sought to destroy the draenei as they viewed them as traitors, and the naaru are eternal enemies of the Legion. Draenei priests are deeply pious, as draenei owe their race's survival to \"The Light\".\nDraenei priests became a character option in \"\" .\n&lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt;, a race empowered by the Light, can naturally be priests.\nDwarf priests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; adopted &lt;a href=\"The%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;The Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; from their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; comrades, and most dwarven priests are members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the discovery of evidence linking dwarves to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, many dwarven priests are also scholars and historians.\nWhile a temptation to worship their &lt;a href=\"titans\"&gt;potential creators&lt;/a&gt; might exist for some Dwarves (see &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Mystery of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;), it appears Dwarves wish to keep religious beliefs separate from historical studies, and maintain the Holy Light as the major religion amongst their society.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have long had priests within their ranks, revering the Light and the Void alike.\nNight elf priests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; priesthood is the only major priesthood in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to not follow the Light, as the night elves have been practicing their own religion since long before their contact with the races of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently, like the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;the priesthood&lt;/a&gt; was a strictly female order, that worshiped the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves believe that she is the protector of all living things and helps living things grow and avoid conflict, and has helped their race thrive, grow and survive.\nThough the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; are still the highest religious order, male priests are now trained. In both genders, the priesthood (including player characters) appears to worship Elune exclusively.\nGnome priests.\nWith the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Gnome healers are finally playable. Gnome priest &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s (such as the &lt;a href=\"Holdout%20Medic\"&gt;Holdout Medic&lt;/a&gt;s in Gnomeregan and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Fleet%20Medic\"&gt;North Fleet Medic&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;) have existed in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for some time, but the destruction brought on by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; will most likely inspire many more Gnomes to turn to their allies and adopt devotion to &lt;a href=\"The%20Light\"&gt;The Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotably, following the examples prior to Cataclysm, gnome priests seem to focus heavily on the divine's ability of healing, though more with the intention of practicing medicine rather than sorcery. Their usage of it is actually very similar to &lt;a href=\"first%20aid\"&gt;first aid&lt;/a&gt;, as such most gnome priests refer to themselves as doctors and surgeons, though this not always true as &lt;a href=\"High%20Cleric%20Alphus\"&gt;High Cleric Alphus&lt;/a&gt; shows. As a result, although not confirmed, it is likely that they pay less attention to a priest's capability to control darker powers.\n&lt;a href=\"Mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; train priests as well, though their faith is not documented yet.\nWorgen priests.\nWorgen are naturally drawn to and revere the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, who in a way, is the progenitor of their race. Some worgen, having had a natural connection to nature, have also taken up &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, those whose minds have been brought back from feralcy will continue to revere the same concepts they did prior to their turning into a worgen (such as the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom still believe in the Light). It is seen though that some of those who have been turned also embrace and revere the nature related spirits that resulted in the worgen concurrently with their former beliefs.\nHorde.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; priests follow various spiritualities, with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s following the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; as members of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of the Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; calling upon different energies - even demonic ones.\nTroll priests.\nMost Priests throughout the various &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; societies of Azeroth, including the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, follow an ancient tribal religion known as &lt;a href=\"Voodoo\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, which worships and invokes powerful spirits which the trolls refer to as &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;. After a battle, the priests often decapitate foes and shrink their heads, so that the spirit of the foe will not escape. They practice voodoo magic and are highly feared for their shadowy tricks. Some trolls are followers of the Blood God &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, a tradition that has existed for generations, born in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroll priests are often selected to be the spiritual adviser (or &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;) of their local tribe, due to their ability to communicate with spirits and their respect for the old ways.\nBlood elf priests.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elves&lt;/a&gt; follow, or at least did when they were &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; just like humans and dwarves. Unlike the two others however, who derive their power from faith alone, &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; and blood elf priests seem to derive theirs from other sources. The first of these was the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, brought to end by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; when it was used to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"Kel%27thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining elves (most of them now calling themselves blood elves), addicted to magic, desperately sought a new source of of their hunger. They found it in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; magic, which implies that the blood elves' actions have not been true to the virtues of The Light, and that their behaviors and attitudes contradict its teachings.\nThe blood elves found yet another source when their leader &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The being was shipped back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; where its Light-powers was siphoned by the elves, creating the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. As such, blood elf priests were \"directly\" defying The Light, \"taking\" it instead of being granted to wield its powers. M'uru was however later kidnapped again, and the Sunwell has been restored. Blood elf priests are thus likely once more deriving their powers from their original source.\nBlood elf priests became a character option in \"\" .\nForsaken priests.\nThe Forsaken are known to be &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s and dark clerics of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren priests.\nWith the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to become priests. It is possible that they use the light of the Sun in their spells just like Tauren &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s do, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. If this is the case, it would similar to how the Night Elf priests use the power of the Moon, their goddess Elune, instead of the Holy Light. &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; became a priest trainer for the tauren. It is possible that he founded the group of tauren priests due to his conversation with &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt;, the first Tauren paladin, before Cataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; train priests of their own, although it is unknown whether they revere the same deities as their Kalimdor counterparts.\nGoblin priests.\nGoblins use willpower to wield the Light, driven by greed.\nOrc priests.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the prime timeline have not been observed being priests, the of the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; have. Due to forcing the Shadowmoon to either join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; or die, broke his people's ancient traditions and used the &lt;a href=\"K%27ara%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Dark Star&lt;/a&gt; to give his clan the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Those who use the power of the Void in this way are called \"Voidseers.\" \nMeanwhile, the only orcs seen wielding the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; have been under the thrall of the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome orcish priests within the Horde adhere to the path of the &lt;a href=\"Lok%27osh\"&gt;Lok'osh&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightborne priests.\nFor healing, the nightborne usually use chronomancy to rewind &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, reversing the wounds rather than healing them in the traditional manner. However, there are some nightborne who are capable of casting holy spells. &lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20Citizen\"&gt;Nighthold citizens&lt;/a&gt; can be seen kneeling before a statue of a nightborne priestess wielding a staff with the symbol of a half-moon. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth&lt;/a&gt; gifts the player character an idol with the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. This may indicate that some nightborne continue their worship of Elune to this day.\nVulpera priests.\nWhile no &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; has been seen practicing priesthood, since they share their land with the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping Zandalari and &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;, it can be inferred that they too worship the loa.\nZandalari priests.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; split off from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, other &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; came to regard the Zandalar tribe as an overarching priest caste for all trolls. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; are even closer to their loa than the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;, as they are able to speak- and make bargains with their loa in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. The priests of these loa thus hold a high position of power in Zandalari society. They are also sometimes known as &lt;a href=\"confessor\"&gt;confessor&lt;/a&gt;s, judges who keep the soul of the Zandalari safe and pure. While all loa seem to have priests among their worshippers, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt; is instead counted as a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, as the Loa of Shapes allows his servants to shapeshift into different forms.\nAlliance and Horde.\nPandaren priests.\n&lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; priests, what they believe in and from where they draw their powers have not yet been addressed by canon sources. However, some in-game references do exist. &lt;a href=\"Omnia%20Priest\"&gt;Omnia Priest&lt;/a&gt;s provide several quotes which refer to the 'light':\nThe leader of the Omnia discipline, the priest &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt;, also mentions the light in several of her quotes:\nThe above may be taken to suggest that pandaren priests do indeed wield the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. The Omnia Priest quote \"Shadows, begone!\" and Yalia Sagewhisper's quote \"Keep the shadows at bay\" may be taken to further suggest that the pandaren share an experience of priestly ways (specifically the division between the Light and the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;) similar to races such as humans.\nOne contradiction to the above is provided by &lt;a href=\"Jojo%20Ironbrow\"&gt;Jojo Ironbrow&lt;/a&gt; when first hearing of the term \"the Light\", responding \"What's the Light?\" However, this may be put down to simple (if surprising) ignorance on Jojo's part, or to a minor error by Blizzard. One other possibility would be that the term is not used on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Jojo's home, but is used widely among pandaren priests on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; itself. Pandaren priests on the Wandering Isle may then share the same beliefs as their Pandarian brethren and simply use different terms, or may have more substantially differing ways.\nOther priests.\nHigh elf priests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, adopted the religion from their allies the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and the high elven priests have devoutly contributed to the Church of the Light. The elves displayed a strong mastery of divine Light magic throughout the ages and during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the high elf priests joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; alongside high elven &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and these priests served bravely as healers to their human and dwarven allies. The priests also fought alongside their brethren when trying to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; forces as he attacked their capital &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the tragedies of the Third War, the high elven population is very small and few high elf priests remain, as most of those that are surviving now call themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nOgre priests.\nPriests are somewhat rare among &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, yet they do exist. They worship &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and other deities.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Church of the Light originated from human cults, and the high elves have made significant contributions to this evolving religion. Divine beings known as &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Hope\"&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt;s guide the Light's worshipers with an unseen hand.\nSome night elves revere one or all of the five Dragon Aspects, and are known as the &lt;a href=\"Sect%20of%20the%20Dragons\"&gt;Sect of the Dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Holy Light has many devotees among elvenkind. They spread a message of comfort and protection to the displaced, the hope of unity among elves, &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, and men - and revenge against the Scourge. Clad in robes but protected by a chain shirt, priests of the Holy Light appear tailored to look like the bastion of their faith. They wear holy symbols around their neck and they bow their heads to say a brief prayer (or in silent, reverent, contemplation). As a priest of the Holy Light dedicated to the aspect of protection, these acolytes prefer not to wade into battle, but to serve in the middle ranks of a group of allies and support them with petitions, prayers and spells. His staff is reserved for use only when a gap in his protection is breached.\nAfter awakening from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s control, The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; chose to abandon many of the morals and beliefs they held during their natural lives. However, those who were priests during their lives have not abandoned religion or become agnostic. Because of their changes, the Forsaken have embraced a twisted version of their former religion, the antithesis of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;The Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, known simply as &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Dark priests are like the religion's &lt;a href=\"archbishop\"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt;s, ruling over wide territories.\nPandaren have a fierce and deep belief in the connection of the material and spiritual worlds. In many ways, their faith mirrors the ancient beliefs of the night elves, and the tribal beliefs of the tauren, troll, and orc races. However, pandaren veil their beliefs in the trappings of a mystical and ancient method called geomancy. Geomancy teaches that the land is a reflection of the spirits, but that spirits are also a reflection of the land. Like the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren follow a shamanistic faith, worshiping the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and giving passage to their dead. They are true &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s, drawing their holy power directly from the Earth Mother. They also follow a new philosophy (new to the other residents of Kalimdor, of course); they are a society that reacts, instead of acting first. They claim to be the water that flows around a rock: The water does not push the rock out of the way, it merely goes around it. They use this uncomplicated way of thinking in their everyday life. If they set their minds to a task, and they fail, then they believe they went about it the wrong way and try again. They do not mourn for failures, believing that they simply have mapped out improper ways to do things and they will know better next time. This philosophy seems simple, but the pandaren apply it to every aspect of their lives, from brewing beer to adventuring. They are calm, affable types who will extend the hand of friendship to a stranger on the road \u2014 but if the stranger is hostile, the hand of friendship can quickly turn into an excruciating joint lock."}

It is Delrissa who revived &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; after he was heavily wounded in an attack on &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and she has stayed in the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; lord's presence ever since. The priestess has a militant circle of loyal acolytes who serve her and will defend her at all cost.\"\nAbilities.\nDelrissa's Minions.\nFour minions are chosen to defend Priestess Delrissa.\nNotes.\nCrowd Control.\nFears, Freezing Traps, Stuns, and Disorients work on any of the NPCs. Individual NPCs are crowd-controllable in additional ways, as listed above. However, they are all immune to &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Seduction\"&gt;Seduce&lt;/a&gt;. The NPC pets can be affected by Taunt, and seem to follow normal aggro rules.\nThe priestess is partly CCable (hunter &lt;a href=\"hunter%20trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Scatter%20Shot\"&gt;Scatter Shot&lt;/a&gt;, stuns including &lt;a href=\"Concussion%20Blow\"&gt;Concussion Blow&lt;/a&gt;) but cannot be &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt;ed, &lt;a href=\"sap\"&gt;sap&lt;/a&gt;ped etc. It is generally advised that you try to keep as many as possible locked down while you deal with each one individually. The Priestess, however, doesn't hit very hard at all in melee (800-900 on cloth in heroic), and can probably be soloed or off-tanked by almost any class, preferably someone that can stun her as sometimes she starts heal-spamming which makes her very hard to interrupt. In most cases she should be nuked down quickly.\nIf your group has no CC, this fight will be almost impossible on Heroic difficulty unless you vastly outgear the instance, and even then it can be touch and go with the wrong person getting gibbed.\nGroup Makeup.\nSince this is a 5v5 fight, it is extremely beneficial to have as many DPS classes that can CC as possible. However it is not necessary, as most of the adds have a fairly low damage output, and good tanks can keep at least two (if not three) on themselves at any given time, lowering the amount of CC necessary to complete this encounter. However tanking adds are extremely difficult as they are immune to taunt and choose their targets seemingly by how hard it is to kill for them (for example warrior types continue to jump to rogues etc.).\nIf there is only one member in the party who can dispel magic effects, it's advised to let them retain the -debuff, as it will break most crowd control (apart from Fear/Stun) that lands on you. This is especially important for healers. The anti-CC trinkets from PvP are also quite useful.\nPreviewing the adds.\nYou can take advantage of the two-floored design of Magisters' Terrace to greatly improve your chances for success with the Delrissa fight by resetting the instance until there is a good combination of adds for your group.\nHave a group member enter the instance to where they can glance down into the courtyard and see Delrissa, who is visible under the left side. Mouse over the adds, or type \"/tar &lt;Add name&gt;\" until you identify her four adds associated with that particular instance of the dungeon. This method can be done by any class, and not just those with stealthing, tracking, or distance-seeing abilities. If your group does not like the add selection, leave and choose \"Reset All Instances\" from the party leader's portrait. You may do this as many times as the reset-limit allows for each group member, as long as the leader is not saved.\nBad combination of adds.\nThe Shaman combined with other meleers, particularly the Mortal Strike Naga makes for a lot of pain.\nEssentially, the melee NPCs are far worse than the other NPCs.\nStrategy.\nAlthough there are various strategies available, depending on your group setup, here is a generalization of what should be done to ensure an easy success on this boss:\nPulling.\nWhen the fight starts, depending on which adds have been selected, the puller will most likely get charged, feared, or hit with painless but very annoying debuffs (such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shock\"&gt;Frost Shock&lt;/a&gt;). It's advised for the tank and all DPS to stand up front and be ready for the pull while the healer hangs back in clear sight and ideally alone to clear up confusion. \nNOTE for rogues: During Blizzard Q&amp;A &lt;a href=\"Hortus\"&gt;Hortus&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D5784540075\"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that \"rogues should be removed from stealth when the NPCs are engaged\". This means that rogues who sap should move away before the mobs are engaged so that he is not taken out of stealth in the middle of them.\nAn alternative pull technique for a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; tank is to use &lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Avenger's Shield&lt;/a&gt; on the corner left or right mini-boss, then run behind one of the pillars that are supporting the arena where Delrissa is. If done correctly, all the bosses will follow the tank to get in melee range behind the pillar, avoiding some serious troubles like the &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Salaris\"&gt;Naga Warrior's&lt;/a&gt; charge at start. If the adds in the opposite wing of the pull can be Crowd Controlled (&lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;ing or hunter &lt;a href=\"hunter%20trap\"&gt;Trap&lt;/a&gt;ping), the pull will go with a better start. But pay attention to the mini-bosses when using this idea \u2014 if any of them has a minion, &lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Avenger's Shield&lt;/a&gt; will strike the minion instead, and do no initial threat to Delrissa, only to the minion and the 2 mini-bosses. \nAn alternative pull technique is also available to engineer tanks who carry a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Goblin Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. Standing directly in line of Delrissa at max distance, a shot can be let off. You can then quickly hide behind the nearest pillar before getting any crowd-controlling affects applied to you. When doing this, it may help to have all crowd control inside the room. This will allow them to get their crowd control off quickly, and safely.\nAfter pull.\nAll forms of Crowd Control help. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s can control the Demons, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s can &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s can &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; the Humanoids (except Delrissa), Hunters can Trap and use their pet to off-tank an add, Shamans can use their Earth Elemental (although the adds are immune to the taunt) and so on. \nThe main element to remember is that the bosses do not hit hard, save for the Mortal Strike Naga Warrior. Warriors can use &lt;a href=\"Hamstring\"&gt;Hamstring&lt;/a&gt; (and Hunters use &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt;) to make this fight significantly easier; &lt;a href=\"Earthbind%20Totem\"&gt;Earthbind Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt; can also help. &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20Howl\"&gt;Piercing Howl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intimidating%20Shout\"&gt;Intimidating Shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howl%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Howl of Terror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt; also make the fight much easier.\nDelrissa and her minions are difficult to kill as long as she is able to heal. Drain her mana with the usual abilities. Damage her and her minions to prod her into casting &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt;, then dispel all her renews, forcing her to continuously re-cast it and use up her mana. Interrupt her &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt; when possible. Use &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the effects of her heals. Once she is out of mana, she is much easier to kill. Once she is dead, her minions are much easier to kill. It is not a fast fight. The key is to survive with an intact group until she runs out of mana and dies.\nAggro.\nOnce your group has applied crowd control, do damage to your heart's content (just not to the adds that have crowd control currently on them). None of the mobs (including Delrissa) have a very strict aggro table\u2014it either resets frequently, is ridiculously touchy, or just does not exist at all. One theory is that it is easily reset, but that healing \u2014 not damage \u2014 causes high threat. Whatever the case, it is extremely unlikely that a tank will be able to keep everything under control. Delrissa hits for about 500 to 700 on cloth and is easily tanked by a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; if really necessary.\nAnother take on the aggro for these mobs is that they follow a PvP-style aggro table, targeting healers and clothies first. With this in mind, your party may find it useful to play in a similar manner, such as having your tank put on DPS gear. Some groups approach this fight like an Arena fight, so consider bringing your PvP gear. Note however, that unlike a true &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; encounter, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt; works and lets the mobs turn to another target most of the time. Another help for &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s is &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt;; when the mobs get out of fear, they sometimes target another player.\nHunters can drop a &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Trap\"&gt;Snake Trap&lt;/a&gt;. The boss and her minions tend to focus their attacks and abilities on the low-health snakes, buying some time for the players.\nKilling order.\nThere is no preferred killing order, however killing the Priestess first (or, alternatively, one of the healer mini-bosses) seems to be the best strategy, as their heals can make the fight drag on and on. If you have a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, have him or her &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; the priestess constantly to remove her buffs. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt; her frequently to achieve a similar effect.\nThe minions do not despawn, and must thus be killed sooner or later. If Delrissa dies before her adds, she will not be lootable until they are dead \u2014 if you wipe, she will resurrect back up, and she will keep taunting you even from beyond the grave.\nGains.\nAfter killing this NPC you will gain: "}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the wrath of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; was almost upon Azsuna, Driana decided to find Azshara and prove her loyalty, although she did that with regret of leaving her previous life.

Assisted by the leaders in reducing the demons' numbers, she was encouraged to be redeemed. At the &lt;a href=\"Nor%27Danil%20Wellspring\"&gt;Nor'Danil Wellspring&lt;/a&gt;, she was transformed from a demon satyr back to a ghost of a night elf by the power of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and returned to her lover, Ilanya, in the &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Palace\"&gt;Crumbled Palace&lt;/a&gt;."}

Charged with the safekeeping of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; lands and armed with magical energy bows - the Priestesses will stop at nothing to rid their ancient land of evil.\nHero names.\nKathris Starsong, Adora Nightshade, Mora Moonsinger, Felore Moonray, Anara Chillwind, Kera Stardragon, Mave Whisperwind, &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, Mira Whitemane, Theta Saberfang, Tygra Snowscar, Ariel Darkmoon, Diana Windwood.\nInformation.\nThe Priestess of the Moon is often an overlooked Night Elf Hero. While many prefer the Keeper of the Grove or the Demon Hunter for their Entangling Roots and Mana Burn, the Priestess can do very well when controlled properly. It can take some time to learn how to use the Priestess of the Moon effectively, but once you do you can rip things up. The Priestess of the Moon is a great focused fire Hero and unit killer, sometimes killing many more enemy Heroes than other allied Heroes in team games. The Demon Hunter and Keeper of the Grove have to get up close to enemy units while the Priestess can bomb them from long distances. The Priestess is also great at delivering killing blows using Searing Arrow to enemy Heroes or units running away. The Priestess is also good for her Trueshot Aura, which adds damage to ranged units. She becomes even more effective when sharing the Aura with multiple allied teammates to increase the damage of their ranged units as well. If the Priestess of the Moon is able to reach level 6 and Starfall she becomes a huge powerhouse. While good enemy players can cancel the Starfall shortly after it begins, against lesser players and with allied support you can kill plenty of enemy units with Starfall. \nThe key to doing well with the Priestess of the Moon is to use her like an Archer. Use the typical ranged unit tactics as you do with other ranged units. Make sure she is always toward the rear of the army and that melee units cannot reach her. Run away when units attempt to surround her or focus fire on her with ranged units. Even with these methods you may still find you lose her against good Undead players using Dread Lord's Sleep, or Night Elf Keeper of the Grove's Entangle. But you can also protect her with a Demon Hunter to Mana Burn enemy Heroes.\nSome top Night Elf players recommend first placing points in Trueshot Aura followed by Searing Arrows and then Starfall at Level 6. You may find Owl useful in large games, or after Searing Arrows and Trueshot Aura is maxed. You can also scout using Huntress Sentinel and combat units or Wisps instead of using Owls. The Benefit of Owls is that they are easy to use and the enemy can't cast spells on them.\nThe Priestess of the Moon is often a good second Hero choice. She can instantly give the Trueshot Aura to your existing units at level 1 and can support your primary Demon Hunter or Keeper of the Grove Hero. The downside of picking her second is that is slower to reach Level 6 and Starfall. Picking the Priestess as the first and only Hero can allow you to reach Starfall much faster. This can be especially effective in 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, and 4 vs. 4 games. The Priestess can also be a great primary Hero when teaming with other Night Elf players since it helps them both.\nMake use of Hide with the Priestess of the Moon. Attack the enemy, then Hide, attack then Hide. If the Priestess is about to die at night, use Hide to avoid dying. This works very well. You can then run back home when it is safe. You can use Hide with your entire army of Archers and Huntresses since all have Shadowmeld. If you find a Cloak of Shadows you can even use this with your second Hero as well.\nGive the Priestess combat items such as Claws, Gloves of Haste, Agility Items, and other items that add to her damage and combat ability. Some players think of her as a caster type Hero but she can actually take advantage of combat items, especially when combined with Searing Arrow.\nUse Moon Wells with the Priestess to heal her and recover mana.\nWhen Searing Arrows are activated, the Priestess of the Moon will continue to drain mana. This can conflict with Starfall sometimes because you will not have enough mana to cast it. If you wish to use Starfall but cannot seem to gain enough mana to cast it, deactivate Searing Arrows. You can also buy a few Mana Potions so that you can use Starfall and Searing Arrows and not worry about having enough Mana.\nSpells and abilities.\nSout.\nThe Owl is invulnerable so you can do whatever you want with it and the enemy can't attack it. The Owl is great for scouting enemy towns or expansions.\nSeaing Arrows (Autocast).\nNotes:\nThe bonus damage uses the unit's Attack type, so heroes will not take reduced damage from it.\nDamage is, however, affected by numeric armor value.\nrueshot Aura (Passive).\nAn aura that gives friendly units around the Priestess bonus damage to their ranged attacks.\nStarall (Ultimate).\nStarfall is great at killing units. If you use potions it will interrupt the Starfall.\nStarfall damage vs. buildings is reduced to 35%.\nStarfall hits units automatically without the caster having to aim. This means it's not really possible to avoid the Starfall unless you run away from the area.\nThe most common defense against Starfall is to run away from the Priestess of the Moon until she is done casting Starfall.\nThis spell must be \"maintained\" to get the full effect. This functionality is applied to mainly mass damage area of effect spells. For example, if you cast an Earthquake spell on an enemy town, your Far Seer must stay casting the spell until the Earthquake is finished. If you give him a new order during the spell, the Far Seer will stop casting the Earthquake. The same is the case for the Priestess of the Moon and Starfall. Therefore, force the Priestess of the Moon to run away by attacking her which will end the Starfall.\nYou can interrupt this spell with spells such as:\n Humans: Mountain King - Storm Bolt\n Humans: Mountain King - Bash (uncastable on air units)\n Orcs: Raider - Ensnare\n Orcs: Tauren Chieftain - War Stomp (uncastable on air units)\n Orcs: Witch Doctor - Stasis Trap (uncastable on air units)\n Orcs: Shadow Hunter - Hex\n Night Elves: Druid of the Talon - Cyclone (uncastable on air units)\n Night Elves: Keeper of the Grove - Entangling Roots (uncastable on air units)\n Undead: Dread Lord - Sleep\n Undead: Dread Lord - Inferno (uncastable on air units)\n Undead: Crypt Lord - Impale (uncastable on air units)\n Neutral: Dark Ranger - Silence\n Neutral: Goblin Tinker - Cluster Rockets\n Neutral: Fire Lord - Soul Burn\n Neutral: Fire Lord - Volcano"}

One of Tharil'zun's retinue spotted their advance and ran back like a coward to warn the other orcs. The priest's party soon found themselves overwhelmed by strong, fierce, dark magic wielding orcs. At first the priest used some holy magic to damage the enemy, but soon attempted to assist the party by healing them, and shielding them. After they had defeated the orcs, Tharil'zun himself came into the battle. The priest knew he had to ensure that her group survived the onslaught so he was only able to cast some Shadow Magic, including the word Pain, but mostly healing his companions. Finally they had killed Tharil'zun, and saved many of the good people of Lakeshire. None of his friends had been lost during the battle, and he knew helping his friends and stopping his enemies was the truest thing that anyone could accomplish, and they had done a great deed that day."}

Baa'ri became the site of one of the worst atrocities committed in this dark conflict: the city was covered under a wall of lava and ash as Gul'dan and other &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s raised the volcano which now bears his name.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt; search the ruins for the relics, the remnants of the Baa'ri priesthood have remained in hiding until the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. With new allies to help in the struggle to reclaim the Temple of Karabor from &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s clutches, the priests of Baa'ri have reemerged to offer their knowledge of the Light to those who prove themselves capable of opposing the Betrayer."}

{"id": "69549", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69549", "title": "Primal (occupation)", "text": "Primals are those &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s who revel in their bestial rage and give into it completely. As they slowly take on an increasingly beast-like appearance, they also gain powerful and violent abilities. Primals believe that every creature is inhabited by a dark, primeval essence. They hold to the notion that each and every living soul is haunted by a beastly force, and that those who accept this fact can eventually ascend to another level of existence - one that is more primitive, but also more connected to nature and the animal kingdom. Though very few can fathom the existence of this whimsical force, primeval characters strive to unlock its secrets. They call this pristine essence \"the beast within\". Primals believe that once someone has accepted the beast within himself, he must learn not to suppress it \u2014 as most civilized folks were brought up to do. Indeed, the character must welcome it into his heart and soul in order to call upon it in times of need. Thus, primals can tap this essence and channel the instincts, strength, and fury only the beast within can provide.\nHistory.\nLong ago, even before they forged their great empires, trolls lived in a primitive world. They shunned civilization and failed to comprehend its ways. Among the many tribes of jungle trolls, fierce barbarians emerged. As disorganized as they were, these raging warriors formed the bulk of each tribe's military force - and indeed the proud jewels of the trolls' ancient life. Though all barbarians of olden times learned to embrace and control their rage, a few among them connected more fully with their bestial anger as well as with their animalistic insights, exploring and surrendering to the dark, primeval essences that inhabited them. In battle, barbarians of the time \u2014 like their modern brethren \u2014 fought as if possessed, but among the jungle troll barbarians some truly were possessed. They not only reveled in their bestial rage, they completely surrendered to the beast within. Their connection to the dark essence into which they tapped was so strong that their bodies took on beastlike appearances. Eventually these warriors came to be known as primals.\nToday, people view primals as lethal and unpredictable warriors driven by savage natures and primitive instincts. As his connection to the beast grows, a primal takes on an increasingly beastlike appearance, gaining powerful and deadly new abilities as he unlocks the mysteries of the beast within and learns to control it. Primals indeed revel in the bestial fury they can trigger on a whim, but there is more to them than meets the eye. As the primal begins to connect with the animal spirit within her, she comes to understand the animals around her. A primal may speak with animals for a number of minutes equal to how skilled she is. The primal grows sharp claws and fangs that can be used in combat. A primal can use body language, vocalizations and demeanor to improve the attitude of any creature of the animal, magical beast or vermin types.\nThrough time subtle changes in the primal\u2019s physical appearance emerge. His physique takes on the most common features of a wild beast. His hair becomes coarser, his face takes on more angular features, and his skin thickens, changes color or grows hairier. As he grows more in touch with the beast within, the primal\u2019s body continues to change. The muscles of his body become thick and sinewy, granting the primal greater Strength. The primal\u2019s eyes mutate into those of a wild animal. The primal\u2019s irises turn into an eerie yellow, green or white shade while his pupils become darker and shaped like those of a feline or other type of animal or magical beast. As the primal gains experience, his body continues to change, becoming more beast-like. Upon attaining more experience, the primal\u2019s nails turn yellow and harden. His teeth become pointier, as though they were gradually turning into fangs. Through extensive experience the primal reaches the apex of this mutation, his body now looks like an unnatural mixture of his original race and a strange type of creature. From this time forth, he appears more beast than humanoid.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"berserker\"&gt;berserker&lt;/a&gt;s, who harness their rage to become more powerful, a primal channels his fury from the beast within. Unlike most characters, the primal accepts and indeed embraces the wild and often macabre aspects of the beast that inhabits all creatures. More importantly, he learns how to draw from this primeval essence and turn his rage into devastating fits of anger not unlike those of the wildest beasts. Like the beast within him, the primal is constantly on guard, and his instincts become so well honed that he can trigger a rage in response to someone else\u2019s action. While raging, the primal grows fangs, horns or claws. The primal\u2019s fangs, horns or claws remain until his rage ends. A primal considers this new appendage a natural weapon with which he is proficient.\nPrimals in the world.\nCivilized society fails to understand primals. Most people \u2014 even among the Horde \u2014 believe that primals are too bestial, too bloodthirsty and too unpredictable to be trusted. Indeed, the majority of those who have crossed swords with a primal did not live to regret it; those who survived now make it a point not to anger them, and indeed do their best to avoid contact with primals. Primals are not welcomed in cities under Alliance control. Since few people dare confront them, primals are often left alone for several days before &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s or town folk organize to drive them away.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, primals are at the same time mistrusted for their incomprehensible connection to the beast within and admired for their sharp instincts and feral bestiality. Thus, their peers often view them as undesirable necessities. Though they are an invaluable addition to the Horde military, in most Horde member's minds, primals serve only one purpose: to wage war. In times of peace (which are certainly rare), even the Horde considers them a sometimes dangerous but always menacing nuisance.\nPrimals consider themselves illuminated and blessed with powers far beyond what others can comprehend. Thus, they frequently view those who would cast them out as frightened and ignorant fools. Preferring the simple ways of primitive people, primals feel more at home among &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; - and these characters indeed are more welcoming and understanding toward primals. \nAlthough the tradition of the primal hails from the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and almost all those who practice this strange profession are from this race, a few orcs and tauren recently uncovered how to unlock the beast within. Taught by jungle troll primals, orcs and tauren who follow this philosophy are rare, but they have the potential to become just as powerful as their teachers.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Torntusk\"&gt;Primal Torntusk&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Village\"&gt;Revantusk Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Thurloga\"&gt;Primalist Thurloga&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20Primalist\"&gt;Tauren Primalist&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Primalist\"&gt;Ashtongue Primalist&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Some animals on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; are primal.\nNamed.\nThe concept of primal and primalists in the game seem to be different of that in the books described above."}

The ruins appear to be of &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; architecture oddly located above ground, mostly. It is speculated that there was an earthquake long ago, possibly the result of magma beneath, and this section of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; got shoved up to the surface. Regardless, nerubians are not there now, and a pack of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; moved in some time ago. They are nasty and attack anyone who gets within range. Fortunately, there is no reason to venture down there as you can reach the ocean just as easily all along the tundra's shore. The Riplash Ruins give the naga a perfect view of anyone approaching across the ocean from the south."}

Ripple!\nIt's a drink, you dummy.\nAn abandoned &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost has a stash of &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20Honey%20Ripple\"&gt;Hinterlands Honey Ripple&lt;/a&gt; from when they were in business. You can't get fine ripple like that anymore! One of Malton's dummy associates knows the shot, so you'll go out there and bring me a case of packaged ripple, and two for my own collection! Talk to Malton, he'll fill you in on the details.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nCompletion.\nOh yeah, about the ripple dad wants! He wants to sell the ripple to a tavern here in Orgrimmar, but we'll get more money if it is in its original packaging. I know someone who can do that, and he's in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; where the ripple is. But he's, um, a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nWell, he's a good high elf, as he's not a part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nether, an ethereal dimension of chaotic magics that connected the myriad worlds of the universe, was home to an infinite number of malefic, demonic beings who sought only to destroy life and devour the energies of the living universe. Unable to conceive of evil or wickedness in any form, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s struggled to find a way to end the demons' constant threat.\nThe conflicts.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic entities made their way into the titans' worlds from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; elected its greatest warrior, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, to act as its first line of defense. A noble giant of molten bronze, Sargeras carried out his duties for countless millennia, seeking out and destroying these &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s wherever he could find them.\nSargeras continued defeating the disorganized and incompetent demons with ease, but he also soon discovered that some demons had begun wielding the dark energies of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Through this discovery, the Defender also discovered the existence of the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s, malevolent beings far more powerful than mere demons who sought to influence the physical universe. The presence of these void lords troubled Sargeras, but he nonetheless continued his work.\nTo his dismay, Sargeras soon discovered that the demons he had defeated simply returned to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to be reborn in new bodies and continue to torment the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;. Sargeras was greatly troubled by the creatures' corruption and all-consuming evil. Incapable of fathoming such depravity, the great titan began to slip into a brooding depression. The Pantheon grew concerned about the increase of demonic activity, and so sent the inexperienced titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to aid Sargeras in battle. Aggramar proved a quick study and soon earned Sargeras' admiration, becoming the warrior's trusted lieutenant.\nThe two fought shoulder to shoulder against the endless demons of the Nether. This allowed Sargeras to more closely study the nature of the Nether, and by learning how to manipulate the chaotic realm's magical energies, despite his moral growing unease, he created a &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;prison world&lt;/a&gt; on a corner of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to contain the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and demons he had defeated. Demonic invasions became increasingly rare, and together, the two titans soon brought peace to the cosmos.\nSargeras and Aggramar eventually agreed to go their own separate ways in order to allow them to more effectively combat the demons. Eventually, over the eons, Sargeras encountered the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful demonic race which was bent on gaining power and dominance over the physical universe. While his confusion and misery deepened, Sargeras was forced to contend with them, whose intent was disrupting the titans' order. This dark race of vampiric demons (also known as dreadlords) conquered a number of populated worlds by possessing their inhabitants and turning them to the shadow. The nefarious, scheming dreadlords turned whole nations against one another by manipulating them into unthinking hatred and mistrust. Sargeras defeated the nathrezim easily, but their corruption affected him deeply.\nEventually Sargeras discovered the full extent of the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s' plans. Coming across a world that had been almost completely infected by monstrous aberrations known as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the titan ruthlessly interrogated a conclave of nathrezim demons who dwelled on the black world. From them, Sargeras learned that the void lords had sent the Old Gods out into the cosmos to infect any worlds that housed titan &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, and if they succeeded, the world-soul would be twisted into an unspeakably dark creature that not even the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; could stand against. Enraged at this discovery, Sargeras cleaved the planet in two, instantly killing the nascent titan it housed. He then immediately returned to the rest of the Pantheon to tell of his discovery, but they chastised him for his rash action, insisting that they might have been able to purge the world-soul of its corruption without killing it. Sargeras tried to convince the other titans that what he had done was right, and that the universe needed to be purged of life in order to prevent the risk of a world-soul becoming corrupted and opening the way for the void lords. Realizing that the others would never see things the way he did, Sargeras stormed off, vowing to cleanse the universe on his own.\nAs doubt and despair overwhelmed Sargeras' senses, he lost all faith not only in his mission but also in the titans' vision of an ordered universe. Eventually, he came to believe that the concept of order itself was folly and that chaos and depravity were the only absolutes within the dark, lonely universe."}

As they spread their corruptive influence across the land, two races arose from the organic matter that seeped from their blighted forms: the cunning &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and the resilient &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. The n'raqi, or \"faceless ones\", acted as taskmasters, employing the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; aqir to build massive citadels and temples around the massive bulks of their Old God masters. The greatest of these bastions was built around &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful and wicked of the Old Gods, and soon these holdings would spread across the world, becoming known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Massive sacrifices and living buildings filled with &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; energy were some of the distinguishing features of this shadowy domain.\nThe rise of the Black Empire did not go unnoticed by the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who had previously been the only inhabitants of Azeroth. Seeing the Old Ones as a threat to their dominion, for the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world united against a common enemy. &lt;a href=\"Al%27akir\"&gt;Al'akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; cooperated to create blistering firestorms, reducing the Black Empire's citadels to ash. &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; raised jagged rock walls to corral her enemies and shatter their temple cities. &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; crushed the n'raqi and aqir with the fury of the seas.\nUltimately, however, no matter how many n'raqi and aqir died, more and more would spawn from the Old Gods' putrid forms like larvae from a hive. The elementals could not stand against the endless swarms, and the Old Gods eventually succeeded in enslaving the Elemental Lords. Without the native spirits of the world to hinder the Black Empire's influence, the world spiraled into an abyss of death and suffering."}

Also note that there is a level gap between &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Silithid\"&gt;Rise of the Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Silithid\"&gt;March of the Silithid&lt;/a&gt; which may make the second half of the chain temporarily unavailable.\nPart 1: Rise of the Silithid.\n&lt;a href=\"Senior%20Surveyor%20Fizzledowser\"&gt;Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser&lt;/a&gt; is looking for assistants to go looking for water sources for &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that the nomads have been seizing all the wells, and he is looking to find more water sources. The pay sounds good, the work easy, so you volunteer.\nFizzledowser hands you a dowsing widget, and asks you to head to a pool near the troll-held &lt;a href=\"Sandsorrow%20Watch\"&gt;Sandsorrow Watch&lt;/a&gt;. You find the pool. Carefully avoiding the trolls, you use the dowser. But your sampling is interrupted by a couple of pony-sized insects burrowing out of the ground at your disturbance.\nYou return with the dowsing results. Fizzledowser apologizes for not mentioning the possibility of the insects, as he had thought them mere inventions of the nomads to cover their water thefts. Now he knows better.\nAnd knowing your foe is the first step to being able to control or defeat a threat. Fizzledowser asks you to go to the &lt;a href=\"Noxious%20Lair\"&gt;Noxious Lair&lt;/a&gt; and bring back enough parts for &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Pestlezugg\"&gt;Alchemist Pestlezugg&lt;/a&gt; to investigate.\nWhile you can get plenty of parts (carefully - those are bad bugs), getting \"useful\" parts take a bit longer. Still, you manage it. You return with the parts to the alchemist, who tells you that Fizzledowser has had some emergency come up that he'd like your help with. The analysis will take some time anyway; you have time.\nFizzledowser, it turns out, had sent his top assistant, one Junior Surveyor Scrimshank, out to &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Chasm\"&gt;Gaping Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, and he's gone missing. Fizzledowser would like you to go out and find out what happened to him. Rescue him if he's still alive, or at least retrieve his equipment.\nYou don't find sign of him anywhere on the surface, so you head into the nest. Quite some distance in, you find what is left of his survey equipment, where the bugs probably stored it.\nYou return the survey equipment to Fizzledowser. He asks you to check in with &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Pestlezugg\"&gt;Alchemist Pestlezugg&lt;/a&gt; to see if he's got results from those parts you gave him.\nHe does indeed, it turns out. Those results seem to confirm that the bugs are being controlled by some outside force, and a pretty malign one at that.\nPestlezugg insists that Fizzledowser needs to see this immediately. Not only that, but he feels you should show the report to anyone you can get to sit down and read it. The threat, he says, is not only to Tanis and Gadgetzan, but to all of Southern Kalimdor, possibly to the whole of Azeroth.\nSharing (for free) does not come naturally to Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser, but Pestlezugg is a long time associate, and he trusts the alchemist's judgement.\nThe Senior Surveyor urges you to take the report to a scholar who has studied this sort of thing. \nThe scholar you are sent to agrees with Fizzledowser, that this threat is real and serious, to both Alliance AND Horde.\nThey even have a name for it: &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nPart 2: March of the Silithid.\nYour scholar contact asks you to return to &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Pestlezugg\"&gt;Alchemist Pestlezugg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and relay to him that he believes the direction is coming from &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nPestlezugg is very glad for your experience fighting the Silithid. He's a little less sure that Un'goro is the ultimate source, but it's a start.\nThe alchemist asks you to venture into Un'Goro and retrieve an intact scent gland from one of the Silithid, as well as several samples of the native Un'Goro soil. He believes that if the Queen can be drawn out of hiding and slain, the rest of the hive will be disrupted.\nThe soil you find easily enough. Clods of it stick to your shoes all the time. The scent gland is a bit more difficult, as the process of killing the bug often renders the gland unusable. Still, you manage, and return with the parts.\nPestlezugg brews up the lure and advises you on how to use it. Somewhere in the hive, he says, is a crystal that they use for communication. Putting the lure near the crystal should draw the queen - and her bodyguards - out where you can get to her.\nYou venture into &lt;a href=\"The%20Slithering%20Scar\"&gt;The Slithering Scar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and find a hive much smaller than either of the ones you found earlier. You find the crystal Pestlezugg mentioned fairly easily and lay out the lure.\nAs hoped for, the queen comes out. And as predicted, a number of bodyguards accompany her. With some assistance, you finally manage to dispatch them. As requested, you slice out the queen's brain, and bring it back to Pestlezugg for analysis.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Pestlezugg\"&gt;Alchemist Pestlezugg&lt;/a&gt; puts together another report, on the events in Un'Goro, and asks you to return to your scholar with it, and asks you to pass on the request for more aid.\n... and disconcertingly, the scholars on both sides are similarly frustrated. The leadership of both the Horde \"and\" the Alliance are so fixated, each upon the other, that they are almost certain to ignore this threat.\nYour scholar contact thanks you, but warns that you are certain to be called upon again some time soon, to assist against the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; further. The results from your foray show that instead of being directed from Un'Goro, there exists a far stronger presence elsewhere.\nIn the mean time, she presents you with a note to take to an agent at the bank. You present the note, and are given an item from the scholar's vault as a token of gratitude.\nRewards.\nOver the course of the chain, you earn amazing amounts of faction:\nYou also earn\nNotes.\nThis chain introduces you to plot line of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, a region where the insects have built great nests and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; struggles to maintain even a minimal base there."}

It was added with &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nThe mysterious prophet only known as &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; has issued a call for Azeroth's embattled troll populations to unite into a single empire. As the gathered troll tribes arrived at the meeting site they were informed by Zul about &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; being lost to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and how &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; is now a wasteland. They are told that the Zandalari plan to reclaim the former glory of the troll race, and will crush any who stand in their way and states that the Troll Empires will rise again. While the other troll representatives present cheer and accept the Zandalari's offer, Vol'jin who views the Horde as his true brothers declines and seeks to stop the Zandalari. To this end, he sends members of his tribe to both Orgrimmar and Stormwind recognizing that the threat of a new Troll empire is something that the Horde can't handle alone. While Vol'jin is able to gather a mobile force to keep the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; from surging out of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, he is unable to contain the Gurubashi.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bambala\"&gt;Bambala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Livingston\"&gt;Fort Livingston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Nesingwary's Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Camp\"&gt;Rebel Camp&lt;/a&gt; come under attack by serpents sent by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Kilnara\"&gt;High Priestess Kilnara&lt;/a&gt; sends panthers to attack the Rebel Camp and Grom'gol while the panther &lt;a href=\"Mauti\"&gt;Mauti&lt;/a&gt; attacks the hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition. Both Grom'gol and the Rebel Camp later come under attack by Gurubashi trolls led by &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt;. After heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; beat back the Gurubashi attack they are sent to &lt;a href=\"The%20Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;The Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; which faces its own troubles.\n&lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt; aids the Gurubashi by turning the inhabitants of both &lt;a href=\"Hardwrench%20Hideaway\"&gt;Hardwrench Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%20Digsite\"&gt;Explorers' League Digsite&lt;/a&gt; into voodoo zombies by poisoning the food in each town. After saving their respective towns adventurers will be sent to speak to a troll who is warning &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; about the Gurubashi. This troll turns out to be none other than Vol'jin, the Darkspear leader himself.\nDarkspear agents inside &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; is wrestling &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; into submission, holding him by spirit chains and stripping out his power into himself. They enlist adventurers to put an end to Jin'do's mad plans once and for all. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of \"Jin'do the Broken\". Hakkar then returns the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing. Meanwhile, during this time Vol'jin lead a strike team into Zul'Aman and put an end to the Amani leadership."}

When loosed upon escaped criminals, wardens employ a number of supernatural powers that enable them to recapture their prey and mete out the night elves' justice. Wardens have a line of sight teleport ability called \"blink,\" which they can use to outmaneuver even the quickest of foes. They notably wield &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Crescent\"&gt;umbra crescent&lt;/a&gt;s and typical &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;s.

Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Saynna%20Stormrunner\"&gt;Captain Saynna Stormrunner&lt;/a&gt;, commands &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps%20Watcher\"&gt;Barrow Deeps Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s that are stationed at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA contingent of wardens, including &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;, was sent by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to accompany and protect Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, establishing &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, stationing themselves at &lt;a href=\"Yrel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Yrel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and affiliating themselves with the other night elves and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Cordana was, however, corrupted by and joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s side.\nLegion.\nThe wardens have a presence on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wardens\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion initially overran the Vault of the Wardens and killed most of Maiev's wardens. The few remaining members searched for Maiev's whereabouts, to little avail, until her brother &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; finally found and rescued her at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. After Maiev was captured by the demons, &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; became the Wardens' leader in her absence.\nBased out of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of the Wardens' ranks have seemingly been decimated by the Legion, making it necessary for them to &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Trainee\"&gt;train new recruits&lt;/a&gt;, and to directly ask &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to hunt down prisoners who have escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. They also worked with the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, their former prisoners, against the Legion, and Maiev herself cooperated with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wardens maintained several &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Towers\"&gt;Warden Towers&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the Broken Isles. Following the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Wardens, including the now freed Maiev and several &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Vigilant\"&gt;Warden Vigilant&lt;/a&gt;s, joined the faction and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev and Sira journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to ask &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; for aid against the Horde after the Burning of Teldrassil. Most of the major surviving Wardens followed Maiev and Shandris Feathermoon to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, where they defended &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; during the Night Warrior ritual alongside other kaldorei and Alliance forces at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; wardens were slain and raised into undeath by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, despite the best efforts of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Embittered that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves had allowed such a fate to befall upon them, Dark Wardens such as &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyani%20Shadestalker\"&gt;Lyani Shadestalker&lt;/a&gt; joined the Forsaken in order to get vengeance.\nThe wardens participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, where Maiev and Sira served as the commanders of the Alliance and Horde forces. Under Maiev's leadership, the Alliance ultimately claimed victory and re-took the region from the Horde, with &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; as their new stronghold, while Sira and her forces escaped.\nShadows Rising.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Sira abandoned the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;serve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, only to be captured and sent to the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, where she was subsequently interrogated by Tyrande, Maiev, and Shandris. It is unknown if the Horde still has wardens in their service.\nKnown members.\nOthers.\nAlsa Iron-cell, The Iron Raven, Saithis, &lt;a href=\"Kiri%20Starstalker\"&gt;Kiri Starstalker&lt;/a&gt;, Anaya Felgrove, Felhala Starmoon, &lt;a href=\"Nalmeena%20Darkfollow\"&gt;Nalmeena Darkfollow&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nThe wardens are the most feared arm of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' wrath. These mystical assassins mete out justice, capture fugitives and carry out covert executions. Trained in martial arts, wardens command a fearsome and formidable range of abilities. Using a combination of cunning, stealth and tactical planning, a warden can shake even a large fighting force to its core.\nThey are stealthy and mystical individuals, using their shadowy abilities in ways much different than the Sentinels. They are adept at entering and exiting combat quickly and have a number of attacks that can quickly disable their opponents. Many wardens are women, though not all of them. Wardens dress in dark colors and favor cloaks, which move about them like shadows to further hide their presence. Wardens are deadly melee combatants, able to bring their opponents to their knees with a few quick attacks, then teleport to safety.\nWardens are members of night elf culture and society. Many wardens are night elves and are members of the Alliance. They have been valuable additions to the night elves' military for millennia. Theirs is an ancient tradition, focused on justice. In addition to some of their other roles, wardens ensure that law is kept in night elf lands. In modern times, they focus their skills on furthering night elf interests in the larger world, and keeping peace in northern Kalimdor. Historically, wardens are the most feared jailers and bounty hunters in night elf society. They keep watch on the most dangerous prisoners. If a prisoner escapes, wardens set out to retrieve him/her/it.\nThe most (in)famous warden is Maiev Shadowsong, the woman responsible for keeping the most dangerous prisoner in night elf history \u2014 Illidan Stormrage. Maiev failed in her duties, as all know, and hunted Illidan across Azeroth and Outland to retrieve him. Her hunt and failure embittered her, and when Illidan bested her in Outland, Maiev died alone and hollow on an alien, red world, or so it was believed. In fact, she was actually captured by Illidan however she breaks free with aid from Akama and aids a group of adventurers slay Illidan. After which her fate is unknown as she admits that without him she is nothing.\nDespite Maiev's failure, many young wardens see her as the epitome of dedication. Though her charge escaped, she pursued him across the worlds, giving up only when \"death\" prevented her from continuing her chase. Other wardens view Maiev with ambivalence, seeing her single-minded focus as responsible for her failure.\nWardens traditionally remain in the night elf homeland, protecting their race's interests. Other wardens, usually young ones who learned their skills since the Third War, head out into the larger world as adventurers. They still seek to further night elf interests, perhaps by destroying demons and other traditional enemies. Others are on missions to capture certain individuals or groups of individuals. They may be charged with returning these creatures to Darnassus, or they may leave to slay them.\nThey are night elf only, but it is conceivable that a night elf could teach the skills of a warden to a member of another race, but so far as anyone knows, this has never been done. All current wardens are members of the Alliance, though it is possible that a warden might break from the Alliance after learning her abilities. Night elves certainly don't train wardens who are not loyal to them.\nAs the night elves special police force, they are tasked with maintaining the laws of their people and with pursuing and capturing their fugitives. Though staunch members of the Alliance, wardens are rarely seen outside night elf lands unless sent on a specific mission. When pursuing fugitives, however, they may work with other Alliance forces and can prove invaluable when navigating night elf territories. More than one Alliance commander has felt some disquiet upon meeting these fiercely independent, accomplished, focused women, but that discomfort often changes to admiration and even appreciation upon seeing the warden at work. Wardens often target key enemy figures who have attacked the night elves before, and their presence near a battlefield often means the upcoming elimination of a significant threat. Sometimes a warden allies with an Alliance force, staying with them and eliminating each major opponent the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commander indicates. This usually occurs around night elf lands, where any invading force is a threat to their society.\nThe warden's &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; is drawn from conviction and belief in justice for the night elves. One of the deadliest abilities of the warden is her power to imbue a weapon with the wrath and justice of the night elves, upon a slashing or throwing weapon that she holds. The ultimate expression of the warden's spirit of justice and wrath is the summoning of a night elf &lt;a href=\"spirit%20of%20vengeance\"&gt;spirit of vengeance&lt;/a&gt;.\nA warden can unleash an arsenal of blades and knives upon the unsuspecting. The warden can magically split a thrown knife to let loose a cascade of cutting terror upon her quarry.\nWarden's Moon Sword.\nSpecially chosen wardens wield these circular slashing blades. The serrated, hoop-shaped moon sword is a deadly weapon for both subduing and executing the warden's quarry. In World of Warcraft, those blades have slightly-shining green aura.\nWarden's Cloak.\nSpecially constructed for the night elves' wardens, these green velvet cloaks bear a fringe of deadly, razor-sharp blades along the hem, resembling the wings of an owl. Wardens learn to shift and swing the cloak dramatically, presenting the blade fringes to anyone who might get too close. The cloak is both a defensive measure against sneak attacks and a potent weapon for the warden when surrounded by enemies. It also provides numerous knife blades for the warden to use with her slicing torrent ability."}

Set apart from the militant Sentinels, Wardens are usually employed as jailors, assassins, and bounty hunters. Attacks land units.\nThe Warden cannot attack air units unless she uses Fan of Knives or Shadow Strike.\nThe Warden is an assassination type Hero that can require a lot of skill to use. Unlike the Demon Hunter, she can't take the same amount of damage before dying. She lacks the Immolation and Evasion abilities and other bonuses that allow the Demon Hunter to survive in melee combat much longer. So the way you play the Warden is a little bit different. She is best played by sending her in to cast Fan of Knives or Shadow Strike, then run or Blink her away once the enemy starts beating on her. She can also assist in melee combat if the enemy is not attacking her. If you don't spend time controlling her and ignore her in battle, she can easily die. But in the right hands of an advanced player, she is very deadly. People find new respect for the Warden.\nIt's best to buy some Healing Potions or Healing Salves to use with the Warden because she quite often is found with low health. You can also send her back to the Moon Wells to heal.\nUnlike the Demon Hunter and Keeper of the Grove, the Warden has Hide! Use this ability during battle when the enemy focuses their attention on her. Then once they move on to other targets, come out of \"cloak\" and attack. You can even Blink away if they continue to surround your Hero.\nSkill point usage is usually Fan of Knives, Blink, Fan of Knives, Blink, Fan of Knives, Vengeance, Blink or Shadow Strike, Blink, Shadow Strike, Blink, Shadow Strike, Vengeance, Blink. A lot of people are seeing the power of Shadow Strike against Heroes and enemy units. You can go Fan of Knives/Shadow Strike and ignore Blink but typically you don't have enough mana for both. Some people go Blink at level 1 then rush the enemy. But this is risky and not always very effective. You can also go for level 3 Blink first instead of Shadow Strike or Fan of Knives to get rid of the 10 second cooldown.\nThe Warden is a GREAT anti-Hero rush Hero when she uses her Shadow Strike. Shadow Strike slows the enemy Hero so you can catch it earlier. It has a damage over time component that continues to hurt a Hero after they teleport away. It also does an initial strike damage! You can even get fancy by Blinking ahead of the enemy, casting Shadow Strike or attacking, then doing it again as the enemy gets further away.\nThe Warden has one of the best ultimate abilities for the Night Elves: Vengeance. In FFA games, or games that go to level 6, you will find this ability very useful. Make sure you run the Avatar of Vengeance away if the enemy targets it.\nSpells and abilities.\nan of Knives.\nThe Warden flings a flurry of knives at multiple enemy targets around her.\nMake sure you use this ability only when the enemy is nearby. It's easy to cast this by mistake otherwise. You cannot aim this ability because it aims itself.\nFan of Knives also damages invisible units around the Warden (but they must be detected to be damaged), this also applies for Burrowed units.\nlink.\nShort distance teleportation that allows the Warden to move in and out of combat.\n-Blink's range is about a half to a full screen radius.\nShaow Strike.\nHurls a poisoned dagger which deals large initial damage, and then deals damage over time.\nThis ability is useful against single powerful targets, especially Heroes. This is an excellent anti-hero ability. If they teleport away, the poison damage is still active and they can die once they arrive at their location! =)\nShadow Strike cannot be removed by Banish. Don't forget, Shadow Strike can hit air units!\nengeance (Ultimate).\nCreates a powerful avatar that summons invulnerable spirits from friendly corpses to attack your enemies."}

While the game is running, Warden uses API function calls to collect data on open programs on the user's computer and sends it back to Blizzard servers as to be compared to those of known cheating programs. Privacy advocates consider the program to be .\nMalware protection.\nIncluded in Warden is a malware detector, that will detect a keylogger that watches the login screen. If a keylogger is detected, and Blizzard has definitions on file for the keylogger, the game will give a warning stating the user's system is infected, and will provide a link to the Blizzard Support pages, which will provide the name of the keylogger along with a list of programs which can remove that keylogger.\nIf a keylogger is proactive enough to attempt to shut down antimalware programs, it will shut down Warden, causing WoW to crash.\nAs of December 2010, Warden can also detect malicious rootkits which can hide keyloggers from antimalware products until the rootkit is removed.\nPrivacy Concerns.\nThe and other groups have labeled Warden as . Blizzard has said that Warden does not gather any personally identifiable information about players other than the account being used. It also states that the data collected is only used for finding evidence of malicious programs and cheating. \n\"The Governor\" is a created by that monitors a portion, but not all, of Warden's activity. Although it may conflict with the World of Warcraft &lt;a href=\"EULA\"&gt;EULA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terms%20of%20Service\"&gt;ToU&lt;/a&gt;, there have been no reports of anyone being banned for using the Governor.\nModeration Bots.\n\"Moderation Bots\" are third-party game clients written to monitor, administer, or moderate in game chat channels. While they are not used for cheating, Warden still disables them. Blizzard's stand on moderation bots calls them \"Third-Party Programs\".\nMDY Industries v. Blizzard Entertainment.\nWarden has been brought to light by Blizzard's lawsuit with MDY Industries, LLC., the creator of the gameplay automation software (more popularly known as WoWGlider or MMOGlider). Blizzard has alleged in legal filings that Warden prevents players from creating unauthorized copies of the game client, which was previously an unknown function. Blizzard makes no mention of its known function of collecting data on open programs. Furthermore, it is actually referred to as \"Warden,\" the first time Blizzard has confirmed its name. \nJudge David Campbell ruled against MDY in July, and agreed with Blizzard\u2019s infringement claims and stated the third party program with World of Warcraft's sales and impacted Blizzard's relationship in a negative fashion with their customers. And now a US district court has awarded Blizzard US$6 million in damages against MDY Industries.\nLegal Notices.\nLegal actions have been taken up against Blizzard's RAM scanning for privacy reasons as far back as its first implementation in the World of Warcraft alpha test to watch if users were breaking their confidentiality contract. Within days of the beta test new lines were added to World of Warcraft's EULA."}

She studied a number of renegade &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, especially their leader &lt;a href=\"Kegan%20Darkmar\"&gt;Kegan Darkmar&lt;/a&gt;, whom she had a growing respect for. She was engaged in studying the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Artifacts\"&gt;Bloodstone Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; that the group of Forsaken carried with them. After what her journal described as a long time, she discovered that the pendant she was working on could drink blood (she discovered this by accidentally cutting herself) and that fire, water, thunder and rock were mixed with the blood within the stone. Lordamere Internment Camp didn't had the manpower or the space to allow her to continue her research, so she decided to send it by courier to Dalaran. The courier never reached Dalaran and the stone was lost with him. Warden Belamoore hoped that the artifact didn't fall into wrong hands.\nBelamoore may have been killed during &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20In\"&gt;Prison Break In&lt;/a&gt;, as she was part of the group that was guarding &lt;a href=\"Kegan%20Darkmar\"&gt;Kegan Darkmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nWarden Belamoore is a stern &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;ess who oversees the &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Internment%20Camp\"&gt;Lordamere Internment Camp&lt;/a&gt;.

She is married to &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt;, the high priest of &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nBeloved by the youth of Zandalar, Wardruid Loti earned her place on the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; through the demands of the next generation of warriors and hunters. Some credit the decision of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt; to allow the Zandalari the worship of many loa, not just himself. This progressive movement, championed in voice by Loti, aided in the resurgence of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism as a cultural mainstay of Zandalar.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; spied reported that dark heresies were being practiced the &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; sent Loti and her husband &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt; to do deal with the situation. Following the arrival of the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; Yazma directed the newly named &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid them as she felt the two were too soft on their own followers and that the Speaker would be more ruthlessly neutral. Loti accepted the aid of Speaker and instructed them to kill &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Cultist\"&gt;Crimson Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s for practicing &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; and to then to tell instruct her husband to get off his perch to help keep the Zanchul secure. For his part Raal was unimpressed with her calling him out and accurately predicting his wife's actions. Declaring such actions barely a half measure Raal explained that the blood magic came from the old ways and had the Speaker join him to patrol the border to &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, so the Speaker could see where the blood magic was coming from. As the patrol came to an end Raal sensed a great power resonating within the Zanchul itself and subsequently sent the Speaker to group with Loti.\nUpon being informed of the situation Loti accused her husband of trying to win the Speaker over and responded by blessing them with the power of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, while instructing them to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodraged%20Pterrordax\"&gt;Bloodraged Pterrordax&lt;/a&gt;es, who were driven mad by some dark ritual, and to shoo away the &lt;a href=\"Pterrordax%20Hatchling\"&gt;Pterrordax Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;s, who were swarming courtyard of Zanchul. Feeling that Loti was more interesting in recruiting than dealing with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; treat, Raal then blessed the Speaker with the power of &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; and instructed them to &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Tombs\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Rites\"&gt;with the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;corrupted guardians&lt;/a&gt;. After discovering the source of the corruption was a ritual in which blood magic heretics were empowering the &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dregada\"&gt;Dregada&lt;/a&gt;, Loti, Raal, and the Speaker united to put the ritual to an end by killing Dregada. With the threat removed Loti declared that while she won't hold a grudge, she'll be damned before letting the Speaker double dip with the loa and called upon them to choose between Gonk and Pa'ku. Should the Speaker pick Gonk Loti would declare that they choose wisely and then directed them to ride with her in order to meet their patron. Despite her declaration she instructed the Speaker to meet with Gonk in the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt;, as she continued to deal with the heretics in the temple. After happily noting that Gonk hadn't ripped out their throat Loti declared it was time to show the public their choice and inform King Rastakhan.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; started his coup he directed his forces to gain control of the Zanchul and in the process Loti was captured. &lt;a href=\"Hexmother%20Kala\"&gt;Hexmother Kala&lt;/a&gt; sought to use &lt;a href=\"Fetish%20of%20Loti\"&gt;Loti's fetish&lt;/a&gt; in order break her will and corrupt her to their cause. However &lt;a href=\"Kaza%27jin%20the%20Wavebinder\"&gt;Kaza'jin the Wavebinder&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the aid of the Speaker in freeing Loti while dealing with the traitors in the Zanchul, to which Loti remarked their deaths werea start. In light of Yazma siding with Zul, Loti ordered for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Yazma\"&gt;Eyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ear%20of%20Yazma\"&gt;Ears&lt;/a&gt; to be dealt with to prevent the rebels from knowing their every move. She also ordered for the death of &lt;a href=\"Crazzak%20the%20Heretic\"&gt;Crazzak the Heretic&lt;/a&gt;, who was using the captured Raal's connection with Pa'ku to weaken the loa.\nAfter Raal revealed that Yazma and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27kaal\"&gt;Vol'kaal&lt;/a&gt; had pulled most of their forces to the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt;, Loti, Raal, and the Speaker headed to there in order to rescue the loa. Feeling that Gonk was in danger Loti declared it was time to repay Gonk for saving her life so many times and headed off to personally rescue Gonk, only to discover that Gonk had personally killed those who had come for him. Loti was stunned after learning that &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; was consumed by Yazma and was horrified to learn that the heresies committed in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, were done in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. Remarking that the Zanchuli Council she instructed the Speaker to inform &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of what had transpired in order to secure &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; support, as she and Raal rallied what support they could before they grouped with Rastakhan at the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoti was among the many who joined the great hunt for Zul and his forces. Discovering that Zul's forces had secured the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Temple of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; Loti directed the Speaker with discovering if Zul had recorded any of his visions. To her surprise not only had Zul recorded them but they revealed that he intended to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the first king of the Zandalari Empire, causing her to wonder if Zul could even be called a Zandalari anymore. After Zul's forces at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Temple of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; were thinned out Loti joined with Raal, who revealed that Rastakhan and &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; had rushed on ahead causing the group to rendezvous with them well giving their king air support. During the confrontation with Zul Rezan was slain which forced the Zandalari forces, Loti among them, into retreat.\nLoti was among the many defenders of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; when Zul, &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;his loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies, &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mythrax%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city as they sought to break the final seal in order to release the &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately the city would be saved, Zul slain, and the seal broken freeing G'huun, who was slain sometime later.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; conferred with her father about how to deal with this new threat. They determined that while Rastakhan would defend the city, Talanji herself would lead the armies of Zandalari against the Alliance. To that end she enlisted the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; with rallying the Zandalari. Loti was among the Zandalari who remained behind with Rastakhan and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the city when Alliance invaded. During the battle, Rastakhan was slain and Loti was among the many to attend his funeral.\nSometime after the death of her father, Talanji created a new Zanchuli Council consisting of Wardruid Loti, &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%27nok%2C%20Bulwark%20of%20Torcali\"&gt;Jo'nok, Bulwark of Torcali&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Vol'kaal), &lt;a href=\"High%20Prelate%20Rata\"&gt;High Prelate Rata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;General Rakera&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Jakra'zet), and &lt;a href=\"Lashk\"&gt;Lashk&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt; to sit on the Council. During the ritual of queens and kings, Loti and the rest of the Council were attacked and imprisoned in webs by &lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;Samara&lt;/a&gt;, the White Widow, as they were giving Talanji their blessings. Upon the death of Samara, the Zanchuli Council was freed and finished their blessings, after which Talanji moved forward. After Talanji passed the rest of her trials, she was declared the Queen of Zandalar and formally joined the Horde as its equal. Following these events, Loti declared that while Talanji tolled away at restoring their empire, the Zanchuli Council had been tasked with seeing that the faithful of Zandalar gave her the time to do so. Though acknowledging how there are still whispers of doubt among the priesthood, Loti was confident that they would see Talanji's worth as a leader as she has done.\nDragonflight.\nLoti traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shady Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and is seen at &lt;a href=\"Greenscale%20Inn\"&gt;Greenscale Inn&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;, a follower of Gonk.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; claimed the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, she aided the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in reclaiming it.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Loti serves as the champion of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;'s Raptors, a dinosaur-themed team of troll &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and appears as .

The machinery is noisier than a hundred engines, so it's gonna attract some unwanted attention.\nBig thing is slow to recover after it breaks, too.

The objective will be taking down the enemy Commander, but be aware as there are different types of commanders.

Since patch 3.2.0, the spell no longer needs mana to summon the warhorse. It was previously awarded by a quest for free but was then changed to be bought with gold like any other mount.\nThis was once again changed with the release of Mists of Pandaria; the mount-summoning spells are learned automatically, just like all other spells for the class.\nDescription.\nPossessed of a noble spirit and deceptive intelligence uncommon among its kind, the warhorse is a regal charger that only the most inspiring of paladins can call to service. Once it pledges its service to a worthy master, the warhorse holds to its responsibility as a loyal mount and steadfast companion with a devotion that cannot be found in its lesser cousins. The paladins warhorse is more than a steed; it is a tireless cohort for its valorous master, carrying the paladin across Azeroth on a ceaseless crusade to vanquish evil wherever it may lurk.\nForsaken Warhorse.\nThe Forsaken warhorses are used in name only.

They are magical practitioners that seek to understand darker &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-based and destructive spells. While many warlocks willingly follow the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, there are those who work against it, using their magic to fight against evil. They have proven themselves to be powerful allies, as well as powerful foes, and are known to be interested in seeking power in the darkest of places and making bargains most people in their right minds wouldn't make.\nWarlocks burn and destroy weakened foes with a combination of crippling illnesses and dark magic. While their &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; pets protect and enhance them, they strike at their enemies from a distance. As physically weak spellcasters bereft of heavy armor, cunning warlocks allow their minions to take the brunt of enemy attacks in order to save their own skin. They deliver fire and shadow damage with their spells, and they're able to hurt others both instantly and with ongoing afflictions. Warlocks are adept at summoning their allies to their presence, whether said allies are other heroes or bloodthirsty demons. Warlocks bind demons to their will: these infernal denizens defend their masters with their lives or rain death upon their enemies. They also make use of debilitating curses to weaken and disable enemies, reducing their ability to fight back.\nWarlock talents can improve the damage of their searing magics, increase the potency of their curses and persistent damaging spells, and empower their demonic servants:\nClass overview.\n\"Warlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of &lt;a href=\"spellcaster\"&gt;spellcaster&lt;/a&gt;s. Though they often pledge themselves to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest allies. Warlocks peer into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle\u2014their greatest abilities are fueled by the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s they've harvested from their victims. They exploit powerful Shadow magic to manipulate and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They employ Fire magic, dropping hellish rain from the sky, to immolate the opposition. They summon and command indomitable &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to do their bidding, or even to be sacrificed as the Warlock sees fit, empowering and protecting the dark caster from harm.\"\nGame guide.\n\"In the face of demonic power, most heroes see death. Warlocks see only opportunity. Dominance is their aim, and they have found a path to it in the dark arts. These voracious spellcasters summon demonic minions to fight beside them. At first, they command only the service of imps, but as a warlock's knowledge grows, seductive succubi, loyal voidwalkers, and horrific felhunters join the dark sorcerer's ranks to wreak havoc on anyone who stands in their master's way. Warlocks can ignite distant enemies in searing flame, send them fleeing in terror and pain, or afflict them with corrupting diseases and curses that steal the victim's vitality.\"\n\"These practitioners of the profane are feared across Azeroth, and many who have felt their wrath now prefer to fight alongside a warlock than against one.\"\n\"Warlocks burn and destroy weakened foes with a combination of crippling illnesses and dark magic. While their &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; pets protect and enhance them, warlocks strike at their enemies from a distance. As physically weak spellcasters bereft of heavy armor, cunning warlocks allow their minions to take the brunt of enemy attacks in order to save their own skin.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\" Warlocks are the bane of all life. Empowered by demonic blood, they can inflict great torment upon their foes. To replenish the dreadful energy their spells expend, warlocks drain vitality from their victims. The warlock can also summon and control terrifying demonic entities. Still, warlocks are feared above all else for their singular wickedness and cruelty.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Utilizing forbidden sorcery to wreak havoc on their enemies, Warlocks commune with dark powers that enable them to summon demons, curse foes, and channel destructive magics.\"\nBackground.\nBefore the Dark Portal.\nThe first known &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; whispered to and instructed in the art of summoning demons and using &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was at this time an apprentice under him, but ultimately betrayed him to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Duumvirate\"&gt;Second Duumvirate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;), guaranteeing his rise to power, and would eventually be the first to accept &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; among the eredar.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; societies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, there were legends among the populace of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Days\"&gt;First Days&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s roamed free and great heroes arose to drive them out. Knowing the real truth, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; forbade demonology\u2014any attempt to summon demons were to be found and stopped at once, often by force. As such, demons had a limited public impact on the people of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, mostly existing through rumors and folk legends. Most situations involving demon worship ended up taken care of by local authorities, with individuals such as teenagers indulging in magicks they didn't understand or venal farmhands and greedy merchants committing sacrifices and other foul acts in the name of some old demon whose name they couldn't even properly pronounce after hearing their whispers in their sleep. Real ceremonies involving demon summoning and &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; spells did happen, such as with the case of &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Jortas\"&gt;Jortas&lt;/a&gt;, but they were secretly neutralized by the efforts of the Kirin Tor and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. In time however, some of those mages charged with hunting demons turned to the dark arts themselves, and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; fought against some of the greatest spellcasters of her age when they fell into demonic lore.\nOn the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; himself created a new generation of warlocks by instructing the orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; in the use of fel and demonic magics. The demon lord first targeted &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, a weak and crippled orc who the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; had refused, offering him a taste of shadowy power. The orc became an avid student of demonic magic and developed into the most powerful mortal warlock in history. He then faked becoming the apprentice of the elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, who himself ultimately resisted the eredar lord's promises of untold power. But Gul'dan still taught other orcs the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts and strove to eradicate the orcs' shamanistic traditions. Gul'dan showed this new brand of magic to his brethren, a terrible new power that reeked of doom. Kil'jaeden, seeking to tighten his hold over the orcs, helped Gul'dan found the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, a secretive sect that manipulated the clans and spread the use of warlock magics throughout Draenor. The first orc warlocks other than Gul'dan were from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, but more and more shaman volunteered for warlock training once they stopped hearing from the elements after they had started &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genociding the draenei&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; also ordered the new warlocks to artificially age every orcish child in order to bolster the ranks of the nascent &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with a plethora of fresh soldiers. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade. Over time, the vast prairies the orcs had called home for generations withered away, leaving only red barren soil. The demon energies were slowly killing the world.\nNot all orc warlocks joined the Shadow Council. Some, such as &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, stayed loyal to their clans instead.\nFirst War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the warlocks were the most powerful of the orcish sects. These dark brethren went where no others dared in search of ultimate power. Their &lt;a href=\"Tower%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt; held the keys to unleashing the very essence of evil upon those they saw as a threat to their devious plans. Spells that channeled fire, brimstone, and shadow through their bodies, or could summon forth great creatures - even &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;daemons&lt;/a&gt; - were theirs to use.\nThere are references to a &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20clan\"&gt;Warlock clan&lt;/a&gt;, though they may be euphemisms for more formally named clans, such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, who included warlocks in their ranks. They may refer to the warlock class as a group, separate from their clan membership.\nSecond War.\nMost warlocks of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; were slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; later transferred some of their spirits into the first &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, while the magical energies of other long dead warlocks were infused into the bodies of the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;.\nFew living warlocks had survived Doomhammer's rampage. Most of them joined Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought alongside death knights in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;battle for Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;. Other warlocks were involved in the creation of the first &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe orcs of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; also learned of Doomhammer's defeat of the Shadow Council. This resulted in a purge of the warlock and dark magic user ranks on Draenor too, as the Draenic orcs feared they would afflict any more of them.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, orc warlocks could still be found among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; (notably the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Warlocks\"&gt;Blackrock Warlocks&lt;/a&gt;) and of the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver exiles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWarlocks would remain shunned and hunted out by society until after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, where their expertise on demonic subjects would be employed for the good of their respective factions. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as such began pressing warlocks into their service. Although many societies considered such dark arts disreputable, their efficacy in combat was considered undeniable. Most warlocks still kept practicing their arts in secret within hidden enclaves so that they could escape the prejudice of the public, however.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Baurles%20K.%20Wishock\"&gt;Lord Wishock&lt;/a&gt; was made aware of the warlock coven under the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Lamb\"&gt;Slaughtered Lamb&lt;/a&gt;, he lobbied for a full investigation and closure of the tavern. &lt;a href=\"Zardeth%20of%20the%20Black%20Claw\"&gt;Zardeth of the Black Claw&lt;/a&gt;, however, implied that the noble was actually trying to shut the establishment down in order to avoid paying his tab there. In the end, the warlocks had Lord Wishock assassinated.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, all warlocks were trained under the auspices of the masters of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the fall of the city, they were all forced to relocate into a \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Forlorn%20Cavern\"&gt;rat's hole&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and to send their novices to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for training as &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; decided to keep a careful watch on them.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, warlocks operated discreetly in the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Neeru%20Fireblade\"&gt;Neeru Fireblade&lt;/a&gt; was a warlock who claimed not to wish to destroy the Horde from within or gain control over it, but he was secretly an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; knew about this and tolerated his presence in order to fool him and better watch over him.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, demons were more accepted than elsewhere, as the succubus &lt;a href=\"Nimrida\"&gt;Nimrida&lt;/a&gt; was walking with her master &lt;a href=\"Keyanomir\"&gt;Keyanomir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Murder%20Row\"&gt;Murder Row&lt;/a&gt; of the city.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, warlocks were still considered as pariahs, operating in the shadows of polite society, but were now starting to be respected on the battlefronts.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, six of the greatest warlocks gathered together to make a pact stipulating they share the knowledge they gathered and innovated from the defeat of their powerful enemies. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; was created to teach all warlocks advanced forms of magic stolen from the adventurers' defeated foes, learning from the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, the demons of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s transformation.\nWhen he created the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; sent his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; guard led by &lt;a href=\"Ureda%20of%20the%20Black%20Flame\"&gt;Ureda of the Black Flame&lt;/a&gt; to have most of Orgrimmar's warlocks executed for being demon worshippers.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, warlocks were originally forbidden in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but trained a whole generation of warlocks to marshal against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, first as members of the and then as Iron servants of the Legion. The are also referred to as warlocks, using the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; to bind souls and control the undead.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the warlocks of Azeroth united against the Legion via the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; once used by the first warlock &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20the%20Man%27ari\"&gt;Skull of the Man'ari&lt;/a&gt; that still retained &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt;'s soul, and &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt; that belonged to the first &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt;. They would go on to conquer &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Banehollow\"&gt;Lord Banehollow&lt;/a&gt; disguised himself as &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Shadow\"&gt;Madam Shadow&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt; and lured new warlocks to his side, posing as a teacher, but in order to obtain their souls. After his true identity was revealed, the nathrezim announced that he had already stolen the souls of thousands of warlocks on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and wouldn't stop, but was ultimately defeated by a warlock &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; before he could enact his plans.\nAbilities.\nSummoning.\nWarlocks are adept at summoning their allies to their presence, whether said allies are other heroes or bloodthirsty demons. Warlocks bind demons to their will: these infernal denizens defend their masters with their lives or rain death upon their enemies.\nWarlocks have access to spells that summon these demonic entities: \nIn addition to these normal minions, the warlocks can summon two greater demons to defend them for a short time or as permanent pets.\nThe warlock can also summon demonic horses into their service as mounts:\nWarlocks may also use &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslave Demon&lt;/a&gt; on some demons, forcing them to serve as minions with their own special set of abilities for a short time.\nRanged Damage.\nWarlocks deliver fire and shadow damage with their spells, and they're able to hurt others both instantly and with ongoing afflictions.\nDemonic Resources.\nWarlocks make use of burning embers, demonic fury or soul shards to empower their spells, making them swifter or more deadly.\nRaces.\nThe warlock class can be played by the following races:\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%2010.1.5\"&gt;Patch 10.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, all races and allied races (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;) can play as warlocks.\nRacial traits.\nEach race comes with its own &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s. Below is a brief list of the traits that interact directly with the warlock's abilities, playstyle and needs in specific situations; other racials are not listed. For a complete list, see &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Human%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Void%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Void elf&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mechagnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vulpera%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Vulpera&lt;/a&gt;\nSpecializations.\nAffliction.\nA master of shadow magic who specializes in drains and damage-over-time spells.\nAffliction warlocks are the masters of damage over time spells, plaguing their enemies with an array of &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s. Affliction warlocks can afflict their foes with DoTs such as &lt;a href=\"Agony\"&gt;Agony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corruption\"&gt;Corruption&lt;/a&gt;. Affliction warlocks' periodic effects are further improved by their &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt; and through their powerful artifact weapon. Affliction warlocks gain &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt; as a secondary &lt;a href=\"resource%20mechanics\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;, which are necessary to cast certain spells.\n\"Affliction warlocks are masters of shadow-touched powers, but unlike &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Shadow\"&gt;shadow priests&lt;/a&gt;\u2014deadliest when pushed to the brink of insanity\u2014these warlocks delight in using fel forces to cause intense pain and suffering in others. They revel in corrupting minds and agonizing souls, leaving enemies in a state of torment that would see them undone in due time. Even the most battle-hardened warriors can be deceived, landing blow after blow against the warlock, only to succumb to their suffering as their very vitality is siphoned away by the dark spellcaster.\"\nDemonology.\nA master of demons who compels demonic powers to aid him.\nDemonology warlocks summon and enslave demons in order to crush their foes. As well as improving their damage and survivability, these warlocks' demonic mastery empowers their minions (, &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Rebirth\"&gt;Demonic Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;) and grants them new demons to command (&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Imps\"&gt;Wild Imps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Felguard\"&gt;Summon Felguard&lt;/a&gt;). Demonology warlocks wield a mixture of Shadow, Fire and &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; damage to immolate and corrupt their enemies.\n\"By their very nature, demons are leeches on the living universe\u2014but the demonologist has mastered harnessing the power of these malefic beings on the field of battle. Warlocks harvest the souls of their defeated enemies; those specialized in the ways of demonology use this life essence to tap into the Void, pulling all manner of abomination from the chaos of the Twisting Nether. While such a practice is often considered by outsiders to be wicked and reckless, the demonologist maintains absolute control over the summoned creatures. These malignant entities are fully beholden to\u2014and empowered by\u2014the will of the warlock, until banished to the realm from whence they came.\"\nDestruction.\nA master of chaos who calls down fire to burn and demolish enemies.\nDestruction warlocks focus on demolishing opponents with fast and powerful direct damage spells. They use the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt; generated by their spells to fuel their most powerful attacks, deal splash damage and even restore health. With enviable abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Shadowburn\"&gt;Shadowburn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Havoc\"&gt;Havoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;Chaos Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, Destruction warlocks can rapidly reduce unprepared opponents to a pile of cinders.\n\"Warlocks who command the power of destruction favor incantations of pure chaos and aggression in battle. In this regard, they'd find a stronger kinship with fire &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s than warlocks of other disciplines\u2014if not for their propensity to make use of magic deemed detestable by all mage orders. The destruction warlock is well-versed in discharging a dizzying array of shadow, fel, fire, and chaos magics upon opponents that rattle souls and conflagrate bodies. They require little motivation for the havoc they wreak, happy to revel in the destruction they cause\u2014thrilled at any opportunity to watch the world erupt in discord around them.\"\nEnd-game expectations.\nWarlocks are taken to &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s for their incredible DPS and their raid utility. Warlocks are usually one of the highest sources of ranged DPS and also possess an array of utilities such as using &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Ritual of Summoning&lt;/a&gt; for late comers, casting &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; for combat resurrections, and distributing &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;. Warlocks are also well known for their &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn PvP, Warlocks are incredibly useful as a support class for &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Corruption\"&gt;Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Bane of Agony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Affliction\"&gt;Unstable Affliction&lt;/a&gt; spread between multiple player targets are excellent at generating pressure for opposing teams. &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Affliction\"&gt;Unstable Affliction&lt;/a&gt; also provides opponents with a hefty penalty for spam-&lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;ling &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"felhunter\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt; also provides excellent anti-caster and anti-healer abilities with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Lock\"&gt;Spell Lock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devour%20Magic\"&gt;Devour Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, they are infamous for their PvP &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Howl%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Howl of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Coil\"&gt;Mortal Coil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt; is also an iconic and powerful contribution to any group.\nWarlocks are renowned for their damage over time (DoT) spells and sinister &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; magic, as well for summoning demonic &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;s and their ability to wreak havoc with destructive &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; spells. Warlocks can specialize in any of these areas: &lt;a href=\"%23Affliction\"&gt;Affliction&lt;/a&gt; warlocks are the masters of damage over time, draining their targets' health with an array of powerful debuffs; &lt;a href=\"%23Demonology\"&gt;Demonology&lt;/a&gt; warlocks summon improved demons to do their bidding, drawing power from their minions; &lt;a href=\"%23Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; warlocks call down a rain of fire upon their enemies, specializing in potent burst damage and Fire spells.\nBeing a warlock demands certain things: being able to engage multiple targets simultaneously while keeping tabs on your minion, to make split-second strategic decisions on cast rotations depending on the situation, and careful resource and cooldown management. Being a warlock also offers many rewards: they are PvP powerhouses due to their powerful crowd-control and sustained damage abilities, and in PvE their damage output is among the highest in both single and multiple target situations.\nExternal links.\n "}

It is this destructive power that the Orcish Warlocks use in their incantations and rituals. As the most powerful of the Orcish sects, these dark brethren of Hades go where none others dare in search of ultimate power. Their &lt;a href=\"Tower%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Towers&lt;/a&gt; hold the keys to unleashing the very essence of evil upon those they see as a threat to their devious plans. Spells that channel the fire and brimstone of hell through their bodies, or can summon forth great creatures - even &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;daemons&lt;/a&gt; - are theirs to use.\nInformation.\nWarlocks are the most advanced unit, such that they can even summon new units. They are quite weak and vulnerable, and chances are that they will die if a melee unit manages to get close to them, so they must be protected. Warlocks are very expensive and easy to kill, so sometimes it is better to leave them at the base and make them summon &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s from there.\nWarlocks use Mana to cast spells. Mana will slowly regenerate over time, up to a maximum of 255.\nSpells.\nThe fires of hell rise up to meet the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20clan\"&gt;Warlock clan&lt;/a&gt;. Their sorceries are rooted in the deepest pits of the underworld, and their command over flame and the monstrosities they create is a cause for great fear to their victims.\nFireball.\nThe basic fire spell which all followers of the Orcish cults (the underworld) first learn. It channels the flames of Hades through the caster's body, allowing the wielder to direct it as a missile at anyone he chooses. It is a dangerous magik to employ, but the effects seem to delight even the lowest circle of Warlock to no end.\nSummon Spider.\nThe Warlock calls forth hordes of deadly, poisonous spiders to aid him. Several spiders come at any one summoning, and will swarm over the enemy as the caster directs. They crawl through gaps in the enemies armor and bite them with their poisoned fangs, injecting their deadly juices into the bloodstream. As the enemy falls to the ground, he literally burns from within.\nPoison Cloud.\nThe caster creates a cloud comprised of brimstone, acid, and poisonous gases to envelop and choke his targets. This foul stench eats through anything that stands in its way, and chokes the very life out of anyone unlucky enough to be in its path. It is a mix of the sickly stench of rotting corpses and the essence of evil, designed to decay and corrode all that it comes in contact with.\nSummon Daemon.\nThe most powerful spell ever rumored to exist. Legends say that the caster would have the ability to summon forth a &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt; by allowing his body to be sacrificed to enable its existence in this plane. The daemon would then be guided by the spirit of the caster to do his bidding, but should the daemon be destroyed, the warlock's life would be forfeit. The truth to this tale is questionable, but the incantations and rituals used to summon the creature may lay in some lost runic writings. The dream of every follower of the underworld is to rediscover these incantations and be able to command the power of the Daemon."}

{"id": "130542", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=130542", "title": "Warlock races", "text": "This article lists the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to become warlocks, along with the lore behind each. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.1.5\"&gt;patch 10.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, every playable race, with the notable exception of the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, may follow the path of the warlock.\nAlliance.\nHuman warlocks.\nNo matter how learned and knowledgeable, how wise and wonderful, how powerful and puissant, there is always one more sliver of power, one more bit of knowledge, one more secret to be learned by any mage. The &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, a well of &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;, was a gate to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the ethereal dimension of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. When the well exploded, the magical energies within scattered to the four corners of the earth, in an eternal rain of magic. Now the gate was not a single great well of power, but rather an infinite rain that continues to fall even today. The first human &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s began scratching at the doors of reality, beginning to summon creatures from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;, prying at the shut gates of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s prison. That was when those &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; who had survived and changed themselves came forward with the story of how their ancestors had almost destroyed the world. They considered what the surviving elves had said, and realized that even were they to lay down their wands and grimoires and ciphers, that others would seek, innocently or less so, ways to allow the demons access once more to their green lands. \nSome say demons come to the weak-willed in their sleep and urge them to find old spells and make sacrifices. Sometimes it is to open the way for demons to come back fully. Others say demons want worshipers and sacrifices to make this world like it once was, bloody and violent, and only then would they return. But the assumption that the demons' victims are weak-willed is in error. There are more than enough venal farmhands who invoke a demonic force for revenge against a former lover, or stupid merchants who burns an invoice from a debtor with a black candle, badly mangling the ancient name of some once-great demonic power. But just as often there are those who walk willingly to the abyss, who feel themselves safe and sure and knowledgeable that they are beyond any blandishment or threat, that they are powerful enough to harness the demonic energies that surge beyond the walls of the world. They are in many ways even more dangerous than the common rabble.\nMages such as &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; believed the orcs' warlocks wielded great power, power against which they had precious little defense. Others like him might have believed (and still might believe) that they have an obligation to learn to wield and counter the warlocks' magics themselves.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; human warlocks practice their craft in secret underneath the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Lamb\"&gt;Slaughtered Lamb&lt;/a&gt;. To &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;, the king of Stormwind, it was always uneasy when those who worked with demons were pressed into service for the good of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but they had certain spells\u2014and certain creatures in thrall\u2014whose efficacy was undeniable.\nGnome warlocks.\nIn times past, all warlocks in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; were trained under the auspices of the masters of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the fall of the city, they were all forced to relocate into a \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Forlorn%20Cavern\"&gt;rat's hole&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and to send their novices to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for training as &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt; decided to keep a careful watch on them.\nGnomes might have been the first among the races of the Alliance to study the dark arts, as their generally empiricist attitude and comparative moral leniency would lend themselves to studying demonic power as easily as anything else. Additionally, the Dark Iron clan might have influenced the gnomes slightly, as their shadowy sorcery was present in Khaz Modan since before the War of Three Hammers.\nDwarf warlocks.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Gakin%20the%20Darkbinder\"&gt;Gakin the Darkbinder&lt;/a&gt;, not many dwarves choose the path of the warlock, even going so far as to call a dwarven warlock \"somewhat of an anomaly\".\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were likely influenced to become warlocks by the newly indoctrinated &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. They were also likely taught by their Gnomish and Human allies. Many dwarves have been shown to use shadow and fire magic already, which proves that they may have already known much about being a warlock.\nWorgen warlocks.\nIt is possible that a worgen might take up the warlock arts in order to trade the worgen curse for a different curse.\nAs they were once humans, it is likely that they resumed practicing the dark arts as Worgen. The kingdom's isolation may have also contributed to the appearance of dark magi in Gilnean society, who eventually turned towards demonic powers.\nHorde.\nOrc warlocks.\nThe origin of orc warlocks lies with &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the orcs the secrets of warlock magics. The most spiritual of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s orcs were the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, which was led by the orc shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul was Gul'dan's mentor, and he taught the young Gul'dan how to harness the elements. Gul'dan was a talented pupil, and with his intelligence and cunning he took to shamanism readily. Gul'dan's hunger for power only grew when he encountered the demon lord, Kil'jaeden. Gul'dan was promised unfathomable power in the form of mastery over &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic\u2014the ways of the warlock. Under his tutelage Gul'dan became an avid student of demonic magic. During the orcs' war with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; realized that the elements no longer heeded their call. As a result, Gul'dan showed a new brand of magic to his brethren, a terrible new power that reeked of doom, while striving to eradicate the orcs' shamanistic traditions. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade. Over time, the vast prairies the orcs had called home for generations withered away, leaving only red barren soil. The demon energies were slowly killing the world. The orc clans began fighting amongst themselves for resources. As fel abilities are fueled by the destruction of life the warlocks feared that no Orc would be left alive. This would serve to upset the delicate balance that allowed them to control the powers that they held in check and called upon to work their magiks.\nGul'dan was eventually contacted by the corrupted Guardian of Tirisfal, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who was possessed by the spirit of the Dark Titan, Sargeras. Medivh promised Gul'dan untold power if he helped him destroy the humans and reclaim Sargeras' body. Gul'dan eventually ordered stonemasons to build a portal that would allow the orcs to travel to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh's home world, and thus the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; begun. Medivh was eventually discovered to be possessed by Sargeras by his friends &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, and was killed. However, prior to Medivh's death, Gul'dan probed Medivh's mind and discovered the location of &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras' tomb&lt;/a&gt;, and was sent into a coma as a result of being inside of Medivh's mind at the time of his death. While Gul'dan was in a coma, his puppet, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, who was the voice of the Orcish Horde, was killed by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and had his position as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; usurped. As an act of revenge, Orgrim killed the majority of Warlocks who destroyed their home world with their dark magic and for killing his friend &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, and a few lesser Warlocks remained, but when Gul'dan betrayed Orgrim on the eve of their final battle against the humans to gain the power Medivh promised him, all Gul'dan found was death, and Orgrim decided to chase Gul'dan and punish him and his followers for their betrayal, costing them the war, thus the amount of orc warlocks left was shortened.\nAn orc named &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; ascended to the position of Warchief of the orcs and banned the use of warlock magic and necromancy but eventually allowed warlocks to practice their art. For a time &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; had a unit of warlocks in his army but eventually he stopped employing them, possibly believing that they seek nothing more for orcs to renew their dependence of their foul magics. He eventually had warlocks executed in the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndead warlocks.\nThe majority of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; warlocks were most likely humans of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordareon&lt;/a&gt; who were afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. When the Lich King's power over the undead was slipping the Banshee Queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; gathered those undead who possess free will and formed the Forsaken. Despite being freed from Arthas' control the undead warlock &lt;a href=\"Maximillion\"&gt;Maximillion&lt;/a&gt; believes that the Forsaken are still slaves but to a different master, which is a sentiment that might be shared with others. Those Forsaken who pick up the warlock arts might do so in order to feel like they're in control, seeking to have creatures serve them. Many members of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; are warlocks or those who study demonic blood, which appears to have necromantic properties. In fact, it was the warlock &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt; who collected the ingredients that formed the grim Plague used at the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome, if not all, undead might pick up the warlock arts in order to feel more alive: Even the dead might feel alive, with the warlocks' power coursing through them. Undead warlocks have to tread very carefully when dealing with sacrificial magics though, their souls are imperfectly attached to their bodies as it is. \nBlood elf warlocks.\nMany of the stoic &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, reeling from the loss of their ancient homeland, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, have given in to their hatred and despair and embraced the dark side of their magical natures. Calling themselves 'Blood Elves' - these cold hearted refugees seek to expand their remaining magical powers at any cost - even if it means courting the infernal powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;! The blood elves began to turn to the darkest parts of magic, abandoning the water and frost spells of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; for the fire and heat of what some people fear to be demonic magic.\nThe blood elves had taken the ways of demons to fight demons\u2014indeed, actually draining the magic from the demons like leeches. The blood elven prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; heard &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;'s claim that the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; could help the blood elves with their addiction to arcane magic. His people were suffering greatly and felt that he had little choice but to search for Illidan in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; alongside Vashj. They discovered that Illidan had been captured by &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj and Kael'thas worked together to free Illidan, and then Kael'thas beseeched Illidan for a cure to the blood elves' addiction to magic. Illidan had a different proposal in mind, though: in return for the blood elves' loyalty, he would teach them how to drain arcane magic from other sources, including demons, and thereby feed their painful addiction. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, who was in Outland with Kael'thas, was sent back to Azeroth, spreading the teachings of Illidan. As the blood elves drew upon demonic energies it would make sense that the blood elves had warlocks summon and enslave demons which would be used to supply the blood elves with magic.\nTroll warlocks.\nTroll warlocks date back to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demoniac\"&gt;demoniac&lt;/a&gt;s, who seek to embody power outright and not just possess it. While warlocks tread dangerous ground in dealing with demons, demoniacs take it one step further. They allow demons to enter their bodies through an ancient and arcane ritual. Rather than let demons possess them, the demoniacs enslave the demons from the inside, absorbing the power of the beast for their own command. It is a feat very few are able to master and more than one has lost the fight, but the power they are able to unleash is worth the sacrifice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls were once part of\u2014contained warlocks such as &lt;a href=\"Hukku\"&gt;Hukku&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoblin warlocks.\nSome Goblins see fel energy as a cheap and renewable resource and are willing to sell their eternal soul for the path of the warlock.\nOther warlock races.\nOgre warlocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;Ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; are rather common among the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20warlocks%23Types\"&gt;generic warlocks&lt;/a&gt; encountered in the world.\nHigh elf warlocks.\nThere also were high elf warlocks working for &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; is a warlock trainer, showing some high elves use warlock magic without defecting to the blood elf cause.\nSome high elves turned to this path after their glorious home of Quel'Thalas was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. This new breed of warlock seeks to control the powers that ravaged their homeland and use them for vengeance."}

Demon trainers offer warlocks the opportunity to randomly generate a new name for any of their primary demons at a cost of a time per minion. This is achieved by obliterating the existing minion, allowing the warlock to summon a new demon in its place.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, demon trainers were actually &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"grimoire\"&gt;grimoire&lt;/a&gt;s, used for training &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s. Grimoires are not available anymore, since all demon abilities and spells are automatically learned as pets gain levels.\nA general rule of thumb for finding the local Warlock trainer is to search the city's shadier establishments. Tucked away in dark streets and buildings are what you seek. Unsurprisingly, most guards provide directions to Warlock trainers with suspicion and contempt. "}

{"id": "12912", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12912", "title": "Blacksmithing", "text": "Blacksmithing is a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; and is the art of forging items out of &lt;a href=\"metal\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"trade%20good\"&gt;trade good&lt;/a&gt;s. Blacksmiths utilize bars of metal unearthed and smelted by the &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; profession along with various trade and magical goods to produce their wares. \nA blacksmith can create melee weapons, Mail and Plate armor, trade items used as ingredients by other professions (such as rods for &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanters&lt;/a&gt;), as well as keys used to unlock a variety of items in the world. Additionally, blacksmiths can craft consumable items that when applied to weapons can provide temporary (and in some cases, permanent) buffs to items. This generally includes &lt;a href=\"sharpening%20stone\"&gt;sharpening stone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"weightstone\"&gt;weightstone&lt;/a&gt;s. While Blacksmiths can create a variety of items, they generally cannot repair these items themselves when &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;damaged&lt;/a&gt;, and must still use the services of a repair vendor. The Master's Hammer is a Dragonflight-era exception, as a consumable that allows the Blacksmith to repair plate items. The profession can also create the &lt;a href=\"Inflatable%20Mount%20Shoes\"&gt;Inflatable Mount Shoes&lt;/a&gt; item as &lt;a href=\"mount%20equipment\"&gt;mount equipment&lt;/a&gt;, and has one &lt;a href=\"profession%20mounts\"&gt;profession mount&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, blacksmithing mainly benefits plate-wearing classes for the unique armors that can be created. This effectively means only the plate-wearing classes (&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s) will derive the maximum benefit from the crafted armor of blacksmithing. However, most classes can use a large amount of the weapons produced by blacksmiths. Blacksmiths can produce not only Swords, Maces, and Axes in both single and two-handed variants, but Fist Weapons, Shields, Daggers, and some Polearms. Blacksmithing is popularly paired with &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; as a second primary profession. It should be noted however, that Mining is \"not\" a prerequisite for the blacksmithing profession, it just makes leveling the profession cheaper.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Kul tiran human&lt;/a&gt; get a small racial &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Bonus%20to%20profession%20skill\"&gt;bonus to Blacksmithing skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Blacksmiths utilize their expertise with hammer and anvil to craft deadly weapons, heavy suits of mail and plate armor, and other, more specialized items. Talented Blacksmiths can also modify their own equipment by adding sockets for magical gems. The gear that they make allows Blacksmiths (particularly those that equip heavy armor) to outfit themselves, equip party members or guildmates, and sell their craftsmanship via the auction house.\n\"The majority of blacksmithing work must be done with a hammer and anvil. Smithing anvils (and forges to smelt minerals) can be found in most towns and cities.\n\"Blacksmithing is often paired with the gathering profession Mining, since minerals recovered from mineral veins are a key component of most weapons and armor.\"\nTraining as a Blacksmith.\nBlacksmithing is taught by various blacksmithing trainers located throughout the world. Prospective blacksmiths must be at least level 5. Initial training costs , granting the Apprentice level with a potential skill of 75 and access to &lt;a href=\"apprentice%20blacksmithing%20plans\"&gt;apprentice blacksmithing plans&lt;/a&gt; taught by trainers, or found throughout the world. Most recipes require the use of a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Hammer\"&gt;blacksmith hammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. However, some products (such as &lt;a href=\"Rough%20Sharpening%20Stone\"&gt;Rough Sharpening Stone&lt;/a&gt;, for example) do not.\nThe following is a breakdown of Blacksmithing by expansion:\nAdvancing as a Blacksmith.\nCrafting items is the only way to progress through the stages. Plans will appear as one of four colors in the profession window, with a certain chance for a skill up (gaining a point):\nAs blacksmithing skill increases, plans will eventually change from orange to yellow, yellow to green and green to grey. Only by finding higher skill plans can one continue to progress through the profession. Approximately every 5-10 points, new plans will become available to learn from the trainers. Alternatively, plans can be looted from corpses, given as quest rewards, or can be purchased either from vendors, or from the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. All plans have a requisite blacksmithing skill to be able to be learned and manufactured. Additionally, some plans cannot be learned until you have a certain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; standing with a given &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlacksmithing Specialization.\nAs of WoW &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; the blacksmithing specializations of Armorsmith and Weaponsmith have been removed from the game. However, there is an &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing%20Specialization\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; to preserve the information relevant to the now-deprecated &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing%20Specialization\"&gt;Blacksmithing Specialization&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlacksmithing specializations returned in .\nSocketing.\nBlacksmiths can also create belt buckles, which can be traded to non-blacksmiths. Belt buckles add a permanent extra &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; socket to level-appropriate waist-slot items:\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, Blacksmiths could permanently add sockets to their own bracers and gloves, which became available at Blacksmithing skill level 400. This previously required &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Bar\"&gt;Saronite Bar&lt;/a&gt;s, but with the advent of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; this was changed to 4 x &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Flux\"&gt;Strong Flux&lt;/a&gt;. A player had to maintain at least 400 Blacksmithing or the socket became inactive."}

{"id": "316749", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=316749", "title": "Blacksmithing specialization", "text": "\"As of WoW patch 4.0.1 the blacksmithing specializations of Armorsmith and Weaponsmith have been removed from the game. The purpose of this article is only to preserve the information relevant to the now-deprecated Blacksmithing Specialization.\"\nBlacksmithing Specialization.\nAt skill level 200 and character level 40, Blacksmiths can choose to specialize as an Armorsmith or a Weaponsmith. Weaponsmiths can later further specialize into hammer, axe or swordsmiths. Many of the most powerful weapons and armor created by these specialists can only be wielded by other weaponsmiths/armorsmiths or by the smith who made the item.\nBecoming an Armorsmith or Weaponsmith.\nBecoming an &lt;a href=\"Artisan%20Armorsmith\"&gt;Artisan Armorsmith&lt;/a&gt; gives you access to a number of new, powerful armor recipes. Specializing in &lt;a href=\"Artisan%20Weaponsmith\"&gt;Artisan Weaponsmith&lt;/a&gt;ing grants access to devastating weapons not normally available. Base prerequisites are character level 40 and a blacksmithing skill of 200. Choosing to specialize as an armorsmith will preclude you from specializing in weaponsmithing and vice versa. Horde players must first speak with &lt;a href=\"Krathok%20Moltenfist\"&gt;Krathok Moltenfist&lt;/a&gt;, to start the quest chain for becoming an Armorsmith or a Weaponsmith while Alliance players must speak with &lt;a href=\"Myolor%20Sunderfury\"&gt;Myolor Sunderfury&lt;/a&gt; to start the Alliance versions of the same quests. Theye will both direct you to the appropriate quest giver behind them.\nChanging Specialties.\nBlacksmithing specialties can be changed at the trainers for a cost. The cost depends on the specialty you wish to drop and the character's level. Once you drop a specialty, you can then choose a new specialty for no cost. Each specialty can only be dropped at the trainer that originally taught it. In order to switch from a Weaponsmithing subspecialty (Axesmithing for example) to Armorsmithing, you must first drop the Weaponsmithing subspecialty (should you have chosen one), then drop the Weaponsmithing specialty before you can learn Armorsmithing. Once you have earned either the Armorsmithing or Weaponsmithing specialty, you do not need to complete the quest line for the other specialty if you wish to switch. The specialty will be given at no cost. \nSpecialization benefits.\nSince the release of &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, you are now able to learn any of the weapon subspecializations, by talking to one of the appropriate three masters in Everlook, and asking them to teach you (though you must still have completed the weaponsmithing quest, as above). The quests, however, still rewards the same plans. These abilities can be unlearned for and another weapon subspecialization can be learned in their place."}

Therefore, he sent &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Agent\"&gt;Blacktalon Agent&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Watcher\"&gt;Blacktalon Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s on secret missions at several locations, notably the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Among the agents, some of them were bringing messages to others, some were excavating at various locations (often proceeding to speak rather cryptically to one another), while the others were moving around stealthed throughout the continent.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Right\"&gt;Right&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Left\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt; aided their master and his ally &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; when they arranged for Hellscream's liberation. However events spiraled out of their control, as Garrosh refused to be anything but his own master, murdered Kairoz, rallied the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; Azeroth. During the subsequent &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; that followed, it was revealed that the Blacktalon had left the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Stair\"&gt;Veiled Stair&lt;/a&gt;.\nExactly where the Blacktalon had moved to and their movements during the war are unknown, though Wrathion himself had appeared on Draenor, where he had become a \"guest\" of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion would ultimately leave the garrison and take several of &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt;'s best followers with him, where they presumably joined the Blacktalon.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, after finding an &lt;a href=\"%3AUnscarred%20Black%20Scale\"&gt;:Unscarred Black Scale&lt;/a&gt; from a young black dragon while on an &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;island expedition&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer knew that Wrathion would want to hear about it and sought him out at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Though Wrathion was not there himself, one of his Blacktalon Agents was. She revealed to the adventurer that Wrathion was searching for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and that other dragons had not been forthcoming in information. One of them was also the former &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; of Deathwing, observing as another uncorrupted black dragon, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, took an essence of the black dragonflight's magic to help heal the world. More Blacktalon Watchers could be found in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the end of the war, Wrathion sent them after &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; but to no avail.\nDragonflight.\nA few years later, the Blacktalon loyally followed their master to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and set up their own encampment, the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Bulwark\"&gt;Obsidian Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Djaradin\"&gt;Djaradin&lt;/a&gt; and their destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dragonheart%20Outpost\"&gt;Dragonheart Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion sent them to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Scalecracker%20Keep\"&gt;Scalecracker Keep&lt;/a&gt; and discover what the djaradin were up too. They subsequently discovered that the djaradin intended to claim the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight's seat of power, and shared with their intel with adventurers, who delivered the news to Wrathion. After discovering that the djaradin intended to claim the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight's seat of power, Wrathion and his agents headed off to stop them.\nRegrouping at their encampment, the Blacktalon were joined by adventurers, sent on &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s behalf to aid them. Wrathion warmly welcomed their aid, believing that with their presence his plans could succeed. After having the Blacktalon tested and going over their intel, Wrathion was prepared to move forward, waiving away any concerns about their low numbers and arrogantly declaring himself an \"incalculable advantage\" and that he would not be denied his legacy. He then gave the order to begin the assault, where the Blacktalon took control of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Ascent\"&gt;Burning Ascent&lt;/a&gt; in the process, and as the proper assault on the citadel itself began they were surprised to received unexpected back up by the arrival &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;his brood&lt;/a&gt;. Working together, the united forces were able to claim the upper courtyard of the citadel and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Oathstone\"&gt;Obsidian Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath, the two heirs of Neltharion began to compete for who would become the next aspect; supported by their respective factions.\nAt an unknown point in time &lt;a href=\"Weaponmaster%20Vordak\"&gt;Weaponmaster Vordak&lt;/a&gt; had joined the Blacktalons, only to later betray them (stealing many of the obsidian citadel weapons in the process) and joined the &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt;."}

Though little more than a docked ship and a tent, this small port was home to a few crew members of the pirate organization. In \"\" the cove was held by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presumably after the Blackwater Raiders had left.\nHistory.\nThe Blackwater Raiders existed before &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; closed its ports, and the &lt;a href=\"Brashwater%20Crew\"&gt;Brashwater Crew&lt;/a&gt; were originally members of the Blackwater Raiders. &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Seahorn\"&gt;Fleet Master Seahorn&lt;/a&gt; knew &lt;a href=\"%22Good-Boy%22%20Bruce\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustoms.\nThey are considered good men, respectable as pirates go. It is an important Blackwater rule to only kill when necessary. As such, there's no love between the Raiders and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nMembers of the Blackwater Raiders should also have the &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; .\nIn the RPG.\nThe Blackwater Raiders is one of the most notorious &lt;a href=\"buccaneer\"&gt;buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; bands in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They are a vile group of &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s who make their home in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;'s southern coast. Despite the fact that they are &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, the Blackwater Raiders are not really that much of bad guys. They are less interested in plunder and more interested in securing mercantile deals and widening the circle of ports with which they can trade. The Blackwater Raiders are led by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe port town of &lt;a href=\"Edj\"&gt;Edj&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;'s northeastern coast, is controlled by them. The &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt; has little in\ufb02uence over Baron Revilgaz, and indeed the Raiders attempt to go under, above, or around the coalition's head. They also control some of the harbors in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;' coast.\nRivalry with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; are the sworn enemies of the Blackwater Raiders, and at the behest of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Falrevere\"&gt;Duke Falrevere&lt;/a&gt;, they make forays against the Raiders' ships and, occasionally, their headquarters in Booty Bay. The two have clashed numerous times over the last 5 years.\nDuke Falrevere and every pirate under his banner seem to bear a personal grudge against everyone they come across, but this grudge is particularly strong when it comes to the Blackwater Raiders. Falrevere despises them because the &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s provide the Raiders with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, equipment and other support. Tavern tales say that the Blackwater Raiders are responsible for the death of Falrevere's son, &lt;a href=\"Magrann%20Falrevere\"&gt;Magrann Falrevere&lt;/a&gt;, who died before their cannons.\nThe Bloodsail frequent seedy taverns in Booty Bay, where they and the Raiders duel in the streets and bars. In addition to ambushing merchant ships that cross the South Seas, the Bloodsail and the Raiders are embroiled in a private naval war that spans the length of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. Falrevere is holding several &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s secretly beneath &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;Bloodsail Hold&lt;/a&gt; for now, for fear of tipping his hand to the Blackwater Raiders before he is ready.\nMembers.\nThe Raiders are comprised of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, and many others who swore them allegiance. After a raid, these pirates send their loot up the road to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; to sell, or even further into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThey are probably named after &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Cove\"&gt;Blackwater Cove&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Shadowflame\"&gt;Vault of the Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, a deep pit of cascading magma, is the heart of Blackwing Descent, and the location of horrific new experiments in undeath and magical augmentation, including a triumph dear to even Nefarian's cold, wrathful heart.

Wrathion and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; entered the area and fought against the sect, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s servants, and corrupted experiments, while noticing several &lt;a href=\"twilight%20drake\"&gt;twilight drake&lt;/a&gt;s and more importantly, hoping to secure an object of pure corruption for the Black Prince. Once the enemies were defeated and the halls investigated, Wrathion destroyed the remains of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, and took their scales to use as protection.\nLayout.\nThe instance consists of two subzones, the Broken Hall and the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Shadowflame\"&gt;Vault of the Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter the instance, the &lt;a href=\"Omnotron%20Defense%20System\"&gt;Omnotron Defense System&lt;/a&gt; will be off to your right with &lt;a href=\"Magmaw\"&gt;Magmaw&lt;/a&gt; off to your left.

Should he prove successful, even darker pursuits rest on the horizon.\"\n\"And, yet, the Lord of Blackrock is not a mere scientist - he is a great dragon cornered in his lair. Can he truly be defeated by mortal hands?\"\nHistory.\nNefarian has vowed to crush &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, he has recently begun efforts to bolster the black dragonflight, much as his father &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; had attempted to do in ages past. However, where Deathwing failed, it now seems the scheming Nefarian may be succeeding. Nefarian's mad bid for dominance has attracted concern from the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which has always been the black flight's greatest foe. Though Nefarian's intentions are known, the methods he is using to achieve them remain a mystery. It is believed, however that Nefarian has been experimenting with the blood of all of the various &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s to produce unstoppable warriors, accomplishing what his father failed, the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;Chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nBesides the twisted dragonflight, other experiments took place in these halls, including manipulation with dragon bones and eggs. Nefarian also captured and corrupted Vaelastrasz, while his creation &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt; survived and guarded the lair.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; who sent information on Nefarian and the Dark Horde all over Azeroth, the Horde leadership in Orgrimmar learned truth about their orc brethren in Blackrock Mountain. As such, Horde heroes invaded the lair, cut through the twisted experiments and slew Nefarian in his sanctuary. Although defeated, the Nefarian's broken corpse was later collected by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists who brought him back with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic as an undead monstrosity.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, agents thoroughly investigated the lair and found references to similar experiments that may predate Nefarian. They collected the material for further study.\nGeography.\nPort in by using the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Command\"&gt;Orb of Command&lt;/a&gt; located at the end of the hall to the right of the entrance to Blackrock Spire (The attunement quest &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%27s%20Command%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Blackhand's Command (quest)&lt;/a&gt; is no longer necessary and has been removed from the game).\nLoot.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; many players want to run Blackwing Lair for the distinctive weapons, including &lt;a href=\"Claw%20of%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Claw of the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragonbreath%20Hand%20Cannon\"&gt;Dragonbreath Hand Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chromatically%20Tempered%20Sword\"&gt;Chromatically Tempered Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1\"&gt;Patch 5.1&lt;/a&gt;, three bosses drop &lt;a href=\"battle%20pet\"&gt;battle pet&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Razorgore%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Razorgore the Untamed&lt;/a&gt; drops the &lt;a href=\"Unscathed%20Egg\"&gt;Unscathed Egg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broodlord%20Lashlayer\"&gt;Broodlord Lashlayer&lt;/a&gt; drops the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Banner\"&gt;Blackwing Banner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt; drops the &lt;a href=\"Whistle%20of%20Chromatic%20Bone\"&gt;Whistle of Chromatic Bone&lt;/a&gt;.\nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Elementium%20Ingot\"&gt;Elementium Ingot&lt;/a&gt; is found as a rare drop from the that inhabit the lair.

They consist of Technicians, Warlocks, Spellbinders, and Overseers.\nFor each pack, a hunter and warrior must be assigned to each of the non-Technician mobs. The hunter who makes the initial pull must target a technician and then exit line of sight so that the other mobs leave their spots. When the other mobs enter the fighting area, each tanks hunter must distracting shot pull their target to the tank. The hunter pulling the technicians needs to kite the technicians into an open area where a designated mage can pick them up with Arcane Explosions and begin kiting them. Meanwhile the rest of the raid is focused on killing whatever Warlocks are pulled. It may be prudent for the warlock tanks to watch for Demon Portals, and call for the raid to switch to whichever lock starts summoning first.

It is full of barren plateaus, axe-cut valleys, and forested tablelands, all sharply contrasting and separated by crags dense with distinctive knife-sharp spikes. While inhabited by a number of races, particularly notable is the large population of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, dominated by the hulking &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;. The mountains were created by the fusion of Frostfire Ridge and Gorgrond.\nHistory.\nBlade's Edge Mountains were once the lands of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, which merged together when Draenor shattered. Before Draenor's destruction, the iconic stone spikes were present in Frostfire Ridge, along with a peak named &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountain\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The two regions were also the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Apparently originating as a weaker sub-species of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres were one of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;last giants&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the gronn show little love for their children, ruling over the ogre clans with an iron fist. Before Draenor's shattering, Frostfire Ridge was also the home of the orcs in the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;. At some point both regions were also inhabited by a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoan&lt;/a&gt; civilization named &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Grishna\"&gt;Grishna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lashh%27an\"&gt;Lashh'an&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruuan%27ok\"&gt;Ruuan'ok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vekh%27nir\"&gt;Vekh'nir&lt;/a&gt; arakkoa are still living there.\nRise of the Orcish Horde.\nOrcs and ogres share a history, though there is some discrepancy on what relation they had to each other. They were enemies for generations until the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, even prior to the orcs' vicious transformation into savages by the hand of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Orcs ruthlessly conquered ogre territory, enslaving and killing ogres as they went; the war lasted quite a while, fueled by corruption from demonic forces. Soon the ogres were broken, the race either forced into exile or enslaved and used in experiments. The Horde enslaved and experimented with several of the ogre clans. The warlock &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; decided that the orcs required the ogre's strength in the orcs' war against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and his experiments created the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;s. Several ogre clans passed through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; simply to escape the orcs, although they didn't like the humans much either. To this day, most ogres hate orcs with a passion, remembering the wars they fought against each other. \nAt the same time, some ogres and orcs were clearly allies; ogres told the orcs that they were being whipped by the gronn and allied with &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his Horde to rebel back. This also provided the ogres with food and weapons. In fact, when the orcs in their demonic craze razed across Draenor in order to kill any other leaving creatures, sometimes fighting among themselves, the only race they might have called allies was the ogres. The ogres served as massive, single-minded warriors who served as little more than walking siege engines for the orcs as they plundered and conquered. Prior to the demonic corruption of the orcs, even off-springs between ogres and orcs occurred. Having the intelligence and cunning of and orc combined with the strength of an ogre, they were honored by shamanistic orcs for being noble and savage creatures of the land. They were called &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt;, the most famous of them - &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; - later willingly joining the old Horde. Other Mok'Nathal can still be found in a &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;small village&lt;/a&gt; in Blade's Edge Mountains.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nThe ogres were brought through the Dark Portal after the First War to act as enforcers to quell needless infighting between the orc clans. They also brought massive devastation to the human lands as soldiers. However, eventually these ogre clans broke free and went their own separate ways. Today, both the Eastern Kingdoms and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; are inhabited by large clans of ogres. Some of them have rejoined the \"new\" Horde.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; came to know about the Dark Portal and the world on the other side. As there were no dragons in Draenor, he felt sure that few of its denizens would dare challenge his black dragons. After the orcs' defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, he made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; in which the black dragons would aid the Horde in return for safe passage of his flight and his eggs to Draenor. Deathwing, his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and a group of black dragons allowed the orcs to ride upon them in order to retrieve four artifacts which &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; required for opening new portals to other worlds for the orcs to conquer. When Ner'zhul had them in his possession, he, the remaining Horde, Deathwing and an escort of his black dragons ventured to Draenor through the Dark Portal. Deathwing hid clutches of his eggs all over Draenor, but most of his black dragons settled in Gorgrond.\nThe dragons were however not welcome by &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the gronn and ogres. They began to destroy both dragons and eggs alike, much to the dislike of Deathwing. Fighting back, he was also encountered by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, a military &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-force seeking to recover the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; which happened to be in Deathwing's property. Deathwing was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and escaped back to Azeroth, leaving only a small portion of black dragons to guard the eggs. Notice that this seems to be a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Deathwing's Lair&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nOutnumbered and leaderless, the dragons were torn from the sky by the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt;'s spells and impaled by Gruul on the jagged spires. For this, Gruul earned the title \"the Dragonkiller\". The remaining eggs were affected by the turbulent nether energies when Draenor was torn apart, hatching into the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;Netherwing dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe expedition, whose primary purpose was to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, another of the artifacts, later encountered &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;. The clan had stolen the book from Ner'zhul, betraying him at the same time. Mogor also commanded an order of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; (possibly by using the book) which held knowledge which Ner'zhul required in order to open multiple portals across Draenor. He sent forces to kill Mogor and subjugate the Death Knights, but The Death Knights were destroyed instead and Mogor escaped. Mogor made a truce with the Alliance Expedition afterwards. In return for the dominance of his clan in the Blade's Edge Mountains and securing the passes across them, he would deliver the book. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and their strongest warriors reinforced Mogor and the Laughing Skull clan and stopped the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt;, then attacked a stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; (possibly &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Village\"&gt;Thunderlord Village&lt;/a&gt;) and destroyed it, gaining the control of the region. The book was eventually handed by &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt; to Khadgar, who used with the skull to close the Dark Portal before Draenor's sundering tore apart Azeroth as well. During Draenor's destruction Frostfire Ridge crashed into Gorgrond and created the modern day Blade's Edge Mountains.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe ogres in Blade's Edge Mountains are still controlled by the gronn, divided into the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20clan\"&gt;Bloodmaul clan&lt;/a&gt; who are fighting against each other. The player is supporting the Bloodmaul, aiding &lt;a href=\"Mog%27dorg%20the%20Wizened\"&gt;Mog'dorg the Wizened&lt;/a&gt; through a series of quests which eventually leads the player to (the ability to gain reputation with) &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;. This is a group of ogres who have become intelligent due to the influence of &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal%20%28item%29\"&gt;apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;. Possibly, they may be a \"revival\" of the once intelligent ogres on Draenor. \nDeathwing's lieutenant Sabellian is still present in the disguise of \"Baron Sablemane\", a human. He, like &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; who has returned to Blade's Edge Mountains to protect the remaining Mok'Nathal from the gronn and ogres, and Mog'dorg the Wizened, gives quests to kill Gruul's sons. Ultimately, this ends the gronn's control over the ogre clans of Blade's Edge Mountains. Gruul himself is a raid boss. Several humans, orcs, &lt;a href=\"broken\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;, and draenei have begun to worship the remaining black dragons, creating the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmcult\"&gt;Wyrmcult&lt;/a&gt;. It is led by &lt;a href=\"Maxnar%20the%20Ashmaw\"&gt;Maxnar the Ashmaw&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;. The player, helping the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; which have settled in &lt;a href=\"Evergrove\"&gt;Evergrove&lt;/a&gt;, kills him in a quest due to the Wyrmcult's hostility. Other black dragons are trying to destroy Ogri'la.\nThe Burning Legion is still heavily present, also being one of the forces threatening Ogri'la. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Dusts%20of%20Outland%20%28WC3%20BloodElf%29\"&gt;arriving in Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; managed to seize the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; several &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateways&lt;/a&gt; used by Magtheridon to bring demons from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. In \"World of Warcraft\", it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Door\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of these gateways was actually located in Blade's Edge Mountains. It seems the Burning Legion has managed to reactivate it - &lt;a href=\"Baelmon%20the%20Hound-Master\"&gt;Baelmon the Hound-Master&lt;/a&gt; is now using it to summon &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20Hound\"&gt;Wrath Hound&lt;/a&gt;-reinforcements. The player helps the Cenarion Expedition by killing him too. \nTo the north at &lt;a href=\"Bash%27ir%20Landing\"&gt;Bash'ir Landing&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s are smuggling &lt;a href=\"manacell\"&gt;manacell&lt;/a&gt;s for the blood elves ruled by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. The manacells are produced in the blood elf-controlled &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt;, and are somehow delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Magister%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Magister's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Kael'thas is planning to use the power in them to summon his new master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt; is no longer in Blade's Edge Mountains; he is instead leading a group of &lt;a href=\"Warmaul\"&gt;Warmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres at the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Ruins\"&gt;Laughing Skull Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. He is killed by the player as the final boss in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if anything remains of the Laughing Skull clan.\nDragonflight.\nThe black dragons led by Sabellian finally left the Blade's Edge Mountains after decades and returned home to Azeroth. According to &lt;a href=\"Osoria\"&gt;Osoria&lt;/a&gt;, while they were there they bent the mountains to their will.\nGeography.\nThe spiky cliffs in the zone neatly divide the mountains into distinct regions and elevations, centered around the long, deep, dusty &lt;a href=\"Daggermaw%20Canyon\"&gt;Daggermaw Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, which stretches from the southernmost point of the zone to tall bluffs in the north. To the east is an equally long, rocky, flat-topped ridge, while curving along from the west to the north is an even higher, longer ridge split into two crystal-strewn plateaus by an impassable peak. Five smaller, forested mesas at modest elevation jut out from below these heights, connected through the ridges by twisting tunnels, and across the canyon by massive stone bridges that look more like immense fallen slabs of rock than anything built by humanoids. Extending up and down from these middle heights are steep switchbacks and ramps, but no land passage is possible up the steep cliffs of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Spine\"&gt;Crystal Spine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Summit\"&gt;Vortex Summit&lt;/a&gt; plateaus to the north and west - only flight makes them accessible.\nTo the south is a gargantuan ridge which would completely cut the zone off from Zangarmarsh if not for more tunnels passing through it. In the east, the goblin-built &lt;a href=\"Gyro-Plank%20Bridge\"&gt;Gyro-Plank Bridge&lt;/a&gt; connects the zone to the floating islands of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting There.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; to the south, take the path through the cave in the northwest portion of the zone.

Diremaul is populated by a fierce tribe of ogres and is located in the western region of Feralas. Diremaul will be limited groups of no more than five players each.\nNew Outdoor Raid Bosses.\nTwo new outdoor raid bosses have been introduced to Azeroth. Azuregos, a monstrous blue dragon, has landed in Azshara, while Lord Kazzak the demon can be found in the Tainted Scar of the Blasted Lands.\nMeeting Stones.\nMeeting Stones are located outside of each dungeon to help players find a group to adventure with in the dungeon. The meeting stone will try to find you a viable five-person group by looking for a tank, a healer, and so on. As time passes and you are unable to find a group, the meeting stone will become less picky about who it groups you with.\nDungeon Player Caps.\nAll dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.\nWith that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:\nAll other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of this change. In addition, will have their loot improved significatnly for the next content patch."}

If you accidentally do this once, you can recover by quitting the game, moving your backup SavedVariables.lua into place and restarting the game with addons enabled.\nYou can query to see if an addon is loaded by using the new IsAddOnLoaded(\"addonname\") function, and you can load an addon dynamically using the LoadAddOn(\"addonname\") function. This function returns true if the addon is loaded successfully, and can be safely and efficiently called even if the addon is already loaded. \nFor your convenience, the function UIParentLoadAddOn(\"addonname\") is provided which will attempt to load the addon and pop up an error message if it failed to load for any reason.\nOnce an addon is loaded, the ADDON_LOADED event is sent, with arg1 set to the name of the addon. An addon can listen for that event, and when it receives that event with its own name, it can safely access its saved variables. \nAn important thing to note is that when an addon is loaded dynamically, it doesn't have access to any of the virtual frame templates that are defined by FrameXML, including font definitions."}

As players delve deeper into the mysteries of Ahn'Qiraj, they will discover revelations of the Silithid infestation and their shadowy masters, the Qiraji. Players will have to complete a world event of massive proportions before they can open the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj on their realm.\n\"During the public test of Ahn'Qiraj, the world event to open the gates will be accelerated to allow testing of the dungeon content.\"[sic]\nLinked Auction Houses.\nPlayers will now be able to buy and sell goods with greater effectiveness using the Linked Auction House system. Auction Houses in Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff will now share the same pool of Horde player-created auctions, and Alliance players will find the same to be true when visiting Ironforge, Stormwind City, and Darnassus Auction Houses. This system has been expanded to support the neutral Auction Houses as well. Tanaris, Everlook, and Booty Bay will all be linked for players of both factions to access. In addition, the \"Looking for Group\" and \"Trade\" channels have been unified among the corresponding cities, meaning, for example, that you can trade your goods or look for groups in Ironforge while in Stormwind.\nMultiple Battlegrounds Queues.\nPlayers will be able to enter multiple battleground queues. No longer must you make the hard decision of which queue to join -- when queued for all three, you can join the first one available or hold out for that particular battleground which you've really got your heart set on. Should a queue open while you are already in a battleground, you may switch to the new battle or remain in the current on.\nSoul Shard Bags.\nTailors now can make soul bags to hold soul shards. The smallest is a 20-slot bag, the recipe for which can be purchased in Gadgetzan. The recipe for a 24-slot bag can be found in Scholomance, and one for an even larger bag can be found in Molten Core. In the main UI, these soul bags will display how many shards they contain. So long as the soul bags have room, any soul shards a warlock creates will automatically go into the bag. The counter on the bag will max out at the number of bag slots even if you have more soul shards in your inventory.\nRaid Calendar System.\nThe raid-lockout system has undergone a significant change. The new system will have all instances reset at a certain server time, regardless of when you were actually saved to the instance. The reset schedule is as follows:\nAll resets will occur during off-hours, when the least amount of raids are active.\nImportant Note for Mac OS X Users.\nThe minimum supported Mac OS X revision for WoW will be changed in a post-1.9.0 patch, from 10.3.5 to 10.3.9. If you are running 10.3.5 - 10.3.8 and need to get the free update, you can use Software Update or you can click here for the direct download. This change will make it easier for us to release future updates to the game, for example to support upcoming Mac models based on Intel processors.\nDetails.\nRacial Traits.\nTroll Racial Abilities.\nTroll Berserking\nThrowing Mastery\nOrc Racial Abilities.\nBlood Fury\nHardiness\nGnome Racial Abilities.\nEscape Artist\nDwarven Racial Abilities.\nStoneform"}

Instead, a new C_TooltipInfo namespace has been added which provides APIs for retrieving structured data for use in tooltips and a new set of tooltip-related mixins have been added to populate tooltips from these APIs.\nCustom Tooltip Frames.\nAny addons that are creating GameTooltip frames should now ensure they inherit &lt;a href=\"GameTooltipTemplate\"&gt;GameTooltipTemplate&lt;/a&gt;.
