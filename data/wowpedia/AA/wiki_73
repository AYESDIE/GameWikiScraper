Common slash commands include the following:\nWith macros, these commands can be used from action buttons, and many of them can be used at once. Each unique command goes on its own line and is written exactly as it would be typed it in the chat box. For instance, a macro that makes the player yell \"Everybody, dance now!\" and burst into dance would be written thus.\n /y Everybody, dance now!\n /dance\nA mostly complete list of slash commands is available at &lt;a href=\"Macro%20API\"&gt;Macro API&lt;/a&gt;. Wowpedia is a great source of additional information for macros, especially scripts using the /run command (which will be covered later).\nNote: Macros run all the commands at once. This means that when you click the button, the macro runs each command from start to finish before returning control to the game. This has two important effects. First, if you write a macro that takes a long time to execute (like /run for i=1, 100000000 do end), the game will freeze for as long as it takes to run the macro.\nSecond, and arguably more important, there is no way to wait in a macro without freezing the game. This fact will become much more apparent when we start dealing with the /cast command and its ilk. Some addons can provide a way to issue a command at a later time, but they can only be used for \"benign\" functions like chatting, emotes, and issuing commands to other addons (though equipping weapons in combat is allowed).\nMaking a macro.\nFirst, open up the macro window. You can do this either by opening the main menu and selecting Macros, or by typing /macro (/m) in the chat box. At the top of the window, you'll see two tabs: General Macros and \"Yourname\" Specific Macros. General macros are stored on an account-by-account basis and are shared by all your characters. Character specific macros are, well, I think you can figure this one out yourself. :P Immediately under the tabs is a grid of 18 boxes where the macros are displayed. Under those, there is a single box which displays your currently-selected macro with a Change Name/Icon button next to it. Below that is the edit box where you actually type the macro. Finally, at the bottom you have a number of self-explanatory buttons.\nTo create a macro, click the New button at the bottom of the window. This brings up another small window off to the side where you choose the icon and type a name for the macro. If you choose the question mark icon (), WoW will automatically pick an icon for your macro based on what spells or items are listed in the macro. Once you have chosen an icon and a name, click the Okay button.\nA few notes: You can control what icon is shown in place of the question mark with the #show command. Although you can name two macros the same, it is better to avoid this since some functions of addons or even certain macro commands reference macros by name. You can also add custom icons to the list (see the Part III).\nNow you will notice that the macro icon you chose has been added to the 18 boxes mentioned earlier (as much of the name as will fit is also displayed on the icon). The newly created macro will also be selected so now it's time to start writing your macro. Click in the edit box of the macro window to start typing.\nNote: Macros have a 255 character limit. Rumor has it that this is because they store macros on the servers (since patch 3.0.2).\nWhen you are done typing your macro, click the Save button, drag the macro's icon from the grid and place it on an action button. The macro will also be automatically saved when you first try to use it or when you close the macros window. Click the button, and there you have it!\nCasting spells.\nDuring the normal course of play, you aren't likely to type many slash commands that are generally useful for macros. Sure, the occasional emote macro can make for some interesting role playing, but c'mon... There's got to be more to it than that...\nThere is. Enter /cast, the most common command you will see in macros. The /cast command allows you to cast any spell from your (or your pet's) spell book by name. The simplest case is a command like:\n /cast Shadow Word: Pain\nThis macro will cast Shadow Word: Pain on your target. It behaves exactly as if you had dragged SW:P onto that spot on your action bar. The action bar code recognizes the spell and will show &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; and range feedback on the icon. In fact, if you choose the question mark icon I mentioned earlier, the action bar will even show the icon for SW:P.\n\"Ho, hum,\" you might be thinking... Why not just put the spell on your bar? Well, that's where combining multiple commands comes in handy, and this is exactly what makes macros so useful. What if you're a mage and you want to let your party know that you're about to sheep something? Well, simply put the cast and /p message in a macro:\n /cast Polymorph\n /p Sheeping %t! You spank it, you tank it!\nNote: Since the macro is executed all at once, the /p command will be issued when you start the cast, and will not care either way whether you have a valid target or whether Polymorph is on &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. This also means you can put the two commands in either order and it will have the same effect.\nThere are also addons that handles this, such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/rsa.aspx\"&gt;Raeli's Spell Announcer&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes about spell names.\nThe /cast command is pretty picky when it comes to your spell name. In order for it to successfully cast a spell you must use correct spelling, punctuation, spacing, etc. The best way to guarantee you enter the right name is to open your spell book while writing the macro, place your cursor in the macro where the spell should be, and shift-click the spell in your spell book. This will enter the exact name of the spell, including any modifiers like Druid forms for the Mangle ability.\nUsing items and trinkets.\nSimple answer: the same way you cast a spell. The command for using an item is (you guessed it) /use. Like /cast, its simplest form takes the name of the item you want to use:\n /use Green Mechanostrider\nThere are also a couple other forms of the /use command:\n/use &lt;inventory slot&gt;.\nThis form of use allows you to use an item in the specified slot. See also &lt;a href=\"InventorySlotId\"&gt;InventorySlotId&lt;/a&gt; for lists of the slot numbers. Example:\n /use 13\nUses whatever is in your top trinket slot.\n/use &lt;bag&gt; &lt;slot&gt;.\nYou can also use an item in a specific bag location. Lets say you always keep the food you want to feed your pet in the first slot of your backpack. You can easily write a macro to feed your pet as follows:\n /cast Feed Pet\n /use 0 1\nBags are numbered 0-4 from right to left (0 is always the backpack) and the slots are numbered starting at 1 going left to right, top to bottom (like reading):\n 1 2 3 4\n 5 6 7 8\nor\n 1 2\n 3 4 5 6\n 7 8 9 10\nTrading risk of confusion for completeness, I'll let you know that /cast and /use function exactly the same way. /cast can use items and /use can cast spells. This isn't very useful for simple macros like you've seen so far. However, when you start dealing with macro options and sequences you'll be happy to know that you can intermingle items and spells in the same command.\nMultiple actions with one click.\nIn general, you cannot cast more than one spell with a single click of a macro. Most spells and some items trigger the global &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; (GCD) which keeps you from taking too many actions at once. Even if a spell fails to cast, if it would trigger the GCD, it prevents subsequent /casts in the macro from running. This was not the case prior to patch 2.0 which is why you may still come across macros like the following:\n /cast Overpower\n /cast Execute\n /cast Mortal Strike\n /cast Sunder Armor\nMacros like this do not work anymore. As soon as Overpower fails to cast, the game will block all the other spells from casting as well, even though the GCD is not actually triggered.\nThere is a bit of good news, though. Certain spells \"can\" actually be cast at the same time in a single macro. Any spell that is instant and does \"not\" trigger the GCD can be followed by another cast. The spell's tooltip will tell you if it's instant, but you have to use the spell (or check a database site such as wowhead.com) to know if it triggers the GCD.\nPrior to patch 2.3 it was necessary to place a /stopcasting command after the instant, non-GCD spells (but not items). The game engine assumed that after the first /cast is attempted, a spell is now in progress. /stopcasting removes this assumption and prevents the \"Another action is in progress\" error. Since the spell is instant, /stopcasting does not actually cancel the cast. Example:\n /cast Furious Howl\n /stopcasting\n /cast Blood Fury\n /stopcasting\n /cast Call of the Wild\nNote that since patch 2.3, this is no longer necessary. The above macro can be shortened to:\n /cast Furious Howl\n /cast Blood Fury\n /cast Call of the Wild\nTargeting.\nTargeting is another common task in macros. This is accomplished either by using dedicated targeting slash commands which actually change your target or by using the [@\"unit\"] macro option on commands that accept them. When you use the macro option, you are actually casting the spell or using the item directly on the unit without changing targets. Macro options will be covered in great detail in Part II. For now, I'll show you how to use the targeting commands.\nThe most basic targeting command (unsurprisingly) is /target. Its use is as simple as\n /target Cogwheel\n/target does a closest match which means if you do /target Cog and someone named Cogwheel is standing near you (and no one named Cog is) it will target them. This is a plus or a minus depending on your situation. Unfortunately, it will also target irrelevant units. This makes macros like the following much less useful than they might first appear.\n /target Blackwing Mage\n /cast Bane of Agony\nIf no Blackwing Mages are around, this might target someone in your raid who happens to have the letters B and L in their name. While they're safe from the wrath of your curse, it's still a bit disconcerting. Another problem is that it may target something 100 yards behind you that you don't really care about. (Patch 2.3 added the &lt;a href=\"%23targetexact\"&gt;/targetexact&lt;/a&gt; command to eliminate part of the problem.)\nIn addition to specifying the name of someone you would like to target, you can also provide a unit ID. Unit IDs are a way to identify a particular character, mob, NPC, etc. For instance, your current target can always be accessed by the \"target\" unit ID (obviously not the most useful for the command we're discussing at the moment :P). You yourself are accessed by the \"player\" ID, and if you have a pet it would be referenced by \"pet.\" You can also append \"target\" to the end of any valid unit ID to arrive at that unit's target. There is a joke about Kevin Bacon involving a macro like:\n /target targettargettargettargettargettarget\n&lt;a href=\"UnitId\"&gt;UnitId&lt;/a&gt; has a full list of allowed IDs.\nOther targeting commands.\nHere is a brief overview of the other targeting commands:\n/assist.\nBy itself, assist targets your target's target (e.g. if you are targeting me, and I'm targeting Iriel, /assist would make you target Iriel). You can also provide a name or unit to /assist and you will assist the specified entity:\n /assist Cogwheel \nThere is an interface option which will automatically start you attacking if you end up with a hostile target.\n/cleartarget.\nLeaves you with no target.\n/targetexact.\nTargets a unit with the exact name listed. If the name is spelled wrong or that unit is not near you, your target will not be changed.\n/targetlasttarget, /targetlastfriend, /targetlastenemy.\nAs the names suggest, these commands will target your previous target, your last targeted friend, or your last targeted enemy. If you previously had no target, this command will do nothing.\n/targetenemy, /targetfriend.\nThese commands cycle through the specified type of unit. /targetenemy is like pressing TAB, and /targetfriend is like pressing CTRL-TAB. You can also add a parameter of 1 which reverses the direction of the cycle (/targetenemy 1 is like pressing SHIFT-TAB).\nNote: You can only use these commands once per macro.\n /targetenemy\n /targetenemy 1\n /targetfriend\n /targetfriend 1\n/targetenemyplayer, /targetfriendplayer.\nThese commands cycle through player-controlled units. They behave just like /targetfriend and /targetenemy except they will only target other players, ignoring computer-controlled units like NPC mobs, pets, minions, creations, etc. They are useful for PvP. As with /targetenemy, a 1 may be added to reverse the direction.\n /targetenemyplayer\n /targetenemyplayer 1\n /targetfriendplayer\n /targetfriendplayer 1\nNote: You can only use these commands once per macro.\n/targetparty, /targetraid.\nCycles through your nearest party or raid members. Like /targetenemy, you can add a 1 to reverse the direction.\n /targetparty\n /targetparty 1\n /targetraid\n /targetraid 1\nPet control.\nAs mentioned in the spell casting section, you can use /cast to cast your pet's abilities by name. In fact, Blizzard had to change the name of the Mage elemental's Frost Nova to Freeze because there was no way to use it in a macro. But as everyone with a pet is aware, that's nowhere near the end of the line for pet control. Luckily the Burning Crusade patches brought us a host of new pet commands:\n/petattack.\nSends your pet to attack your target. You can also specify a name or unit ID and your pet will attack that instead.\n/petfollow.\nCauses your pet to follow you, cancelling its attack if necessary.\n/petstay.\nCauses your pet to hold at its current location until given another command.\n/petmoveto.\nBrings up a targeting reticule. Click on the ground at a location and your pet will move there.\n/petpassive, /petdefensive.\nSets the reaction mode of your pet just like the buttons on your pet bar.\n/petautocaston, /petautocastoff, /petautocasttoggle.\nThese commands manipulate the auto-cast of a given pet spell. The first will always turn auto-cast on, and the second will turn it off. Example:\n /petautocaston Torment\n /petautocastoff Suffering \nRecently, a new command has been added which will toggle a pet's auto-cast spells, petautocasttoggle. Example:\n /petautocasttoggle Fire Breath\nThis will turn the auto-cast on if it is currently off, or off if it is current on, which can entirely replace the former command depending on the planned use.\nControlling button feedback and the question mark icon () with #show.\nBy default, WoW uses the first spell or item that appears in a macro to show &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, range, and availability feedback on the button, and to pick which icon to display when you use the question mark icon. Take our multi-spell macro from earlier as an example:\n /use Talisman of Ephemeral Power\n /cast Arcane Power\n /cast Presence of Mind\n /cast Pyroblast\nWith this macro, WoW chooses Arcane Power for the feedback. However, this is probably not what you really want. The main point of this spell is to cast Pyroblast. The first few lines merely exist as support spells to make the Pyroblast more effective. You can make the button behave as if Pyroblast were the first spell by adding the following line to the top of the macro:\n #show Pyroblast\nIf you used the question mark icon for the macro, the button will even have the icon of Pyroblast without any extra effort on your part. The parameter to #show (in this case Pyroblast) works the same way as the /cast and /use commands. You can use a spell name, item name, item id (item:12345), inventory slot, or bag and slot numbers.\nSimilar to #show is #showtooltip. Normally when you mouse over a macro on an action bar, your tooltip displays the name of the macro. This is not incredibly useful most of the time (especially if you use an addon like TheoryCraft to give you detailed spell information in tooltips). However, the #showtooltip command allows you to specify a spell to use in the tooltip the same way as #show. If you use #showtooltip, you do not need to use #show.\nIf you're happy with the spell that WoW is choosing for the feedback, you can use #showtooltip without a spell to save space in your macro. WoW will still use whichever spell it was choosing before, but it will now show the tooltip info for that spell/item.\nYou cannot use #show and #showtooltip in the same macro, the second one will be ignored.\nPlease Note: unlike slash commands, #show and #showtooltip must be written in lower case letters.\nConditionals for #show(tooltip).\nThe #showtooltip and #show commands will also accept the found further below. Here's a simple example:\n #showtooltip [modifier:shift] Conjure Food; Conjure Water\nThis line at the top of the macro will show icon and tooltip corresponding to the Conjure Water spell, unless shift is held down, in which case Conjure Food will be used instead, regardless of what else the macro is doing and which spells it is using.\nOther slash commands.\nNow that you have a solid foundation I'd like to briefly cover some of the other slash commands at your disposal. Some of these commands may seem a bit pointless at first glance, but when you combine them with the macro options from Part II, they can perform some neat tricks.\nEquipping items.\nThere are three commands for equipping items: /equip, /equipslot, and /equipset. /equip simply takes an item name and will equip it to the default slot as if you had right-clicked it in one of your bags (i.e., a one-handed weapon will be equipped to your main hand). /equipslot takes an &lt;a href=\"InventorySlotId\"&gt;inventory slot ID&lt;/a&gt; and an item name, and equips the item to the specified slot. Note that when using /equipslot, you must respecify the slot for each set of conditionals. If you use the Blizzard equipment manager and save an equipment set, you can use the /equipset command to use it. Examples:\nEquip a weapon to default slot:\n /equip Honed Voidaxe\nEquip a trinket to the lower trinket slot:\n /equipslot 14 Carrot on a Stick\nSave two equipment sets. One called Tank that has a sword and shield equipped, one called DPS that has a two handed weapon equipped. Use this macro to switch between the two:\n /equipset [equipped:Shields] DPS; Tank\nIf you have a shield on, it'll equip your saved DPS set, otherwise it'll equip your saved Tank set.\nSwap between your offhand and a shield:\n /equipslot [equipped:Shields] 17 Merciless Gladiator's Cleaver; 17 Crest of the Sha'tar\nNote: If you are trying to equip two of the same weapon simultaneously into different slots, your macro will not work properly.\nNote: Addons are allowed to use the equipping functions directly, even during combat.\nSequencing spells and items.\nMany times you will find yourself casting a series of spells or use certain items in the same order on pretty much any mob you fight. To make this job a bit easier, we have the /castsequence command. /castsequence takes a list of spells and/or items separated by commas. These follow the same rules as /cast and /use. This means you can interchange spell names, item names, item IDs, inventory slots, and bag slot combinations. Each time you run the macro, it activates the current spell/item. If the spell or item is used successfully, the sequence will move to the next entry. You must repeatedly activate the macro to use all the spells in the sequence. Once you use the last entry in the list, it will reset to the beginning. Example: \n /castsequence Immolate, Corruption, Bane of Agony, Siphon Life\nThis might be something you would use for a Warlock's opening attack. Note, however, that if Immolate fails to cast for some reason (out of mana, not in range, silenced, etc.), the sequence will remain at that point. Because of this, you cannot use a /castsequence to make a spammable macro like:\n /castsequence Overpower, Execute, Mortal Strike\nBefore the spell list (but always \"after\" the conditionals), you can also specify reset conditions to start the sequence over before it reaches the end. The basic syntax for reset conditions is:\n reset=\"n\"/target/combat/shift/alt/ctrl\nWhere \"n\" is the number of seconds of inactivity after which the macro should be reset. In other words, if more than \"n\" seconds pass without the macro being called, then the next time you call it the sequence will start from the first spell. Note that this is not the time since the \"first\" spell in the sequence was cast, but rather the time since the macro was last called (to cast \"any\" of the spells in the sequence). This is a very important distinction because it means you cannot use a reset timer to account for &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs to the other conditions, \"target\" resets the sequence when you change targets; \"combat\" when you leave combat; \"shift\", \"alt\", and \"ctrl\" when you activate the macro with one of those keys depressed. You can specify any number of these conditions separated by slashes as shown. \nExample:\n /castsequence reset=10/shift Spell 1, Other Spell, Some Item\nTo make a macro cycle through two different 'sets' of spells that should be used together, where each set can not be used at the same time (i.e trinkets with shared &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s) it is possible to use multiple instances of /castsequence to achieve this effect. \nExample:\n /castsequence Berserking, Icy Veins\n /castsequence Trinket 1, Trinket 2\nOn the first button push this macro will cast Beserking and Trinket 1, on the second it will cast Icy Veins and Trinket 2.\nIf you used the question mark icon, WoW will automatically update the icon to the current element of the sequence. If you have other /casts or /uses (or complex conditionals) before the /castsequence, though, WoW will sometimes not be able to figure out which icon to use. In this case, you can specify the icon using #showtooltip as described above\nRandom spells and items.\nOne of the most common requests on this forum is for a macro to use a random mount. This is extremely trivial thanks to the addition of /castrandom and /userandom. Like /castsequence, /castrandom and /userandom takes a list of spells and/or items separated by commas and picks one at random when you run the command. Example:\n /castrandom Swift Green Mechanostrider, Black Battlestrider, Summon Dreadsteed \nAttacking.\nChange your target to \"unit\" and start auto-attacking.\n /startattack Cogwheel\nStop auto-attacking.\n /stopattack\nAction bar manipulation.\nThere are two commands that allow you to change action bar pages: /changeactionbar and /swapactionbar. /changeactionbar takes a single number and will always switch to that page. One use of this is for hunters to emulate stances by having a pair of macros like:\n /cast Aspect of the Hawk\n /changeactionbar 1\nand\n /cast Aspect of the Monkey\n /changeactionbar 2\n/swapactionbar takes two page numbers and will swap between them each time it runs. If you're on a page other than one of the two specified, it will be change to the first of the two.\n /swapactionbar 1 2\nRemoving buffs.\nThe /cancelaura command allows you to remove unwanted buffs. For example, a Death Knight without the Horn of Winter minor glyph cannot cast Horn of Winter if a glyphed version of the buff is already on them (from another Death Knight). The following macro solves this problem:\n /cancelaura Horn of Winter\n /cast Horn of Winter\nLeaving a form.\nWith the exception of Warriors, any class with stances (Druids, Priests with &lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt;, Rogues with &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) can use /cancelform to leave their current form. Example:\n /cancelform\n /use Super Healing Potion\nIn patch 2.3, /cancelform will be recognized instantly for Druids. Until then and for everyone else, you may have to click the button twice.\nStopping a cast.\n/stopcasting was touched on briefly in other contexts but its main use, as you might guess, is used to stop another spell cast that's in progress. This is useful for making \"panic buttons\" that interrupt whatever you're doing at the moment in favor of something more important. On a Warlock, for instance, the following macro can be used:\n /stopcasting\n /cast Shadowburn\nHalting a macro early.\n/stopmacro is one of those commands that doesn't really come into its own unless you use it with macro options. Its main use is to implement \"fall-through\" logic to prevent you from continuing a macro if certain conditions are true. See \"Using focus\" at the end of part II for an example.\nDismounting.\n /dismount\nBasically self-explanatory.\nSaving a target for later action.\nThe /focus command allows you to save a target to come back to later. For example, say your raid leader assigns you a target to sheep. First, select that mob, and type /focus. Now you can use a macro like the following to cast sheep on your focus:\n /cast [@focus] Polymorph\nNote that this is not the most efficient use of the focus feature. See \"Using Focus\" towards the end of Part II for a much more in-depth look at this mechanic.\nSimulating button clicks.\nThe /click command takes the name of a button and acts like you clicked the button with your mouse. By default, it behaves like a left-click, but you can specify other mouse buttons in the command. There are a few ways to determine the name of the frame you're interested in:\n /run local f = GetMouseFocus(); if f then DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(f:GetName()) end\n/click can be used for many different purposes. You can chain together multiple macros by /click'ing buttons with other macros on them. For example, you might have a really long macro that doesn't fit into 255 characters. Put as much of it as you can in one macro and end it with the following line:\n /click MultiBarRightButton1\nThe rest of the code would go into a new macro that you would then place on MultiBarRightButton1 (the first button of the right-hand vertical extra action bar).\nYou can also do things that normally wouldn't be available to macros. For instance, turning on auto-cast for a pet spell can't be done by Lua scripts and there isn't a secure command for it (until the next patch, at least). However, you can write a macro to pretend that you right-clicked on one of your pet bar buttons:\n /click PetActionButton5 RightButton\nThis command will act like you right-clicked the 5th pet button from the left. The extra button parameter can also be LeftButton (the default), MiddleButton, Button4, or Button5.\nOn top of these uses, there are some more complex examples of /click branching towards the end of Part II.\nAction bar button names.\nAs shown above, MultiBarRightButton1 refers to the first button of the right-hand vertical extra action bar. MultiBarRightButton2 refers to the second button, and so on. Names for buttons on each of the standard action bars are as follows, replacing the \"#\" with an appropriate number:\n ActionButton\"#\" Main Bar*\n BonusActionButton\"#\" Dynamic bar that switches actions based on Druid Forms, Warrior Stances, and Rogue Stealth*\n MultiBarBottomLeftButton\"#\" Bottom Left Bar\n MultiBarBottomRightButton\"#\" Bottom Right Bar\n MultiBarRightButton\"#\" Right Bar\n MultiBarLeftButton\"#\" Right Bar 2 (to the left of \"Right Bar\")\n PetActionButton\"#\" Pet Bar\n ShapeshiftButton\"#\" Druid Forms, Paladin Auras, Warrior Stances, Death Knight Presences, Rogue Stealth\nAdvanced Scripting.\nWhat scripts \"can't\" do.\nScripts are very powerful tools that can make complex decisions based on a number of criteria. Because of this power, Blizzard has limited the types of things we're allowed to do with them in order to keep macros and addons from taking actions that should be controlled by the player. I'm starting this section with what you can't do because I don't want you to get your hopes up. While scripts do remain useful for quite a few purposes, you cannot use them to cast spells, use items, change your action bar page or affect your target in any way. You are limited to using the \"secure\" commands already shown for those tasks.\nScripting.\nThe WoW UI is controlled by code written with the Lua scripting language. You can take advantage of this scripting system in a macro with the /run command (equivalent to /script--I use /run to save a few characters). The whole script must be on one line, though you can have multiple /run commands in a single macro.\nA full treatment of Lua and programming in general is well beyond the scope of this document. However, if you have some programming experience, you should head over to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/pil/\"&gt;Lua.org&lt;/a&gt; to learn the basics of Lua and if you don't have any programming experience, you may want to check out &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pine.fm/LearnToProgram/\"&gt;LearnToProgram&lt;/a&gt; to get a foundation of the concepts used in scripts.\nBlizzard provides many functions (called the API) which the Lua scripts can use to control the UI. You can view the API and other features of the UI system over at &lt;a href=\"Interface%20Customization\"&gt;Interface Customization&lt;/a&gt; (if you spend any considerable time with scripts and/or addons, Wowpedia will be indispensable). I can't possibly cover all the details of the UI environment, so I will simply present you with one of my favorite scripts as an example. See the previously linked references and the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D11381244%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;Mod Author Resources sticky&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nThe following macro (on which I based my CCWarn addon) will whisper everyone in your raid to change their targets if they have the same target as you. This is to help keep them from breaking the sheep that this macro casts as well.\n /cast Polymorph\n /run for i=1,GetNumRaidMembers()-1 do local u,t=\"raid\"..i,\"target\"if UnitIsUnit(u..t,t)then SendChatMessage(\"Change targets! Trying to sheep...\",\"WHISPER\",nil,UnitName(u))end end\nThere are two reasons that it looks as obfuscated as that. First, there is the 255 character limit (though there is a workaround in Part III); you often need to take certain shortcuts in order to get a script to fit in a macro. Second, you have to keep the entire script on one line. Under more ideal circumstances, that code would look more like:\n for i = 1, GetNumRaidMembers() - 1 do\n local unit = \"raid\"..i\n if UnitIsUnit(unit..\"target\", \"target\") then\n SendChatMessage(\"Change targets! Trying to sheep...\", \"WHISPER\", nil, UnitName(unit))\n end\n end\nMacro conditions.\nMacro conditions are a way to control actions based on various pieces of information. To dive right into an example, the following macro will cast Renew on a friendly target and Shadow Word: Pain on a hostile one.\n /cast [help] Renew; [harm] Shadow Word: Pain\nWhen you run this macro, the [help] condition is checked. This determines whether your target is someone you can cast beneficial spells on. If the [help] is true, it then casts Renew and the macro moves to the next line. Otherwise (either you have no target, or you can't cast a helpful spell on your target), it falls through to the next clause. Now it checks for the [harm] condition. [harm] is just like [help] but for offensive spells. If true, it casts Shadow Word: Pain. If it isn't true (no target or you can't harm your target) then it does nothing because there are no more clauses.\nNote: I could have left the [harm] check out and it would have functioned in much the same way. However, if you have no target or your target can be neither helped nor harmed, you would receive an error message or, depending on the spell, the target selector cursor.\nThe macro will now search for the selected target. If the target is [help] than it will use it's helpful spell. If the target is [harm] than it will use it's harmful spell. But nothing will happen when you haven't selected any target. Not even when you have \"Selfcast\" enabled in the interface options. but with the following macro it will use selfcast when nothing is selected.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [help] Healing Touch; [harm] Wrath; [@player] Healing Touch\nCommands that accept conditions.\nOnly the \"secure\" commands respond to macro conditions. In fact, the secure commands are the reason macro conditions were created in the first place. Insecure commands like chatting, emotes, etc. can be scripted using Lua and the /run command. Furthermore, Blizzard didn't want to confuse people who use semicolons in their chat messages. If /say could use macro conditions, the following would always just say \"Hello\":\n /say Hello; I'm a n00b\nThe following is a list of all the secure commands currently available in WoW:\n+ /equip, /equipslot, /equipset and /usetalents are not technically secure since their functionality is available to addons and macro scripts.\nIf you would like a way to use macro options for insecure commands, there are addons that provide such capability. My addon, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6853-MacroTalk.html\"&gt;MacroTalk&lt;/a&gt;, adds a number of /opt___ commands for each chat command and a generic /opt command that lets you use options to choose other full (insecure) slash commands. I believe the newest SuperMacro provides this functionality as well. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12573-MacroBroker.html\"&gt;Macro Broker&lt;/a&gt; provides this as well through a new command, /eval.\nSyntax overview.\nThere can be an awful lot of confusion around how macro options work, so I will take this early opportunity to break down the general concepts behind them. I will be providing some real-world examples using actual options. Don't worry too much if you don't understand what they mean. All options will be covered in detail later on.\nGeneral options syntax.\nAll slash commands basically work the same way. You have a command, and a set of parameters. The parameters depend on the command, and some commands don't take any. Here are a few examples:\n /cast Smite\n \\___/ \\___/\n | parameters\n command\n \n /petattack\n \\________/ V\n | parameters (empty)\n command\n \n /castsequence reset=target Immolate, Corruption, Curse of Agony, Siphon Life\n \\___________/ \\____________________________________________________________/\n command parameters\nMacro options allow you to choose a set of parameters based on a number of criteria. At the highest level, you have a set of criteria/parameter groups separated by semicolons. The semicolons can be seen as an \"else\" or an \"else if.\" The criteria consist of zero or more sets of conditions. Each condition set is enclosed with square brackets. Here is an illustration of this basic syntax.\n /command [conditions] [more conditions] parameters; [conditions] parameters ...\nAs you saw in the basic examples above, the command is evaluated from left to right. As soon as it finds a set of conditions that are true, it runs the command with the corresponding parameters. If there are no conditions in a clause, it will always be true. In fact, you can imagine a single-spell /cast command as a macro option with one clause that has no conditions. When the command does not have any conditions that are true, it will not execute at all.\nCondition syntax.\nEach set of conditions is a simple comma-separated list. They can appear in any order, though [@unit] is always taken into account first, before any of the conditionals. Think of the comma as an \"and.\" A condition like [help, nodead, @focus] means \"My focus is friendly AND not dead.\"\nNotice: Conditions are case-sensitive. If you use [Help] instead of [help], the macro will generate an error. However, this does not necessarily include the condition's parameters (described below). Still, it's usually better to consistently capitalize as things appear. Write spells and items just like you see in their tooltips. Follow the examples in this guide precisely.\nConditions themselves have a few building blocks. First off, as you just saw with \"nodead\", you can put \"no\" in front of a condition to mean the opposite. Notice that [nohelp] does not mean the same thing as [harm]. [harm] and [help] both return true only if there is a target to begin with. Furthermore, there are some targets that can neither be helped nor harmed (unflagged players of the other faction, non-combat pets, escort quests, etc.).\nSome conditions also take their own sets of parameters. For example, [stance] by itself means \"In any stance\" (useful for every class with stances except Warriors since they are always in a stance). However, you can also specify one or more particular stances to check. The set of parameters begins with a colon (:) and each parameter is separated with a slash (/) that means \"or.\" Here's a generic illustration of the syntax of a single condition where everything inside angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) is optional.\n [&lt;no&gt;condition&lt;:parameter&lt;/parameter&lt;/parameter&lt;...\u00bb\u00bb]\nHere's a simple example that uses Shield Bash in Defensive or Battle Stance, but switches into Defensive Stance if you're in Berserker:\n /cast [stance:1/2] Shield Bash; Defensive Stance\nThis can be simplified to pseudo-code English as \"IF currently in stance 1 OR in stance 2 then use Shield Bash ELSE switch to Defensive Stance.\nNote: \"no\" applies to the whole condition and all of its parameters. This means that [nostance:1/2] would mean \"anything but stances 1 or 2\"\nComplete EBNF syntax.\nFor those who are familiar with EBNF notation, the entire macro option syntax can be represented as follows:\n command = \"/\", command-verb, [ {command-object, \";\" } command-object] ]\n command-verb = ? any secure command word ?\n command-object = { condition } parameters\n parameters = ? anything which may be passed to the command word ?\n condition = \"[\" condition-phrase { \",\" condition-phrase } \"]\"\n condition-phrase = ([ \"no\" ], option-word, [ \":\" option-argument { \"/\" option-argument } ]\n | \"@\", target)\n option-argument = ? any one-word option, such as 'shift, 'ctrl', 'target', '1', '2' ?\n target = ? a target pattern ?\nEmpty parameters.\nOne source of confusion comes in dealing with parameterless commands. A very common error when writing macros is to add an extra semicolon to the end, but this creates some unexpected bugs. Take the following macro:\n /petattack [@focus, harm];\nTo the uninitiated, that looks like it'll send your pet after your focus if it's harmful, and do nothing otherwise. However, let's look at a breakdown of this macro:\n /petattack [@focus, harm] ;\n \\________/ \\____________/ V V V\n command options | | parameters (empty)\n | options (empty)\n parameters (empty)\nSee that extra blank set of options and parameters? Remember that a blank set of options always evaluates to true, so that second empty parameter gets passed to /petattack if the first conditions are false.\nEmpty conditions.\nSometimes you may want a command to cast on a particular target under certain circumstances but behave like normal if those conditions aren't true. In this case you will want to use an empty set of conditions which will always evaluate to true. The following macro will cast Flash of Light on the unit under your mouse. If you have no mouseover or it's hostile, the macro will behave like a plain /cast Flash of Light, casting on your target and respecting self-cast key and auto-self-cast interface option. \n /cast [@mouseover, help] [ ] Flash of Light\n[target=] or [@] versus unit parameters.\nSome commands accept units directly as their parameters. For example, /target party1 will target your first party member. The command /target [@party1] while a bit more verbose has the equivalent behavior. However, in most cases the designers don't want us to be able to test conditions on one unit and then act on another, so you must use one or the other. E.g., a macro like the following will not work as expected:\n /target [@focus, dead] party1\nWoW will ignore party1 because you set a unit with the [@] targeting option. There are some specific exceptions to this rule. A few commands have \"key units\" that are fundamental to the command. If you use that unit in your [@] option, WoW will allow you to specify another unit or will use the default unit for the command if you don't specify one. That last bit needs a concrete example: \n /focus [@focus, dead] [@focus, noharm] target\nIn this case, the key unit is focus. Since we are using [@focus], WoW will send \"focus\" to the /focus command. We could also have left off the \"target\" at the end since the /focus command defaults to your target. Below is a list of all commands with key units, and their default units if any. To reiterate for clarity, the key unit is a unit you can use in [@] option that will allow you to send another unit to the command. The Default Unit is the unit that will be sent to the command if you don't provide one. \n Command | Key Unit | Default Unit\n /target | target |\n /focus | focus | target\n /startattack | target | target\n /petattack | pettarget | target\nToggleable abilities.\nAs of patch 2.3.2, the cast command toggles abilities on and off. From the official patchnotes:\n/cast will toggle spells again unless the name is prefixed with an exclamation mark, e.g. /castsequence Steady Shot, !Auto Shot\nExamples of such toggleable abilities are Stealth, Shoot or Mass Dispel (the green targeting circle). If you want to spam such a macro without toggling the ability immediately off, prefix its name with an exclamation mark.\n /cast !Stealth\n /cast !Mass Dispel\n /cast !Shoot\nMacro option applications.\nMany of the commands introduced in Part I don't really come into their own until you add macro options to the mix. You've seen a few simple examples recently, but there's still a bit more to cover. The next couple sections will tie up these loose ends and hopefully give you some inspiration to start you on your way.\nUsing Focus.\nFocus is a &lt;a href=\"UnitId\"&gt;unit ID&lt;/a&gt; like target, player, or raidpet1target. It allows you to reference a mob, player, or NPC you specify. The simplest usage of focus is with key bindings. There are two focus-related functions in the bindings menu: Focus Target, and Target Focus. Focus Target sets your focus to whatever you are currently targeting (it will clear your focus if you have nothing targeted). Once you have a focus set, you can use it as a unit ID for any other command. Target Focus will, as you might guess, target the entity you have focused. However, these bindings don't really take full advantage of focus. In order to get the most bang for your buck, you will need to use macros with macro options. \nOne of the most common uses is to set a crowd control target. A mage can select a mob to sheep and set it as their focus. Now they can change targets for DPS and use the following macro whenever they need to re-sheep.\n /cast [@focus] Polymorph\nOr maybe a healer could set their focus to the main tank. Using the game's focus unitframe, they would then have a frame devoted to their main tank that they could easily use for healing.\nIn addition to the key bindings, there are also the /focus and /clearfocus slash commands. Without any parameters, /focus works exactly like the key binding, setting your current target as your focus. You can also specify any valid unit ID (see Targeting above) or name as a parameter to /focus: \n /focus party3target\nHere is an example of more advanced focusing:\n /focus [@focus, noharm] [@focus, dead] [modifier]\n /stopmacro [@focus, noexists]\n /cast [@focus] Polymorph\nThe first line sets your focus to your current target (or clears your focus if you don't have a target) in one of the following situations:\nThe second line keeps the macro from proceeding if you don't have a focus. Finally, it casts Polymorph on your focus. This gives you a one-button solution for your crowd control with focus. You may notice that we could have used an exists condition in the /cast command instead of a separate /stopmacro command. However, /stopmacro affords us a bit more flexibility by stoping any other commands we may add to the macro later (like a warning in /p).\nIt's possible to swap your target and your focus, giving you in effect two targets you can toggle between:\n /cleartarget [@target, dead]\n /clearfocus [@focus, dead]\n /target focus\n /cleartarget [@focus, noexists]\n /targetlasttarget\n /focus target\n /targetlasttarget\nThe first two lines clear the target and/or focus if they are dead (if you really want to keep track of multiple dead targets, e.g. to resurrect or loot them, then delete those lines). The fourth is needed because /target focus doesn't clear your target if you have no current focus (without it, the fifth line would then retrieve your previous target).\nMacro Branching with /click.\nSay you want a button that chooses between three different spells based on shift, ctrl, or no modifier and two different targets depending on left or right click. This can be done all in one like the following:\n /cast [mod:shift, button:2, @player] [mod:shift, @party1] Greater Heal; [mod:ctrl, button:2, @player] [mod:ctrl, @party1] Flash Heal; [nomod, button:2, @player] [nomod, @party1] Renew\nThat's quite an unwieldy bit of script there. We can split it onto multiple lines for clarity and remove some redundancies to save room but it's still a bit of a beast:\n /cast [mod:shift, button:1, @party1] [mod:shift, @player] Greater Heal\n /cast [mod:ctrl, button:1, @party1] [mod:ctrl, @player] Flash Heal\n /cast [button:1, @party1] [@player] Renew \nHowever, by using one master macro to choose the target based on mouse button and two macros to choose the spells based on modifier key, we can make it much easier to follow. For the sake of these examples, macros 2 and 3 are on MultiBarLeftButton2 and MultiBarLeftButton3, respectively.\nMacro 1:\n /click [button:1] MultiBarLeftButton2; MultiBarLeftButton3\nMacro 2:\n /cast [mod:shift, @party1] Greater Heal; [mod:ctrl, @party1] Flash Heal; [@party1] Renew\nMacro 3:\n /cast [mod:shift, @player] Greater Heal; [mod:ctrl, @player] Flash Heal; [@player] Renew\nCustom icons.\nIf you would like to use custom icons for your macros, you can place them in your World of Warcraft\\Interface\\Icons folder (creating this folder if it doesn't exist). The files must follow the same guidelines for UI textures. Namely, they must be either BLP files or 24-bit/32-bit alpha uncompressed TGA files. Their dimensions must be powers of two up to 512 (e.g. 32x32, 512x128). Note: any images that aren't square will look squished on your action bar.\nKeeping macros on multiple computers.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2%23User%20Interface\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, macros are now kept 'server-side', so there is \"...no longer a need to reconfigure them when logging in using another computer.\""}

An alternative is to simply create a Slider object of your own, but there is no HOWTO on that at the moment. Using &lt;a href=\"API%20CreateFrame\"&gt;CreateFrame&lt;/a&gt;() to create the list items dynamically may also be a good idea.\"\nHow to do it.\nBefore starting out, it helps to visualize that the Scrollbar is nothing more than a vertical slider. We set a min, max, steps to the slider and then react to changes in its offset. The slider doesn't keep tabs of any of our data beyond this. It's up to us to handle the actual movement of data as the user moves the thumb.\nYou can look at ItemTextFrame.xml/lua, QuestFrame.xml/lua for other examples of how to make ScrollFrames. This will focus on the FauxScrollFrameTemplate route, for a series of rows we define in detail.\nFauxScrollFrameTemplate is inherited from UIPanelScrollFrameTemplate, both in UIPanelTemplates.xml. FriendsFrame.xml is a good reference for how to flesh out a FauxScrollFrame with things such as highlights and \"gutter\" textures. But for simplicity's sake ours will be very basic: An up+down arrow at the ends of the scrollbar and a thumb to move the data.\nFirst, we need data to scroll through:\n function MyMod_OnLoad()\n MyModData = {};\n for i=1,50 do\n MyModData[i] = \"Test \"..math.random(100);\n end\n end\nNow we have an array of 50 entries with \"Test (some random number up to 100)\"\nNext, we need a scrollbar on the window:\n &lt;ScrollFrame name=\"MyModScrollBar\" inherits=\"FauxScrollFrameTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMRIGHT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnVerticalScroll&gt;\n FauxScrollFrame_OnVerticalScroll(self, offset, 16, MyModScrollBar_Update); \n &lt;/OnVerticalScroll&gt;\n &lt;OnShow&gt;\n MyModScrollBar_Update()\n &lt;/OnShow&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/ScrollFrame&gt;\nThe components of the ScrollFrame that we care about now:\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"0\" y=\"-8\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMRIGHT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"-30\" y=\"8\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n\"Note: The OnShow can happen BEFORE your mods' OnLoad. In 99% of cases this is not important but for testing purposes you may need to delay the OnShow to the mod's \"primary\" OnLoad.\"\nThe all-important MyModScrollBar_Update will look something like this in its most essential form:\n function MyModScrollBar_Update()\n FauxScrollFrame_Update(MyModScrollBar,50,5,16);\n -- 50 is max entries, 5 is number of lines, 16 is pixel height of each line\n end\nIn UIPanelTemplates.lua, the function is documented as:\n -- Function to handle the update of manually calculated\n scrollframes. Used mostly for listings with an indeterminate\n number of items\n function FauxScrollFrame_Update(frame, numItems, numToDisplay,\n valueStep, button, smallWidth, bigWidth, highlightFrame,\n smallHighlightWidth, bigHighlightWidth, alwaysShowScrollBar )\nIf the function that's the second parameter of FauxScrollFrame_OnVerticalScroll doesn't contain a FauxScrollFrame_Update, we will get an error. Once we have an update function within &lt;OnVerticalScroll&gt;, and a FauxScrollFrame_Update call within that function, the scrollbar is functional. We can test it by getting the offset and printing it:\n function MyModScrollBar_Update()\n FauxScrollFrame_Update(MyModScrollBar,50,5,16);\n -- 50 is max entries, 5 is number of lines, 16 is pixel height of each line\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"We're at \"..FauxScrollFrame_GetOffset(MyModScrollBar));\n end\nTry that and scroll the bar around. You'll see that _GetOffset will return from 0 to 45, which happens to be 50-5.\nWe now have an indexed array of data and a scrollbar. Now we need to display the data based on the scrollbar's position. First we need to construct the xml elements of the display.\nStart simple and make one button template to play around with:\n &lt;Button name = \"MyModEntryTemplate\" virtual=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"150\" y=\"16\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;NormalFont style=\"GameFontHighlightLeft\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nThis is a virtual button, 150 pixels wide and 16 pixels tall, that can be used to display text.\nNow use this template to draw our series of buttons:\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry1\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModScrollBar\" relativePoint=\"TOPLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"8\" y=\"0\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry2\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry1\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry3\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry2\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry4\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry3\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry5\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry4\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\nThe above draws the first entry with top-left aligned to top-left of the scrollbar's scrollable area, 8 pixels to the right, then it draws each one below aligned with top-left of next one aligned to bottom-left of previous.\nNow we go back to the update function and add the code to display our data depending on the position of the bar:\nWe have 5 lines on the screen at all times: MyModEntry1, MyModEntry2, etc. Each entry has a text inside named MyModEntry1_Text, MyModEntry2_Text, etc.\n function MyModScrollBar_Update()\n local line; -- 1 through 5 of our window to scroll\n local lineplusoffset; -- an index into our data calculated from the scroll offset\n FauxScrollFrame_Update(MyModScrollBar,50,5,16);\n for line=1,5 do\n lineplusoffset = line + FauxScrollFrame_GetOffset(MyModScrollBar);\n if lineplusoffset &lt; 50 then\n getglobal(\"MyModEntry\"..line):SetText(MyModData[lineplusoffset]);\n getglobal(\"MyModEntry\"..line):Show();\n else\n getglobal(\"MyModEntry\"..line):Hide();\n end\n end\n end\nNow we have a scrollbar that scrolls through the data and redisplays it when we move. Now you can customize it to your mod's needs. First step would be to make the values fit your mod, especially the size and shape of the data.\nRemember to check out FriendsFrame.xml/.lua to see how to select entries by locking/unlocking its highlight, how to draw a gutter, create multiple columns, etc.\nCompleted example.\nMyModScrollBar.toc.\n ## Interface: 30000\n ## Title: MyMod\n ## Notes: Example of using FauxScrollFrameTemplate\n MyModScrollBar.xml\nMyModScrollBar.lua.\n function MyMod_OnLoad()\n for i=1,50 do\n MyModData[i] = \"Test \"..math.random(100)\n end\n MyModScrollBar:Show()\n end\n function MyModScrollBar_Update()\n local line; -- 1 through 5 of our window to scroll\n local lineplusoffset; -- an index into our data calculated from the scroll offset\n FauxScrollFrame_Update(MyModScrollBar,50,5,16);\n for line=1,5 do\n lineplusoffset = line + FauxScrollFrame_GetOffset(MyModScrollBar);\n if lineplusoffset &lt;= 50 then\n getglobal(\"MyModEntry\"..line):SetText(MyModData[lineplusoffset]);\n getglobal(\"MyModEntry\"..line):Show();\n else\n getglobal(\"MyModEntry\"..line):Hide();\n end\n end\n end\nMyModScrollBar.xml.\n &lt;Ui&gt;\n &lt;Script file=\"MyModScrollBar.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Button name = \"MyModEntryTemplate\" virtual=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"150\" y=\"16\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;NormalFont style=\"GameFontHighlightLeft\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"MyMod\" parent=\"UIParent\" enableMouse=\"true\" movable=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"196\" y=\"96\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n MyMod_OnLoad()\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;Backdrop bgFile=\"Interface\\DialogFrame\\UI-DialogBox-Background\" edgeFile=\"Interface\\Tooltips\\UI-Tooltip-Border\" tile=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;BackgroundInsets&gt;\n &lt;AbsInset left=\"4\" right=\"4\" top=\"4\" bottom=\"4\" /&gt;\n &lt;/BackgroundInsets&gt;\n &lt;TileSize&gt;\n &lt;AbsValue val=\"16\" /&gt;\n &lt;/TileSize&gt;\n &lt;EdgeSize&gt;\n &lt;AbsValue val=\"16\" /&gt;\n &lt;/EdgeSize&gt;\n &lt;/Backdrop&gt;\n &lt;Frames&gt;\n &lt;ScrollFrame name=\"MyModScrollBar\" inherits=\"FauxScrollFrameTemplate\" hidden=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"0\" y=\"-8\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"BOTTOMRIGHT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"-30\" y=\"8\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnVerticalScroll&gt;\n FauxScrollFrame_OnVerticalScroll(self, offset, 16, MyModScrollBar_Update);\n &lt;/OnVerticalScroll&gt;\n &lt;OnShow&gt;\n MyModScrollBar_Update()\n &lt;/OnShow&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/ScrollFrame&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry1\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModScrollBar\" relativePoint=\"TOPLEFT\"&gt;\n &lt;Offset&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"8\" y=\"0\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Offset&gt;\n &lt;/Anchor&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry2\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry1\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry3\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry2\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry4\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry3\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;Button name=\"MyModEntry5\" inherits=\"MyModEntryTemplate\"&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;\n &lt;Anchor point=\"TOPLEFT\" relativeTo=\"MyModEntry4\" relativePoint=\"BOTTOMLEFT\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Button&gt;\n &lt;/Frames&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;"}

Note the use of movable and enableMouse attributes, as well as the OnLoad script allowing the frame to be dragged around using the left mouse button. The codice_6 check in the OnDragStart handler illustrates that you can easily implement frame locking by not having your widget handlers call :StartMoving() when the frame is locked.\n &lt;Frame name=\"DragFrame1\" enableMouse=\"true\" movable=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n self:RegisterForDrag(\"LeftButton\")\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;OnDragStart&gt;\n if not self.isLocked then\n self:StartMoving()\n end\n &lt;/OnDragStart&gt;\n &lt;OnDragStop&gt;\n self:StopMovingOrSizing()\n &lt;/OnDragStop&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture setAllPoints=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Color r=\"1.0\" g=\"0.5\" b=\"0.0\" a=\"0.5\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Texture&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;Size x=\"64\" y=\"64\" /&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;&lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\" relativeTo=\"UIParent\"/&gt;&lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nWhile OnDrag* handlers typically require the mouse button to be held down for a small amount of time prior to enabling the mouse behavior, making them well suited for dragging widgets that normally respond to clicks. However, if the frame you wish to make draggable is not normally a button, you can use OnMouseUp/OnMouseDown to provide a more responsive experience. If OnMouseDown/OnMouseUp were used instead of OnDragStart/OnDragStop in the example above, the OnLoad handler could be omitted.\nUsing TitleRegion.\nFrames can have a TitleRegion object that handles dragging automatically -- as long as the mouse is held down within the TitleRegion, it'll allow the frame to be dragged.\nThe frame created below will be draggable by clicking on its top 20 pixels:\n &lt;Frame enableMouse=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Size x=\"100\" y=\"100\"/&gt;\n &lt;TitleRegion&gt;\n &lt;Size x=\"100\" y=\"20\"/&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;&lt;Anchor point=\"TOP\"/&gt;&lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/TitleRegion&gt;\n &lt;Layers&gt;\n &lt;Layer level=\"ARTWORK\"&gt;\n &lt;Texture setAllPoints=\"true\"&gt;\n &lt;Color r=\"1.0\" g=\"0.5\" b=\"0.0\" a=\"0.5\" /&gt;\n &lt;/Texture&gt;\n &lt;/Layer&gt;\n &lt;/Layers&gt;\n &lt;Anchors&gt;&lt;Anchor point=\"CENTER\" relativeTo=\"UIParent\"/&gt;&lt;/Anchors&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nUsing Lua.\nThe OnDragStart/OnDragStop and OnMouseDown/OnMouseUp methods translate trivially to an entirely-in-Lua implementation, shown below.\n local frame = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", \"DragFrame2\", UIParent)\n frame:SetMovable(true)\n frame:EnableMouse(true)\n frame:RegisterForDrag(\"LeftButton\")\n frame:SetScript(\"OnDragStart\", function(self)\n self:StartMoving()\n end)\n frame:SetScript(\"OnDragStop\", function(self)\n self:StopMovingOrSizing()\n end)\n -- The code below makes the frame visible, and is not necessary to enable dragging.\n frame:SetPoint(\"CENTER\")\n frame:SetSize(64, 64)\n local tex = frame:CreateTexture(\"ARTWORK\")\n tex:SetAllPoints()\n tex:SetColorTexture(1.0, 0.5, 0, 0.5)\nNote that the StartMoving and StopMovingOrSizing widget methods can be reused as widget handlers in this case, avoiding the creation of additional functions."}

{"id": "243134", "revid": "40288547", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=243134", "title": "Making money with companions", "text": "This is a &lt;a href=\"Guide%20to%20making%20money\"&gt;Guide to making money&lt;/a&gt; through selling &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt; pets \"(a.k.a. small pets, non-combat pets, mini-pets, or vanity pets)\". Due to their desirability with &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt; hunters, pet collectors, and casual players alike, companion pets can be used to make a significant amount of gold regardless of your level or faction.\nThis is not a guide to collecting pets, simply a guide for easy money-making by selling them.\nYou can sell crafted pets, pets dropped from mobs, or pets sold from vendors, on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; (AH).\nOn most servers you should easily get for any pet. Some pets sell for hundreds, even thousands! You just need to be smart, do a bit of travelling or farming, and be patient with the AH. Be aware that generally cute or nicer-coloured pets sell for more.\nRequirements.\nSelling pets can be done at any level! Each starting area has a nearby pet vendor, all you need is a little bit of funding to get you started. Dropped pets can also be found in areas as low-level as &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;. Preferably you should have flight paths to major and neutral cities, or your &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; set to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; to cut down on your traveling time.\nCross-Faction Selling.\nVendor pets may fetch an even higher price on the &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;, due to the difficulty opposing faction players have in acquiring them.\nYou may also set up cross-faction pet selling via your &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forum\"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing the other faction to know you're selling, and assuring a buyer in the process.\nVendor Pets.\nThere may be several reasons why somebody will buy a pet at auction, instead of directly from the vendor:\nAlliance.\n sells &lt;a href=\"Snowshoe%20Rabbit\"&gt;Snowshoe Rabbit&lt;/a&gt; for . Although her location is hard to reach, the rabbits come at a very low price.\n sells 4 different &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s for each. The Cornish Rex and Orange Tabby generally don't sell well as they are both similar colour.\n sells 2 &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt; for . Most players don't wish to travel to Darnassus, due to being out-of-the-way, so you're likely to find a buyer seeking convenience.\n sells stunning &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt; pets at . Players without the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion cannot access this vendor, so these desirable pets can achieve a high AH price. Also, as with Darnassus, most players don't wish to travel to The Exodar, due to being out-of-the-way, so you're likely to find a buyer seeking convenience.\n is a rare spawn vendor. He sells one item; &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Carrier%20%28White%20Kitten%29\"&gt;Cat Carrier (White Kitten)&lt;/a&gt; for , and only ever has one in stock. Due to this kitten being 'cute' and pretty hard to find, it can fetch a profit of several hundreds, especially when sold on the &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde.\n sells 3 different &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s for . Due to their ease to buy directly from the vendor, and unpopular looks, they are a bad choice for resale.\n is a &lt;a href=\"Prairie%20Dog%20Whistle\"&gt;Prairie Dog Whistle&lt;/a&gt; vendor. They sell for and are highly desired due to their looks.\n sells &lt;a href=\"cockroach\"&gt;cockroach&lt;/a&gt; for . These are not popular, and may also be bought from a &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; vendor in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, making this a bad choice for pet sellers.\n sells stunning &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Hatchling\"&gt;Dragonhawk Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; pets at . Players without the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expension cannot access this vendor, so these desirable pets can achieve a high AH price. Also, most players don't wish to travel to Silvermoon City, due to being out-of-the-way, so you're likely to find a buyer seeking convenience.\nNeutral Vendors.\n sells a couple of &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s at the cost of . Selling these at the neutral AH is not wise, as many people access the neutral AH not far from where the vendor stands.\n comes and goes with the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;. He sells two &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s for each. The &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Frog%20Box\"&gt;Tree Frog Box&lt;/a&gt; is unlimited, but the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Frog%20Box\"&gt;Wood Frog Box&lt;/a&gt; only comes in a limited stock of one every few hours. He also runs around the faire, and can be very hard to catch up with. Holding on to these pets and selling them when Darkmoon Faire is over can be very profitable.\n sells &lt;a href=\"Ancona%20Chicken\"&gt;Ancona Chicken&lt;/a&gt; for . This is an out-of-the-way location, especially for Alliance, so you're likely to find a buyer seeking convenience.\nArgent Tournament.\nAll races at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; have faction-specific pets available to them. Any given character must both unlock the ability to buy from each racial quartermaster for their faction, but must earn the tokens (&lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt;) required to buy the pet. In addition to the racial pets, the tournament factions (&lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;) have their own pets. Each character thus has access to 6 pets specific to their faction. Due to the rarity of these pets and the work needed to earn them, they can be sold for a sizeable amount. Whether the cost to buy them from the vendor outweighs what players will buy them for is a subjective decision.\nCrafted Pets.\nThe only pet of note here is the &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Squirrel%20Box\"&gt;Mechanical Squirrel Box&lt;/a&gt;, crafted by &lt;a href=\"engineers\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt;. This is taught by , a world drop for low-level mobs. It is pretty likely that an engineer will have it, so he will probably not ask for a large fee. The materials are very easy to obtain, making it perfect to craft in large quantities when convenient. You can make a decent profit, from depending on your server's market.\nWhile more engineering pets are available, the materials for them are much more costly, and there's less chance the engineer will have the recipe.\nFarmable Pets.\nWhich pets to farm are entirely up to the time you're willing to devote, and the server's market. There's also the random element here, which means that you may spend many fruitless hours farming, or may get incredibly lucky and make a big profit fast. Unless you have a lot of free time on your hands, avoid seeking pets such as &lt;a href=\"Hyacinth%20Macaw\"&gt;Hyacinth Macaw&lt;/a&gt;. Although they can go for upwards of to hardcore pet collectors, their high price is not unwarranted, and the drop rate is incalculably low.\nGood farming choices are:"}

These crustaceans live in colonies along the shores of Azeroth and in the deeper oceans.\nThey are most commonly found on the coastlines of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; and recently &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Some were also found in the waters surrounding &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and around the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Arkkoran\"&gt;Temple of Arkkoran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that they may be descendants of a lobster &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, though for the moment this is only a theory.\nThe lobster-like race of makrura, while widely considered primitive, has an innate capacity for water magic.\nThey are also found on .\nMakrura don't have bones.\nBackground.\nMakrura are aquatic creatures that superficially resemble enormous crayfish, and uneducated observers have mistakenly dubbed them \"lobster men\". They sport two strong pincers used solely for combat, as well as six small tentacles close to the head that can be used for finer manipulation. They walk on four small legs that extend out from under a flat, flippered tail. Their carapaces come in many colors, including shades of red, blue, and black. &lt;a href=\"Omnia\"&gt;Omnia&lt;/a&gt; scholars have suggested that the makrura have some capacity in magic. Some even possess a crude &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic power, fighting with the force of water itself.\nRecently the makrura have shown increased activity on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests a possible future attack.\nBogstroks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; that settled in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; breed creatures called &lt;a href=\"bogstrok\"&gt;bogstrok&lt;/a&gt;s that closely resemble makrura, although the bogstrok are thought to be native to Outland.\nIn the RPG.\nThe makrura are a race of &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; lobsters from the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mak%27aru\"&gt;Mak'aru&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt;, that live primarily in the sea. Makrura speak &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact they may have invented the language. They use a primitive but powerful form of magic that is related to the element of water. They are also incredibly hostile and will attempt to kill anybody that comes near them. They are often found underwater guarding shipwrecks. Makrura are amphibious and dwell equally well on land or under water, although they prefer shallow, tropical seas. Makrura fight by grappling an opponent with one pincer and holding it in place while the other pincer tears it apart. Makrura defend their territory aggressively, and they attack murlocs and naga on sight.\nMakrura are hardy creatures with exceptionally powerful pincers but they are clumsy, their primitive society allows for little intellectual stimulation, and their strange mindset unnerves others. They are 12 ft. long, usually &lt;a href=\"chaotic%20neutral\"&gt;chaotic neutral&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes also speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;. They weight 500 lbs. and can be &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMakrura have physical and magical prowess and are skilled underwater. \nSociety.\nMakrura society is matriarchal. Male makrura mate only once and then molt into sexless drones (although they are still referred to as \u201che\u201d for all practical purposes). Makrura appear scattered and tribal, but in reality they have a large capital city, Mak\u2019aru, in the Eye, close to the naga capital of Nazjatar. Makrura are primitive, knowing little of advanced magic, craftsmanship, or technology. They use tools only to build their crude underwater dwellings and shellfish traps, or to break apart giant clams (their favorite food). Makrura decorate their hard carapaces with tribal markings and colors, but otherwise disdain clothing, armor, and other trappings of civilization.\nTheir carapaces come in many colors, including shades of red, blue, and black. Makrura, regardless of gender, are typically 12 feet long and weigh 500 pounds. Both appear identical to non-makrura observers unless a female is carrying a clutch of eggs on her torso. Females typically bear several hundred eggs at a time, maintaining them for several months until they hatch, but less than one fifth of these survive to maturity.\nMakrura have little or no access to advanced technologies, metalworking, or arcane magic. The vast majority of heroic makrura are barbarians. Scouts, warriors, and healers other than shaman are uncommon, while arcanists and tinkers are virtually unknown. Makrura are gregarious by nature and fiercely protective of their fellow makrura and their communities. Occasionally, though, a wanderer sets out on his own, driven by a desire to explore and see new things.\nRelations.\nMakrura suffer from the extreme disadvantage of being tasty to many carnivorous races, a fact appreciated all too well by their enemies on both land and sea. While land dwellers sometimes hunt them for food, a makrura\u2019s most hated enemies are murlocs and naga (but especially the latter). Murlocs consider makrura a snack to be eaten raw, while naga maintain a wide variety of makrura recipes and sometimes raise the poor creatures from birth in special farms.\nMany of these individuals turn to the land, where the dangers posed by murlocs and naga are not as acute. Wandering makrura are rare, so much so that members of the Horde or Alliance don\u2019t know what to make of them. If a makrura can speak an understandable tongue, he might be able to make his own way, but he is always treated with curiosity or outright wonder. In wilder areas, their resemblance to shellfish might cause a makrura to be mistaken for a walking seafood dinner.\nThe lobsterlike makrura hate the naga and are their chief enemy. They don\u2019t take kindly to outsiders of any kind, but their war with the naga \u2014 which has been going on for who knows how long \u2014 makes them potential allies. They are protective of their homeland.\nLanguages.\nMakrura speak Nerglish, a low aquatic tongue. Makrura sometimes learn the language of their hated enemies, to better combat them. Those makrura who deal with shore-dwellers may learn languages appropriate to trading and negotiations."}

They are a type of &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, and other makrura place great value in makrura prawns. Makrura prawns train as animals of war. Makrura prawns also act, in makrura settlements,as guard dogs do for humans.\nIn their natural habitats, makrura prawns are unremarkable. They spend their days moving slowly across the ocean floor or rocky beaches, scavenging for food. Despite their large claws, makrura prawns are scavengers rather than hunters, as they don\u2019t have the speed to bring down anything faster than a garden slug. The seafloor is a good spot for scavenging, though, since most everything that dies in the water sinks to the bottom. Some of it washes up on beaches, so makrura prawns frequent those areas as well.\nMost makrura prawns live in saltwater, but freshwater varieties exist. Both taste excellent. \nIn their natural habitat, makrura prawns are not aggressive. They are large enough to intimidate rival scavengers, and use their claws primarily for tearing dead food into smaller chunks. However, when a makrura prawn encounters rivals for a piece of food, it advances menacingly (well, as menacingly as these creatures can) and strikes with its claws to drive the intruder away. Often, the intruder is another makrura prawn. Makrura prawns also fight in defense if they cannot escape.\nOther makrura train makrura prawns to be more aggressive. Under a skilled handler, a makrura prawn confronts enemies. They serve better as guard beasts than as attack creatures, however, as do other makrura. A typical makrura tactic is to remain away from an enemy, allowing their tidecallers and other spellcasters to pummel them with spells and draw them into melee; then the makrura warriors and prawns attack. Makrura prawns are also a favored summoned creature of makrura spellcasters."}

A clan usually has a chief &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and several apprentices, all of whom are rivals for their chief's attention. Should the chief shaman perish, the apprentices battle to the death for the right to become the new spiritual leader of their clan. Makrura tidecallers tend to be weaker than their fellows, but make up for their lack of strength with a command of divine magic. &lt;a href=\"Makrura\"&gt;Makrura&lt;/a&gt; tidecaller chiefs can wield great power and are rightly feared.

During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he was one of the dreadlords sent by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a jailor of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. He commanded the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and was chosen to head up the plot to turn &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to darkness and make him the Lich King's greatest champion. However, the Lich King then betrayed Mal'Ganis by allowing Arthas to kill him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Mal'Ganis orchestrated the creation of the extremist &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and led it under the guise of &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Grand Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;, plotting to take revenge and overthrow the Lich King, but he had to flee after being discovered by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, Mal'Ganis and his fellow dreadlords reappeared in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and revealed their true allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Mal'Ganis led a diversion while the other nathrezim freed the captive Denathrius from &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently escaped from captivity himself to assist the Jailer's efforts in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately being defeated by the mortal &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nOrigin.\nMal'Ganis and the rest of the nathrezim were originally created by &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; realm of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, to serve as infiltrators and spread &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;'s influence through the cosmos. Mal'Ganis and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; seem to have personally known each other during this time. After one of the nathrezim's incursions triggered an invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and led to rising tensions with &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;, Denathrius banished the nathrezim from the Shadowlands. However, in truth, this \"exile\" was also part of the Sire's plan: the nathrezim's mission remained unchanged, and all of the schemes they carried out in the following eons as members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; were only pawns in &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s long-term plan of reaching the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the Shadowlands and remaking reality. Mal'Ganis believed that if the Jailer succeeded, those who had served him faithfully would be \"rewarded in kind\".\nThe Third War.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the Legion lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. A group of dreadlords consisting of Mal'Ganis, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; took turns torturing the orc until he agreed to serve the Legion, at which point Kil'jaeden transformed him into the spectral &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords equipped Ner'zhul with the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and a set of armor including the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, before he was imprisoned in a block of ice which was hurled to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to become the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden sent the nathrezim who had tortured Ner'zhul to accompany him, act as his jailors and executors, and ensure that he succeeded in his task of spreading a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; to weaken Azeroth's defenses in preparation for the Legion's invasion. Mal'Ganis and the other dreadlords' true master, the Jailer, intended to use the Lich King to establish his own influence on Azeroth, a plan which, however, failed when Ner'zhul and his successors either proved too weak or defied the Jailer's will.\nIn time, the Lich King recruited &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who founded the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and began to spread the plague throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Lich King also decided he needed to use Frostmourne to create an additional champion to act as his direct surrogate beyond the Frozen Throne. He knew the dreadlords would never allow him to create a servant of his own, but he was able to play on their fears of Kil'jaeden to convince them that finding other mortal champions was the key to victory, all while making them believe that it had been their idea. With the nathrezim's approval, the Lich King thrust Frostmourne from the Frozen Throne to await a wielder.\nMal'Ganis was responsible for commanding the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces in Lordaeron at the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging&lt;/a&gt;, with Kel'Thuzad as his subordinate. The Lich King settled on Lordaeron's crown prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, as the perfect candidate for a champion. Based on the Lich King's advice, the dreadlords crafted a plan to lure Arthas to Frostmourne in Northrend. On their orders, Kel'Thuzad faced the prince in battle and revealed that he was a servant of Mal'Ganis, who lurked in the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. As he continued battling the Scourge, Arthas grew increasingly unhinged and obsessed with killing the dreadlord. On arrival to Stratholme, he discovered that it had already been infected by the plague and ordered his forces to &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;purge the city&lt;/a&gt; before its inhabitants could turn into undead. Mal'Ganis remotely projected his voice to taunt Arthas during the subsequent massacre, before eventually appearing to him in person amid the burning streets. The dreadlord challenged Arthas to face him in Northrend for a true battle, then shrouded himself in magic and left the city. He left behind &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20from%20the%20Nathrezim%20Homeworld\"&gt;an artifact&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim homeworld.\nAs expected, Arthas sailed north with the royal fleet. At the time, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Expedition\"&gt;Dwarven Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, was searching Northrend for ancient artifacts. Mal'Ganis and the other dreadlords secretly planted clues and false information about Frostmourne in the dwarves' camp in order to lead them to it. Upon arriving in Northrend, Arthas joined forces with Muradin against the undead, but the prince's obsession with the dreadlord led him further down the path of evil, leading him to burn his own ships, lie to his men, and betray his mercenaries. The next day, Mal'Ganis attacked Arthas' camp with an overwhelming force of Scourge. The prince and Muradin sought out &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;Frostmourne Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, where Arthas took up the runeblade and became a servant of the Lich King. He rejoined his forces and easily cut through the Scourge to reach Mal'Ganis. Instead of telling Arthas to stand down, the Lich King took the chance to eliminate one of his most powerful Legion handlers and ordered the prince to kill the dreadlord. After a short duel, Arthas felled his enemy with Frostmourne. Mal'Ganis died in disbelief, both at having been defeated and at having been betrayed by Ner'zhul.\nMal'Ganis' death infuriated the other dreadlords, but the Lich King convinced them that it had been an accident and that Arthas hadn't been under his full control yet. Both Arthas and Ner'zhul believed Mal'Ganis to be slain. However, the nathrezim had previously shielded themselves from Frostmourne's power. As such, the sword did not consume Mal'Ganis' soul but instead sent it back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; where he would be reborn in a new body.\nThe Scarlet Onslaught.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Mal'Ganis returned and orchestrated the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, a splinter faction of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; that traveled to Northrend to battle the Scourge. His goal, according to himself, was to have the Onslaught wash over the Scourge and thereby allow him to get revenge on Arthas, who had become the new Lich King. This mirrors &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption of the original Scarlet Crusade.\nMal'Ganis began by whispering to the Crusade's high general, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, in her dreams. Abbendis thought that the voice was that of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, even though it left her feeling unnaturally cold. The voice told her and &lt;a href=\"High%20Abbot%20Landgren\"&gt;High Abbot Landgren&lt;/a&gt; to create a cadre of the most faithful to travel north, and to name it the \"Scarlet Onslaught\". Shortly after, the Scourge attacked the from . During the assault, the Lich King could sense Mal'Ganis' presence (\"An old enemy. An enemy that I destroyed long ago...\") but decided that it did not matter. Mal'Ganis sent a vision of the Enclave's destruction to Abbendis and Landgren, urging them to leave with the most faithful and abandon the rest of the Crusade to their fate. Abbendis did not understand why the Light would give her such a dishonorable command, but obeyed nonetheless.\nThe \"Light\" stayed silent during the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Fleet\"&gt;Scarlet Fleet&lt;/a&gt;'s voyage to Northrend, before one day intervening again by moving Abbendis' hand to make adjustments to her maps, showing her where to go. Upon landfall at &lt;a href=\"Crusader%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Crusader's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Light\" spoke through Abbendis to declare the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the birth of the Onslaught. During construction of &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, Mal'Ganis assumed the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Grand Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt; (who had died in Northrend years prior) and sought out Abbendis, telling her that he'd been sent by the Light to advise her. Although he claimed that he didn't intend to replace her, he effectively undermined her authority and took over command of the Onslaught.\n\"Westwind\" warned Abbendis about the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s upcoming invasion of Northrend, and created the sect of &lt;a href=\"raven%20priest\"&gt;raven priest&lt;/a&gt;s by passing on a \"blessing\" from the Light to High Abbot Landgren. Abbendis felt that something wasn't right about the admiral, but dismissed the feeling and resolved to stay faithful, even though the \"Light\" had stopped speaking to her in conjunction with the admiral's arrival. Shortly after the Alliance and Horde's arrival to the Dragonblight, Westwind ordered some Onslaught men to begin building a new base, &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance and Horde later came to New Hearthglen to disrupt the Onslaught. Mal'Ganis predicted that they would try to get information from High Abbot Landgren and warned him, which led to the abbot killing himself before the adventurers could attack him. When the adventurers entered New Hearthglen's cathedral to kill Abbendis, Admiral Westwind stood by, protected by a magic shield, and watched them kill her. He commented that Abbendis had \"served her purpose\" and then teleported away. &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Wroth\"&gt;High Executor Wroth&lt;/a&gt; were both concerned by the admiral's escape but decided that he'd have to be dealt with later.\nWestwind retreated to Onslaught Harbor and told his followers there that they would soon defeat the Lich King, then conquer the rest of the world to \"bring order to Azeroth\". He holed himself up in a &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Hollow\"&gt;Hidden Hollow&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the final battle against the Lich King; alongside him were &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Onslaught warlocks&lt;/a&gt; performing &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; rituals. He ordered the rest of the Onslaught to stay away from the cave. Adventurers working with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; discovered Westwind's whereabouts through Onslaught intel and by killing the resurrected Landgren a second time and interrogating his soul. &lt;a href=\"Lord-Commander%20Arete\"&gt;Lord-Commander Arete&lt;/a&gt; gave the adventurers &lt;a href=\"Lord-Commander%27s%20Nullifier\"&gt;a device&lt;/a&gt; to nullify Westwind's magic shield, then sent them to the cave to kill the admiral. During the battle, Mal'Ganis shed his disguise and revealed his true identity, but eventually escaped through a portal to gather his strength on \"&lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;the homeworld&lt;/a&gt;\". Before leaving, he told the adventurers that they'd never defeat the Lich King without his forces, and swore to get revenge on both them and Arthas.\nA &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;past version of Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, in which adventurers must preserve the timeline by helping Arthas defeat the dreadlord.\nLegion.\nMal'Ganis was one of the many demons summoned by in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. He was not seen again for the rest of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the invasion, the heroes of Azeroth killed the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; falling dormant, in turn causing all souls entering the afterlife to flow into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; sent Mal'Ganis to inform another one of his allies, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, of the new situation. The night before Sylvanas , Mal'Ganis entered the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a handsome &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and asked for an audience. Having previously been told by the Jailer to look for a \"child of the blood\", Sylvanas let him into her private quarters. He revealed his identity and told Sylvanas the details of the Jailer's plan: how the dreadlords had corrupted Argus, and of how the Jailer planned to reach the realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and access the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, from which he could remake the cosmos. Mal'Ganis instructed Sylvanas to start unleashing as much death and destruction as she could, since every mortal death would empower the Maw further and bring the Jailer closer to his goal. Sylvanas stated that she'd do what she could to manifest the plan, then brusquely dismissed Mal'Ganis and prompted him to teleport away.\nShadowlands.\nChains of Domination.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought, the nathrezim returned to the Shadowlands and infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of freeing their master, &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, who had been imprisoned in his sword &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;. Mal'Ganis was given the hardest task: infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;'s inner circle and keeping him out of harm, as well as earning the trust of the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s. He was also given the honor of revealing his superior's plan to Renathal when the time was right.\nAfter facing problems with dreadlord incursions, Prince Renathal, a Maw Walker, and their allies traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Keep\"&gt;Dominance Keep&lt;/a&gt; to recruit &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;'s help against the nathrezim, as well as ask for her &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;:Medallion of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; to recreate the venthyr's &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;covenant sigil&lt;/a&gt;. Mal'Ganis' minion &lt;a href=\"Nal%27ragas\"&gt;Nal'ragas&lt;/a&gt; sprung a trap on the meeting to steal the medallion, which she then gave to Mal'Ganis. The other &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; performed a ritual which revealed that Mal'Ganis was hiding in &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt; alongside his fellow dreadlords &lt;a href=\"Diathorus%20the%20Seeker\"&gt;Diathorus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gorgannon\"&gt;Gorgannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Kivretan\"&gt;Kivretan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terravangelous\"&gt;Terravangelous&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker, the Stonewright, Renathal, and their allies defeated him and took back the medallion, after which Renathal tried to convince Mal'Ganis to join them and help save Revendreth. However, the dreadlord revealed that the medallion heist had only been a distraction to keep the venthyr occupied while the rest of the nathrezim captured their true objective: Remornia and Denathrius' essence. He added that neither the medallion, Revendreth, nor Renathal's cause mattered in the face of Denathrius' long-term vision for reality, and that the prince should've obeyed the Sire when he had the chance.\nThe Stonewright took Mal'Ganis into custody in Dominance Keep. She intended to harshly interrogate him, and then hand him over to Renathal for \"whatever atonement he believes a dreadlord capable of\" once she was done. While sneaking into Dominance Keep in disguise in search of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cudgelface\"&gt;Cudgelface&lt;/a&gt; came across Mal'Ganis' cage. The dreadlord tried to bribe the Maw Walker into freeing him by collecting the keys to his cage. Instead, the hero gave the keys to the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; guards and told them about the dreadlord's escape attempt in return for information on where to find Huln. Mal'Ganis was furious at having been tricked and swore revenge on the Maw Walker.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, a message from Mal'Ganis found its way to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the nathrezim revealed that he had escaped through other means and promised to make the Maw Walker pay for refusing to help him.\nEternity's End.\nMal'Ganis and many other nathrezim accompanied the Jailer to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. To enter the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer needed to use the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Kin%27tessa\"&gt;Kin'tessa&lt;/a&gt; led efforts to destroy the Forge's defensive obelisks, Mal'Ganis took advantage of the high trust shown to the Maw Walker by disguising himself as them, sabotaging &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Fauna\"&gt;Provis Fauna&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses and positioning &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; forces where they would be of little help. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; realized that something was amiss and sent the Maw Walker to investigate. They confronted Mal'Ganis alongside &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, but the dreadlord revealed that his efforts had merely been to stall the covenants long enough for Zovaal and his champion, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, to reach the Forge. He then teleported away while the Jailer used the Forge to enter the Sepulcher.\nWhen Maw Walkers entered the Sepulcher to stop Zovaal, Mal'Ganis and Kin'tessa, together called the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Dread\"&gt;Lords of Dread&lt;/a&gt;, tried to stop them to ensure that none were left to interfere with the Jailer's plan. However, the Maw Walkers fought through their magic and illusions and defeated them. It is not known if their deaths are permanent.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nMal'Ganis is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSpeculation.\nIt is unknown why he was not present in Icecrown Citadel. It can be speculated that his plans were ruined by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

However, it has a number of features which set it apart from other DOTA-style games. Experience is shared between all players on a team (so there is no benefit to last-hitting). There are no purchasable items (but characters can be customized by learning talents as they level up). All skills are unlocked at the beginning of a match. Games are intended to last for about 20 minutes each, and each map has unique objectives.\nHeroes.\n89 hero characters that are playable are:\nOne of the game's features is the ability to purchase or earn skins for each hero, with each skin often available in different color schemes alongside the 'traditional' colors. Some skins represent characters from the past, a different timeline, or even a parallel universe such as:\nA model for &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; has been shown been shown at past &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;s but he was never added to the game.

Firstly introduced in ', then as a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;hero unit&lt;/a&gt; in ', the death knight is the first &lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced in the \"\" expansion. Each death knight of the game's original 8 races begins at level 8 (55 prior to \"Shadowlands\") in a &lt;a href=\"Phasing\"&gt;phased&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;d area known as . However, death knights of &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; instead start at level 10 and are sent directly to Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Originally, only one death knight could be created per &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt;, but this restriction was lifted in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3\"&gt;patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt;. The requirement of already having a level 55 character in order to create a death knight was lifted in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.1\"&gt;patch 6.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath knights engage their foes up-close, supplementing swings of their weapons with dark magic that renders enemies vulnerable or damages them with unholy power. They drag foes into one-on-one conflicts, compelling them to focus their attacks away from weaker companions. In order to prevent their enemies from fleeing their grasp, death knights must remain mindful of the power they call forth from runes, and pace their attacks appropriately. In order to protect themselves and their fellows from death in battle, death knights gird themselves in heavy armor and parry attacks with their blades. They have a personal connection with their blades, and can forge runes into them in order to increase their power; these runeblades are empowered with dark magic and they can expend the power of their runes for vicious attacks.\nDeath knight talents can bolster their defensive abilities by focusing on their ability to heal themselves, increase their damage and spell attacks, or summon forth minions and diseases by making use of their runes:\nPrimary death knight attributes are &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. Most important secondary attributes are usually &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt;, though certain specializations and rotations may favor &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nClass overview.\n\"When the Lich King's control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose. Frost sharpens their strikes; blood fortifies their bodies; and undeath allows them to erupt in unholy rage in the heat of battle. A thousand atrocities are etched in the eyes of every death knight, and foes who gaze into them too long will feel the warmth pulled from their bodies, replaced with cold steel.\"\n\"When the Lich King's control over his death knights was broken, his former champions found their new purpose as &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; donned the helm to keep the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; contained, he called forth a new generation of death knights to join the Ebon Blade's cause.\"\nBackground.\nCreations of Gul'dan.\nThese soldiers of darkness were created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to replace the slaughtered &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20clan\"&gt;Warlock clan&lt;/a&gt;s. Assembled from the corpses of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; slain in the last battles of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, these abominations were then instilled with the ethereal essence of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, now serving the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; state of eternal &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Further empowered with magical energies culled from the slain &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, the death knights wielded an arsenal of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; and elemental spells that mete out all but certain death to the enemies of the Horde.\nThe original death knights were created for &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as powerful soldiers of the Horde. These death knights were created by placing the souls of the slain &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; into the corpses of fallen &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, the first of whom was &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike modern death knights of the Scourge, these ghoulish fiends were not battle-hardened warriors: they were insidious necromancers who possessed superior intellect and tremendous magical power. They often favored the use of terror tactics and reanimated the corpses of enemy soldiers who fell in battle to serve them as mindless undead minions.\nMost of these death knights were destroyed during and after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, either killed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or transformed into &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nFallen Knights of the Silver Hand.\n\"Death Knights were once virtuous defenders of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;ity. However, once the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Paladin ranks&lt;/a&gt; were disbanded by the failing &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, many of these &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;holy warriors&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;plague-ridden colonies&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Paladins were immune to disease of any kind, they were persecuted by the general populace who believed that they had been infected by the foul &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. A small band of Paladins, embittered by society's cruelty, traveled north to find the plague's source. These renegade Paladins succumbed to bitter hatred over the course of their grueling quest. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. The weary, vengeful warriors accepted his dark pact, and although they retained their humanity, their twisted souls were bound to his evil will for all time. Bestowed with black, &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;vampiric Runeblades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger\"&gt;shadowy steeds&lt;/a&gt;, Death Knights serve as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s mightiest generals.\"\nYears after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the immensely powerful &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; created a new breed of death knights: malevolent, rune-wielding warriors of the Scourge. The first and greatest of these was the Lich King's chosen champion, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, once a mighty paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, who sacrificed his soul to claim the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in a desperate bid to save his people. The rest were primarily made up of other fallen &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s whose souls were twisted and bound to the will of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Gul'dan's death knights, these dark champions possessed unholy strength, however, they did not possess free will and their minds were inexorably entwined with and dominated by the Lich King's vast consciousness. Despite the heavy costs of free will, some powerful mortals were intrigued by the promise of immortality and pledged their souls freely into the Lich King's service to achieve it.\nIn the years since Arthas shattered the Frozen Throne and merged with the Lich King, the power and fury of the death knights only grew. These unrelenting crusaders of the damned eagerly awaited the Lich King's command to unleash their fury on Azeroth once again.\nThe Death Knights of Acherus.\n\"A hero... that's what you once were. You stood boldly against the Shadow and purchased another dawn for the world... with your life. But the evil you fought is not so easily banished; the victory you claimed, not so easily held. For now, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;specter of death&lt;/a&gt; looms over the world yet again and it has found &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;new champions&lt;/a&gt; to bring about its final reign. Knights of darkness, wielding &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;runes of death and destruction&lt;/a&gt;, bound by the will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. This is the hour of their ascension! This is the hour of your &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;dark rebirth&lt;/a&gt;...\"\nDeath knights are the former champions of the Scourge. They fortify their bodies and drain life energy itself with the power of blood, sharpen their blades and strike powerfully with the power of frost, and raise the dead while striking with the unholy fervor granted by undeath. They are engines of destruction chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to serve the almighty will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe playable death knights are the uniformly undead members of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, a regiment consisting of hundreds of death knights stationed at the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; under the direct command of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. These death knights were set loose upon the , culminating in the flight of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; to Northrend, and the subsequent massacre in which the death knights decimated Scarlet reinforcements. After this, the Death Knights of Acherus were sent to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King, in betrayal of his death knights, was willing to sacrifice them to kill &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. However, when Tirion emerged to defend Light's Hope Chapel, along with the paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, he unleashed his holy fury against the invading armies of undead. The Light overwhelmed the might of the Scourge, immediately killing all the undead forces in the immediate area, while Darion Mograine and his death knights knew defeat.\nThe freed death knights took Acherus from the Scourge and formed the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Highlord Mograine. The Ebon Blade sent many of its freed death knights to their respective factions \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The Knights of the Ebon Blade would later become a major factor in the death of the Lich King &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, joining the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;. They also played a considerable role in defeating the Legion during their invasion several years later, moving &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and accepting the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, the new Lich King, in exchange for his assistance in holding back the Scourge and helping them in their efforts against the Legion.\nDeath knights of formerly Alliance races could potentially make individual cases in order to join the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; death knight proved his loyalty beyond a doubt, he may be allowed to serve under Sylvanas. However, this is considered extremely uncommon, and no known undead worgen character has yet to join the Horde in the lore.\nRaces.\nAll races released can be death knights, and start with the following attributes:\nRacial abilities.\nThese are some of the &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s relevant to death knights:\nOverview.\nDeath knights in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" are a new &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; mirroring their previous incarnations. While boasting powerful melee abilities, as well as plate armor, these warriors supplement their strength with dark magic. Calling upon a &lt;a href=\"rune%20system\"&gt;rune system&lt;/a&gt; of magic, the death knight may summon unholy, blood, and frost spells.\nUnlocking your death knight.\nThe death knight is the first &lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\". The death knight will start at level 8 in over the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple spells and abilities ready to use, and a set of gear. &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;Allied race&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; death knights start at level 10 in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; instead. When you leave Ebon Hold, you will have a full set of gear ready for Outland or Northrend. Through the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20quests\"&gt;death knight-specific quests&lt;/a&gt; in this necropolis and the surrounding areas, the character learns to master the power of the death knight and learns to use this new power for the will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Quests will take them outside the necropolis and into an area within the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"hero class\" is commonly misunderstood to mean that the class is more powerful than other classes. The term instead signifies a unique playstyle and experience, as well as denoting a class of heroes which start at an already \"heroic\" or \"veteran\" level, with an experience and gear to match.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3.0\"&gt;patch 5.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, players are no longer restricted to creating a single death knight per realm. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%206.1.0\"&gt;patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, the requirement to have an existing character at level 55 or higher before creating a death knight has also been lifted. All races introduced prior to \"\" can be death knights.\nThe rune system.\nThe death knights use a unique &lt;a href=\"Rune%20system\"&gt;rune-based resource system&lt;/a&gt; as a resource to govern their spells and &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;. Using certain abilities exhausts one or more runes, starting a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; of 10 seconds. Only two runes can recharge at once, regardless of how many have been used. In addition, whenever the death knight uses a rune ability, it builds up a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"Runic%20Power\"&gt;Runic Power&lt;/a&gt; (usually 10 Runic Power per Rune spent). All abilities that use Runic Power use a set amount (for example, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil%20%28Death%20Knight%29\"&gt;Death Coil&lt;/a&gt; always uses 35).\n&lt;a href=\"%23Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; death knights primarily focus on building enough runic power to consistently self-heal through attacks. &lt;a href=\"%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; death knights deal large amounts of damage through powerful strikes and use of runic power. &lt;a href=\"%23Unholy\"&gt;Unholy&lt;/a&gt; death knights focus more on rune regeneration, fast-paced attacks, and the aid of undead minions.\nThe original player frame for death knights shown at BlizzCon was changed as feedback showed it was not ideal for displaying rune power for players.\n&lt;a href=\"Runeforging\"&gt;Runeforging&lt;/a&gt; is a profession available only to death knights, providing permanent weapon enchants. The enchants work just like the permanent weapon enchants provided by &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, but are self-only and are designed specifically to benefit the death knight class. These are independent of the rune resource system.\nCharacter's role.\nIn general, the death knight can be considered a hybrid melee class that combines damage dealing and tanking, somewhat akin to Warriors. They wear plate armor and are able to dual-wield or use two-handed weapons. Like druids, they tank without shields. Their tanking mechanics involve high armor and a high chance to dodge and parry. Death knight tanks depend on a combination of high damage abilities, in addition to high threat abilities, such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Strike\"&gt;Rune Strike&lt;/a&gt;, to generate and hold &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecializations.\nBlood.\n A dark guardian who manipulates and corrupts life energy to sustain &lt;him/her&gt;self in the face of an enemy onslaught.\nBlood is the death knight tanking spec, primarily amplifying the death knight's melee spells, weapons, and abilities. Blood's primary abilities are &lt;a href=\"Marrowrend\"&gt;Marrowrend&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a stacking buff that reduces damage taken, and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt;, which provides self-healing and a temporary damage absorption shield. While having less damage mitigation than other tanking classes, Blood has a prominent health-regeneration theme, allowing them to solo many encounters that would otherwise require a healer.\nAt level 10 or above, Blood death knights can wield &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; after completing the appropriate quest.\n\"In undeath, some death knights find a special affinity for the blood and bone of the living. They carve into their enemies, sustaining themselves with deadly sanguine strikes, while using the bloody, shattered remains of the dead to fortify their own defenses. These crimson-soaked knights bend the very rules of mortality to control the frontlines of the battlefield.\"\nFrost.\n An icy harbinger of doom, channeling runic power and delivering vicious weapon strikes.\nFrost has many control elements, with a strong critical-strike/bonus-damage theme, and enhances the dual-weapon and two-weapon DPS abilities. It provides some very powerful direct damage abilities like &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Strike\"&gt;Frost Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Obliterate\"&gt;Obliterate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Blast\"&gt;Howling Blast&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt level 10 or above, Frost death knights can wield the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Frostreaper\"&gt;Frostreaper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icebringer\"&gt;Icebringer&lt;/a&gt; - after completing the appropriate quest.\n\"Combining martial prowess with supernatural cold, frost death knights leave their enemies chilled to the bone\u2014and broken of the will to fight. Unlike mages who learn to harness frost magic to great effect, these death knights are born of it, rime gripping their decaying hearts. These frozen undead warriors wield dual blades to strike with ferocity and inflict deathly cold upon anyone who would stand against them.\"\nUnholy.\n A master of death and decay, spreading infection and controlling undead minions to do &lt;his/her&gt; bidding.\nUnholy has a heavy focus on diseases and related abilities, with AoE, spell damage shielding, and mobility-improvement sub-themes. It enhances the death knight's diseases and damage over time spells, as well as improving summoned minions. It also provides the death knight with a &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Ally\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, who is a permanent &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; guardian he or she can &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt level 10 or above, Unholy death knights can wield &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; after completing the appropriate quest.\n\"While free from the Lich King's grasp, some death knights still embody the ever-corrupting nature of the Scourge plague that once threatened to consume Azeroth. No matter their allegiance or cause, they remain defilers of life; and nowhere is their callousness more on display than when threatened. Inflictors of the most aggressive of diseases\u2014and masters of raising unhallowed minions from the ground\u2014these unholy death knights are vicious melee combatants, capable of striking with the force of an undead legion and unleashing pestilence that would bring their foes to ruin.\"\nGear.\nDeath knights can wear any type of armor (though they specialize in &lt;a href=\"Plate%20armor\"&gt;Plate&lt;/a&gt;) from the moment of creation and begin with a full set of Uncommon-quality plate armor. They can wield any type of sword, mace, axe, or polearm and can &lt;a href=\"dual-wield\"&gt;dual-wield&lt;/a&gt; one-handed swords, maces, or axes. Death knights have their own, unique enchantments acquired by &lt;a href=\"Runeforging\"&gt;Runeforging&lt;/a&gt;, and also have three unique mounts: the &lt;a href=\"Acherus%20Deathcharger\"&gt;Acherus Deathcharger&lt;/a&gt;, the purchasable &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Steed%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and the quest reward &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%27s%20Vilebrood%20Vanquisher\"&gt;Deathlord's Vilebrood Vanquisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath knights rely on enchanted rune weapons to use their abilities and are powerful foes on the battlefield. Like &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, they deal large amounts of physical damage and are capable of withstanding large amounts of damage to protect their allies. Death knights spread infections and diseases among their enemies, and use dark magics to heal themselves in battle. Born of the frozen north, death knights can command the frost in their veins to freeze the hearts and minds of their enemies, or even turn the ground beneath their feet to ice. They also have a number of abilities for defending against magic.\nRuneforging.\n&lt;a href=\"Runeforging\"&gt;Runeforging&lt;/a&gt; allows the death knight to permanently enchant their weapon. These enchants act as a replacement for the stat enhancements provided by shields or ranged weapons, which death knights cannot wear. \nA weapon can have an enchant from either runeforging or from &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, but not both together (the runeforging enchants are usually considered better). A player will have to be near a &lt;a href=\"Runeforge\"&gt;Runeforge&lt;/a&gt; in order to forge a rune onto their weapon. Once a weapon has been engraved with a rune, it is impossible for the rune to be removed, though it can be exchanged for a different rune. Like all weapons that have been modified, a runeforged weapon becomes soulbound to its death knight.\nIn the RPG.\nDeath knights are afflicted by what is called the \"Alabaster Skin\": as they progress in power, the death knight's skin hardens and grows pale, resembling marble or alabaster. Their hair also develops streaks of white, and some death knights' hair goes completely white as they progress in power.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

These orders share a few things in common, including riding undead horses and manipulating &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; energies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; were powerful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; necromancers created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to replace the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The first and most prominent of these death knights was &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new order of death knights emerged during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, in service to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. They were created from living and undead &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s (and occasionally other races) who had been granted unholy &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;runeblades&lt;/a&gt;, and most were former &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who had forsaken the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; class was the first &lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt; to be introduced. They represented a new breed of undead warriors, fallen heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raised against their will and bound in service to the Lich King.\nOf the Horde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s composed the magic users of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. However, when &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; seized power for himself, the warlocks of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; were branded as traitors to the Horde and executed en masse, leaving the Horde without its leading practitioners of demonic magic. Only &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and a few others survived by pledging allegiance to the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking to please Doomhammer, Gul'dan promised him an army of undead warriors loyal only to him. After experimenting at length with the souls of the recently slain council members, Gul'dan successfully instilled the spirit of the warlock &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; into the corpse of a fallen knight. Gul'dan then summoned his necrolyte followers to a conjunction spell and sacrificed them while they were channeling. This sacrifice allowed him to imbue the spirits of the other members of the Shadow Council into the corpses of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the death knights were born. Each death knight was given a jeweled truncheon into which the powers of the slain necrolytes was imbued. Doomhammer was pleased with Gul'dan's creations, however, he overlooked the fact that the spirits of the Shadow Council warlocks remained loyal to Gul'dan.\nThe dreaded undead spellcasters were distributed among the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;Horde clans&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them crossed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, joining the forces of the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;. Some, such as &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;Gaz Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;, were assigned special duties during the conflicts. When not fighting, the death knights dwelled in the fetid halls of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Temples of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to study their &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; on fallen warriors reaped from the battlefields above. The death knights were known to have &lt;a href=\"Unyielding\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt; the Alliance soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Armory\"&gt;Expedition Armory&lt;/a&gt;. Death knights generally played a crucial role during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, being responsible for reopening and maintaining the Dark Portal, while also sending dreams and visions to the scattered Horde remnants on Azeroth to rally them to the cause of the new &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Alliance victory, most of the death knights were destroyed, though some of them were rallied by Teron Gorefiend, who offered his allegiance to Ner'zhul in exchange of a world for the death knights alone to conquer. During the destruction of Draenor, many death knights ventured alongside Ner'zhul into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, where along with Ner'zhul's other prominent spell casters they were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, transformed by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es and reappointed into the service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in order to better assist him with his new task.\nLegacy.\nWhile a new, distinct order of death knights has arisen in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, no death knights of the original order are known to have survived. Any in Azeroth would likely have been destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It is rumored that a jewel that had been part of a truncheon carried by one of these death knights was used to create &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot all Draenor death knights were taken with &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, however, as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Ghostrider%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Ghostriders of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. The most famous of these survivors was Teron Gorefiend. In a quest chain beginning with &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend%2C%20I%20am...\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend, I am...&lt;/a&gt;, he deceived players with a fabricated account of history that tricked them into assisting him, and this deception ultimately resulted in his release from eternal imprisonment. He subsequently appeared as a raid boss in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Another stranded death knight was &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was believed by some that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; were surviving death knights of this generation. However, it was later shown that they were in fact merchants who had tried to sell fake artifacts to a &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, and so he cursed them in turn to forever track down artifacts as specters and bring them back to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIronically, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had witnessed the death knights of the Old Horde during their raid on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and became even more interested in necromancy after seeing what its power was capable of.\nOf the Scourge.\nWhen Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; gave himself over to &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he became the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s first death knight, sworn to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and invested with dark powers to carry out its will.\nOther once-noble &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s would follow in Arthas' steps. During the fall of Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; were disbanded. Some of these holy warriors traveled to the quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;plague-ridden colonies&lt;/a&gt;. Though the paladins were immune to disease of any kind, they were persecuted by the general populace who believed that they had been infected by the foul &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. Embittered by this rejection, a few traveled north to find the plague's source.\nMuch as Arthas had before them, these renegade paladins succumbed to bitter hatred over the course of their grueling quest. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. The weary, vengeful warriors accepted his dark pact, and although they retained their humanity, their twisted souls were bound to his evil will for all time. Bestowed with black &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;runeblades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger\"&gt;shadowy steeds&lt;/a&gt;, they became the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s mightiest generals.\nDespite the heavy costs of free will, some other mortals were intrigued by the promise of immortality. Rich landowners like &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Alexei%20Barov\"&gt;Lord Alexei Barov&lt;/a&gt; pledged their souls to achieve it. There are also examples of death knights created during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; who did not give themselves willingly. &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt; were killed and raised as death knights against their will by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Captain Falric&lt;/a&gt; shortly after this. As all three precede the &lt;a href=\"Arthas%27%20Betrayal\"&gt;destruction of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they would have been created before the aforementioned paladins. &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; was also killed and raised by Thassarian in the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;destruction of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; during the Third War.\nAfter the end of the war, several death knights still served as superior officers of the undead army. &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; lorded over the forces of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; was now a tutor at the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen paladin &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Zeliek\"&gt;Sir Zeliek&lt;/a&gt; was unique in the fact that, while his body was forced to obey the Scourge's commands, he had managed to retain his sanity and morals despite his corruption.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; appeared over the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that within its walls dwelt a mighty &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29%23Deathknight%20Wing\"&gt;army of death knights&lt;/a&gt;, with many new human recruits and converts training to become dark weapons of the Scourge.\nLegacy.\nThe forces of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; were eventually defeated by a joint effort from the mortals of Azeroth.\nAfter waking up from his slumber, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;new order&lt;/a&gt; of death knights, which were raised from the corpses of fallen heroes and powerful warriors of the Horde and Alliance instead of being willing &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s tempted by a dark power. These new death knights had their souls enslaved upon reanimation and bound in service to the Lich King.\nThe forces of the Ebon Blade eventually rebelled after the failed &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. When the Alliance and Horde launched a retaliatory campaign against the Scourge in Northrend, they discovered that the Lich King had started creating even more orders of death knights, notably in the reestablished Military Quarter of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and at . In both cases, these orders were more similar to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; than the mounted generals of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Suffering\"&gt;Host of Suffering&lt;/a&gt;, notably, had the same training organization as the knights of .\nAs powerful and valuable agents of the Scourge, death knights are not freed from service to the Lich King should they die again. They are often simply raised once more to continue their work, sometimes even by a &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. As an example, the members of the original &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; were raised back into service once to be led by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, a man who himself had his head removed some times earlier, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Knight\"&gt;the Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; had to be killed no less than four times by &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs.\nIn the RPG.\nEven the most honorable warriors can fall prey to the plots of the Lich King. Some, usually the ones the Scourge had the most trouble defeating, become the horrors known as death knights \u2014 elite members of the Scourge who lead the Lich King's armies. Neither their personalities nor their skills are lost entirely, but their souls belong to the Lich King. All good creatures fear their mighty &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;rune weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost death knights are fallen paladins, having fought in battle against the Scourge and proven themselves worthy. Any member of the Scourge powerful enough to defeat a particularly strong paladin knows whether or not that paladin would make a fine death knight.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;, the death knight is a &lt;a href=\"prestige%20class\"&gt;prestige class&lt;/a&gt;, an advanced class with certain requirements for entry. It is comparable to the \"Blackguard\", a prestige class in \"\". The would-be death knight &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; must vow to serve the Scourge and must receive a &lt;a href=\"vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;vampiric runeblade&lt;/a&gt; from the Lich King.\nKnights of the Ebon Blade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; are an &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; of renegade death knights. Once members of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, they were freed from the grasp of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, then regrouped under the banner of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, took control of as their headquarters, and cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter getting their vengeance, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose. They dedicated themselves to the protection of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and some of their members rejoined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, of which they were members before their death against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir powers are a combination from those of both previous death knight organizations, and unlike their predecessors, they are racially diverse and are not bound to a single &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt;."}

When originally released, only one death knight could be made per server, and only if the player already had a level 55 or higher character on that server; the latter restriction was mostly lifted in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, while the former was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3.0\"&gt;patch 5.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the restriction of having a level 55 on your account was removed. Since then, death knights can now be made on any server, no matter what level character you have on your account.\nRaces.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; did not discriminate when raising those who fell against him, almost any race can be a death knight.\nThe \"\" races, &lt;a href=\"worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, are also allowed to become death knights. Worgen death knights were former followers of &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, whereas goblin death knights originated with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of their seclusion from the outside world, the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; were the only playable race that could not be playable death knights. However, pandaren death knights could still theoretically exist, but would be very rare. The only known example of a pandaren death knight was &lt;a href=\"Gravewalker%20Gie\"&gt;Gravewalker Gie&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the lead up to \"\", allied races also could not be playable death knights.\nWith the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; as the Lich King, and in the events leading up to \"Shadowlands\", all races including pandaren and &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s can be playable death knights, except for the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. These death knights have a different starting experience from those death knights raised by Arthas.\nAlliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenei are likely the most religious, orthodox and faithful race that currently reside on Azeroth. As such, death knights are considered disgusting, abominable and unholy by most draenei. A death knight of this race may have to look elsewhere for home, as toying with &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; is reviled by draenei. However, draenei make some of the most vicious and deadly death knights. With the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, the one thing that draenei all share, they may develop a disregard for geniality or mercy. A caring but strong race with all mercy removed creates a deadly and intimidating presence on any battlefield, and draenei death knights are a force to be reckoned with.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe views of dwarven death knights may be different depending on their clan. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; regard the undead similarly to humans, as they are also followers of the Holy Light. &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have a deep connection to the earth and therefore it would be a struggle for a death knight of this race to live amongst former brethren. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; would likely be the most accepting, as their culture revolves around sorcery and using what they have to fight, and death knights may feel more welcome in this society. Much like humans, the Lich King valued dwarves for their stoic nature and high body strength. \n&lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not considered a race of raw strength or might, becoming a death knight for a gnome may be just another adventure or experiment much like blowing up a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; encampment. The gaining of unholy strength also augments the strength of gnomes, allowing them to be lethal and still incredibly agile. This added strength, the gnome archetypal insanity and a wanton disregard for safety make the gnome death knight just as deadly as any other race. Do not underestimate them.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the human death knights were holy crusaders or veteran soldiers of human kingdoms that fell in battle in their war to end the profanity of the Scourge. The Lich King raised these fallen champions in undeath as death knights to serve him. Humans are one of the most adaptable races, being proficient in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and combat. Human society has a foundation in the Holy Light, and having that taken away could be problematic. Nevertheless, humanity has a history of sympathy when it comes to extreme circumstances and as such would be willing to accept death knights into their ranks as they would any other profession. However, one must remember the revilement and hate some highly orthodox followers of the light may have against death knights, as the hatred for &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; runs deep in human society.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;paladin ranks&lt;/a&gt; were disbanded during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; by the failing &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, many of these human &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;holy warriors&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;plague-ridden colonies&lt;/a&gt;. Though the paladins were immune to disease of any kind, they were persecuted by the general populace who believed that they had been infected by the foul &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. A small band of paladins, embittered by society's cruelty, traveled north to find the plague's source. These renegade paladins succumbed to bitter hatred over the course of their grueling quest. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. The weary, vengeful warriors accepted his dark pact, and although they retained their humanity, their twisted souls were bound to his evil will for all time. Bestowed with black, &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;vampiric Runeblades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger\"&gt;shadowy steeds&lt;/a&gt;, death knights serve as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s mightiest generals.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to a connection to the natural world, it may be hard for a night elf death knight to wander near their brethren without challenge or dismay. Nevertheless, night elf death knights are agile, unfaltering and beautiful to behold. Their severance from the natural world may drive night elves to become more bloodthirsty when turned to undeath, easily striking fear into the bravest of warriors. Grace combined with unholy magic makes night elves one of the most unpredictable and persistent races to fall to undeath. \n&lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nA bloodthirsty, savage, intelligent and lethal race, the worgen who were raised from &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;'s dead are an intimidating presence to behold. With the strength of wolves combined with unholy and frost magic, worgen are augmented beyond what some mortals could hope to achieve. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; worgen, those who were raised from Arugal's batch are likely to be more bloodthirsty and potentially reckless. As such, they are a danger to behold on the battlefield and in a frenzy, even allies may want to keep their distance.\nHorde.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith everything the blood elves have suffered through in the past, it was inevitable that the grimmest of the death knights would come from their ranks. Their nature and the grim mark that the Scourge left upon their lands instantly make them a target of spite from their own kin, and the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from even the rejuvenated Sunwell has turned many into little more than hollow shells. Turning away from everything they once held dear and fought for in life, many seek only the companionship of their fellow &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of what race they herald from.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHailing from the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, goblin death knights are just as likely to go their own way as they are to join the Horde with the other death knights for safety in numbers. As with gnomes, their short stature makes them an odd choice, but with even less regard for safety and caution than gnomes, backed by unholy strength they are a force of destruction to be reckoned with. Though likely dismayed or even disgusted by what happened to them, many goblins may come to consider the state something of a boon, with their new powers opening new avenues for gathering all kinds of wealth.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the orcs came the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;first death knights&lt;/a&gt;. These soldiers of darkness were originally created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to replace the slaughtered &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20clan\"&gt;Warlock clan&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Assembled from the corpses of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; slain in the last battles of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, these abominations were then instilled with the ethereal essence of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, and further empowered with magical energies culled from the slain &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThough the powers associated with these knights of death has changed over time, the orcs have not forgotten that black mark on their history. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; is making use of orcish death knights once again by forcibly raising fallen orcs into death knights of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. As with warlocks, they are tolerated but never truly accepted into orcish society, and watched with wary gazes by all they pass. The orc death knights themselves, however, have not lost all traces of what they once were, and many seek the honorable death stolen from them by the Lich King. They remain loyal to their people and to the Horde against all odds and seek to aid both with the dark powers seeping through their undead bodies.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch like the night elves, a tauren death knight may find it difficult to return to their living kin due to their condition's separation from the natural world. Though there are some who would accept them in their new condition, many, especially in the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; circles, revile them. Even so, tauren death knights have displayed the ability to remain compassionate and caring for the living in spite of their condition, though many more fall to the darkness in their dead souls and the violence that comes with it. Because of their powerful stature, they are among the strongest of the death knights.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; has a deep reverence for their dead, and &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Samedi\"&gt;Samedi&lt;/a&gt;) is known to have a deep hatred for the undead he sees as abominable. Because of this, troll death knights are likely to find no comfort with their old kin, and may be driven deeper into the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; or even to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in the search for some kind of companionship. The troll death knights themselves may agree with their living kin, or they may see their return to the world in undeath as a sign of some greater mission bestowed to them by their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; gods.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo strangers to undeath, those &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; turned into death knights may exhibit no changes in attitude and personality; they were damned before, they are damned still. Alternatively, a second brush with death and raising from it may have killed off whatever remained of the humanity within the Forsaken individual and they may be even more reclusive and emotionally dead than the typical member of their race. As a whole, the Forsaken tend to be more accepting, though not sympathetic, towards their brothers in death, and this may extend to even those death knights of other races.\nOther death knight races.\nPandaren death knights.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, pandaren death knight sightings have been rising. Before then, there was at least one &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; death knight, &lt;a href=\"Gravewalker%20Gie\"&gt;Gravewalker Gie&lt;/a&gt;. She was likely a wandering explorer who got caught up in the war in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nVrykul death knights.\nThe Lich King also raised &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Baelok\"&gt;Baelok&lt;/a&gt;."}

With this in mind, the three trainers are found in their own quarter of the Hold. Lady Alistra is teaching initiates about necromancy in the east wing, Amal'thazad is lecturing initiates in the west wing, and Lord Thorval is giving a lesson in the north wing. The color palettes of each area are strong hints at what school is taught there (For example, Lord Thorval's area has a tint of red for Blood). \nAfter the completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20of%20Dawn%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Light of Dawn (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and before the completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Ebon%20Hold\"&gt;The Battle For The Ebon Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the trainers are unavailable, as the whole citadel is fighting the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.

When they found the death revenant, they had to kill it in order to clean the forest and stop the endless spawn of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"corrupted%20treant\"&gt;corrupted treant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nDeath revenants are the rarest of all the types of &lt;a href=\"revenant\"&gt;revenant&lt;/a&gt;s and most mysterious. The creature is seemingly humanoid, but rides on a ball of green-colored energy rather than walking on two feet. A death revenant wears flowing black robes under scale mail armor and carries a heavy mace and large metal shield emblazoned with a single green-colored image of an eyeball. Etched into the shield, radiating from the eye out to the shield's edges, are yellow beams. The eye sockets of the creature's metallic helm shine with a menacing green light. Only its arms are readily visible, and appear to be made of black dirt and rocks held together by green energy. Their vaguely humanoid appearance is almost an illusion created by the armor, and Death Revenants appear to also wearing flowing black robes. Beneath, a death revenant is dark earth held together by elemental energy. The face of death brutalized and decaying, no doubt a result of their preference for the dead and predilection to roam graveyards. They are eerie creatures, with echoing voices and strange, riddling replies to any questions posed to them. Although they do not prefer to fight, death revenants have their own ideas about when \"too far\" has been reached, and they are more than willing to visit the truth of the after life on any who bother them without good cause.\nSince death revenants prefer to roam graveyards, it's common for them to have already exhumed a number of corpses, if for no other reason than to gaze upon the dead. Death revenants posses necromantic skills, and when threatened, death revenants use them to raise undead to fight for them. Death revenants can create spawn from slain corpses and the elements from the ground beneath it. They try to focus their attacks on the weakest foes; the ones most likely to not survive melee. Death revenants fight to the end.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eldritch%20Deathlord\"&gt;Eldritch Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; in \"Warcraft III\" could be death revenants retroactively."}

The player and the Aldor led by &lt;a href=\"Ishanah\"&gt;Ishanah&lt;/a&gt; seek to end the life of Socrethar and deal a Deathblow to the Legion.\nObjectives.\nHigh Priestess Ishanah wants you to go to the Legion Teleporter at the northwestern corner of &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and use it to teleport to &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%27s%20Seat\"&gt;Socrethar's Seat&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, defeat &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerforming quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.\nDescription.\nWhen facing &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; of great power, large armies are useless for the most part. Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.\nTake this stone to the , between and and bring your closest, strongest friends with you. Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them.\nMay the Light prevail today, &lt;name&gt;. May Socrethar meet his end.\nRewards.\nYou will also receive:\nProgress.\nLight be with you, &lt;class&gt;.\nCompletion.\nIt is done, &lt;name&gt;. Socrethar has been destroyed.\nI and the others will recover from our wounds, &lt;name&gt;. The wrath of Socrethar's magic was far too much for young Kaylaan, however. Not even my strongest prayer could raise him.\nIt is an unbearable pity that one so young would fall in battle. However, in the end his will was strong enough to recover from the Legion's corruption and we may find solace in that.\nNotes.\nBring Kaylaan down to 50%.\nGetting there.\nDeathblow to the Legion is a quest for those who chose to ally with the Aldor in Shattrath City, the long questchain starts with &lt;a href=\"Assist%20Exarch%20Orelis\"&gt;Assist Exarch Orelis&lt;/a&gt;. The quest, simply put, involves killing a demon named Socrethar (mentioned in a prerequisite quest). Socrethar himself is located on a floating island off the northwest corner (36,18) of Netherstorm. To reach him, you can use two methods:\nFind a Scryer buddy.\nThose allied with the Scryers have an equivalent to Deathblow to the Legion called &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt;. When a Scryer receives the quest, their quest giver gives them an item called Voren'thal's Presence. When used against Socrethar, this item gives him a debuff that increases all damage done against him by 300% and decreases all damage that he deals by 75%. Combined with the use of an Aldor's adds, the fight is incredibly easy.\nEncounter.\nSocrethar has fear, knockback, shadow volley, and spell reflect shield. He is easily kiteable and affected by CC (like banish &amp; cyclone). Therefore clear possible adds.\nThe whole fight itself is a complete tank and spank. With the adds and the debuff, the tanking part is optional. With a half-decent healer and Socrethar's damage nerfed, any cloth wearer should be able to take the hits with ease. Chances are you won't be facing the encounter without at least the adds or the debuff, so there shouldn't be much to worry about.\nNote that Socrethar is extremely weak to all forms of frost, so if your party is without Scryer assistance, a frost mage may make up for this. An average level 70 frost-spec mage should be able to crit for over 10,000.\nBug and workaround.\nThe encounter was once known to bug for a very long time, making Socrethar merely stand there and not aggro or be able to be attacked. This was possibly due to a wipe while using the adds, freezing the event in place. Since a recent patch, this bug has been known to happen less frequently.\nIf the encounter bugs, here is how to fix it:\nJune 24, 2007: Quest did bug multiple times, ultimately leaving three NPCs standing before Socrethar and not doing anything. When discussed with a GM, they believed the cause was a mixed group of Aldors and Scryers, and strongly advised us to try again with an Aldor-only group. We were told that the group could be any size, and that non-group help could be received from Scryers without bugging the quest yet again. Likely the GM was mistaken as to the cause. It is more likely that the NPCs get their aggro table confused due to an add.\nIf another group is killing him (even if opposite faction) there is a 50% chance your quest will complete if you are close enough."}

It's mainly a &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; with an interesting twist (Blood Power).\nAfter falling to &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was raised in undeath by the Lich King and brought to Icecrown Citadel. Imbued with the power of the Scourge, the Deathbringer bars the way of any attackers trying to enter the &lt;a href=\"Spire\"&gt;Upper Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nReset.\nThis fight can be reset by running back on the gunship while it's still there - it despawns after some time.\nStrategy.\nThe fight has only one phase. Saurfang does hard &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; after 8 minutes. At 30% there's a soft enrage (Frenzy), &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; are normally saved for that point (although some raids have success using them early, and thus delaying the first Mark as long as possible).\nBlood Power.\nSaurfang starts with 0 Blood Power. He can accumulate up to 100 in his Energy bar (akin to death knights). He gains Blood Power whenever one of his special attacks hits or ticks. When Blood Power reaches 100, he casts Mark of the Fallen Champion on a random raid member, resetting his Blood Power to 0.\nEach active Mark increases the rate at which he gains Blood Power. For this reason, it's imperative to limit the amount of Blood Power he gains. Saurfang should be at 60% or lower before he casts the first Mark.\nTanking.\nSaurfang should be tanked right where he spawns, his melee damage is not high. Tanks must pay attention though that Saurfang doesn't gain Blood Power from . If a tank gets it, another tank must quickly taunt and take over. The debuff lasts 20 seconds.\nPositioning.\nThe melee should stand right on Saurfang. Ranged damage dealers can stand closer to the boss, while healers should be furthest away. Healers need to be well spread out, so that all raid members are in range of several healers.\nAll non-melee raid members must stay at least 12 yards away from each other to avoid activating , else Saurfang receives extra Blood Power.\nBlood Beasts.\nSaurfang summons Blood Beasts every 35 seconds. In:\nSaurfang gains Blood Power whenever a Blood Beast deals melee damage, thus they must be slowed and kited, and killed by ranged DPS. Since Blood Beasts are resistant to AoE it's pointless to use such abilities. Melee in particular should avoid using any multi-target abilities (such as &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Strike\"&gt;Heart Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Command\"&gt;Seal of Command&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Revenge\"&gt;Improved Revenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Storm\"&gt;Divine Storm&lt;/a&gt;) in order to avoid drawing aggro. The Blood Beasts must leave the platform ASAP (in hard mode they're also likely to one-shot melee).\nBlood Beasts are immune to crowd-control. They are susceptible to root, snare, slow and stun. Be careful not to root them within melee range of anybody. Classes with a root, snare, or stun ability should use this macro whenever the Blood Beasts spawn:\n #showtooltip\n /tar Blood\n /cast (Name of ability)\n /tar Death\nThis immediately uses the ability on the closest Blood Beast and then targets Saurfang.\nThe Beasts normally aggro healers after some time, therefore healers should stand away from the boss. Alternately, healers can stand on the platform among the melee. Initially the Beasts can be pulled away by the DPS pretty easily, later on they move back towards the platform when they aggro a healer. At this point, it helps a lot if the healer can temporarily reduce aggro, such as a priest using &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanged DPS should target the beast furthest away, and as soon as the beast gains aggro, switch away to another one. Ping-ponged between different ranged DPS prevents anyone from being hit in melee. Melee players (or the tank) can help by taunting Beasts that are far away from them. If a Beast gets close to its target, that target must run away and start kiting \u2014 do not let them hit anyone.\nIf the raid is too melee-heavy, it is possible to stunlock one Beast and kill it with melee, while the other beasts are kited by ranged.\nClass-specific tactics.\nThese abilities are particularly helpful for slowing down Blood Beasts:\nBoiling Blood.\nSaurfang casts on random raid members. This can easily be healed through. Every tick grants Blood Power. &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt; removes it, though that should only be needed in Hard Mode on a player afflicted with .\nMark of the Fallen Champion.\nWhenever Saurfang gains 100 Blood Power, he casts on a random raid member. This debuff inflicts heavy damage (about 6,000 per second in 25 player) and yields a lot of Blood Power to the boss. When a player with a Mark dies, this heals Saurfang about 5%. The Mark persists through death\u2014\"do not combat rez a player that dies from it\".\nA good healer can handle about two active Marks if focusing exclusively on the Mark targets. Two active Marks in 10 player usually lead to a wipe, in 25 players the limit is about 8 Marks.\nIt may be a viable tactic to let the Mark of the Fallen Champion victims die. It's much easier to deal an extra 5% damage to Saurfang than to heal the Mark victim and deal with the increased frequency of future Marks. There are diminishing returns however, as living DPS are required to take down the Blood Beasts.\nHeroic Mode.\nThe primary differences of Heroic mode are a shorter enrage timer (6 minutes), Blood Beasts catching 5 seconds after spawning, reducing the movement speed of the entire raid by 80% for 10 seconds, and Saurfang healing for 20% HP upon a mark of the fallen champion death. His blood power gain is also much faster compared to normal. Blood Beasts also hit hard enough to one shot any non tank.\nOn a first kill, prepare for at least two marks on 10-man and six marks on 25-man. Assign one dedicated healer per mark. If healers are struggling towards the end of the fight, they can stop healing one of the tanks because of the mechanics of .\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Its members are simply called deathguards. They are mostly deployed to the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the comments from the Deathguards in Tirisfal Glades on &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, they don't hold them in high regards.\nHistory.\nIn Year 24, they had to shut down the kids' summer camp because of psychos wearing masks near &lt;a href=\"Brightwater%20Lake\"&gt;Brightwater Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Deathguard likes to use the cellar of the &lt;a href=\"Gallows%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;Gallows End Tavern&lt;/a&gt; as a holding cell until prisoners can be \"properly\" dealt with. They were concerned about the growing army of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also assisted in the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. They also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can be chosen as guards of &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, some of them could spawn at the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; to help their allies defend against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They also accompanied &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of Deathguards participated in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, notably in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nathanos\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt; also dispatched them to clean up the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; stragglers in &lt;a href=\"Go%27Shek%20Farm\"&gt;Go'Shek Farm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Deathguards returned to the rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and defended it against the blighted undead.\nIn the RPG.\nCapable of enduring vastly harsher conditions than living troops, the tireless Deathguard can march for days, even weeks. The Forsaken can disguise themselves as dead or dying soldiers in the colors of intruding forces. Sometimes the Deathguard will dig ambushes, lying still under the earth to erupt forth upon the proper signal.\nEquipment and weaponry.\nThe Deathguard protecting &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; wear light &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt; and are generally seen using only &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, but when deployed in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; they can be seen using shields and heavier &lt;a href=\"plate%20armor\"&gt;plate armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of them prefer \"traditional\" medicines like leeches, maggots or bonesaws instead of herbalism cures. They speak fondly of engineering weapons and leather armor (referring to it as \"something dead rubbing up against you\".). They also don't like taxidermists who think they can stuff and mount them because they think they're dead. Black, grey and dark purple are their prescribed colors."}

One of the greatest struggles for the citizens of Deathknell is obtaining the natural resources they need to survive, particularly gold. The &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest has been overrun by spiders, and the people of Deathknell frequently attempt to clear it out, so that they may begin mining its precious metals. In the meantime, they do what they must to survive in the face of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore-wise, Deathknell is unique among Forsaken sites due to its name. While other communities inhabited by the rebel undead of the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Banshee Queen&lt;/a&gt; retained their names from their days as centers of human civilization, Deathknell was obviously renamed to its current appellation for reasons unknown. The valley itself is guarded by a number of &lt;a href=\"Deathguard%20Elite\"&gt;Deathguard Elite&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnemies of Deathknell.\nScourge.\nThe primary threat to the town of Deathknell is the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, or as the citizens of Deathknell refer to them, the \"Mindless Ones\". The northern part of the village and its &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; forge has been overrun by Scourge, and the Forsaken have entrenched themselves near the &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; as best they can; frequently sending out assault parties to drive the Scourge back and search for equipment in the abandoned town.\nRotbrain undead.\nUndead raised in Deathknell refusing to join the Forsaken. They hate what they've become, so they venture away from town. They weren't a true threat until &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Redpath\"&gt;Marcus Redpath&lt;/a&gt; was raised. He brought the undead together at the &lt;a href=\"Rotbrain%20Encampment\"&gt;Rotbrain Encampment&lt;/a&gt; and are planning an attack on Deathknell.\nScarlet Crusade.\nA detachment of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; has set up camp southeast of the village and stages frequent attacks against the citizens of Deathknell as well as against the Scourge. Vital information often passes between this encampment and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; far to the east, so this leads many to question the exact motives of the human forces in the area.\nThese Scarlet Crusaders have since been killed off and likely have been raised into undeath by the Forsaken.\nIn the RPG.\nDeathknell is a Forsaken village in northeast Tirisfal. The &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; of Deathknell is one of the main bases of the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;cult of the Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that this is the same village as &lt;a href=\"Vandermar%20Village\"&gt;Vandermar Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The few that remain are particularly aggressive and hostile. They are known to deliberately sink ships and stealing their loot.\nA sea giant kingdom is located in the island region of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. These giants have allied with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; minions.

They keep a wary eye on ships and upon those who make their living on the ocean, such as fisherfolk. While not evil creatures, sea giants care nothing for the laws of land dwellers or the lives of the small beings that trespass in the waves. They tolerate no opposition \u2014 on the rare occasion when a sea giant issues a warning, he does so only once. Sea giants rarely interact with other races save to drive off trespassers or punish those who befoul the oceans. They live underwater but rise regularly to patrol their coastlines. Ancient and wise, sea giants nonetheless display a chaotic nature as unpredictable as the sea itself. Still, adventurers who tread carefully and speak convincingly may find a sea giant willing to trade information or secure safe passage in exchange for treasure or knowledge. Sea giants sometimes build underground settlements of coral and stone, though they rarely put much effort into such constructions. As guardians of the waves, they prefer to be able to pick up and leave at a moment's notice to chase rumors of defilers.\nSea giants are tasked to keep the oceans clean and safe. They seldom make their way to the surface world, instead preferring the isolation of the ocean bottom. They enjoy the worship of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s but are the constant enemy of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Of late, sea giants have taken to hunting out these corrupters, which has brought the sea giants closer and closer to the surface world. They stand around 18 feet tall and weigh about 10,000 pounds. Nomadic creatures, sea giants do not maintain lairs like others of their kind. Instead, they drag their belongings and wealth along with them in huge sacks crafted from the sails of sunken ships. Their watery home does not allow them to keep many goods, so they favor metals that will survive the ocean depths.\nSea giants are not refined in their tactics. If on land, they will simply rush their target and try to stomp it out of existence. At sea, they will use their club or command of water to destroy their opponents. Once engaged in combat, they will fight to the death in their anger. Sea giants can hurl boulders, but they prefer close combat. A sea giant begins combat with a slam attack (using its Bash feat) against the nearest opponent; if surrounded, he chooses the target who seems the largest or strongest. He then switches to his heavy pick and attacks the next-nearest opponent. He uses his Power Attack and Reckless Attack feats to their fullest degrees, hoping to kill an enemy outright and then Cleave into the next; he generally positions himself near multiple foes, if possible, so that he can use his Great Cleave feat.\nCulture.\nAzeroth's sea giants venerate &lt;a href=\"Golganneth\"&gt;Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; and hold small ceremonies several times a year in his honor. These ceremonies involve the crafting and sounding of musical horns and the feeding of small fish."}

Seaforium only explodes if an external source (a detonator) provides a significant electrical surge. The detonator is typically attached to a length of copper wire so the operator can stand some distance away, preferably around a corner or behind some other sort of cover. The detonator can also be set to activate automatically, without the wire, after a preset delay period. Seaforium charges come in three basic sizes, small, medium, and powerful.\nSeaforium Detonator.\nThis is a T-shaped plunger in a red box with lightning bolts on the side.

One month before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he and his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; invaded Nathreza, breached the archive, and stole the seal before retreating back to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the beginning of the invasion of Outland, Illidan used the disk in a complex ritual at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to send his soul straight to Argus. A representation of the Seal of Argus he held in his hand drew him toward the &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%27s%20palace\"&gt;palace of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, where he began casting a spell to strengthen the disk's connection to the planet and allow it to act as the anchor for the portal he planned to open between &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and Argus. However, a dark entrapment spell and the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;elder naaru&lt;/a&gt; led to his soul being sent back to Outland. Over the following months, Illidan worked to create a gateway to Argus, with the Seal of Argus at the center of the weave to act as a direct link to his destination and guide the energies of the portal. However, before he could finish his preparations, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; was invaded and he had to resort to sending the Illidari to &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, an alternate means of reaching Argus.\nThe Seal of Argus was still in the Black Temple when Illidan was defeated, but it has not been mentioned since then and its whereabouts are unknown."}

It is no longer required for access to the upper portion of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; (BRS), but it can be worn to protect you from one of &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;Gyth's&lt;/a&gt; special attacks as well as summon the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Red\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Red&lt;/a&gt; to help you in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThis item obtained from a short questline:\nIn order to begin the quest, one must acquire an &lt;a href=\"Unadorned%20Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Unadorned Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. The seal is a random drop off of mobs both inside and outside the BRS instace. The seal can be purchased and sold on the Auction House.\nOnce one has the Seal, enter &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; (LBRS). Go up the stairs, take a right. Jump down and through the passage on the left. There will be a wooden bridge ahead of you.\nLooking up on the left side, the group will see a single mob kneeling on a ledge. Walk to the end of the ledge, following it around and up an incline. What appears to be a regular mob is actually in disguise. Upon coming into his aggro radius, he will cast a harmless spell on the group, allowing all to see Vaelan in his human form. Any group member with an &lt;a href=\"Unadorned%20Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Unadorned Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory will gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Seal of Ascension (quest)&lt;/a&gt; quest. \nNow collect the gems: The &lt;a href=\"Gemstone%20of%20Bloodaxe\"&gt;Gemstone of Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt; drops from , the &lt;a href=\"Gemstone%20of%20Smolderthorn\"&gt;Gemstone of Smolderthorn&lt;/a&gt; drops from , and the &lt;a href=\"Gemstone%20of%20Spirestone\"&gt;Gemstone of Spirestone&lt;/a&gt; drops from . The gems have a 100% drop rate. However, \"keep in mind that these gems are of Uncommon quality and do NOT drop for all group members\".\nReturn to Vaelan. Upon turning in &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Seal of Ascension (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, he will issue the quest &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension%20%282%29\"&gt;Seal of Ascension (2)&lt;/a&gt; giving you the &lt;a href=\"Unforged%20Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Unforged Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Draconic%20Energy\"&gt;Orb of Draconic Energy&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside, locate . Attack Emberstrife until the \"Emberstrife's will is starting to falter\" status message appears. Then place the unforged seal on the ground, right in front of him, where the tank stands. Use the Orb of Draconic Energy on Emberstrife. Emberstrife is now under your command for a brief time. Cast his first spell to breathe \"Flames of the Black Flight\" on the seal. Move him away over the pool to break Mind Control, then loot the &lt;a href=\"Forged%20Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Forged Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; from the seal.\nReturn to Vaelan in LBRS. Hand in the quest and you will then receive the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. \nCurrently, there is a bug with this quest, and you will be unable to turn it in unless you have a &lt;a href=\"Unadorned%20Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Unadorned Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; on you. Either farm mobs until another one drops, or check the AH for one.\nEither this has been fixed, or it only happens when your instance has reset. If you complete the forging of the seal and return to Vaelan rightaway, he will let you complete the quest.\nSummoning Vaelastrasz During Battle with Rend Blackhand.\nAt some point during the battle with the false warchief, &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, you can use your Seal of Ascension to summon a shade of &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Red\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Red&lt;/a&gt; (looks like a ghostly red dragon), who will heal your entire group for 5000 HP as well as 'help' you in your fight against Rend. To do this, you just 'use' your Seal like you would any other item with a \"Use: do something\" tag on it. This was once an unlisted \"hidden\" ability, but it was since been added to the tooltip and is now quite obvious.\nThe tricky part is the timing of when you \"use\" it. One tip is to add the ring to your action bar to keep fumbling to a minimum. As soon as Gyth dies use your ring and it should work properly.\nThree (3) minute cooldown on the \"use\" of this item."}

Using &lt;a href=\"Judgment\"&gt;Judgment&lt;/a&gt; when Seal of Righteousness is active deals a high amount of Holy damage. A moderate amount of Holy damage is also applied on each weapon swing.\nDamage.\nSeal of Righteousness deals additional Holy damage on every swing to a single target. Due to &lt;a href=\"normalization\"&gt;normalization&lt;/a&gt;, seal damage over time is a constant independent of weapon speed. What is means is, that a 4.00 speed weapon will deal twice as much damage per hit as a 2.00 speed weapon, but since it swings twice as often, the effective damage over time is the same.\nUsage.\nSoR is best used with one-handed weapons, or for Retribution paladins, when fighting multiple enemies because of the cleave bonus. The threat generated by its Holy damage is enhanced by &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt; and can thus be used to keep aggro.\nSeal of Righteousness is appropriately used when the fight or phase is short or where targets are switched so often that applying DoT stacks again every time would be impractical. Seal of Righteousness is replaced by &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Seal of Truth&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to long boss fights.\nIt is good to remember that a Seal's power always depends on the situation. Skilled Paladins with good situation awareness will switch Seals to adapt to the situation, sometimes several times during a fight if necessary. Good examples of fights like this are &lt;a href=\"Razorscale\"&gt;Razorscale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although described as a percentage of weapon damage, this damage is also highly variable.\nThe application of an additional stack of Censure (or the refreshing of the Censure stack) on the target is resolved as its own melee attack, separate from the normal melee swing that caused it. Even if the normal melee swing connects, Censure can still miss, be dodged, be parried, or be blocked.\nSeal of Truth is considered the primary seal for &lt;a href=\"tankadin\"&gt;tankadin&lt;/a&gt;s. This is because the DoT causes a constant &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;-generation which keeps mobs stuck to the tank, preventing them from attacking more fragile players in the group/raid. This is an important feature in situations where various effects may temporarily put the tank out of action (such as a &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;), create distance between the mobs and the tank, or even wipe all aggro. The DoT will keep on ticking whatever happens, generating threat without the tank having to do anything (until the debuff expires).\nDespite its DoT component, as it takes only a few seconds to place 5 stacks of Censure on a target, Seal of Truth's usefulness is not limited to lengthy encounters."}

{"id": "50663", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50663", "title": "Seal of Vengeance", "text": "Seal of Vengeance is a Paladin seal obtained at 64, intended to replace &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;Seal of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; as the primary tanking seal. Initially it was only available to Alliance Paladins; post 3.0 Horde Paladins receive an equivalent at 66, &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seal of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nWhile activated, the Paladin's melee swings apply a debuff on the target that causes holy damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds. The DoT stacks up to 5 times, with subsequent swings granting a damage bonus of direct holy damage and continuing to refresh the stack's duration. Furthermore, for every stack of Holy Vengeance on the target, Judgement's damage is increased by 10% (up to 50%).\nNote that only normal melee swings can apply the debuff, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;. Attacks like &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Storm\"&gt;Divine Storm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; will not apply or refresh the DoT, though they do gain the direct holy damage bonus if the DoT has 5 stacks.\n3.2 changes.\nIn patch 3.2, the application of the debuff is treated as a melee attack. That is to say, it is not applied to the target automatically every time your melee swing lands\u2014instead, when your melee swing lands, a separate melee attack is made to see if the debuff is successfully applied to the target. This separate attack can miss, be dodged, or be parried just like a regular melee special can.\nFurthermore, in patch 3.2, if the target already has a 5-stack of Seal of Vengeance debuffs, each subsequent melee swing or special attack made while this seal is in effect will inflict 33% of the attacker's Weapon Damage as Holy damage to the target (twice this amount if the melee swing crits). This extra holy damage cannot miss, be dodged, or be parried.\nTips and tactics.\nThis is a valuable seal for Tankadins, as the full 5 stack will do more holy damage (and therefore threat) per second than &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;Seal of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; can be used to maintain the DoT on up to three (four with the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt;) targets at the same time.\nIt can also be useful in PvP against &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s who use &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, as the Damage Over Time component will force them out of &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis seal is listed as magic, not melee so it can not miss, but it can, however, be resisted.\nIn PvP situations, it is not unknown for paladins who use this seal to carry a fast, 1 handed weapon (and normally a shield) to build up debuff stacks as fast as possible, then change to their slow, hard hitting 2h weapon after they reach 5 stacks to do burst damage.\nUp to patch 3.2 this seal was used as a tanking seal.\nThis is very useful while tanking as it allows the paladin to switch targets while still maintaining aggro, and it allows the paladin to generate instant threat in the event of a threat wipe.\nSince patch 3.2 it became the main DPS seal for Retribution Paladins against mobs with big amount of HP (bosses)\nIn PVP its usage is now limited - due to long time of stacking DOT."}

By the time of the Assault, the Wastewanders have been overrun in several locations. With the exception of the Obelisk of the Moon, the Oasis of Vir'sar and the Ruins of Ammon; the various Wastewander settlements have been taken over by the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. In Orsis, a small hold out group remains, though they are all injured save for a lone Wastewander Mender; &lt;a href=\"Outrider%20Lashan\"&gt;Outrider Lashan&lt;/a&gt; is a part of this group. In particular, the Wastewanders at Ankhaten Harbor have been turned into living hosts for the swarm, with the flight master, &lt;a href=\"Dartan%20Oilpan\"&gt;Dartan Oilpan&lt;/a&gt;, killed with aqir spores growing from his corpse. Wastewanders can also be found attempting to retake the Temple of Uldum at the &lt;a href=\"Maker%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Maker's Ascent&lt;/a&gt;. There, they are accompanied by an Explorer's League entourage of &lt;a href=\"Reno%20Jackson\"&gt;Reno Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Finley%20Mrrgglton\"&gt;Sir Finley Mrrgglton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"H%27partho%20Ardoros\"&gt;H'partho Ardoros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nGadgetzan Water Company.\nThe Wastewander nomads are enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Water%20Company\"&gt;Gadgetzan Water Company&lt;/a&gt; for three reasons:\nReputation.\nKilling &lt;a href=\"Caliph%20Scorpidsting\"&gt;Caliph Scorpidsting&lt;/a&gt; gives 15 reputation with &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; if doing so grants experience. All Wastewander NPCs in Tanaris have (or had) a chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"Wastewander%20Water%20Pouch\"&gt;Wastewander Water Pouch&lt;/a&gt;. These are once used to be turned in to &lt;a href=\"Spigot%20Operator%20Luglunket\"&gt;Spigot Operator Luglunket&lt;/a&gt; in stacks of 5 for &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; reputation and a &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Water%20Co.%20Care%20Package\"&gt;Gadgetzan Water Co. Care Package&lt;/a&gt;, which may contain food, water, and/or potions. Wastewander NPCs, as of \"Cataclysm\", no longer drop &lt;a href=\"leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; patterns for the &lt;a href=\"Tough%20Scorpid%20collection\"&gt;Tough Scorpid collection&lt;/a&gt; armor pieces.\nGained rep from normal Wastewander NPCs.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Wastewander Bandits are a band of outlaws who wander &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Caliph%20Scorpidsting\"&gt;Caliph Scorpidsting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no easily attainable sources of water anywhere in Tanaris and so the &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Waterworks%20Company\"&gt;Gadgetzan Waterworks Company&lt;/a&gt; build wells across the desert to farm fresh water. Mostly everyone leaves the wells alone, except for the annoying Wastewander Bandits who steal the water for their own use. You have to watch out for them as they will kill you on sight, steal your water, and then \u2014 if the rumors are true \u2014 they will \"distill\" your body, draining all the liquid out for their own use.\nSpeculation.\nBefore being captured, &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Bandit\"&gt;Enslaved Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s were likely Wastewander."}

One of these methods involves zerging/nuking the boss, while another involves one person kiting as many mobs as possible up the corridor to the entrance while the remaining 4 people nuke the boss down within approximately 1 minute. This second method, as of patch 3.0.8, does not work as the mobs are leashed and the entire encounter will reset if mobs are pulled out of the room.\nThe intended method is to eliminate all adds except for the three watchers and then engage the boss. The boss is burned down while the watchers are left alive. This can be difficult due to the watchers' web wrap ability, and the Blinding Webs ability of watcher Narjil.\nA well geared group is highly desirable for this fight, and group makeup can be swapped around as required, but strategy will be different to the one following.\nA known successful group combination for the zerging method achievement is:\nAs the pull is initiated, all DPS is focused on &lt;a href=\"Krik%27thir%20the%20Gatewatcher\"&gt;Krik'thir&lt;/a&gt;, and his adds are effectively ignored. The holy priest can shackle a shadowcaster as the boss is pulled, then follow with a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Hymn\"&gt;Divine Hymn&lt;/a&gt; to crowd control multiple mobs.\nThe tank uses &lt;a href=\"Challenging%20Shout\"&gt;Challenging Shout&lt;/a&gt; to tank everything else, and probably shortly follows with shield wall at their discretion.\n&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; is blown, and all cooldowns are used to hold aggro and maximize DPS in the shortest time possible. If done correctly, this fight should be over in approximately 35 seconds. Poison cleansing totem should be up, and the Shaman can also cast Earth Elemental Totem to taunt adds and keep them off the tank for a vital few seconds. \nAnother known but highly dangerous group would involve:\nIn this group makeup, sole priority is burst damage. If this boss is not dead within 20 seconds, then odds are it will be a wipe. Cooldowns must be used right away in order to obtain the highest burst DPS possible. The use of free action potions is vital in these fights due to the three separate watchers and the one web-wrap ability. So long as the DPS is high enough, this achievement is do-able.\nWhen the ground shakes and small adds are summoned these can be AoE'd to keep them off the healer, but it may be risky as it will likely break Divine Hymn and wipe the group anyway.\nSome aspects of this fight can be attributed purely to luck, such as fixates and web wraps/disorient. Do not be surprised if this takes a lot of time and money in an undergeared group."}

{"id": "19721", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19721", "title": "Watchers", "text": "The Watchers are the jailers and marshals of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; society. They guard the barrow-prisons of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and hunt down dangerous criminals. Though their members came from a number of backgrounds, their original members were volunteers of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. A circular blade called an &lt;a href=\"%3AUmbra%20Crescent\"&gt;:Umbra Crescent&lt;/a&gt; is the favored weapon of the Watchers, most famously wielded by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, but can be seen even today on night elves such as the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps%20Watcher\"&gt;Barrow Deeps Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. They can also wield typical &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;s. The highest rank that can be bestowed on a Watcher is the one of &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembership.\nAt first, volunteers from the Sisterhood of Elune made up the Watchers, and so the organization was composed solely of night elf women. As their duties were broadened, the Watchers accepted night elf women from other professions as well as men and druids, such as &lt;a href=\"Sarius\"&gt;Sarius&lt;/a&gt;. A mixture of volunteerism and military promotions caused the organization's size to grow somewhat, although the Watchers remained a relatively small group.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Watchers recruited hundreds of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their ranks in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. These recruits were trained to move silently in the forests like night elves, but were ultimately wiped out in the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAftermath of the War of the Ancients.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sentenced his brother &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; to imprisonment for having created a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;second Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. In inflicting this punishment, Malfurion hoped to prevent Illidan from continuing his reckless pursuit of arcane power. By this point in time, however, Illidan was already an extraordinarily powerful sorcerer, and Malfurion dared not leave his captive twin to be guarded by only one or two jailors. One of the senior Sisters of Elune, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, had already shown her competence in guarding Illidan before he was brought to trial. Malfurion accordingly asked Maiev to gather additional volunteers from the Sisters of Elune. Maiev obeyed, and Malfurion called this new group the Watchers, for he charged them with ensuring that Illidan never escaped the barrow prison. Maiev, as the Watchers' leader, would answer to the head of night elf government, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the prison of the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Califax\"&gt;Califax&lt;/a&gt; personally guarded Illidan's cell.\nThe Watchers were created specifically and exclusively to be Illidan's jailors, but as further threats came up, Tyrande broadened the Watchers' role to include guarding other prisoners. Maiev took grim pleasure in these added responsibilities. Watchers became jailors and marshals: they policed the barrow prisons and hunted down dangerous criminals. Outside of the barrow prisons, members of the Watchers worked alone. These deadly women were not a militia, nor were they considered part of either the Sisterhood of Elune or the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. As the group's leader, Maiev was given the rank of &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;, which she later awarded to a select few who had proven their exceptional fighting abilities, tracking skills, and tenacity.\nThird War.\nDuring the Third War, Tyrande realized that Illidan had been incarcerated for over ten thousand years. She felt that he had more than paid his debt to society; furthermore, she felt that he would be a valuable ally against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, she led a band of soldiers into Illidan's prison. When Tyrande called on them to release Illidan, they openly defied her. They would not surrender their charge, Tyrande and the Sentinels fought and killed a number of Watchers. Once freed, Illidan stole and consumed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and he was transformed into a demon.\nTerror of the Tides.\nInfuriated by Tyrande's actions, Maiev swore she would track Illidan down and put him back in prison. In light of the demon's undeniable might, Maiev took most of the Watchers with her on the hunt. They pursued Illidan across &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; where they came upon the devastated seaport town of &lt;a href=\"Nendis\"&gt;Nendis&lt;/a&gt;, its denizens slaughtered and mutilated. After clashing with &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;satyrs&lt;/a&gt; and demon-tainted beasts from the wilderness they came face to face with Illidan's monstrous new &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; allies attempting to sink the ships docked in the harbor while their master sailed away. By defeating the naga they recovered enough vessels to follow the Betrayer to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce they landed, the Watchers made camp in the jungles and in the ruins of the old Kaldorei cities lost during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. They fought their way through the naga once more and pressed their hunt for Illidan into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. As they entered the Tomb, Maiev deciphered the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; runes left behind by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and grew worried that Illidan would retrieve a magical artifact and become significantly more difficult to recapture. She and the other Watchers caught up with Illidan too late, having to battle the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver Clan&lt;/a&gt; as well as the tomb's own demonic guardians, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and wild creatures, and the naga led by &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;: Illidan had already claimed the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He used the Eye's power on the tomb's stone walls, trapping the Watchers in one section of the tomb while seawater flooded the area. Only Maiev was able to escape; her sisters in arms were buried alive, including her first lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev would not forget her Watchers, swearing that she would avenge them all.\nFleeing from the collapsing Tomb, Maiev met with the Watchers camped outside. She warned them of Illidan's acquired artifact and urged them to retreat back to Kalimdor to enlist the aid of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, Illidan had other plans and cornered the Watchers with his naga to halt their escape. A long and hard-fought battle ensued between the two armies as the Watchers stood their ground, entrusting a small party to escort a runner through the naga's lines and onto the shore where they could sail to sea.\nAgainst the odds, the Watchers were able to hold back Illidan's attacks long enough for Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to arrive with reinforcements. Though the presence of the High Priestess caused much displeasure to Maiev, they fought together and were able to win the day against the naga. Tyrande herself sought to stop Illidan, but he was able to flee once more, this time to the distant lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndeterred, Maiev led her Watchers to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; where they reluctantly aided prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in crossing the undead-infested forest of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching the river &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;Arevass&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande stood behind to hold back an overwhelming force of undead, however, she fell in the waters of the stream below and despite the pleas of prince Kael, Maiev and her Watchers did not go to her rescue, believing they had a greater mission at hand.\nThe chase for Illidan eventually led them to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where the Betrayer had begun a mighty ritual using the Eye of Sargeras, such was its potency that it began to tear the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;roof of the world&lt;/a&gt; asunder. Maiev deceived Malfurion into believing Tyrande was torn apart by the undead in an effort to maintain his support to the Watchers. Along with the blood elves, the Watchers assaulted the ruins and interrupted the incantation wrought by Illidan's naga sorceresses. The magical instability that followed destroyed the Eye of Sargeras and left Illidan surrounded by the Watchers. Ensnared by Malfurion, Illidan could not flee as Maiev sentenced him to death. But before the killing blow could be given, prince Kael revealed that Tyrande was still alive. Outraged at this discovery, Malfurion ensnared Maiev instead and called her a betrayer while letting Illidan free on the accord that he would aid him in recovering Tyrande.\nDiscontent with the outcome faced in Dalaran and believing that justice still had to be done, Maiev led her Watchers to continue following Illidan while he saved Tyrande. When the Betrayer left &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through a portal, Maiev and her Watchers charged inside after him. The gateway led them to the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where they were, at long last, able to catch Illidan and bind him in an enchanted prison once more. His second incarceration was short-lived; during the transit back to their camp, the Watchers were assaulted by a joint force of blood elves and naga, led by Kael'thas and Lady Vashj, who took Illidan's prison and released him afterwards. The pursuit was not over.\nThe hunt continues in Outland.\nIn spite of the losses suffered, the Watchers stayed true to their mission of bringing Illidan Stormrage to reckoning. By this time, &lt;a href=\"Anyndra\"&gt;Anyndra&lt;/a&gt; was Maiev's second-in-command and only thirty Watchers still marched with her. The following years proved Outland to be an unforgiving and hostile place, the Watchers suffered heavily from thirst and heat, and they were confronted by many perils which they only narrowly survived, such as &lt;a href=\"Fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reavers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;ravagers&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev, who had until then never doubted their commitment to the hunt, knew she had to keep a closer eye on her own Watchers and their wavering morale, though many of them remained stalwart regardless of their dire situation. Even as she considered a closer eye on her troops, Maiev herself was often consumed by deep ruminations on Illidan that led her to inadvertently risk exposure or walk her troops into traps, for which she cursed Illidan.\nThe Watchers initially ventured from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to the boggy fenland of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, seeking the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; sage, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to gather allies against Illidan. While here they were met with new terrible living conditions, mainly the spores that saturated the very air and found their way everywhere on the Watchers, settling within their clothes and their armor. Phosphorescent fungi began to grow from their skin and only careful cleaning or healing magic could remove them. Huge stinging insects deposited brain-eating larvae within their bodies, which Maiev also blamed on Illidan after one stung and killed &lt;a href=\"Kolea\"&gt;Kolea&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finding Akama in the village of &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt; he refused to aid the Watchers directly, but he revealed to Maiev that Illidan was carrying the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, this prompted the Watchers to make haste back to Hellfire Peninsula where Maiev planned a suicide attack to assassinate Illidan in full view of his army. At the last minute, Maiev was lost in fantasies of beheading Illidan when Anyndra broke her ponderings and &lt;a href=\"Sarius\"&gt;Sarius&lt;/a&gt; warned her that Illidan was looking in her direction. This led her to call off the attack and retreat in search of allies braver than Akama.\nLeaving Hellfire behind, the Watchers traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; where they set up camp and began recruiting hundreds of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and Broken youths to their army by visiting town after town to convince the people of Outland of the danger posed by Illidan. Here they encountered the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt;, who invited them to &lt;a href=\"Telaar\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt;. The town's leader, &lt;a href=\"Arechron\"&gt;Arechron&lt;/a&gt;, allowed them to recruit in his village and told them of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. From the Kurenai the Watchers recruited five scores of young fighters mounted on &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;, then they departed for Shattrath.\nIn Shattrath, they sought an audience with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. They distrusted the blood elves in the city, Sarius pitied them, while Maiev wondered if they were spies for Kael'thas, refusing to collaborate with the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt; personally making himself available. In the end, they parted ways from A'dal after he told Maiev he had no aid to give, leading to the Watchers appealing to the Aldor instead, who likewise could not offer any help. During their stay, Akama informed the Watchers of the new generation of &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunters&lt;/a&gt; Illidan was making and of Kael'thas' departure from Illidan's service. Feeling time was wearing thin, the Watchers prepared themselves for action.\nThe Watchers passed through Zangarmarsh once more, they attempted to sabotage the water-pumping engines of the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20tribe\"&gt;Coilfang&lt;/a&gt;, but failed. They freed several Broken slaves held captive by the naga, but Maiev disregarded them as useless.\nWhile the Watchers worked with Akama and the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Ashtongue&lt;/a&gt; in secret, Illidan was able to discover the plot and manipulated Akama &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;by tearing out a portion of his soul&lt;/a&gt;. Akama then contacted Maiev and planned a meeting at Orebor Harborage, telling her to ready her Watchers for fighting. Thinking that the time to act had finally come, the Watchers quickly rode to the village after a brief clash with &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;. Akama arrived late, but he delivered wonderful news of an opportunity to strike at Illidan during a moment of vulnerability at the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; where the Betrayer would attempt to open a new gateway. At the prospect that Illidan could flee from her grasp once again with a new portal, Maiev prepared her Watchers and made for &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; at once, with assurances of support from the Ashtongue.\nIn Shadowmoon, the Watchers and the Ashtongue took furtive positions at the Hand of Gul'dan while the ritual was in process. When the order to strike was given, the Watchers and their allies outnumbered the Illidari and many of them quickly fell at the sudden onslaught. Then, Illidan gave a signal and portals began to open all around them, bringing massive reinforcements for the Illidari. Despite attempts to block the portals, the Watchers were quickly overrun and decimated to the last one standing, including Anyndra and Sarius. Only Maiev was spared to suffer capture at the hands of the Betrayer.\nThree months later, Maiev was liberated from her cell by her own jailer, Akama. The following day, Maiev reached the pinnacle of the Black Temple and slew Illidan alongside Akama and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;. Her long hunt was finally over, all her promises of reckoning fulfilled, and her Watchers avenged. Though she would continue to be haunted by the deaths of her followers and a sense of hollowness.\nIllidan's lifeless body was encased in a crystal by Maiev, a fate shared by the surviving &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunters&lt;/a&gt;, who were then transported to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolfheart.\nSearching for something to live for following Illidan's death, Maiev left &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to rejoin &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;her people&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her role in leaving &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; for dead during their venture into the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, she was permitted to return to Darnassus to begin training a new generation of Watchers, all of whom are just as fearless and dangerous as the originals. When Malfurion and Tyrande allowed for the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; to live in Darnassus, Maiev was secretly outraged \u2014 despising the Highborne for their part in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and the other races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for bringing the night elves into their affairs.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Thera%27brin\"&gt;Thera'brin&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated and his corpse was found by the Watchers' training grounds, it seemed to be intended to impute the Watchers. Maiev offered her services to investigate the matter and bring the murderer to justice, to which Malfurion and Tyrande consented. In truth, however, she was secretly the one responsible for the Highborne killings. Maiev had planned to slaughter the Highborne and their leaders first, and then give Malfurion a slow rotting death. In her opinion, Malfurion was guilty of the same arrogance that his twin, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, displayed. By believing that he knew what was best for the night elf people, she felt Malfurion condemned them by taking away their immortality. She also despised him for forgiving the Highborne and accepting them back into night elf society. It is suspected that the trauma caused by years of dedication to her duty, combined with the torture inflicted upon her when she was Illidan's prisoner had finally driven her mad.\n&lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; later freed Malfurion and joined him in confronting Maiev and her Watchers. Jarod distracted Maiev while Malfurion was rescuing the Highborne, whom Maiev had captured in a deadly trap. Jarod subsequently drove Maiev off, unable to kill his own sister. The Highborne were safe, and most of the new Watchers were dead, though their mistress had vanished into the night. With Maiev gone, Tyrande decided to question the remaining Watchers and appoint a new leader from the innocent ones.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Warden &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; was sent by Maiev to accompany and protect Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. She was, however, corrupted by and joined the Legion's side.\nLegion.\nThe Watchers have a base in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; is located, a prison for the most dangerous beings that the Wardens have encountered. With the help of Cordana, who allowed them access into the facility, the Legion assaulted the Vault and retrieved the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev was taken during the assault as well and brought to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The Wardens worked with the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the traitor Cordana, and many powerful individuals that had escaped the prison during the attack. &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; acted as their leader in Maiev's absence.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev's wardens arrived in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the events leading up to it as Tyrande prepared the Night Warrior ritual, the Wardens joined the Alliance against the Horde. \nAfter Sira Moonwarden and &lt;a href=\"Lyani%20Shadestalker\"&gt;Lyani Shadestalker&lt;/a&gt; were killed and raised by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, they joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, although Sira was captured and sent to the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, and Lyani was slain in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSub-groups.\nBarrow Deeps Watchers.\n&lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps%20Watcher\"&gt;Barrow Deeps Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s are night elven soldiers associated with the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; guarding several prisoners. They are located within the underground prison complex of &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Hyjal Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Saynna%20Stormrunner\"&gt;Captain Saynna Stormrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The Barrow Deeps Watchers fight with Twilight Assassins, who are trying to free &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; from his prison. They seem to be \"lesser\" wardens with less extreme armor components, and open-faced helms similar to Maiev Shadowsong's in-game model in Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.\nShadow Wardens.\nAfter the escape of Fandral &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; talked to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Saynna%20Stormrunner\"&gt;Captain Saynna Stormrunner&lt;/a&gt;. He knew that they took the loss of Fandral from their custody very seriously, so it didn't take much prodding to bring the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; to hunt the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their attire, neither the Barrow Deeps Watchers nor the Shadow Wardens were initially confirmed to be a part of the Watchers. However, many members of the Shadow Wardens were later seen on the accompanying &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; camps and later with &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nInconsistencies.\nLeadership conflict.\nAt the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Wolfheart\"&gt;Wolfheart&lt;/a&gt;\", after Maiev betrayed &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; wanted to pick an innocent member of the Watchers to replace her and lead them, while &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; was to lead a new security force composed from the members of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Visual%20Guide\"&gt;Ultimate Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that \"Jarod now leads the Watchers, which act as a security force\" and labeled him as \"Leader of the Watchers\". The changed the sentence to \"Jarod now leads a security force of night elves\", but kept his title, though it still is closer to \"Wolfhearts wording. It could be speculated that:\nHowever, these events seem to be largely ignored in later development. For unknown reasons, Maiev still seems to be considered leader of the Watchers in recent content despite her betrayal in \"Wolfheart\"."}

Unfortunately, the healing spells have a cooldown of about 20 secs, so it won't be of much help healing the tank.\nHeroic.\nIncreased damage from Surge, but still not very high.

While the Lich King gathered his strength, Tichondrius and his fellow dreadlords would serve as jailors and executors meant to hasten the Lich King's task by any means necessary. To this end, they would construct the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though seemingly broken by the dreadlords, Ner'zhul sought vengeance and was able to play on the dreadlord's fears of Kil'jaeden in order trick them into allowing him to hurl Frostmourne out of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scourge of Lordaeron.\nAs befitting his status as the greatest of the Nathrezim, Tichondrius was placed in charge of a number of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; operations. Following the corruption of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, Tichondrius introduced himself to the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;, providing him with orders from Ner'zhul, especially concerning the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Because he didn't entirely trust Arthas, Tichondrius pretended to be another one of the Lich King's followers. The ghost of Kel'Thuzad, however, informed Arthas that Tichondrius and the other dreadlords were actually the Lich King's jailers. He took particular amusement in sending Arthas to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;Urn of King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, a task which would involve killing Arthas's former mentor &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nTichondrius regularly &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadlords%20Convene\"&gt;discussed the Scourge's progress&lt;/a&gt; with his colleagues, &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, who remained on a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; planet in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The Darkener expressed (justified) concern that Ner'zhul had alternative plans for his new \"champion\", but Mephistroth pointed out that he \"wouldn't dare undermine our efforts now.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; continued his work, eventually overseeing the death of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, the invasion and destruction of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and the siege of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. During the siege of Dalaran, Tichondrius accompanied Arthas and Kel'Thuzad throughout the city and eventually took the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; while Kel'Thuzad and Arthas stole the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Once &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was summoned, he decreed that the Lich King was no longer needed, and gave Tichondrius control of the Scourge.\nInvasion of Kalimdor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, having lost their most powerful leaders and heroes, quickly fell before the might of the Legion, now joined by &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Mannoroth was still sore over the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' failure to conquer &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; years before, and was angrier still when Tichondrius smugly observed that the Scourge had done the job the orcs couldn't. Mannoroth became even more enraged when Tichondrius informed him that the orcs had left the continent. The pit lord was eager to take his frustrations out on the orcs, so at the first opportunity he and Tichondrius picked up the trail and followed the orcs to the ancient land of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe arrival at Kalimdor reminded the pair of demon lords only too well that the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; still remained, as well as the demigod, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Mannoroth suspected that unless weakened, they would still pose a considerable threat. Tichondrius, however, came up with a solution. He knew that the orcs had earned the wrath of Cenarius, and he believed that corrupting the orcs once again would give them the power to defeat Cenarius, leaving him defeated when the Legion began their invasion of Kalimdor in full. Encouraged by the Darkener's plot, Mannoroth spilled his burning blood into a sacred pool that was eventually &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Witch%20Doctor%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;sensed&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who would eventually drink the blood in order to kill Cenarius. Following the death of Cenarius Mannoroth would personally recruit the Warsong back into the Legion's fold, while at an unknown point either during or after these events Tichondrius would return to Archimonde's side.\nTichondrius led the Scourge to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to destroy the &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt; holding the body of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. While the ghouls were cutting down the trees near the building, Tyrande awakened Malfurion.\nIn spite of Mannoroth's death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Tichondrius proceeded with the invasion. The Scourge, more dangerous than ever thanks to the demonic support of &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, was more than successful in penetrating &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; without Cenarius's intervention. The combined forces of the orcs and the humans, coupled with the resistance of the night elves, eventually managed to halt their progress. \nAs the invasion of Kalimdor progressed, Tichondrius began corrupting the forests of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; using a powerful warlock artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, which also augmented his own powers. However, the skull was consumed by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who had been tipped off by none other than &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. Transformed by the skull into a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;-hybrid, Illidan used his newfound power to defeat Tichondrius.\nAfter his death, the Legion forces in the area took his &lt;a href=\"Claw%20of%20Tichondrius\"&gt;claw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;, whom he called brother, participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; likely in his stead.\nLegion.\nTichondrius reformed within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the many demons summoned by during the battle of the Broken Shore.\nTichondrius watched over Gul'dan in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure he did not fail his masters. He served as a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, where he voiced contempt that the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; were unable to stop their own palace from invasion. He would ultimately be defeated himself, his dying words expressing his disbelief.\nIn the RPG.\nAs an agent of the Burning Legion, Tichondrius was charged with overseeing the Scourge uprising in Lordaeron. His primary task was to soften up the human defenses in preparation for a full assault by the demons of the Burning Legion. To accomplish this, Tichondrius orchestrated the spreading of a contagious plague across the countryside. He focused on corrupting food stores and water sources, which allowed the plague to infect a large number of humans in a very short time frame. Once infected, humans would gradually transform into zombie-like undead minions. These zombies formed the core of the Scourge armies and severely weakened the human defenses.\nAlthough Tichondrius is a powerful Nathrezim dreadlord, he rarely depends on his combat abilities and instead prefers to manipulate situations from behind the scenes. He is an exceptional diplomat, with an incredible proficiency for bribing, corrupting or otherwise coercing people into doing his will. He often attempts to come across as a friend by providing token amounts of assistance, but always requires more significant favors to be paid back in return from those he \u201chelps.\u201d Even though he openly serves the Burning Legion, Tichondrius\u2019 first loyalty is always to himself. Serving the demons was simply the easiest way for him to increase his stature and power in a short amount of time. However, Tichondrius has far greater ambitions than being a lackey for the Burning Legion, and he constantly tries to strengthen his own personal position through whatever means are available.\nOn the rare occasion sTichondrius is called on to fight his own battles, he engages with his most powerful spells first. The moment things look bleak, he teleports away to safety.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The bonus to critical effect chance stacks with your normal crit chance. If a player already has a 40% chance to crit from other sources, the first spell cast with Tidal Force is guaranteed to crit.\nWhen cast, Tidal Force places a &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; stacked three times on the player. Each stack increases the critical effect chance of Lesser Healing Wave, Healing Wave, and Chain Heal by 20%. Every time one of these spells crit, the stack is reduced by one. This means that after one crit the effect is reduced to +40%, after two it is reduced to +20%, and after three crits the buff is removed.\nSince Chain Heal has a separate chance to crit on each target, it will remove one charge from the buff for each target it crits on. If the spell crits on all three targets, it will immediately consume all three charges of the Tidal Force buff."}

This effect stacks up to 2 times.\nNotes.\nTidal Waves is a staple of restoration healing, and allows you to significantly reduce the otherwise fairly long casting times of Healing Wave, while also providing a bonus to Healing Surge. The Healing Surge bonus is very rarely useful, however, as the main benefit of the spell is its short casting time; something that is only relevant when you \"don't\" have Tidal Waves active. The casting time reduction can be used to mitigate the main drawback of Healing Wave, namely it's low healing per second. Managing the buff and knowing when you'll be able to refresh it next can be tricky, but is necessary for getting the most out of your healing spells."}

A thick, emerald-colored hide forms this creature's monstrous body, but countless tiny scales of dark blue and deep purple shades cover its serpentine skin. These form a tough natural armor that shimmers iridescently wherever light shines upon it.\nOccasionally, &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; capture and train tube wyrms to serve them as defenders (particularly in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;), though this strategy is not widespread. Naga refer to these tamed tube wyrms as Tidal Guardians. Tube wyrms thrive in heated, sulfur-rich, acidic waters. Heated gas emerges from thermal vents in some areas, and tube wyrms consume this gas and convert it into nutrients. One such area is the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20Deep\"&gt;Pillar Deep&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt;. On first sighting this area, an undersea explorer sees enormous pillars rising from the ocean floor. Closer inspection, however, reveals that these \"pillars\" are tube wyrms, grown to enormous size in these rich waters. Tube wyrms protect the tubes in which they live and the surrounding area. Some varieties spit acid and/or grapple foes.\nSpeculation.\nThey may have inspired later naga worms like &lt;a href=\"Serpentrix\"&gt;Serpentrix&lt;/a&gt;. Though feral, it is a similar creature that lives in a series of holes."}

Most people on Kul Tiras look to the &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;s for guidance the same way others look to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but the tidesages have a much deeper connection with the water. The Kul Tirans have always survived primarily on their wits and bravery, for while the Light rewards conviction, the ocean demands activity. Long have the tidesages listened to the sea to guide their ships and their people, gentle whispers imperceptible to most. But in recent times, the voices changed, becoming demanding and even violent. This led to the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tidesage%20Council\"&gt;Tidesage Council&lt;/a&gt; and many other followers, and their fall to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al wards \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Tidemother's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tidemother%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tidemother%27s%20Radiance\"&gt;Radiance&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 that guard the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; were said to be gifts from the sea itself. They long protected &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; flagships against even the fiercest storms, but after the tidesages settled in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the wards have instead kept the Shrine safe. To enter the Shrine of the Storm one must use the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Rod of Tides&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Tideguard%20Victoria\"&gt;Tideguard Victoria&lt;/a&gt; states \"&lt;a href=\"Oathbound\"&gt;deemed&lt;/a&gt;\" the player character worthy; this perhaps implies the Tidemother could reject one from entering the Shrine of the Storm."}

Most people on Kul Tiras look to the seas for guidance the same way others look to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but the tidesages have a much deeper connection with the water.\nThe tidesages were led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"Tidesage%20Council\"&gt;leading council&lt;/a&gt; beneath him, each overseeing a different aspect of the order's work. Recently, however, Lord Stormsong, his inner circle and most of his followers have turned to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Fed up with feeding the entire kingdom and building and blessing its ships for nothing in return, they stole the Kul Tiran fleet and set out to build many more ships to conquer Kul Tiras. Their alliance with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; was eventually shattered as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of Stormsong inhabitants opposing their schemes, assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; and killed Lord Stormsong.\nHistory.\n2,700 years ago, a group of humans from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; left their homes and took to the ocean. They scanned the horizon day and night for a new home, seeking a place that married land and sea to shelter their children from the ocean waves. The ancestor of &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; was the first to hear the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;, gentle and imperceptible to all but him, which taught him the power of the seas. Stormsong's powers guided fish and fresh water to the sailors, now masters of the elements, and as Stormsong's powers grew others began to hear the Tidemother. The wind was theirs to command as it powered their sails, and the hulls of their ships became impenetrable to the denizens of the ocean deeps. The sea guided the sailors to a new home, an island that they would call &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and they sent their tidesages to guide others to come to the island as well. The sea priests played a vital role early in the history of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, when the city was only a collection of houses on a rock and there was no seawall to protect it from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;'s storms. Each ship that wanted to go in and out of the harbor carried a sea priest if its crew wanted to survive the journey. In those days, many tidesages\u2014who were the first to board and the last to disembark\u2014died young trying to prevent the waters from dragging sailors down with their perishing vessel. As such, while the tidesages were dearly beloved, fathers still wept when their children were sent to join the order.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn recent days, the Tidesages have withdrawn into their cloisters and seem uninterested in finding the ships of the Kul Tiran fleet that have been missing for months. Long had they listened to the sea to guide their ships and their people, gentle whispers imperceptible to most. But in recent times the voices changed, becoming demanding and even violent. They started manipulating the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and while many turned hostile and started worshiping the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;horrors of the ocean&lt;/a&gt;, others remained firm in their duties to Kul Tiras. Their aid and mystical oceanic magic is requested in order to locate the missing fleet of legend.\nThe tidesages stationed at &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Monastery\"&gt;Stormsong Monastery&lt;/a&gt; betrayed their people and their teachings, and those who tried to betray them were considered &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s and then eliminated, such as &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Alen\"&gt;Brother Alen&lt;/a&gt;. The place was raided by a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; in order to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, one of the order's most powerful artifacts, with the help of traitor Tidesage &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to have become a follower of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and planned to conduct a ritual that would give her the entire Kul Tiran fleet which the tidesages held hostage. Many tidesages have become &lt;a href=\"k%27thir\"&gt;k'thir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Lord Stormsong's defeat, the missing fleet was found, but it could not be called home without the aid of a &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; would later save them using a magic song her father taught her as a child.\nDescription.\nKul Tiran children who hear the whispers of the Tidemother are sent to join the tidesages in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. All tidesages walk the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Path of Storms&lt;/a&gt; on their way to be blessed at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storms\"&gt;Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sagehold\"&gt;Sagehold&lt;/a&gt; is where the tidesages study and learn to master command of the sea. The tidesage order also possesses &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Monastery\"&gt;a sizable monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, where visitors are only allowed by boat. They have magical dominion over the oceans, can control water, storms, wind, and have mastery over all the &lt;a href=\"elements\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;. They use wands to control their &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt; constructs. They can also free an elemental from its bindings. Their aquatic magic also involves &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;. They can use ritual implements to augment their power: a &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Kris\"&gt;Tidal Kris&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Beacon%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Abyssal Beacon (quest item)&lt;/a&gt; allowing them to reach what the ocean's mists hide, and a &lt;a href=\"Wavecaller%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Wavecaller's Mantle&lt;/a&gt; which carries incantations on its scrolls. They can also summon &lt;a href=\"siren\"&gt;siren&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe tidesage takes several oaths as part of their role: to serve and protect the people, guide and sustain them, and to make their ships strong. There also appears to be one to not attack or go against their fellow sages.\nTidesages bless every last &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; ship, which is what really sets them apart from the vessels visiting Kul Tiras. Kul Tiras's largest ships always carry a tidesage to navigate through storms, withstand heavy seas, and put wind in their sails. They help bring fish to nets in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and rains to the fields in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. A tidesage's day-to-day job involves, among other things, blessing ships, fishermen, and their equipment; reading the tides for omens; finding the best spots to fish; and praying for the return of sailors.\nThe people of Stormsong do not bury their dead, they send them to the sea. The tidesages can use a bell that calls the souls of the recently deceased to them, and release them through the Ritual of Release. The souls of the fallen are released into rivers that flow through the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; and out into the open sea. Legends say that as their spirits pass through the Shrine, they aid in the great blessing rituals that all Kul Tiran ships undergo. In that way, the Stormsong never stop serving their people.\nTidesages use seaweed and &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; blubber to create tonics for illnesses. They can bless seawater into &lt;a href=\"Imbued%20Tidewater\"&gt;Imbued Tidewater&lt;/a&gt;, which rejuvenates strength and mends wounds. Because &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Silver%20Ore\"&gt;storm silver&lt;/a&gt; is lightweight and resists corrosion, Kul Tirans use it in their ships. Once this sacred material is blessed by a sea priest for use in shipbuilding, it is buried under water for a year.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dapple%20Gray\"&gt;Dapple Gray&lt;/a&gt; is the favored mount of the sea priests.\nThe tidesages worship a being known as the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;. The magical wards &lt;a href=\"Tidemother%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Tidemother's Pride&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tidemother%27s%20Radiance\"&gt;Tidemother's Radiance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tidemother%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Tidemother's Wrath&lt;/a&gt; that guard the Shrine of the Storm were said to be gifts from the sea itself. They long protected Kul Tiran flagships against even the fiercest storms, but since the Tidesages settled in Stormsong Valley they have instead kept the Shrine safe. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; later turned their power against outsiders.\nWhen a tidesage blesses a ship, they recite the following:\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em\"&gt;\nStorm above and tides below, hear us now!\nBreathe strength into our sails, and guard us against the crushing depths!\nLet this vessel be one with the vast ocean, and us with her.\nSea to sea, storm to storm, tide to tide.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn the old days of Boralus, tidesages were not above teaching the irreverent through the use of physical blows. Though most tidesages are robe-wearing casters, there are also some of them wearing heavy armor. Among them are the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Templar\"&gt;Shrine Templar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;-like melee fighters, and the &lt;a href=\"Ironhull%20Apprentice\"&gt;Ironhull Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;s following the &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Ironhull\"&gt;way of the Hull&lt;/a&gt; (see below). In addition to these armored warriors are &lt;a href=\"tideguard\"&gt;tideguard&lt;/a&gt;s."}

They include the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt;. Both the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; thus have a claim to rule the Tideskorn. If female, the ruler is expected or assumed to be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir largest settlement is the city of &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20drake\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;-taming &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;. Those among the Tideskorn who accepted the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; gift and turned &lt;a href=\"felsworn\"&gt;felsworn&lt;/a&gt; became known as Felskorn. They remained the same tribe, and shared the same banner.\nHistory.\nTideskorn Harbor.\nThe Tideskorn earned their name the day the mists took their greatest harbor. Since then, no vrykul loyal to &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; has willingly entered their cursed place. Scorned by the tides that the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; arrived on, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;'s mists consumed &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;their harbor&lt;/a&gt;, maddening the people and causing it to be lost to the &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt;. With this, the jarls of Stormheim were forced to give up the sea. Many of their numbers became Helarjar.\nLegion.\nAt one point, &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;Skovald&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Uldgar\"&gt;Uldgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voldgar\"&gt;Voldgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Agnol\"&gt;Agnol&lt;/a&gt;, killed their father together. Then, they turned on each other. Skovald's blade was the fastest, however, and so he became king.\n&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; approached the vrykul king Skovald with a simple proposition: he could join the Legion and receive ultimate power, or he would see his people destroyed. Dreaming of conquest and glory, Skovald took up the Legion's offer and was set to a single crucial task: claiming the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; from Odyn in the Halls of Valor and deliver it to Gul'dan. Only then could his endless conquest begin.\nAfter becoming Felskorn, Jarl Skovald killed his mother, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bretta\"&gt;Queen Bretta&lt;/a&gt;, and her &lt;a href=\"Defiant%20Queensguard\"&gt;Defiant Queensguard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kingsfall%20Pass\"&gt;Kingsfall Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and became the ruler of all vrykul, the God-King. &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; would later send assassins to kill Skovald's children - whom he had fed with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; - because of a prophecy he did not want to come true.\nDuring the invasion, a raiding party of Tideskorn wielding crafted weapons made from &lt;a href=\"Lumenstone\"&gt;Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Plunderer%20Jurval\"&gt;Plunderer Jurval&lt;/a&gt;, were attacked by troops of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who wanted to collect their weapons.\nAt some point, Gul'dan sent a secret directive to God-King Skovald. In response, Skovald's forces stepped up their attacks. But Skovald was too obsessed with Odyn to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, and he died in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s as he tried to take up the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Many Felskorn would remain unaware of their God-King's demise thus continue to serve the Burning Legion on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sigryn\"&gt;Sigryn&lt;/a&gt;, his daughter, would eventually rise to become God-Queen in turn as was prophesized, but decided to follow in her father's footsteps instead and give in to the fel when she learned that the murder of her family had been orchestrated by the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; Odyn. However, an &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"champion\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; stopped her invasion of the Halls of Valor at the Great Mead Hall, where she planned to exact vengeance on the Keeper. She let go of her hatred and became the rightful God-Queen of the Tideskorn after receiving &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing."}

Since then, no vrykul loyal to &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; has willingly entered that cursed place.\nThe final quest in this area requires players to complete the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, and destroy &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;'s ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Naglfar\"&gt;Naglfar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nAt some point before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, scorned by the tides that the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; arrived on, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;'s mists surrounded Tideskorn Harbor, maddening its citizens and making them violent and savage. This made work in the harbor much more difficult as the fleets' crew preferred to brawl instead of working. As time passed, &lt;a href=\"seagull\"&gt;seagull&lt;/a&gt;s begin to fall dead from the skies, entire schools of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; died with the floating bodies rotting in the shoals, and the fishermen didn't have a good catch. If this wasn't enough, the town's entire stock of food spoiled after the first day of the mists engulfing the town, and people begin to disappear, the air growing stale and the stench of dead fish everywhere. Day by day more people couldn't think clearly and many had ventured into the mists never to be seen again, including the town's leader, &lt;a href=\"Tarben\"&gt;Jarl Tarben&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the entire population of Tideskorn Harbor was taken by the mists, siphoned of life and converted into Helya's own. Since then, the harbor belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt;, and the jarls of Stormheim were forced to give up the sea. It was custom for deceased jarls to be sent out into the sea in a longboat and set the boat ablaze, but after the mists came, the vrykul dare not to as the body may return as a kvaldir.\nWith the help of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Havi\"&gt;Havi&lt;/a&gt; managed to find a lead, Helya's ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Naglfar\"&gt;Naglfar&lt;/a&gt;\". The adventurer was tasked to go aboard the ship and destroy it. After this, the Tideskorn souls were freed to be judged.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20Raiders\"&gt;Bladewind Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Helarjar kvaldir that serve &lt;a href=\"Vigfus%20Bladewind\"&gt;Vigfus Bladewind&lt;/a&gt;, attacked Tideskorn Harbor. They were defeated by the mortal champion of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; to kill Helya's personal champion who had stolen Odyn's &lt;a href=\"Warswords%20of%20the%20Valarjar\"&gt;warswords&lt;/a&gt;. While Vigfus was defeated, survivors are said to have retreated back into &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;."}
