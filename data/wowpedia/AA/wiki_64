Dagnar directs the two death knights to killing &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Zalinor\"&gt;Inquisitor Zalinor&lt;/a&gt;, who carries the keystone that unlocks his shackles. After being freed, he informs Sliver and the player that Margrave has been taken captive and that they will need to rescue him, but Sliver refuses, saying that the death knights are on Niskara to slay a demon, not rescue every failure who couldn't get the job done. Dagnar is shocked at Sliver's response, but agrees to come with them anyway, though he swears to rescue Margrave the first chance he gets. That chance never arrives, as Gorelix kills Margrave when the three knights reach the foot of his citadel, but Dagnar nonetheless assists in the fight against the Fleshripper.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Stonebrow\"&gt;Foreman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greta%20Stonebrow\"&gt;Greta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ingrys%20Stonebrow\"&gt;Ingrys&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jormund%20Stonebrow\"&gt;Jormund Stonebrow&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is notorious for pledging the Dark Iron clan in service to the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20lord\"&gt;elemental lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, who his ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, successfully summoned to the mortal plane. His allegiance to the Firelord led to his eventual downfall when he was killed by forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sent by Magni.\nHe was succeeded by Moira, who rules until their son, &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt;, is of age to take over the leadership of not only the Dark Irons, but of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nBackground.\nEmperor Dagran Thaurissan, a direct descendant of &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, ruled the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; with a combination of charisma, sorcery and iron will. The Emperor ruled his people not from &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt; founded by (and named for) his ancestor, but rather from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;depths&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; near the entrance to Ragnaros's domain, the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor's Dark Irons swarmed the depths of Blackrock Mountain, and have also been seen in the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Even as the leader of his clan, he was, like all Dark Iron dwarves, a servant of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. However, while Thaurissan delighted in the power that Ragnaros had bestowed upon him he bristled at his servitude to the Firelord. When Ragnaros ordered Thaurissan to prepare the Dark Irons for a new war, the emperor was overjoyed. He had long dreamed of conquering the other dwarf clans, not only to rule over them but also to wield their combined power to break free of the Firelord's control.\nThe Emperor kidnapped King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard's&lt;/a&gt; daughter, Princess &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, intending to use her as a hostage of last resort once war began. He believed that Magni would never consider assaulting Blackrock Mountain if it meant putting Moira in harm's way. Thaurissan found himself falling in love with Moira; she had a sharp wit and strong will, and was not intimidated in the slightest by her predicament. The two dwarves began to speak at length about their hopes for the future, and Thaurissan confided in Moira that he wanted to free his people from enslavement and was willing to do anything to achieve that. Moira, too, soon fell in love with him because he treated her with the respect due her position, and even kindness and affection. She became pregnant with his child, who is half Bronzebeard dwarf and half Dark Iron dwarf, and the heir to both thrones of &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge\"&gt;Shadowforge&lt;/a&gt; and Ironforge.\nDagran wielded the legendary hammer &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, but not by legitimate means. The hammer's hereditary owner, &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; was captured and imprisoned by the Dark Irons, his weapon claimed by Dagran.\nHe also sent his emissaries and agents to the gnomish capital of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, apparently in an effort to back the self-proclaimed ruler of Gnomeregan, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; sent a team to kill Emperor Thaurissan, and retrieve the previously thought to be ensorcelled Moira back to Ironforge. Yet Moira refused to come home and announced that she was pregnant, and that the death of her husband has left a terrible, fiery rage within her heart.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Emperor Dagran Thaurissan rules alongside Princess Moira of the rival Bronzebeard clan. Debate rages over whether the emperor ensorcelled his bride or she willingly joined him. Whatever the truth, Thaurissan's continued presence bodes ill for the future of his clan. So long as he lives, the Dark Irons will remain pawns of Ragnaros, and a dire threat to kingdoms throughout Azeroth.\"\nIn World of Warcraft.\nEmperor Dagran Thaurissan is the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.

At low levels it was recommend that you cleared the room before engaging the boss, though high levels could easily take care of them.\nIn the Cataclysm.\nEven though Dagran is deceased in lore, and all dungeons quests were revised in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and so was the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Dagran Thaurissan is still alive, and along with his wife are still the final boss of the instance (since the dungeon wasn't updated story-wise as was the Shadowfang Keep).

Anduin guessed that the prince was six or seven years old. When the trio reached &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, Dagran started reading the ritual words that had turned Magni into diamond. Moments later, a guard informed Moira and Anduin that Magni had returned to Ironforge and needed to see them in the Hall of Explorers. Although Dagran protested that he wanted to see his grandfather, Moira asked &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; to take care of the prince while she and Anduin met with the Speaker. However, once the conversation with Magni was over, Moira asked him to stay in the city a little longer so he could meet his grandson.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Dagran and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt;. At some point during the party, he chatted amicably with &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; under a tree, with whom he developed a friendship, and examined a beautiful ceremonial dagger that the paladin had worn at the wedding. Moira expressed to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; that she was glad Arator was befriending him as Dagran didn't have many friends growing up.\nAppearance.\nIn-game, Dagran uses a baby dwarf model with pale skin, short red hair, big eyebrows, and blue eyes.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", he is a young child with skin described as an unusual but warm shade of gray.

Like all other forest trolls, the Witherbarks allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, a famous troll hero from the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde was soundly defeated, Zul'jin disappeared, and the forest trolls abandoned their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish allies.\nThe Witherbark trolls are known to be sworn enemies of the Stromgarde.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Witherbarks living in the Hinterlands settled several places, including the &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27watha\"&gt;Hiri'watha&lt;/a&gt; village, the &lt;a href=\"Zun%27watha\"&gt;Zun'watha&lt;/a&gt; ruins, and the temple of &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually happened across the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt;s and launched many attacks against the small tribe. The &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; also became a noticeable threat against the troll tribe.\nThe Witherbarks were once allied with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, but they betrayed him, and the Darkspear tribe unleashed the fury of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; and young &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s upon them.\nThe Witherbarks living in the Arathi Highlands grudgingly allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in order to wipe out the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces who have constructed the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7.0\"&gt;Hakkar was brought back in Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, the Witherbarks sent &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20Speaker%20%28Zul%27Gurub%29\"&gt;Witherbark Speaker&lt;/a&gt;, as an ambassador for their tribe, in order to possibly ally themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Witherbark trolls have vanished from the Hinterlands, it's unknown if they were driven off or simply killed. They still remain in the Arathi Highlands. &lt;a href=\"Zul%27arek%20Hatefowler\"&gt;Zul'arek Hatefowler&lt;/a&gt; occasionally appears among the old Zun'watha ruins which have since been abandoned. The Hiri'watha village was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and turned into a research station, while Shadra'Alor temple was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; trolls.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde was taken by &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and the Witherbarks led by &lt;a href=\"Ojin%27ba\"&gt;Ojin'ba&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city and holed up in the mage district.

The area has far more trolls, a denser forest surrounding it, more huts have been added and its architecture has been updated.\n&lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20Speaker\"&gt;Witherbark Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.

Withered are considered beyond redemption and there is no cure yet to their state. They are not only consumed by a burning thirst for the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; but are tormented by their former memories, truly a fate worse than death. One of the final symptoms just before turning is that the nightfallen will lose their eyesight. It is surprising that the withered don't try to eat their own clothing when it contains innate power.\nSome withered in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; capture &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blue%20whelp\"&gt;whelplings&lt;/a&gt;, knock them unconscious, and drink their &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough they are physically similar to the &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, they are fundamentally different. The transformation into wretched is due to over-indulgence and reckless abuse of arcane magic, whereas withered are a result of withdrawal from the energies of the Nightwell.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, withered that joined &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; were trained and made &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-resistant."}

Your mission is to lead a squad of withered into a special instance of &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt; to defeat monsters and retrieve chests which upgrade your army. The primary reason to run the scenario is to gain reputation with the Nightfallen, although you can gain &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Power\"&gt;Artifact Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Order%20Resources\"&gt;Order Resources&lt;/a&gt; and other things. The scenario is on a 3-day lockout, much like the now-removed &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; 20-man raid.\nOverview.\nThe first time you get the quest you are given a team of 8 withered which is not enough to accomplish very much. Fortunately a few of the withered you encounter are non-hostile and can be added to your army. If you play it right you can retrieve a pair of 5-minion chests. After you complete the initial run you unlock the repeatable version of the instance where you can pay &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Mana\"&gt;Ancient Mana&lt;/a&gt; to determine the size of your starting army. You probably want to delay starting the scenario until you have enough ancient mana to take the maximum army (limited by your ancient mana cap which is upgraded by completing certain campaign quests and by using certain single-use items in Suramar).\nChests.\nThere are three varieties of chest placed throughout the scenario which contain loot or items that upgrade your army:\nThe large and medium chests can be opened when you are finished with the scenario, which happens:\nThe medium and large chests can only be collected once per character and contain upgrades for your army that take effect the next time you go into the scenario.\nThere is also one larger reward chest at the end of the scenario with your reward for completing the scenario. It contains reputation tokens worth up to 425 reputation (based on your score from defeating monsters inside the scenario). You can also get &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Power\"&gt;Artifact Power&lt;/a&gt; and toys from this chest.\nLoot.\nSmall chests:\nMedium chests:\nLarge chests:\nFinal chest:\nLua Scripts.\nThe following Lua script can be used with an addon like ArbitraryCommands to check which chest rewards you have yet to collect.\n for q,i in pairs({[\"Petrified Silkweave\"]=43149,\n [\"Berserking Helm of Ondry'el\"]=43071,\n [\"Traveler's Banking Chest\"]=43140,\n [\"Soothing Leystone Shard\"]=43111,\n [\"Spellmask of Azsylla\"]=43146,\n [\"Ancient Mana Basin\"]=43144,\n [\"Lenses of Spellseer Dellian\"]=43134,\n [\"Lens of Qin'dera\"]=43148,\n [\"Spellmask of Azsylla\"]=43128,\n [\"Disc of the Starcaller\"]=43135,\n [\"Leyline Broodling\"]=43141,\n [\"Berserking Helm of Taenna\"]=43145,\n [\"Box of Calming Whispers\"]=43120,\n [\"Treemender's Beacon\"]=43143,\n [\"Manafused Fal'dorei Egg Sac\"]=43142}) do\n print(q, IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(i))\n end"}

{"id": "127627", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127627", "title": "Withered creature", "text": "Withered creatures are twisted, withered husks of once-mortal creatures now horribly transformed into malicious undead servants, bolstered by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. They retain their intelligence, their special abilities, and sometimes (and most disturbingly) their memories.\nSome are maddened creatures, longing for their old lives but forever barred from that path, taking out their resentment on the living. Others wallow in despair, repulsed by their forms but forced to bear them, waiting patiently and hopelessly for the sweet release of destruction. Still others revel in their new powers, embracing their new unlives with an insane fervor. The only constant among the withered is that none of them remains unchanged by the touch of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Scourge created the first withered creatures, other types of withered creatures have since come into existence. In some cases, those who die violent deaths at the hands of undead rise spontaneously as withered creatures. Particularly evil beings sometimes find themselves cursed after death, unable to rest quiet in the grave. Greedy folk who cling to life with both hands sometimes attain a withered state through sheer force of will. Necromancers who traffic with the forces of life and death can rise as withered creatures after death, and some seek out the transformation deliberately.\nNo two withered creatures look exactly alike. Most retain their mortal forms, yet with a dry, dead look about them, as if they were empty husks. Some lose their flesh entirely, remaining as animated skeletons. Others rot continually, shedding slick white flesh and writhing maggots in their wake, but somehow never losing mass. Most bear glowing eyes, usually yellow, red, or green, and certain similar abilities.\nAny dead creature that is brought back through the use of necromancy or any creature brought close to death by a member of the Scourge, becomes withered. This possibility reflects the plague\u2019s effects on non-humanoid beings. The plague is not only effective on humanoids; it also infects plants and animals. In theory, there could be some withered &lt;a href=\"shambling%20mound\"&gt;shambling mound&lt;/a&gt;s or other vegetative creatures in existence, as well. Becoming a member of the withered allows the creature to keep its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities along with its intellect, although the guiding intellect of that creature is now malevolent and loses all ties with any past life. Even if the animal was once benevolent and with good intentions, it loses all thoughts of morality and ethics once it has been revived with the plague. Sometimes these creatures are fleshly zombies; other times, they are animate without flesh, becoming &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20creature\"&gt;skeletal creature&lt;/a&gt;s with magical abilities to maintain their own bodies despite the plague's physical ravages. Blue dragons that become &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s are withered.\nThey are always or usually &lt;a href=\"evil\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;."}

No Kirin Tor sanctioned female wizards appeared to have existed prior to 800 years ago, when &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Even in the recent past, it has been difficult for women to become wizards \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; faced considerable obstacles in her ambition to be more than a mere sorceress. Fortunately for her, she was able to convince &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; to care more for her magical talent than her gender, and she became a fully qualified wizard in record time.\nRenegade wizards.\nThough most contemporary &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s bow to the sovereignty of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, there are a great many who choose to delve into the secrets of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; by themselves. Considered to be non-sanctioned renegades by the Kirin Tor, these &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;rogue mages&lt;/a&gt; strive to expand their knowledge of magic and spellcraft beyond the constraints of what most other wizards believe to be safe or morally acceptable.\nIn the RPG.\nWizards are &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spellcasters who have undertaken intensive study of magic in places such as the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or the Academies of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. They do not channel arcane power, but instead use their vast knowledge of otherworldly forces to harness the energies to their will.\nWizards come from any races. A night elf who takes this class is stripped of her racial heritage and effectively and physically transforms into a high elf over time. When it starts it is a painful and irreversible process that only takes a week. Orcs and tauren are unlikely to take this class, since they lack wizards available to train anyone and have a bias against arcane spellcasting to begin with."}

With &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1.5\"&gt;patch 8.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, the tower's interior was completely revamped to house the Stormwind Portal Room, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of Stormwind and their allies maintain &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s to a number of different areas on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and that had previously been scattered throughout the capital, while portals to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; have recently been implemented. Though the personnel working here are generally affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, decorations such as the insignia at its entrance suggest the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; helped with the remodeling. The area is patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Golem%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;arcane golems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Guardian\"&gt;summoned water elementals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe kingdom's magi are trained here and study the arts of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. Their society of mages has a task to ensure the safety of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and its lands, they wage a \"secret war\" into the \"invisible world\", notably by investigating and dealing with any magical anomalies and creatures threatening the realm and its inhabitants. Inside the Wizard's Sanctum, &lt;a href=\"Maginor%20Dumas\"&gt;Maginor Dumas&lt;/a&gt; is known to be one of Stormwind's most renowned mages, and met there promising apprentice mages sent by other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; mage masters. &lt;a href=\"High%20Sorcerer%20Andromath\"&gt;High Sorcerer Andromath&lt;/a&gt; is also present, and is considered as one of the finest and most powerful &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s that was not locked away in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after its &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside of the Sanctum, &lt;a href=\"Lisan%20Pierce\"&gt;Lisan Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Janey%20Anship\"&gt;Janey Anship&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Suzanne\"&gt;Suzanne&lt;/a&gt; can be found discussing in great and confusing detail about topics such as portals and polarity \u2014 however, if one listens closely, it is revealed that they are merely trying to develop a love potion for one of the group's crushes. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Nakada\"&gt;Archmage Nakada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Linda\"&gt;Linda&lt;/a&gt; are also conducting a class for a crew of \"Junior Mages\".\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLong ago, three mages studied in the tower until one of them, &lt;a href=\"Morganth\"&gt;Morganth&lt;/a&gt;, fell to the dark arts. He was urged to turn away from that evil magic, but he could not resist, and was banished. Morganth took with him a powerful book \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Ur%27s%20Treatise%20on%20Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt;, though he failed to break the seals placed on it by the mages of Stormwind. A &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; mage was later sent to defeat him and bring back the magic book. To reward them for their actions, the mages of the Wizard's Sanctum contacted &lt;a href=\"Wynne%20Larson\"&gt;Wynne Larson&lt;/a&gt; to design a robe suiting an adept mage.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels, the mages of the Wizard's Sanctum struggled to determine the effects these changes had caused, and some of them feared the worst. When the flow of magic in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; was somehow altered, they sent a mage hero to &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Lake\"&gt;Mirror Lake&lt;/a&gt;, in order to test its water for magical properties before those who drank from it would be adversely affected. Another case was a disturbance in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Recluse\"&gt;Blue Recluse&lt;/a&gt; tavern, where a &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; rift has formed, and from which came &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Spawn\"&gt;invisible creatures&lt;/a&gt;. A mage hero was then sent to subdue them in containment coffers, in order to study and determine the reason behind their arrival in the physical world.\nAt the same time, the mages of Stormwind were conducting researches at &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, research vital to their understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which required nearly constant supplies.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; was the brighter district in the capital enveloped by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;'s mist, as its mages were constantly casting spells to repel the invaders.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evacuation%20Portal\"&gt;evacuation portals&lt;/a&gt; were placed in the Wizard's Sanctum, and when an &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; invasion was announced by the city guards, many &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Citizen%20%28Elemental%20Unrest%29\"&gt;Stormwind citizens&lt;/a&gt; evacuated through them. In the other districts, a few &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Mage\"&gt;Stormwind City mages&lt;/a&gt; were in charge of creating other portals to evacuate the rest of the population out of the capital.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the accomplishments of a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; hero reached &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who later commissioned the royal enchanter &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Cordell\"&gt;Lucan Cordell&lt;/a&gt; to create a special weapon for them. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Maginor%20Dumas\"&gt;Maginor Dumas&lt;/a&gt; summoned the adventurer in the Wizard's Sanctum and sent them to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, in order to obtain all the materials required. He later met them again in the tower, this time to find the grimoire of &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%20Loregrain\"&gt;Pyromancer Loregrain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, in order to devise counterspells and other ways of dampening the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s used by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron forces&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nElegy.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Wizard's Sanctum served as an evacuation point, where &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Malin\"&gt;Archmage Malin&lt;/a&gt; and the Stormwind mages opened portals for the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; came into the mage tower to learn what happened in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. For days the magi couldn't sleep, as they were keeping the portals open, and subsisted on conjured food and drink with the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s' continual blessings. Faced with the increasingly heavy flood of confused and frightened refugees, the tower had to be evacuated by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt; to allow the mages enough space to bring in more civilians. However, when &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was set on fire by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the smoke and ashes that entered the tower obliged all the mages to cease their portals.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;corrupted version of Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; and his followers of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; turned the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; summoning location. In order to end the vision, the Alliance heroes had to close all the portals and defeat the corrupted Umbric in the Wizard's Sanctum.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; brought by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; were allowed in the capital by &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Spymaster Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;. One of the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; visited the Wizard's Sanctum, recognizing the &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of its portals like the one of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt; was sent disguised as one of the mage apprentices to observe them.\nAccess to the tower.\nFor &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s in training, access to the &lt;a href=\"mage%20trainer\"&gt;mage trainer&lt;/a&gt;s is gained by going up the ramp and climbing to the highest part of the tower and then passing through the portal there.\nAll Alliance &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s can learn to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; directly into the Wizard's Sanctum at level 21, and &lt;a href=\"portal%20%28spell%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; other players there at level 24. They can also reach the Sanctum by using teleport items such as &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Coordination\"&gt;Cloak of Coordination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrap%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Wrap of Unity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvailable portals.\nDragonflight.\nNote: At the entrance to the tower there is an &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold%20Mage\"&gt;Honor Hold Mage&lt;/a&gt; that may take you to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, if eligible. An &lt;a href=\"Vanguard%20Battlemage\"&gt;Vanguard Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Emissary\"&gt;Kirin Tor Emissary&lt;/a&gt; are also present, if eligible, they indicate to take the portals to &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; upstairs. Additional portals to \"Cataclysm\" specific areas are available in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Portals for allied race starting areas are still in front of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe vine-covered tower sits to the west of the city, and it also contains the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Arcane%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Arcane Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;."}

It includes &lt;a href=\"Dorothee\"&gt;Dorothee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roar\"&gt;Roar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strawman\"&gt;Strawman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tinhead\"&gt;Tinhead&lt;/a&gt;, Dorothee's summoned dog &lt;a href=\"Tito\"&gt;Tito&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Crone\"&gt;The Crone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe actors in this encounter can be found backstage in &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe encounter and its denizens are a tribute to \"\".\nOverview.\nHere's an overview of the mobs encountered in this fight:\nThe first four bosses are upstage when the event starts and become active one after the other quite quickly. The activation sequence is:\nAfter these four are all dead, The Crone will appear. Killing The Crone successfully ends the event.\nStrategy.\nKill order.\nThe raid needs to agree on a kill sequence. All mobs (exc. Dorothee) can be controlled, depending on player skill and classes available some may be more dangerous than others. One accepted sequence is to deal with the mobs in the order in which they activate. Dorothee is generally regarded to be the most dangerous, because she cannot be tanked. Roar is more dangerous than Strawman because of his fear, and Tinhead is the least dangerous because after some time he moves so slowly that he can be easily kited.\nTanking.\nTinhead is the only mob which really must be tanked. On all others, tanking is optional, but helps to avoid trouble if they break control. The main tank should be on Tinhead exclusively, a second tank should help on Roar, and maybe taunt Strawman now and then. Tanking Dorothee is pointless. Tito can and should be tanked.\nDorothee.\nThere's not much to say about her other than just nuke her fast. Pay attention not to kill &lt;a href=\"Tito\"&gt;Tito&lt;/a&gt; while she's still up, or else she will enrage. Tito should be killed right after she's down. Waterbolt cannot be interrupted, and because she has no aggro table, it targets random people while she's alive.\nRoar.\nRoar is rather cowardly, and susceptible to &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scare%20Beast\"&gt;Scare Beast&lt;/a&gt;. However, often he will run into one of the two doors and go out of line of sight making it somewhat difficult to keep him constantly feared. Be prepared for many early breaks and resists, as he seems to do this quite often. One Warlock should still be enough to control him, an off-tank on Roar makes the Warlocks job much easier. Despite being a &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt; he is not susceptible to &lt;a href=\"hibernate\"&gt;hibernate&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrawman.\nWhen he is struck by fire damage abilities, there is a very high chance that he will be disoriented for 6 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Pain\"&gt;Searing Pain&lt;/a&gt; are excellent abilities to proc this debuff. A fire mage would be the best class to deal with this add, but any mage or warlock (with his imp) will do OK too, even a Shaman's &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Totem\"&gt;Searing Totem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;Fire Elemental (shaman ability)&lt;/a&gt; could do the job in an emergency. A wand also works if it deals fire damage. The off-tank on Roar should taunt Strawman now and then. If your raid is low on fire damage, or Strawman's disorient is not proccing enough to keep him controlled he can be killed first. He goes down much faster than Dorothee, and a pair of good healers can easily heal through Dorothee's damage while the raid takes down Strawman.\nTinhead.\nTinhead needs to be tanked by the main tank due to the rather high amount of damage he inflicts. As the encounter progresses, he begins to rust (as indicated through an announcement) and slows down. After a while, he slows down a great deal and can be effectively kited by the main tank. At this point the tank should be taking minimal damage as he can run around without being struck.\nNOTE: A popular misconception is that Tinhead's rust event is initiated by ice spells. This is not the case. The rust event is simply a timed event and cannot be influenced.\nThe Crone.\nAfter all 4 major characters have died, The Crone spawns. She has no vulnerabilities, so the MT should pick her up immediately. She spawns cyclones that will knock raid members straight up into the air, dealing a significant (but not fatal) amount of damage; HoT's can keep the cycloned victims alive. When you land, you will take fall damage as well. They are avoidable, and any slow fall ability will also negate fall damage. Cyclone does not stun, so instant cast spells can be used in midair. The cyclones move slowly around the room in a group, and can cross the center of the stage, so it is unsafe to move strictly clockwise or counter-clockwise. Someone should be continuously calling out the cyclones position and direction so everyone can adjust. The Crone does not have a lot of HP; this phase is much easier than the first.\nNOTE: Patch 2.1 removed damage done by cyclones. Expected falling damage is 1500-3000 depending on max health.\nKnown Bugs.\nThis encounter, unfortunately, appears to have a number of bugs. Players who have encountered these bugs have not had much success, if any, getting the encounter to reset. Reports say the encounter can't be reset, but it can be reset if you get out of the room at the bottom of the stage.\nIf you kill Dorothee too fast she will bug the other people in the event and not summon them. The people she didn't call to help her will stand around waiting for their cue from Dorothee and the event will never finish.\nAs of June 4. 2007, we encountered the first and the third bug. We left the instance for 30 minutes, had to clear up to the opera again, and got Wizard of Oz again, this time it ran bug-free.\nThe first bug may result in trapping the raid on stage - after all available bosses are down, the door isn't opened and there seems to be no way out. To avoid using mage portal or hearthstone, ranged DPS can shoot some of mobs in the audience to aggro them and wipe the raid.\nIt can also bug the event if any player jumps off the stage to reset the fight (it's possible if you know the jump trick). The only way to fix this problem is to 'Soft Reset' the instance by all players leaving the instance and waiting 30mins for it to reset. This will also reset the trash up to opera event."}

The series revolves around the misadventures of Lolcrusader (pictured above) and his party of (sometimes) loyal companions who are bound by an uneasy truce, and a desire to bring peace to the server of Moon Guard (Or secure their place as \"Awesome Kings\").\nCharacters.\nLolcrusader.\nPerhaps the wackiest of the group is the flamboyant, sometimes idiotic Level 1 Warrior known as Lolcrusader (Pictured Above). He was drawn into the game by a couple of friends who played it at school, later, getting addicted to the so-called \"Extreme-ness\", or so he was told by the game store clerk. Even though he is a low-leveled character, he strangely enough escapes almost inexorable death with little effort.\nNexus-Prince Haramad.\nThe most intelligent member of the party, he is infatuated with George. Usually shows kindness to most characters in the series, and has a tendency to intervene in acts that would danger his party, or those around him. He could be described as maternal, and doesn't mind even the most unfavorable members of the party. He also leads the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeorge.\nThe hard-ass tank, and sometimes, comic relief of the party, George could be described as loyal to his friends, and perhaps, impulsive (Especially with his prank on the Taco Bell Girl). He is adorned in heavy Field Marshal gear, and wields a Grand Marshal's Blade. He was recruited subtly for the adventure by Private Gummy and the Captain.\nPrivate Gummy.\nLike Haramad, Gummy is in love with George. He often daydreams about George singing to him in the Gurubashi Arena. He is a member of the Stormwind Knights, and is currently battling in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; on the front alongside Captain Herbert.\nCaptain Herbert.\nCaptain of a small group of Stormwind Knights, Herbert is orchestrating the formation of the Fellowship. He is a fierce fighter, and long-time enemy of &lt;GM&gt;Beef. He is often seen yelling at Private Gummy for a number of reasons.\nTero.\nThe self-proclaimed \"Raid King of Moon Guard\", he claims to have killed \"Thousands of Horde with his Bare Hands\". Perhaps the most powerful party member, he somehow has gained God-like powers, including the ability to dual-wield double &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;s. He is the king of \"The End of the WoWniverse\", also known as \"Teroland\", \"Terocountry\", or \"Tero's Domain\".\nUncle Albert.\nOne of the first characters introduced in WoWBeef, Uncle Albert welcomes Lolcrusader into Azeroth, telling him why Humans could not be hunters (When Emily Elizabeth tried, Cliford only grew into a Raidboss). He seems to have unearthly powers, able to resurrect himself after gruesome deaths. However, this could just be a running gag.\n&lt;GM&gt;Beef.\n\u00aba href=\"GM\"&gt;GM&lt;/a\u00bbBeef is a cruel, merciless Game Master of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; who kills any unfavorable subjects without pity or mercy. He wishes to establish a totalitarian rule over &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, his main goal, destroying &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; to deprive players of \"idiocy\".\nMinor Characters.\nTaco Bell Girl.\nTaco Bell Girl is the clerk in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s Taco Bell. She is a bubbly teenager who spends her life selling fast food.\nEdwin VanCleef (Post Plastic-Surgery).\n&lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; was the Chief Architect who worked on the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since he fell into depression, he has continued to change his face until it no longer looks human.\nThe Spicy Defias.\nThe servants of Edwin VanCleef, the Spicy Defias are loin-cloth adorned thieves who have little regard for those who wear regular pants.\nTrivia.\nMost characters in the series are voiced by Aphel, who also produces the series, and additionally, composes the music.\nThe Clifford joke in Episode 1 was poking fun at Blizzard's tendencies to make all of their major Lore characters go insane, and become instance bosses.\nImogen Heap's Hide and Seek is featured in the series each time Uncle Albert is shot. This is a parody of SNL's \"Dear Sister\".\n\"Desert Dawn\" by the indie band, String Cheese Incident, is the main theme of the series."}

Added to that, the time it takes to test each change is fairly long.\nWoWBench enables AddOn developers to test most of their functionality offline, in a controlled environment where they can fire game events at their own leisure, with content that they choose. \nIt also features a \"built-in commandline debugger\" with stack backtraces and capability to look at global as well as local variables at various stack depths, that allows you to run your own Lua code while examining the breakpoint or error. Of course, anyone with a \"&lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; debugger\" can utilize those for much more fine-grained debugging while running their AddOn under WoWBench, something which is not possible while running it inside the actual game.\nWoWBench does not have an actual graphical user interface (at least, not yet).

At the end of world.toc, WoWBench has finished defining everything built-in. All that remains to be loaded after that point is FrameXML and AddOns.\nIf you want to modify something \"after\" FrameXML has loaded, the best way is probably to create a new \"AddOn\" (new directory with .toc and everything) that contains your \"myhacks.lua\", and list that addon as the first one on the command line.\nOf course just flat out modifying what's already there works too, but you might end up regretting it when you download a new copy of WoWBench.\nUsing command-line .txt files to temporarily load hacks.\nAs of v1.11.0.a4, WoWBench will accept .txt file names on the command line. These files will parse just like anything you enter on the command line.\nExample commandline script to add extensions and tweak things:\n dofile(\"myhacks.lua\");\n dofile(\"hacks/someotherhacks.lua\");\n some_var = some_value;\n say Bob Oh, schnapps!\nYou'd just load this with something like:\nWe want your hacks, too!\nIf there's even a remote chance that your local hacks can be useful to anyone else, we'll gladly accept them!

Methods that are not implemented, but have not yet caused problems for anyone, call codice_2, which causes an assert. \nIf any of these methods cause problems for you, but you judge that it is not important for them to be emulated in any way, just replace \"_notimplemented\" with \"_ignore_notimplemented\". Do not simply remove the call; it is useful to be able to modify _ignore_notimplemented() to spot problems in the future."}

If an AddOn depends on something else, you have to make sure to load it yourself.\nAddOns will be loaded from the WoW directory that you specified in codice_9.\nThe WoWBench prompt.\nAt a glance, these are things that WoWBench can do:\nHow to interact with things.\nInteracting with the game world is a bit rough but fairly straightforward. The only actual WoWBench-specific emulation is mouse movements and \"looking\" at frames (and the game world around you).\nLooking at the world.\n Cmd&gt; look\n Looking at World:\n 1: World World\n 2: Player Charles\n 3: NPC Murloc Warrior\n 4: Object Mailbox\n 5: Object Signpost\n 6: Player Alice\n 7: Player Mikk\n 8: NPC Northshire Worker\n 9: Player Bob\n You can now use $1--$9 in command line expressions.\n Hint: Use 'look $1' to re-examine this object.\nThese are NPCs and objects that you can interact with via the WoW APIs, e.g. &lt;a href=\"API%20TargetUnit\"&gt;API TargetUnit&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nThe only other interaction possible from the command line is simulating mousing over things, and clicking them.\nInteracting with units and objects.\n cmd&gt; mouse Signpost\n You read the signpost. It says:\n Welcome to WoWBench v1.10.2.a3\n It is dark and you are in a maze of hairy lua scripts, all alike but subtly different.\n You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nThis just a simple codice_16 trigger in world.xml, in codice_17, which demonstrates that you can more or less define the world to behave exactly the way you like it to. A more meaningful implementation of OnEnter in objects is probably to trigger the GameTooltip object to show:\n cmd&gt; mouse Bob\n Show: GameTooltip GameTooltip\nWoWBench will tell you about frames being shown or hidden after startup. In this case, mousing over Bob triggered a GameTooltip object named \"GameTooltip\" (you'll recognize this from how it actually works in-game) to show. And we can even look at the tooltip!\nLooking at frames.\nContinuing from the past example where we \"moused\" over Bob, we can proceed to look at the tooltip frame that popped up:\n cmd&gt; look gametooltip\n Looking at gametooltip:\n 1: GameTooltip GameTooltip\n 2: FontString [Level 60 WARRIOR] GameTooltipTextLeft2\n 3: FontString [Bob] GameTooltipTextLeft1\n (+60 hidden frames not shown)\n You can now use $1--$3 in command line expressions.\n Hint: Use 'look $1' to re-examine this object.\nYou'll notice that WoWBench is case insensitive about findings frames. It will continue to be so until it clashes with something important (to Lua itself, \"GameTooltip\" and \"gametooltip\" are two entirely different variables).\nIn this case, we are being told that we're looking at a top frame called \"GameTooltip\", which is a GameTooltip object.\nIt has two visible children, 2 fontstrings, containing \"Bob\" and \"Level 60 WARRIOR\". They're out of order since the \"look\" command has no idea about what it actually would look like on-screen, but the object names to the right should clue you in as to the order they'd be shown in on-screen. (Also, the actual tooltip text is totally different from the in-game text. It's the game engine itself that decides what these tooltips should look like, so it's up to you to modify it to emulate WoW better!)\nTo see \"everything\" on-screen (well, nearly), you can codice_18, but \"that\" dump, we're not going to show here :-)\nMore commands.\nFiring events.\nYou can fire any of the game events with the fire command. See the &lt;a href=\"events%20%28API%29\"&gt;full list of events&lt;/a&gt;, or the list of what is actually registered:\n Cmd&gt; fire\n Registered events:\n ACTIONBAR_HIDEGRID - 73 frames\n ACTIONBAR_PAGE_CHANGED - 74 frames\n ACTIONBAR_SHOWGRID - 73 frames\n AUTOFOLLOW_END - 1 frames\n BAG_CLOSED - 12 frames\nTo actually fire an event, simply enter its name and, optionally, parameters:\n Cmd&gt; fire DUEL_REQUESTED Alice\n Firing DUEL_REQUESTED\n Show: Frame StaticPopup1\n Processed by 1 frames \n cmd&gt; look StaticPopup1\n Looking at StaticPopup1:\n 1: Frame StaticPopup1\n 2: FontString [Alice has challenged you to a duel.] StaticPopup1Text\n 3: Button [Accept] StaticPopup1Button1\n 4: Button [Decline] StaticPopup1Button2\nIf you need to provide more complex arguments, you can call the underlying function directly:\n cmd&gt; fire(\"DUEL_REQUESTED\", \"Alice\");\nLogging in multiple players.\nWoWBench allows you to log in multiple players.

Our website does not only allow you to view the prices on a single server, but also the prices on all servers together in a single list. This is especially useful to make profit by buying items at the cheapest rates possible and selling them again for a much higher price on another realm. Or perhaps you're trying to complete your pet, mount, recipe or tabard collection, but have difficulties doing so on your own realm? Some valuable items may be very scarce or overpriced on lower populated realms. WoW Scan offers you a helping hand, though a character or guild bank transfer will be needed in most cases. Please visit our transfer guide to find out more.\nHow is the data on the website obtained?\nWoW Scan makes excessive use of data provided by Blizzard through their official Web API. Auction House data is fetched by our website and saved into a cache which updates every few hours.\nAre the item search results updated realtime?\nUnfortunately it is not possible to update search results realtime. This is due to Blizzard only allowing a set amount of data requests per day. Currently the data is refreshed approximately every three hours, but we're communicating with Blizzard to allow additional requests per day. We hope to have the data update every hour in the very near future.\nIs the website free to use?\nYes, WoW Scan is absolutely free to use and it will always be.\nCan I create a user account on this website?\nWoW Scan has its mind set on ease of access and therefore we currently do not offer the option to create an account on our website. However, we might allow user accounts to be created in the future when additional features are being released.\nI like WoW Scan! Can I help?\nThank you for showing interest in our website. The development team of wowscan.com does not need any help at this time. However, you can contribute to our website in various other ways; we appreciate feedback and suggestions and we will improve the website and its features based on constructive user feedback.

In 2007 the wiki joined and transferred legal rights for the \"wowwiki.com\" domain. Three years later, Wikia implemented visual interface changes across its platform that broke some of WoWWiki's functionality and was poorly received by some of WoWWiki's community. As a result, a cohort of non-employee admins and active users decided to leave Wikia and forked the wiki project to Wowpedia in October 2010.\nIn May 2020, the decision was made to close WoWWiki and encourage its users to migrate to Wowpedia.\nHistory.\nWowpedia was created by duplicating the wowwiki.com database as of 18-20 October 2010, including edit histories and user pages. Thus at the launch of Wowpedia.org, the two wikis had identical content.\nFrom 2010 until 2020, WoWWiki continued to operate albeit with a slower pace of contributions than its pre-fork state. Individual editors continued changing the two wikis independent of the other. Changes were not automatically reflected in the other wiki, although some editors participating in both wikis concurrent or mirror changes from one to the other. As part of the CC-BY-SA license used by both Wowpedia and WoWWiki, copying content between the two sites remained permitted so long as proper attribution was given.\nIn 2019, after parent organizations (owner of Wikia) and (owner of Gamepedia) had joined through a corporate merger, discussion began at WoWWiki toward possibly reuniting the two communities. Concerns initially arose about the following topics:\nBeginning in February 2020, a vote by five former and current members of WoWWiki concluded the two communities should indeed reunite using Gamepedia/Wowpedia infrastructure. On 12 May 2020, WoWWiki locked itself to further editing. Although prior content remained in a read-only state, Fandom employee Mira Laime published announcements inviting users to Wowpedia and announcing the closure:"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/8717943, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle.\nThere, on the horizon to the Northwest, do you see it? Daggers of lightning spear through clusters of dark clouds filling the air with electricity you can feel crackling against your skin. There's a sense of foreboding that clings, and something else . . . .\nAct I: The Premise.\nLet me tell you a tale. To set the scene, Rise of the Thunder King: &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.2\"&gt;Patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt; is live and we're a week into the new content. It's a typical afternoon and as I fire up my computer, I can feel relaxation set in as my mind ponders the many things I hope to accomplish in game.\nAct II: Adventure is Not a Four Letter Word.\nI'm itching to head to the Isle of Thunder, but I know I have time to weave in a few other day to day &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s and tasks. Being a farming nut I have some crops I want to tend to first!\nThe &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; has always felt like a place of such great harmony. My kinship with The &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt; of the Valley was quickly forged the very first time I travelled through the area, and I quickly worked toward becoming &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt; with the faction. Being Exalted with The Tillers and having all four plots unlocked, I was able to purchase the farm, and I'm happy I get to call this place home (not to mention set my Hearthstone here!).\nRight, first thing's first: It's time to till! The crops I planted yesterday are ready for harvest, and I want to make sure I plant some more today before heading out. With the patch you can now take work orders for various factions, allowing you to gain rep just by growing crops! I begin plowing my field, and much to my delight with each pass of the plow the &lt;a href=\"Squatting%20Virmen\"&gt;Squatting Virmen&lt;/a&gt; are knocked out of their &lt;a href=\"Occupied%20Soil\"&gt;Occupied Soil&lt;/a&gt;, stunned and damaged. Huzzah! This is the point where I realize I'm doing a silly happy dance and force myself to stop out of embarrassment. To no one's surprise, &lt;a href=\"Luna\"&gt;Luna&lt;/a&gt; gazes at me suspiciously while &lt;a href=\"Shaggy\"&gt;Shaggy&lt;/a&gt; just snorts and gnaws on his cud.\nAfter quickly planting what's left of my seeds and clearing away obstacles from my growing plants, I hop onto my &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Pandaren%20Kite\"&gt;Jade Pandaren Kite&lt;/a&gt; and make my way to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. The portal to the new island is near the Shado-Pan garrison, and since I still want a &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt; of my very own, it's time to exact some revenge for the Watchers on the Wall! With &lt;a href=\"Tenwu%20of%20the%20Red%20Smoke\"&gt;Tenwu of the Red Smoke&lt;/a&gt; at my side and our stealth giving us the edge, we swiftly work through the &lt;a href=\"Sra%27thik\"&gt;Sra'thik&lt;/a&gt; leaving a trail of lifeless bodies in our wake.\nAs I head to the portal, members of my &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; begin to chatter about tomorrow's scheduled raid in &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. Though we've dipped our toes into &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; Normal, we're all pretty casual and still have some gearing up to do before we can make real attempts on the new &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es. A couple people are sharing some tactical ideas with one of our raid leaders. For me, I just make sure I hit hard, avoid standing in bad things, and toss a battle rez should the worst happen. But their impassioned planning gets me thinking: \u201cTomorrow, &lt;a href=\"Un%27sok\"&gt;Un'sok&lt;/a&gt; . . . tomorrow you will meet your demise.\u201d (You'll have to picture me with my GRRR face on and my fist clenched in the air for this to be properly dramatic.)\nAct III: That Lesson About Being Prepared.\nAfter tidying up what's left of my Shado-Pan tasks for the day, a group begins to form to take on the Thundering Isle in force. We are unable to ignore the haunting calls of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, and the terrifying &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, the quest hub progression needs our help as our realm works together to conquer Lei Shen's stronghold, and compelled by our patriotism, we set off. Arriving at the armada just offshore, we're greeted by a mass of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin-Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; leaders, each one providing instruction as to the materials they need and creatures to be decimated. If we're to battle our way into the Throne of Thunder, now is the time to step up! We report to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; and he provides us the option to assist in either PvE or PvP quests for that day, and upon completion we're to receive a chest full of useful &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. Today we choose PvE, although certainly many around us have clearly gone the PvP route with yellow-flagged names showing their intent.\nWe're all pretty familiar with each other so this should go fairly smoothly. Moving together like a pride of &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s, we weave in and out of every obstacle leaving a trail of destruction in our wakes. A few of us earn some &lt;a href=\"Uncommon\"&gt;green drops&lt;/a&gt; from the kills, otherwise they'd be sharded or auctioned, but these hold a specific significance. Some of the green items that drop on this island use the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28BC%20Classic%29\"&gt;old Zul'Aman raid&lt;/a&gt; item appearances, perfect for &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;. We complete one of our tasks, then another, and it's at this moment we finally pause. Just up the path in front of us is the &lt;a href=\"Saurok\"&gt;Saurok&lt;/a&gt; Cave, and something just doesn't feel right. We've banded together against some pretty vicious foes in our past, but for some reason, this island gives us a chill of fear we're not too familiar with. Steely and determined, we press forward and continue our attacks.\nTrouble! As we're managing a mass of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, along comes a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20mob\"&gt;rare spawn&lt;/a&gt; which puts a strain on our crew. Fortunately, just up the way is another group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and they join in to help us take down the beast. Whew! We wipe the sweat from our brows content that we've finally completed all of our quests. It's a moment we can relish and finally catch our breath. Our &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; breaks the relaxing silence as he notices a few mysterious items in his inventory. They are called &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Ritual%20Stone\"&gt;Shan'ze Ritual Stone&lt;/a&gt;s and can apparently be used to summon a powerful rare creature. It's at this point I can picture us all having the same look: Eyes squinted with determination, each of us looks around and we nod in unison. Let's do this!\nTucked away off to one side of the island is a small clearing. It is here we realize we're able to begin the summoning ritual. Eager for the chance to earn &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, items, and rep-granting insignias our party chat fills with hopes for the coming kill. Suddenly, popping out of what can only be described as nether, a vicious brute by the name of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27dok\"&gt;Kor'dok&lt;/a&gt; appears before us. Before we have any time to consider our opponent the fight has already begun, and after an epic battle it concludes. A couple of us get &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt;s filled with &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; materials, while the tank manages the unthinkable and wins a mount, a three-horned &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt; formed of the darkest crystal, and guild chat erupts as he links his prize.\nAs we make our way back towards the armada, I notice a strange key in my inventory. Examining it more closely, I soon discover that it belongs to the Shado-Pan. The rest of my group goes on without me to take on their own adventures for this night, and after a quick discussion with one of the Shado-Pan leaders I'm snuck to a secret location. It's a &lt;a href=\"Troves%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;single-player scenario, and it's full of treasure&lt;/a&gt;! Glorious and ornate, the room is a spectacle to behold. Littered about me are &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s bulging with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and powerfully rare antiquities, but I have only a short time to grab as much as I can, and the traps that protect the chests are designed to slow my progress. I make it out, alive, with arms full of riches and items.\nEager to continue my evening I queue for the first wing of the Throne of Thunder Raid Finder: Last Stand of the Zandalari. These new encounters test our group fearlessly, and the experience is too much for some to bear. As we fight on we pick up new valiant adventurers, and fight on until we've nothing left to fight. At the end of it I'm an ilvl 502 trinket richer, and find myself doing that same embarrassing happy dance from earlier.\nHonestly, I cannot do any of this justice, so I will leave you with these parting words:\nWhispers float on the winds of this island of a fearsome reptile, of a celestial spirit that guards a gateway, and of a legend that will weigh heavy upon the minds of triumphant heroes. And while each of these rumors is intriguing, what I've shared is but a day in Pandaria\u2014a day that barely scratches the surface of what's to come.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nFrom the moment of its mysterious creation, the purpose of this dark tower has been intertwined with the history of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, once &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest bulwark against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It is now best known as the home of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who tragically betrayed Azeroth and brought the unbroken chain of Guardians to an end. This legacy makes Karazhan a place of particular interest for the Legion, who have descended in full force in an effort to open a new front in their war on the denizens of Azeroth.\nIt's been some time since the heroes of Azeroth have been called into the halls of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to do battle with the evils within, but a return was inevitable with so many secrets left undiscovered.\nA Return to Karazhan.\nReturn to Karazhan in &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; will provide a new 5-player experience for those who are familiar with &lt;a href=\"the%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;the Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; 10- player &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Raid dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. Once the seat of power of Medivh, the last Guardian of Tirisfal, each stone and stair is imbued with untold power. It is this power that has lured the Burning Legion into its halls and Medivh's servant, &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; has been happy to throw open the doors in the hope that his master will be returning soon.\nInside the tower, players will discover a variety of new challenges to face from both familiar and new &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es to fight along with a few new tales to experience within the infamous &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Hall\"&gt;Opera Hall&lt;/a&gt;. But, before you can waltz through the doors, you'll need to complete an attunement by working with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to thwart 's latest plans.\nGul'dan's been sending secret orders to high-ranking &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s found within the darkest recesses of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and Khadgar is going to need you to intercept them. But this is just the start of your adventure. You'll need to face down the &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; within Mythic &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; along with three more of Gul'dan's demons. With all the clues at hand, Khadgar will learn a deadly truth that will send adventurers into the haunted tower of Kharazhan. Facing a gauntlet of enemies old and new, only the most seasoned heroes have any hope to survive and foil the Legion's plan.\nThis is a large dungeon with a raid-like feel in which players will want to revisit as they work their way through. To allow time to do this, the dungeon will have a 1-week lockout timer which will provide players the time they need to work their way through and claim their new loot.\nMaiden of Virtue: Arriving in Karazhan to cleanse the tower of vice and corruption, the titan watcher was infuriated by Medivh's infamous parties and debaucheries. As her crusade for virtue seeks converts to her cause, the Maiden remains committed to purging immorality using all the powers at her disposal.\nOpera Hall: Wikket: Are villains born evil, or do they fall into wickedness due to the influence of others? Perhaps considering this quandary from the ozen point of view will offer enlightenment\u2026\nOpera Hall: Westfall Story: Amidst the carnage of rival gangs battling for the turf of Westfall, two lovers from very different worlds fight for happiness. It is said that love is blind\u2026 but does it also need a translator?\nOpera Hall: Beautiful Beast: Cursed to take the form of a beastly monster, Brute must find true love before he loses his life to the dark magic that transformed him. Will he learn proper table manners in time to win the heart of the fair Bella?\nAttumen the Huntsman: Once charged with hunting game for his master's feasts, Attumen now sets his sights on a very different kind of quarry. Ever wary of those seeking to steal his famed steed, Midnight, Attumen unleashes his well-honed fighting skills against all intruders.\nMoroes: Moroes, the steward of Karazhan, dotes upon his master's dinner guests within the grand Banquet Hall. Eternally devoted to care of the tower, he dispatches impolite party crashers with cruel efficiency.\nThe Curator: The Curator safeguards the Menagerie from unwelcome guests, terminating trespassers who seek to plunder the secrets of Karazhan. Though assembled by Medivh himself, the guardian construct has deteriorated over time, becoming prone to energy overloads and erratic behavior.\nShade of Medivh: So great was the power of the last Guardian, Medivh, that his magic still echoes through the halls of Karazhan. Some of these echoes take the shape of visions, revealing past events to the tower's guests. Others assume more malevolent forms, recalling a time when the Guardian's will was not his own.\nMana Devourer: Rarely does the sight of a mana wyrm cause a seasoned adventurer concern. These small, simple creatures float about, consuming stray pockets of arcane energy. But in Karazhan, tables are often turned, and what at first glance appears harmless may be revealed as an enormous threat.\nViz'aduum the Watcher: The all-seeing Viz'aduum was commanded by Kil'jaeden to capture Karazhan and tap into the tendrils of ley energy woven through the tower. Should he succeed in anchoring the structure to the myriad of worlds held by the Legion, the Dark Titan's army will overrun Azeroth and leave little more than a smoldering husk.\nWe look forward to seeing you within the halls of Karazhan once more."}

Enjoy.\"\nIt's dawn and something just doesn't feel right. It's almost as if the axis of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; wobbled a bit overnight, and this time it had nothing to do with me smackin' &lt;a href=\"Oondasta\"&gt;Oondasta&lt;/a&gt; upside the head. I have an uneasy feeling, and if you know me, I won't stop until I've figured out what the problem is, found a way to resolve it, and made sure someone went home crying. You like my style, don't you?\nWell, whaddya know? I've just entered the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and can feel my journal rustling about inside my satchel. It appears a mysterious person has magically scribbled a note titled \u201c&lt;a href=\"A%20Flash%20of%20Bronze...\"&gt;A Flash of Bronze&lt;/a&gt;\u201d and that I'm to seek out my old friend &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;. As much as I like to flirt with cute little &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s who can gnaw my face off, I opt to avoid long conversation and put these uneasy feelings to rest. She hands me a &lt;a href=\"%3ACurious%20Bronze%20Timepiece\"&gt;:Curious Bronze Timepiece&lt;/a&gt; which I quizzically ponder for a moment: I guess there's no harm in me using its powers to see what happens. I'll just hold it in one hand and wave the other over the top, and . . . *FWOOSH*\nNow see, according to my &lt;a href=\"%3AGnomish%20Army%20Knife\"&gt;:Gnomish Army Knife&lt;/a&gt;'s compass and my calculations of the stars that have suddenly appeared above, I'm southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; on what I'm being told is &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Landing\"&gt;Tushui Landing&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Hmmm, this wasn't here yesterday when I swam by doing my daily laps around &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Methinks a challenge is afoot! And it goes without saying\u2014but I'll say it anyway\u2014my existence and the glory of my presence must be felt by every living creature on this planet. So off I go!\nI'm not on the Isle for two seconds before I notice an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Spineclaw\"&gt;Ancient Spineclaw&lt;/a&gt; giving me the crook-eye. To arms, you clot! I engage in battle with the angry crustacean, who actually scratches my precious armor with its Claw Flurry. Unacceptable! Following a mighty swing of my hammer, it lets out a screech and keels over. Much to my surprise and delight, however, it's carrying a new kind of currency I've never seen before: &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Coin\"&gt;Timeless Coin&lt;/a&gt;s! And as if that wasn't sweet enough, it's even coughed up a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Charm%20of%20Good%20Fortune\"&gt;Lesser Charm of Good Fortune&lt;/a&gt;. Cha-ching!\nNo time to admire things that aren't quite as impressive as I am: With gusto, I head off deeper into the forest away from the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Shore\"&gt;Timeless Shore&lt;/a&gt; in search of more challenging adventures. Felling limbless reptiles, rabid &lt;a href=\"crane\"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt;s, and really angry &lt;a href=\"yak\"&gt;yak&lt;/a&gt;s, I discover the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt;. It's surrounded by denizens of Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, and\u2014oh look\u2014there's &lt;a href=\"Chen\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;! And there's the infamous &lt;a href=\"Fo%20Sho%20Knucklebump\"&gt;Fo Sho Knucklebump&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Monkey%20King\"&gt;the Monkey King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillpaw\"&gt;Old Hillpaw&lt;/a&gt;, and wow, even &lt;a href=\"Ling%20of%20the%20Six%20Pools\"&gt;Ling of the Six Pools&lt;/a&gt;! She's a legend around &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; for her love of cheese.\nThat's when I happen upon &lt;a href=\"Master%20Li\"&gt;Master Li&lt;/a&gt;. He offers me the opportunity to face some of my fellow champions in an &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;epic Pet Battles tournament&lt;/a&gt;, and I happily accept. &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%204000%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Blingtron 4000&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shademaster%20Kiryn\"&gt;Shademaster Kiryn&lt;/a&gt; . . . all of them fall to my remarkable team. Can you feel it?!\nUp next are the children of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, which\u2014if I may say so myself\u2014are quite impressive. Sadly, not as impressive as me! Down they go, one by one, and I'm rewarded with a few Celestial Coins. Turns out, Master Li also holds these same children as pets I'm able to adopt, and since I showed them who's boss in the arena, I choose &lt;a href=\"%3AYu%27la%2C%20Broodling%20of%20Yu%27lon\"&gt;:Yu'la, Broodling of Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;. Come on, who wouldn't want a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; to follow them around?!\nDirectly west of my position I can smell hops and barley, but it really isn't all that pleasant. In fact, it's rather more like Eau de &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20Skunk\"&gt;Highlands Skunk&lt;/a&gt;. I turn and head into &lt;a href=\"Old%20Pi%27jiu\"&gt;Old Pi'jiu&lt;/a&gt; where I find several &lt;a href=\"Skunky%20Brew%20Alemental\"&gt;Skunky Brew Alemental&lt;/a&gt;s. Skunky . . . who'd a thunk it? Smashin' and dashin', I lay waste to these stinky beings only to fill up a giant cask summoning &lt;a href=\"Zhu-Gon%20the%20Sour\"&gt;Zhu-Gon the Sour&lt;/a&gt;, an even bigger stinky being. Heh, not a problem. KAPOW! SMASH! BOOM! Down it goes, and in the stain it leaves on the grass? My very own Skunky Alemental pet! I may mix up my team now . . . stop it, &lt;a href=\"Grizzle%20%28pet%29\"&gt;Grizzle&lt;/a&gt;, I'm kidding!\nWhew, this adventuring is almost making me tired. I said almost! And that's when I hear it. Bleating. Pathetic, miserable noises that can only be categorized as bleating because really, aren't &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; just a bunch of &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;? Especially the ones around the &lt;a href=\"Firewalker%20Ruins\"&gt;Firewalker Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Just as I'm about to smite a whole village of these flea-bitten mongrels, I notice a really big chest tucked behind the wall. STOMP! With the yaungol all stunned, I quickly open the chest and go back to finishing each of them off. When the fracas is all said and done, I realize I've collected some sort of &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; loot! It's just an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, but the inscription tells me I can create a piece of armor if I were to channel its power. New kicks for Payne!\nSeriously, the amount of land to cover and creatures to lay waste to is far too immense to even explain. I won't even begin to tell you about &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt; and why flaming bits of him are stuck to my shield. Let's just say I've made this island my\u2014ouch! One of the yaungol's fleas bit me and now I have an itch. Anyway, my tales tend to cause minds to melt very quickly, so I'll leave you with this: &lt;a href=\"Whispershade%20Hollow\"&gt;Whispershade Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Stone%20Run\"&gt;Red Stone Run&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Way\"&gt;Blazing Way&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20Lost%20Spirits\"&gt;Cavern of Lost Spirits&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Zarhym%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;mysterious floating skull&lt;/a&gt;, and a ghostly world riddled with chests. There are countless events, encounters, smelly animals, and delicious noms for you to enjoy. SO GET MOVIN'!!"}

It's about the model change and lore for &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nFortified citadels lie in ruins. Once-verdant forests burn brightly in the twilight of the setting sun. And arid stretches of desert, known to have claimed even the hardiest of travelers, now house fertile oases.\nThe breaking of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; changed a great many things. While the altered landscapes of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; may be the most noticeable evidence of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s violent return, many of Azeroth's heroes have also undergone drastic physical and mental transformations of their own.\nRecently, we focused on how the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; has affected the lives of the accomplished &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Today we examine Anduin Wrynn, son of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;, and the indelible impact that the great changes sweeping Azeroth have had on this young man.\n\"Although only a teenager, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s prince, Anduin, has persevered through numerous trials and tribulations, such as being kidnapped by the scheming &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. His greatest challenge, however, might lie in his relationship with Varian. Anduin is no stranger to his father's love and affection, but he is constantly wary of sudden outbursts from Varian's violent, &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;ial side. Anduin has also struggled against his father's insistence that he become a warrior.\"\n\"Events just prior to the Cataclysm signaled a new chapter in Anduin's life. While undergoing martial training in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; bastion of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin witnessed as &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the estranged daughter of the late King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;\u2014held the city hostage with a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being the legal heir to Ironforge, she drew the ire of Varian for her heavy-handed tactics. Before long, the king and a team of agents infiltrated the city, intent on killing the brash dwarf heiress. Only through Anduin's wise and resolute intervention did Varian stay his hand and spare Moira's life, thus averting a political disaster that might have ignited a dwarven civil war.\"\n\"During his time in Ironforge, Anduin also discovered his true calling in life: to be a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; devoted to the tenets of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. For those who know Anduin well, this discipline is a perfect fit for the prince, who has consistently proven himself to be compassionate and thoughtful. No longer the child-prince of Stormwind from years past, Anduin is fast becoming his own man with the courage to speak up for what he believes in. He does not share Varian's outright hatred and mistrust of the Horde. On one occasion, he even imparted sage advice to the &lt;a href=\"tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;tauren chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; after the death of his father, &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;. Yet in Azeroth's current state of turmoil, it is unknown whether Anduin's destiny with the Light will proceed on its current course, or whether his path will take a different turn.\"\nWe'll be examining other key characters' transformations\u2014including those of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in the months ahead, so come back soon."}

It's a chance to take hold of your heroes' destiny and shape the of the past \u2013 and it all starts in a very dangerous place. Long before the planet was ripped apart and became &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was home to brutish &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who went to war across a treacherous landscape.\nYour first steps into Draenor will be within the wilds of Tanaan Jungle, where the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; has staged &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;their assault&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. With these new attacks, you'll be charged with leading the greatest heroes of this age in the counterstrike. This is an invasion that can't be ignored and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are both set on taking the offensive before it's too late.\nYour journey's beginning in Tanaan Jungle is sure to present challenges \u2013 many of which have very sharp teeth \u2013 but it's also where you'll be introduced to some of the greatest orc warlords and heroes of all time. Unfortunately, the orc leaders of storied clans such as of , of , and of the aren't going to be happy to see you. They won't welcome you with anything other than unbridled savagery. You really shouldn't expect anything to be on your side in this jungle.\nShutting down the is your first priority, but the mission may quickly go awry. Even if you do manage to seal the portal, your party will still be trapped in the middle of a hostile army. Your only option is to fight your way out! You might even be forced to accept the help of the infamous . Fortunately, you'll also have luminaries such as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; by your side.

It's about various &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s and beaches in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19816676/azeroths-six-best-beaches-7-1-2015, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle.\nIt's summertime! The &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt; is in full swing, and everyone is taking trips to faraway places. We traveled all over to put together this rundown of the six best beaches in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for you. Whether you're going &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, or looking for treasures, or just want a place to dig your toes into the sand and relax while the sun sets over a sparkling sea, we've got you covered!\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#6 -- Longshore (Westfall).\nIt's one of the biggest beaches on the planet, and it's one of the best. Sure, there are parts of this vast, sandy expanse that seem positively covered in &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, but that only adds to its charm. &lt;a href=\"Longshore\"&gt;Longshore&lt;/a&gt; provides a number of easy activities for the kids (beyond clearing out the murlocs). There are clams to dive for just offshore, and rumor has it that an even greater treasure awaits &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who dig deep enough into the local culture.\nFor the best views from Longshore, head West from &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; until you reach the beach, then go South for a little while. You'll find a spot that has a great view of the lighthouse and is relatively free of aggro from the locals!\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#5 -- The Forgotten Coast (Silithus).\nYes, that's right, the much-avoided insect infestation known as &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; is home to a getaway beach that you've got to see to believe. From the middle of the zone, just head West until you find a truly glorious strip of sand and trees on the edge of forever. The &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Coast\"&gt;Forgotten Coast&lt;/a&gt; got its name fair and square, as even my strongest recommendation won't bring more than a handful of tourists to this distant gem.\nThis beach is so far off the beaten path that your personal map won't be able to deal with most of it. Nonetheless, at the Southern end of The Forgotten Coast, you'll find the sort of solitude and natural beauty that can't be bought for any price back home. Make sure you bring anything and everything you might need to enjoy your day at the beach. There aren't any &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s for miles!\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#4 -- Moa'ki Harbor (Dragonblight).\nNo travel list would be complete without a visit to the great white North ... rend, and coming in at number four is a very different experience for the traveler who's looking for something a bit less tropical. It's &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a fishing community run by the &lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; that's as rugged as it is charming.\nOnce you've set up your fishing chair on the end of one of the sturdy docks, lean back and take a deep breath of the cool, crisp ocean air. The winds blow from the south here, so you'll have no worries about dealing with the stink of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Look around and soak up the Northern beauty as kites fly just overhead. Some of those kites have been flying there for years!\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#3 - Echo Isles (Durotar).\nThis pristine example of &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; homestead land is sitting pretty at number three, and boy is it pretty! It's hard to imagine a better example of sand and sun and surf, with no real threats to bother you and perfect weather all summer long. Small creatures abound here, so bring your own small creatures and turn them loose to chase each other around in relative safety.\nFor this entry, I want to direct your attention to the far South island in the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and specifically the Southeast corner beach. Have you ever seen a more lovely view of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;? Probably! But now that you're here anyway, open one of those spiked beverages you've been carrying around in your bags for the last couple of years and get tipsy! You deserve it!\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#2 - Land's End Beach (Tanaris).\nEver since the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; knocked the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; off this list, travelers have asked me \"Where can we go to get away from it all?\" No matter what \"it\" is, you can get away from it on this massive white sand beach at the Southern tip of Tanaris. Bring your sunscreen! It's bright out here.\nNamed for beachgoer &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Land\"&gt;Nathan Land&lt;/a&gt;, who met his demise here, &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; has a little something for everyone, as long as everyone wants to be in a desert on the other side of a rocky mountain range from another desert. You'll wonder at the hot beauty of this place. You'll wade into the warm waters to find that they don't really cool you off. You'll find out once and for all whether or not &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; sweat.\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#1 - Turtle Beach (Krasarang Wilds).\nIt's the best beach in all of Azeroth, and you simply must visit it at your next opportunity. Drop everything and head to this little slice of heaven on the South coast of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. You won't find a better view from a beach than this beautiful spot.\nTo get to &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Beach\"&gt;Turtle Beach&lt;/a&gt;, head to The &lt;a href=\"Incursion\"&gt;Incursion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, then head East along the legendary shore until you come to a statue of &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, friends, this is the very spot where Liu Lang embarked on his adventures with &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, it's a beach with a wondrous secret.\nEach and every Sunday night, long after the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; has gone down, Turtle Beach is overrun with history as the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Wanderer's Festival&lt;/a&gt; takes place. Fireworks light up the sands to mark the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Shuchun\"&gt;Lorewalker Shuchun&lt;/a&gt;, who are joined by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;. The rare Wonderer's Festival Hatchling pets appear with a thirst for pet battles, but only for a few minutes.\nIt's the only beach on the list where you'll get an &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; just for being there!\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\nLife's a Beach.\nThere you have it: the Top Six Beaches in Azeroth and what they're each good for. You know what they're all good for? &lt;a href=\"Fireworks\"&gt;Fireworks&lt;/a&gt;! Before you head out to any beach, fill your bags with your own fireworks display. It'll be fine! &lt;a href=\"WoWWiki\"&gt;WoWWiki&lt;/a&gt;'s fireworks page is a fine resource for locating your nearest sky-boom &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you don't want to travel far or have a phobia of handling things that go \u201cBOOM\u201d when lit on fire, then don't forget to head to the nearest &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; for a firework display you won't want to miss. Midsummer Fire Festival ends with a bang on July 4 with professionally choreographed displays high above the capital cities at the top of the hour beginning after sundown. Don't miss it. It'll be a blast!\nSurely.\nWhat's your favorite beach in Azeroth? Why? No, seriously -- why?"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nAzsuna is home to the remnants of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; ravaged by the wrath of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. This accursed land is rife with many mysteries, and serves as refuge to what remains of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\n[ \"Embed of Soundcloud Soundtrack \"]\nSacred Stone composed by Sam Cardon.\nWe sat down with Senior Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Maloof\"&gt;Eric Maloof&lt;/a&gt; to get some insights on the zone and learn a bit more about what you'll find there.\nQ. How would you describe the zone's ambience? What's it like?\nEric Maloof: Azsuna is a broken land. The island was cursed just before the events of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, a little over 10,000 years ago. It's also an invaded land, and probably has the heaviest concentration of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; aside from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; decided to use Azsuna as a major warfront, taking over the sub-island of &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt; and also staging a fairly heavy incursion onto the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; side of things, they invaded and created the &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;, basically.\nI like to call Azsuna the research park of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; for the elves. The &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Academy&lt;/a&gt; was the center of magical knowledge before Queen Azshara sundered the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the curse. Basically, it killed all of the elves and doomed them to an eternal existence\u2014rather than turning into &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s and returning to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;, they're stuck here as &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;Azurewing Repose&lt;/a&gt; is a beautiful quest hub, where players see a different side of Blue Dragonflight from the one they've seen up to this point. What we see here is really a final retreat for the oldest living &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and he's just hanging on by a thread because of the magic that's infused in the island. The pool of magic that he's resting in keeps him alive now\u2014and that, in turn, is attracting the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and others from Suramar.\nAzsuna is punchy and has a lot going on. It's probably the one zone that isn't necessarily dominated by any one given force, because realistically no one really comes here. You don't imagine the elves from Suramar coming here, because it's cursed. Why would you come here? Really the only reason is because Azshara is like, \u201cYep, I'm after the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; now,\u201d and the demons have invaded we have to stop these guys from doing this. We normally wouldn't come here. You don't want to go here. It's like a horror story waiting to happen\u2014but you really don't have any choice.\nQ. Which locations in Azsuna would you say are some of your favorites, and why?\nEric Maloof: Well certainly Faronaar, just because of what happens to a place that was night elven and then gets hit with the full force of the Burning Legion. In lower Faronaar, where you do your level-up questing, you still have remnants of the elf ruins. But upper Faronaar is almost 100 percent just demons. This is what they do. This is what happens. This is what the whole world is going to end up looking like. The closest analog would be the demon &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;. So it sets the stakes for what we're really fighting against here. I think we see a little of that in the invasions as well that are happening right now, but we don't see as complete a takeover. You see the buildings coming in, and you can extrapolate what would happen.\nAnother favorite of mine is &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Nar%27thalas\"&gt;Ruins of Nar'thalas&lt;/a&gt; and the Academy. The team did just such an outstanding job\u00a0 to really get that vibe of \u201clong, long, long ago, here was a really important point of elf civilization and it got smashed because of Azshara's wrath.\u201d I think the evolution\u2014or de-evolution, when you compare it against some of the places in Suramar, for instance\u2014is really interesting. The art kit is similar but aged and desaturated and cracked. I think it's such an iconic anchor point of the zone.\nQ. Why do you think a player would want to start in this zone first?\nI honestly think all of the four level-up zones are extremely compelling. Certainly if they want to get more exposure to the immediacy of the Burning Legion, they're going to get that out of Azsuna. \nQ. What is it that will bring players back to this zone?\nI'd say that when we were plotting out Azsuna, we put in a lot of spaces for top-level content, but with the scaling tech, we had a lot of opportunity for other content that we could satisfy everyone with.\nWe set aside the &lt;a href=\"Timeworn%20Strand\"&gt;Timeworn Strand&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; skirmish, so there's a &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; invasion on the west coast encroaching into these elf ruins that have slid off into the ocean. Who knows, it might have been the Sundering, it might have been the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe have the Isle of the Watchers, which is all top-level. There, &lt;a href=\"the%20Wardens\"&gt;the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; faction has you deal with these monstrosities that have broken out of the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; dungeon and set up camp in various places. In addition, the Burning Legion has taken one of the towers and is fighting the Wardens for the other tower with their &lt;a href=\"felsworn\"&gt;felsworn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014basically, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and others who have sworn their allegiance to the Burning Legion.\nThen we have the two dungeons, The Vault of the Wardens and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, which is magically connected to Azsuna. It's effectively the dungeon staging area for Azshara's forces as they either magically transport into the middle of the zone or swim up through the ocean, as we show when you're coming into the zone for the first time.\nSo yeah, we've got a lot of reason to come back\u2014plus we have &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; content spread throughout the zone as well.\nQ. Is there anything else that players should look forward to here?\nThere are so many little anecdotal things that might be too spoilery. One of the most compelling storylines focuses on &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; and his redemption. Here's this guy who, in trying to do the right thing, damned his people for all eternity. He attempted to use one of the Pillars of Creation to stop Queen Azshara and the events at the Great Sundering with the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; when that occurred. But in attempting to use an artifact of such immense &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; power, Azshara got the drop on him, and all of his people blame him. To see him go through just being spit upon by his own people\u2014and then going on to work with the player to help recover the Pillar of Creation\u2014it's really a redemption story. It's really cool to see.\nAnother good story is in the north, there's a nightfallen who's really trying to resist his condition. You're kind of rooting for him and you're not sure how things are going to turn out for him."}

The Azure Span stretches from coastal tuskarr villages through sprawling forest tundra to looming spires of ice and snow. Regal blue dragons once roamed these lands, but with the passage of time, several tribes of tuskarr, gnolls, and furbolg now call these ancient lands their home.\nThe Azure Span is one of the largest zones created in World of Warcraft to date and offers the greatest visual elevation change players will see in the Dragon Isles.\nMuch of the inspiration for this zone comes from one of our favorites in Wrath of the Lich King, Grizzly Hills, along with the California Bay area's coastal fogs and redwoods. Though, there's more than just redwoods to be found throughout Azure Span, as you'll learn when you trek through this diverse wilderness.\nMuch of the zone is filled with varied biomes covered in snow and ice, giant frozen waterfalls, ice rivers, and forests shrouded in mist that beckon eager heroes hungry for adventure.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nAzure Span's Denizens.\nAs you progress on your adventures, you'll encounter many inhabitants of this snow-touched biome who have made the icy peaks, forests, and shores their homes. Here are some that you'll meet on your journey.\nTuskarr.\nLike their Northrend relatives, the tuskarr of the Dragon Isles are fishers and traders and have inhabited the land since the days when blue dragons roamed the Azure Span. Their tribes can be found throughout as they aid Kalecgos.\nBlue Dragons.\nThe Dragon Isles have been rejuvenated, but many blue dragons are still scattered across Azeroth. Kalecgos will need all the help he can get to reunite them\u2014and an unexpected source appears to offer that aid.\nGnolls.\nA savage clan of shamanistic gnolls that have harnessed the power of decay, darkening their wetland home with vile pockets of thorns and roots. They are a force to be reckoned with.\nFurbolg.\nThe forest-dwelling furbolg are dealing with conflicts that have splintered their clans. Many have been lured with the promise of being able to bend the elements to their will.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThis is only the beginning of your adventures through the Dragon Isles.

{"id": "431602", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=431602", "title": "WoW Blog/Beasts of the Savage Lands", "text": "Beasts of the Savage Lands are a series of blog posts by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; on the official \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" website, posted prior to and shortly after the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\". Their purpose was to introduce and describe some of the creatures and monsters players would encounter in . They were posted from the 3rd of July to the 13th of November 2014. They did not survive the overhaul of the &lt;a href=\"Official%20site\"&gt;Official site&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrostfire Ridge.\nArming yourself with knowledge is essential if you\u2019re hoping to survive the savage world of Draenor. In this series, we\u2019ll talk about the different creatures you may encounter as you explore this untamed world. While not comprehensive, this should give you an idea of what to expect as you prepare to face the challenges ahead. Here\u2019s a look at some of the creatures that can be found in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;:\nMagnaron.\nAncient creatures of molten stone, the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; are directly descended from the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20giant%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;colossals&lt;/a&gt; who first shaped Draenor. There are few living today who can communicate with these enigmatic giants, and fewer still who understand their seemingly chaotic motivations. Among the roiling lava spouts of Frostfire Ridge, the magnaron carve fiery sigils into the earth and shape entire mountains to their needs. Magnaron have been known to both enslave and befriend elemental &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt;, and they are seldom alone. Approach with caution!\nOgron.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, and magnaron all share a common lineage, with the beastly &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the missing link between savage gronn and their smaller, more numerous children. They take in their surroundings with a single yellow eye\u2014slow to blink and even slower to comprehend. Too idiotic to disobey orders, but big and dangerous enough to keep even unruly ogres in line, ogron serve as expendable muscle for ogre leaders from warlords all the way up to the emperor himself. Any champions seeking to overthrow ogres in power had best prepare to face down one or more ogron towering in their way.\nRylak.\nThe versatile, flying &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt; have adapted to climates across Draenor, but their greatest density is in Frostfire Ridge. Here, warm volcanic stone ledges make for excellent nesting sites, while snowy featureless expanses serve as prime hunting grounds for these ferocious predators to seek flesh with their dual sets of eyes and nostrils. Their thick hides protect them from the elements, as well as from the arrows of frustrated hunters. Adventurers seeking to display a two-headed rylak trophy should remain wary of both sets of fangs . . . and those seeking to tame a new mount should consider the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s tendency to armor the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skyreaver\"&gt;largest rylaks&lt;/a&gt; and lead them into combat.\nFrostwolves.\nOnly the hardiest can survive the unforgiving climate of Frostfire Ridge. Numbering among the natives are the sturdy &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf orc clan&lt;/a&gt; has taken these beasts as their symbol and namesake, and the orcs and their wolf companions fight and hunt together as an extended pack family.\nExplorers in Frostfire Ridge should be wary of the frostwolf\u2019s undomesticated cousin, the dangerous &lt;a href=\"garn\"&gt;garn&lt;/a&gt;. These enormous beasts, twice the mass of an &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, are identified by their massive jaws and jet-black fur. Even the Frostwolf orcs fear the unruly and wild garn.\nThere are still countless other dangerous creatures out there, all of them looking forward to their next adventurer-sized meal\u2014so keep your eyes open and your weapons sharp. Do you have what it takes to survive in Draenor?\nShadowmoon Valley.\nThe lush appears peaceful and idyllic, lulling many would-be adventurers into a false sense of security as they explore its rolling hills and violet forests. But countless hidden perils lie waiting behind the tranquil fa\u00e7ade, and only those well-armed with knowledge can hope to survive. What dangers lurk in the shadows?\nRiverbeasts.\nAdventurers are often misled by the seemingly docile &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s. Though slow to anger, once disturbed, a charging riverbeast is a ferocious sight: 4,000 pounds of fat and muscle storming toward its target like a runaway tram. Roaming &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rangari\"&gt;rangari&lt;/a&gt; have long been astounded by how much damage a rampaging riverbeast can take before it\u2019s brought down, and draenei children are taught to keep a wide berth of shallow waters. Riverbeasts are characterized by their rock-like skin, likely developed during the early days of Draenor\u2019s prehistory, when &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;creatures of stone&lt;/a&gt; dueled for supremacy against the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;chaotic flora&lt;/a&gt;. Those looking to take a riverbeast as a trophy should take note of their durable armored flesh and tendency to charge unexpectedly.\nPodlings.\nA number of Draenor\u2019s indigenous species blur the line between plant and animal, and the so-called &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s are the most vicious and chaotic of their ilk. Small and seemingly harmless, they work together to capture their prey, attacking only when they have numerical superiority. Explorers who pay attention to the color of podlings\u2019 flowering buds can ascertain whether they favor poison, ensnaring, or physical attacks to incapacitate their victims. Once podlings have overwhelmed their quarry, they will drag the unlucky creature down into the weeds to fertilize a new generation. The clear lesson for adventurers: looks can be deceiving!\nElekk.\nThe majestic &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; graze contentedly across the grassy plains of Draenor, relying on their huge size and the support of the herd to keep predators at bay. Draenei explorers have determined that the animals pose no threat, as long as their young aren\u2019t endangered or their water supply jeopardized. With the endurance to cover great distances and the ability to defend themselves by ramming or stomping attackers, these beasts have emerged as the draenei transport of choice. Explorers should take note of persistent draenei rumors that the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Thunderlord Clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs torment and twist terrified elekk into vicious weapons of war, covering them in armor plating and inciting them to rampage when turned loose on their foes. Beware!\nDraenor Ancients.\nIt was only very recently that draenei rangari managed to communicate with these enormous sentient trees, but wildly different ways of life\u2014not to mention a completely different perception of time\u2014have made further interaction difficult. The &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20ancient\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; get their name from their &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;analogues&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth; they are tied closely to a prehistoric plant lineage that unites much of Draenor\u2019s flora and places them in opposition to the creatures of stone. These enigmatic ancients remain in the same area for hundreds of years and are reluctant to move unless their home is threatened. Adventurers should be cautious when harvesting the valley\u2019s lumber, as they may find the forest fighting back.\nShadowmoon Valley is a dangerous place, but there are many deadly threats still to be discovered across the savage world of Draenor. Until next time, stay alive . . . if you can.\nGorgrond.\nThe primal forces that forged the lands of Draenor are still in conflict to this day, and in no other place is this more evident than &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. A land of contradictions, Gorgrond features barren rocky plains and dense overgrown jungles. Everywhere one looks, there\u2019s evidence of a realm at war with itself and monstrous creatures as dangerous as they are ancient.\nThe Botani.\nSlender, deliberate, and calculating, these enigmatic living trees single-mindedly tend to the wilds of Draenor. Wise in the ancient ways, they seek lost artifacts of bygone ages to empower the explosive growth of their territory... often at the expense of Draenor\u2019s other sentient denizens. The &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; wage an eternal war against the creatures of stone, and the natives of Gorgrond do their best to survive in the midst of constant conflict between the botani and the &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; and others. Since the Iron Horde and the creatures of stone began working together, the botani have become even more aggressive \u2013 orcs and draenei both have been disappearing of late into dense botani enclaves.\nThe Infested.\nThe botani have long cultured unique plantlife in their irrigated ponds or tree dwellings, but far more terrifying is their ability to cultivate flora within a living host. Unwary natives are captured and seeded in an agonizing process that alters their physical makeup and takes complete control over their bodies, turning them into mindless walking saplings. The entire process is poorly understood, but these grisly &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt; can be seen guarding botani enclaves or shambling ahead of the botani host as gruesome cannon fodder whose corpses eventually seed new terrain.\nGenesaur.\n&lt;a href=\"Genesaur\"&gt;Genesaur&lt;/a&gt; are enormous &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s who date back to the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Colossals\"&gt;age of colossals&lt;/a&gt;, when giants shaped the terrain of Draenor amidst constant warfare. The botani have retained the ability to communicate with these bastions of life, and genesaurs are revered as gods in their culture. Draenei have not yet determined if genesaur are immortal or not; genesaur emerging from botani-tended pools often retain the memories and will of their long-dead forebears. Adventurers fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of these rare beings are cautioned to give genesaur a wide berth. They are deceptively quick given their size and destroying them will take a small army of well-equipped heroes.\nGoren.\nWhile the gronn and magnaron shape the world through their brute individual strength, the &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; are scavenging opportunists who dart unseen between the lumbering feet of their larger cousins. Roughly the size of an Azerothian &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;, goren live in massive colonies that burrow through the earth, gobbling up minerals and leaving twisting caves in their wake. They enjoy devouring crystalline minerals, which are digested and extruded through their skin, giving some goren the benefit of an armored crystalline shell. The bane of both orc and draenei miners, goren sniff out and infest mineral-rich burrows. Adventurers should be wary of the gorens\u2019 ability to shoot crystalline projectiles and swarm around unprepared explorers in rolling packs, as well as their impossibly sharp teeth and acidic spit.\nBetween the creatures of stone and flora, and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt; looking to expand their domain, Gorgrond is a place you won\u2019t forget easily\u2026 assuming you make it out in one piece.\nSpires of Arak.\nExtending south from the Draenor mainland, this region plays host to the cryptic arakkoa. Up in the towering spires or down below in the woods, menacing creatures lurk unseen at every corner.\nThe Arakkoa.\nThe winged &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; are the proud descendants of the once-grand &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, a glorious empire of the sun that ruled vast territories alongside the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;ogre empire&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago. While many of the great works of their forebears remain a mystery, the arrakoa of this era \u2013 proud, hateful, and defiant \u2013 have mastered their own distinct magical arts to channel and control the power of Draenor\u2019s sun. Although they\u2019ve been reduced to a shade of their former power and driven high to the peaks of Arak, the Arakkoa still look down on the ground-dwellers below. Approach winged arakkoa with caution, as they are known to attack ground-dwellers on-sight.\nThe Arakkoa Outcasts.\nDiscipline is harsh for any arakkoa who conflicts with the sages ruling the capital of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;. Those found guilty of breaking the law, dabbling in shadow magic, or worshipping gods other than &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; are hurled from the spires and into the cursed pools of &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, where their wings shrivel and their bodies contort. No longer able to fly, and forever cut off from their sun god, these &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;outcasts&lt;/a&gt; have formed their own communities in the shadows of the spires, particularly in the refuge city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;. The outcasts are a tight-knit group and deeply distrustful, but they share common enemies with adventurers from Azeroth, and it may be possible to forge a relationship with them if one knows who to speak with.\nDread Raven.\nLong ago, the Raven God was cursed never to fly again. Anzu disappeared into the shadows, later to become the patron God of many flightless arakkoa outcasts. His children, the dangerous and shadowy &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s, still populate the Spires of Arak to this day. Fiercely strong and surprisingly intelligent, dread ravens are dangerous when their territory is breeched, particularly if their hatchlings are jeopardized. They are a grave threat on land and even more terrifying when they strike from above. Adventurers should be wary of their powerful headbutt or deafening screech. Stronger dread ravens use their wings as weapons, buffeting explorers with winds that threaten to blow them off the spires\u2019 high cliffs.\nMandragora.\nDraenei explorers have not yet determined if these multi-headed plant beasts are a natural species, or if they are created by the botani to defend their lands. These enormous, mindless creatures should only be engaged with extreme care, as each of a &lt;a href=\"mandragora\"&gt;mandragora&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s multiple heads are lined with serrated teeth, and the heads that aren\u2019t busy chomping adventurers assault them with toxic spit or poisonous breath. Be wary of these foes when trekking through Draenor\u2019s many overgrown jungles or bodies of stagnant water.\nRavagers.\n&lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt;s hatch as small ravenous larva, but soon disappear into pupae, only to emerge as slender &lt;a href=\"Ravager%20wasp\"&gt;wasps&lt;/a&gt; with a swarm mentality and a ferocious sting. Wasps quickly set out to gorge themselves until their wings can no longer support their body weight, after which they undergo a third and final metamorphosis into a vicious four-legged insect, whose distinctive, gurgling click-hiss instills fear in orc and draenei alike. Heroes should beware the fully-grown ravager\u2019s serrated mandibles (capable of shredding armor) and the lacerating spikes ravagers eject from their armored carapaces.\nSurviving the Spires of Arak takes both a keen mind and a sharp blade. With threats flying in from above and hiding amidst the trees below, you\u2019ll need all the help you can get. Next (and final) stop: Nagrand!\nNagrand.\nThe fertile fields and beautiful rolling plains of play host to some of the most diverse species on Draenor... as well as its most menacing threats. Here sits the ogre capital of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;valley home&lt;/a&gt; of the marauding &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; orc clan, and the &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;crash site&lt;/a&gt; that marks the arrival of the draenei to this world. Tread carefully!\nThe Pale.\nWhen young orc shaman from around the world come of age, they make a pilgrimage to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Throne of Elements&lt;/a&gt; to seek the blessings of the elemental spirits. The entire journey is filled with risk, but the ceremony itself is the most dangerous time of an orc\u2019s life. It\u2019s not clear what happens to those who are not strong enough and succumb to terrible visions and unearthly whispers during what should be the triumph of their young life. Those orcs who fall to the otherworldly voices flee their clan and become the &lt;a href=\"Pale\"&gt;Pale&lt;/a&gt;, withered remains of their former selves, hiding from the light and babbling incoherently in dark caves. Are they truly insane, or have they actually made contact with a malevolent force? The answers may lie in the twisting caverns beneath Nagrand, where some of the largest colonies of Pale linger and speak cryptic warnings.\nSaberon.\nFew creatures embody the savagery of Draenor as much as the &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt;, vaguely feline beasts who have adapted to nearly all of this world\u2019s diverse environments. From the icy caverns of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire&lt;/a&gt; to the steamy jungles of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan\"&gt;Tanaan&lt;/a&gt; to the maze-like rocky outcroppings of Nagrand, there\u2019s not a niche that the ferocious saberon haven\u2019t conquered. Saberon outwardly appear more advanced than beasts; they have a social structure, and can shape simple tools into weapons. Adventurers should be especially wary of saberon hunting parties, whose coordinated attacks, sharp rending claws, and ability to shadowstep behind prey make them deadly indeed.\nClefthoof.\nHeroes who ventured to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; may have encountered the &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; before, but seeing one of these majestic creatures in their prime is a different experience entirely. Large enough to quake the ground, covered with a thick valuable pelt, and armed with enormous tusks, these gigantic beasts are a hunter\u2019s most treasured prize and worst nightmare rolled into one. The meat of a single adult clefthoof can feed an orc clan for days, but their inclination to travel in large packs makes them dangerous prey - beware their devastating headbutt or swiping attacks with their formidable tusks. Fortunately, it\u2019s nearly impossible to be surprised by these massive beasts \u2013 heroes will be able to see and hear them coming from far away!\nThe Elementals of Draenor.\nThere are many similarities between the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor and their counterparts on Azeroth, but also many differences that &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; will be forced to adapt to. Whereas the elements of Azeroth are in constant conflict, the elements of Draenor strive for balance within themselves. This is especially evident in the Throne of Elements in Nagrand, where the greatest elemental furies of Draenor have convened peacefully since the dawn of the world. Be warned, however: if the chaos of war on Dreanor throws the elements out of balance, they may lash out at each other... and anyone caught between them.\nNagrand, like all regions in Draenor, eagerly awaits foolish would-be conquerers, ready to show them the error of their ways. Are you fully prepared? Draenor lies ahead\u2026"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nWhen last we delved into soloing raids past, we paid a visit to &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. If you've never tried tackling an older raid on your own before, be sure to check out that guide, as the first half serves as a primer on soloing raid content.\nRather than be predictable and move straight on to &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, we thought it would be more fun to briefly alight on raids from different eras, slay the inhabitants, and move on -- like an especially bloodthirsty butterfly. So let us flutter to Black Temple, storied raid from &lt;a href=\"the%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;the Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; era and stronghold of one of the most recognizable and iconic characters in all of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; lore: &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. By the time you've finished reading this walk through, you will be prepar-\nWait! Stop. You know what? No. We're not making that joke.\nWe're not going to do it.\nYou'll be\u2026 \"ready\" to face &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Se\u00f1or Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his cronies. With that, let us begin!\nThe Desecrated Temple.\n\"Long ago on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; was the center of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; worship. But the devout &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who prayed there are long dead, slaughtered by marauding, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ically corrupted &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. In the aftermath of the massacre the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; seized the structure and bestowed upon it a new name: the Black Temple.\"\n\"When Illidan the Betrayer fled to Draenor (now called &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;), he ousted the Temple's ruler - the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; - and claimed his throne as the lord of the blasted world. Despite the bitter retribution of his enemies, Illidan has begun to tighten his grip on Outland from within the profaned sanctum, where he awaits one who would challenge his rule.\"\nBlack Temple was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1\"&gt;Patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt; of The Burning Crusade expansion, so that means that we're taking a trip to Outland! After watching Illidan discuss matters of preparation in the expansion trailer, the heroes of Azeroth would finally get to go toe to toe with the man (&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt;? Demon? Demon.) himself.\nLet's Talk Loot.\nThere's some very cool stuff to swipe from the Black Temple, too much to cover here in detail. Here's a sample instead:\nLegendary Weapons.\nDem Warglaives. Unlike many of the other Legendary weapons that can be acquired from &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;'s various bad guys, one or both of the &lt;a href=\"Warglaives%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Warglaives of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt; simply have a chance to drop when you defeat Illidan.\nFaction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Ashtongue&lt;/a&gt; are a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, led by Elder Sage &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, that offered allegiance to Illidan Stormrage to take vengeance upon those who had subjugated and slaughtered their race. The &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt; are an elite faction (also led by Akama) within the Ashtongue that have sworn undying loyalty to Illidan himself. Unfortunately, Illidan proved to be little better than those the Ashtongue had sought vengeance against. The Deathsworn are plotting to betray the Betrayer, they want Illidan's head, and they want your help to take him down and free their people. Akama, and his Ashtongue, will be valuable allies as you infiltrate the Black Temple.\nSlaying foes within the Black Temple will improve your &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with them, and there are quest lines in Outland that will net you rep with them as well.\nAn Outing to Outland.\nIf you've never been to Outland, there are a few different methods to get there. The fastest way is via your faction shrine in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the portal chamber and take the portal to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;. From there it's an easy flight east to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, if you want to go the old-school route, you can visit the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; zone in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to walk through the Dark Portal into &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can fly due south over the yawning, terrifying void straight to Shadowmoon Valley, or you can take the long way around through &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you've reached Shadowmoon Valley, the Black Temple is found in the eastern reaches of the zone. The exterior of the Temple has a lot going on, but to reach the raid, we'll want to head straight up the main thoroughfare. The entrance isn't through the main gates, which are sealed, but rather through a breach in the wall to the south (on the right, if you're facing the Temple gates), through which the instance portal is visible. You'll see a lot of guys running around down there, but fortunately for us, they couldn't manage to assemble a work crew to get that hole patched. Maybe they were distracted by &lt;a href=\"Doomwalker\"&gt;Doomwalker&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, it's easy to get into the Temple. Attunement is no longer necessary, though the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s still exist if you want to experience them and get a little background on what Akama is talking about while you're inside.\nZoning Out(land).\nAs you head into the &lt;a href=\"Karabor%20Sewers\"&gt;Karabor Sewers&lt;/a&gt; you'll pass the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Olum\"&gt;Spirit of Olum&lt;/a&gt;. He can help you teleport back into the Temple should you decide to call it quits for the day or perish before clearing the instance.\nThe Sewers aren't the cleanest of environs, but you can readily skirt most of the critters in here except those standing directly in front of doorways, and at level-90 they don't present much of a threat. Move past Olum, head up the sewer tunnel to the right, and then hang a left. You'll soon see &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Naj%27entus\"&gt;High Warlord Naj'entus&lt;/a&gt; in an alcove to the right.\nHigh Warlord Naj'entus - is one of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, a massive &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; with bizarre shell-like growths erupting from his body. Two &lt;a href=\"Aqueous%20Lord\"&gt;Aqueous Lord&lt;/a&gt;s are hanging out nearby. You can pull the Lords separately and kill them before you engage Naj'entus. Otherwise, they'll attack when you engage the High Warlord anyway. Fighting this boss is pretty straightforward, and shouldn't present much of a challenge. If you're familiar with the original encounter, you'll be happy to hear that he no longer throws his dreaded Spine at solo heroes that oppose him. The downside is that, after a minute passes, he will surround himself with a Tidal Shield that could once be broken by those Spines. Now you'll have to wait it out while he heals, but you should be able to take him down in time.\nOnce Naj'entus is down, turn around and head through the doorway guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, move past a swarm of &lt;a href=\"Aqueous%20Spawn\"&gt;Aqueous Spawn&lt;/a&gt; into the broken sewer pipe, and then follow it upwards to emerge into the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Illidari Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Supremus\"&gt;Supremus&lt;/a&gt; - is an enormous, blue-tinged &lt;a href=\"Abyssal\"&gt;Abyssal&lt;/a&gt; overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; assembled in the Illidari Training Grounds. You'll find him standing near the sealed gates to the Black Temple over on the right--you can't miss him. You'll have to douse him to gain entry.\nThe most dangerous thing about Supremus (though still not particularly dangerous to level-90 characters) is the blue fire he'll spawn at your feet. That's easily dealt with by shifting position to the left or right to avoid standing in the fire, but be sure to position yourself in such a way that his knockback won't hurl you into the troopers who are inconveniently loitering in the area.\nKilling Supremus causes the gates of the temple to spring open. Head up the stairs and past the gate to enter the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Sanctuary of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. You can technically take on any of the four bosses down here in any order, but we'll present the bosses in the same order they were typically slain back when the raid was current content. With that in mind, head to the right to enter the &lt;a href=\"Refectory\"&gt;Refectory&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnless you've got access to stealth, you'll be forced to fight some packs guarding doorways, and even at 90 some of Illidan's servants, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Feral%20Spirit\"&gt;Ashtongue Feral Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s (which see through stealth) have a surprisingly wide aggro radius. When you engage foes in this area, be sure to kill the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Battlelord\"&gt;Ashtongue Battlelord&lt;/a&gt;s first, as their Concussive Throws have the potential to lock you down with long-lasting stuns. The &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Primalist\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; can also cast a Sweeping Wing Clip that will root you temporarily, though that's less troublesome. If your &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have a means of breaking crowd control, it might be advisable to equip a PvP trinket so you can break out of the Concussive Throw stun, just for the sake of convenience.\n&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt; - When you enter the Refectory, Akama will be there waiting for you.\nLet him wait a little longer: you'll make things a bit easier on yourself if you clear out the trash in the room first (remember: kill those Battlelords first!). After you finish clearing the Ashtongue loitering about the Refectory, let Akama know you're ready to roll. He'll begin channeling a beam at the Shade of Akama, and the Channelers who surround the shade can now be slain. Kill off the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Channeler\"&gt;Channelers&lt;/a&gt; and then help Akama defeat the Shade of Akama to free his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, sparking open revolt among the Ashtongue against Illidan. After you slay the Shade, Akama will address his people and the remaining hostile Ashtongue Broken within the Refectory will despawn. Their tribemates throughout the Temple will no longer be hostile \u2013 though they won't help you fight either.\nElder Sage Akama \u2013 One of four major lore characters found in the Black Temple that hearken back to days of Warcraft yore, Akama has been with us since , where he fought alongside Illidan, Kael'thas, and Lady Vashj. Check out the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign if you'd like to see how it all played out.\nTeron Gorefiend - Exit the Refectory and turn right to head upstairs to &lt;a href=\"Gorefiend%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Gorefiend's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;. You can skirt most of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon Orcs&lt;/a&gt; in this area, aside from those patrolling the stairwells or guarding the doorways, but nothing is very dangerous either, so slay to your heart's content.\nThis part of the Temple is pretty linear, so there's not a lot of room for confusion. After you reach the top, Teron Gorefiend will briefly reference his status as the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;first Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; and his many turns through the wheel of death. Clear the two &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Hand of Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; honor guards that are standing near him, otherwise they'll join in when you engage Teron, then set about sending Mr. Gorefiend back around the wheel one more time. (Fun fact: You are responsible for resurrecting Teron over the course of a quest line in Shadowmoon Valley)\nAfter you lay Teron to rest again, backtrack to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Sanctuary of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and head up the stairs onto the center platform. In the alcove to the east, completionist crafters can talk to &lt;a href=\"Okuno\"&gt;Okuno&lt;/a&gt; to repair your gear or purchase &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailoring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; patterns at rep levels from &lt;a href=\"Friendly\"&gt;Friendly&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Honored\"&gt;Honored&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aluyen\"&gt;Aluyen&lt;/a&gt; sells reagents to those who forgot to stock up.\nThe Spirit of Udalo can teleport you to the Chamber of Command after you've cleared out the other bosses.\n&lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reliquary of Souls&lt;/a&gt; - Head up to the right to enter the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Halls of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering, hang an immediate right to head through the soul fragment haunted halls that lead to the Reliquary of Souls. Initially ensconced within a pulsing, rib-cage-esque wrapper, the boss will emerge to show three faces to you, each of which has special effects. After you defeat each face, you'll need to clear out a swarm of &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Soul\"&gt;Enslaved Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, each of which will heal you upon death. In fact, you don't even need to destroy them. They'll swarm around your hero, and eventually detonate with healing. Here's what to expect from each phase:\nNow that the Reliquary has been shut down, head back down to the opposite end of the hallway. Clear the pack of orcs guarding the stairwell, then enter that doorway and continue downstairs where Bonechewer pugilists are pugiling. You can likely skirt them by keeping to the left and sticking to the walls.\n&lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt; - There at the bottom of the ramp you'll find Gurtogg Bloodboil. He's a big red orc, and a pretty rough customer. Between the damage over time from his Bloodboil ability, Acidic Wounds (that also reduce armor), and rapid fire melee strikes, Gurtogg can pump out a surprising amount of damage that ramps up over the course of the fight as those debuffs stack. On top of that, his Bewildering Strike can leave you confused and vulnerable for 8 seconds. He's a real danger even to level-90 characters. High damage output, self healing and defensive cooldowns are key. Abilities that can clear his debuff stacks are especially helpful, but note that only certain effects can clear his Acidic Wound stacks, such as Divine Shield, Ice Block, and Cloak of Shadows. You may need to experiment with different talents and abilities, or even gear up a bit, but you'll lay him low eventually.\nAfter you kill him, head up the stairs to the east and take two quick lefts to leave the Halls of Anguish and return to the Sanctuary of Shadows once more.\nNow that the Shade of Akama, Teron Gorefiend, the Reliquary of Souls, and Gurtogg are all dead, it's time to move on to an altogether more pleasant place: the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Mortal%20Delights\"&gt;Den of Mortal Delights&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt; dwells. Still, don't let the gauzy curtains and comfy cushions fool you: everything here wants to kill you. Don't get too close to the concubines, because despite \u2018Charming' being in the name, they're anything but. Hang a left and move up the stairs deeper into the Den. Much like Gorefiend's Vigil, this route is pretty linear, so it'll be tough to get lost.\nMother Shahraz - A &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ess of the &lt;a href=\"Shivarra\"&gt;Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; race who presides over the Den of Mortal Delights. She's actually pretty tough and deals a decent amount of damage, particularly with Saber Lash, though she's still probably not too dangerous to level-90 characters. Her Silencing Shriek is potentially inconvenient for casters, but it's resistible and likely won't land. She's also the first boss in the Black Temple to have a chance to drop Tier 6 armor pieces, specifically Shoulder items.\nAfter you defeat her, turn right, and head up the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, dodging &lt;a href=\"Promenade%20Sentinel\"&gt;Promenade Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s as you go, until you reach the top of the staircase. Aside from one Sentinel at the top of the staircase, you should be able to dodge most of the trash here if you don't feel like fighting it. Without stealth, you will definitely need to clear one pack of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; standing near the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Command\"&gt;Chamber of Command&lt;/a&gt; on the right.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Council\"&gt;Illidari Council&lt;/a&gt; - Enter the Chamber of Command to face off against Illidan's inner circle: the Illidari Council. The Council is composed of four blood elves who share a health pool:\nThis can be a very tough fight, even for a level-90 character. Strong damage output, self-healing, and interrupts help a great deal. A significant portion of the Council's damage arrives via ground based area of effect (AoE) abilities, so it's important to shift position periodically as new AoEs are cast to minimize your incoming damage. As with Gurtogg, you might have to experiment with abilities, talents, and tactics to figure out what works. You'll have a much easier time dealing with them if you stay out of those AoE's and interrupt Malande's Circle of Healing every time she tries to cast it.\nAfter you finish off the Council, Akama will appear at the base of the dais. Maybe he was there the whole time and didn't help. Regardless, talk to him and then follow him up the ramp on the left side of the Chamber. Once at the top, he'll unlock the door to Illidan's sanctum with the help of the spirits of Olum and Udalo. Follow him to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Summit\"&gt;Temple Summit&lt;/a&gt;, and speak to him again to begin the confrontation with Illidan.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage, the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; - The first &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and twin brother to &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan was an instrumental figure in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. He was imprisoned by his own brother for 10,000 years under the guard of the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, including Maiev Shadowsong and her fellow &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20moon\"&gt;priestesses&lt;/a&gt;, when Tyrande freed him to help face down the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He once went one on one with &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. His actions have left an indelible Illidan-shaped mark on the history of Azeroth and Outland alike, spanning &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt; and World of Warcraft. His story can (and has) filled volumes. He is the most interesting man (Night elf? Demon? Demon.) in the Black Temple. And now you get to kill him.\nYou'll find Illidan kneeling in the center of the Temple Summit, so absorbed in the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn't respond to your presence. When you're ready to take him on, talk to Akama to start a conversation between him and Illidan, where they discuss Akama's inevitable betrayal. Illidan will become vulnerable to attack shortly after their conversation concludes.\nSurprisingly, Illidan will likely prove easier to handle than some of the fights you've already dealt with. In phase one of the fight, you and Akama will face him together. Illidan does a decent amount of damage, but he probably won't represent a tremendous threat. Periodically he'll leap dramatically into the air, and fire a blast down at you that leaves a burning blue blaze on the ground--as always, don't stand in the fire. As phase one ends, Akama will depart (thanks Akama), and Illidan will once again leap into the air. This time he stays there, and hurls his Warglaives to the ground on either side of a grate.\nThis is where the fight gets tricky. Each Warglaive has a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Flame of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt; trapped within it, and they'll emerge from the weapons to attack you. If they are moved too far away from the Warglaives they will enrage, and deal more than enough damage to make short work of even a level-90 hero. To keep that from happening, stand in the center of the grate, and take out both Flames of Azzinoth while standing within the vicinity. After both Flames are put out, Illidan will descend once again.\nYou'll re-engage him, and after you do more damage, he'll take some time to lock you in an unbreakable Shadow Prison and talk some trash. Drop some more damage on Illidan, and Maiev Shadowsong will arrive when he reaches 30% health, contributing to the fight by dropping traps you can use to increase the damage that Illidan takes. If you take it easy on your dps output, you may witness Illidan assume his demonic transformation!\nAfter the Betrayer is laid low, he relates to Maiev that she should feel bad. And she does. Which motivates her to do some pretty crazy things later on.\nWrapping Up.\nThus ends your battle with Illidan Stormrage. That wraps up our walk-through of Black Temple, but there is more yet to come, and we'll be taking you on a guided tour of more classic raids in the future.\nIn the meantime, share your stories of Black Temple glory (and loot!) in the comments!"}

When the dust settles, the world won't be the same again.\nThis is just the start of things to come and you'll make your way through the starting experience at the Tomb of Sargeras. Newly boosted and returning players will also be provided a separate introductory experience before they head off to assault the Tomb of Sargeras, which allows for the Broken Shore to be entirely focused on delivering an epic and engaging experience for the heroes of Azeroth.\nRunning with the Demon Hunter.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; before, the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter%20starting%20experience\"&gt;Demon Hunter starting experience&lt;/a&gt; will help define what it means to be a Demon Hunter and bridge the gap in the story between what occurred during &lt;a href=\"the%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;the Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the emergence of this Epic Hero Class. You'll learn more about what &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; was really doing at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and make your way through &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;. Shattered by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, this former prison world is now the resting place of the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; \u2014the key to traversing the countless worlds of the Burning Legion.\nMardum isn't a place for the faint of heart, and you'll encounter new and more powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"Imp%20mother\"&gt;Imp Mother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion also has some epic new architecture and nefarious devices you'll be able to get your hands on so that you can fight (&lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt;) fire with fire. You'll learn new spells as you go and will steal power directly from the demons around you.\nDemon Hunters will also get the &lt;a href=\"Felsaber\"&gt;Felsaber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mount\"&gt;Mount&lt;/a&gt;\u2013 a gift from the ultimate Demon Hunter, Illidan.\nMardum is just the beginning of the Demon Hunter's adventures and after fighting to escape imprisonment at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s, you will eventually integrate with your faction,establish your &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order%20Hall\"&gt;Class Order Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and seek out your &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons. The sacrifice of these brave &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; to become Demon Hunters will not be in vain. Their power will be needed in the fight against the Burning Legion.\nPiecing Together the Broken Isles.\nYou'll be adventuring within the Broken Isles to search out &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; relics known as the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, which are the only hope of re-sealing the Tomb of Sargeras and ending the Legion threat. These zones include:\nThe Broken Shore: You'll start your adventure within the Broken Isles and find the Tomb of Sargeras here. The pitched battle that starts off your journey is bound to change not only you, but Azeroth itself.\n&lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val-sharah&lt;/a&gt;: Within these densely forested lands, you'll find the very heart of &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the location of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and where the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; first trained &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. You'll also find key locations such as the tainted &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and the dungeon &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; (an elven fortress that dates back to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;: This is home to the remnants of the ancient night elves ravaged by the wrath of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. It is a cursed land rife with many mysteries and serves as home to what remains of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;: The location of one of the largest single mountains in Azeroth it is a rugged and beautiful terrain, that serves as home to three &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;. They are a people with a highly evolved culture locked in a bitter struggle against savage drogbar that threaten their lands. \n&lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;: The land encapsulates the harsh beauty of this &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt; home. Here, you'll learn more about the vrykrul culture, including the origins of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; and the terrifying &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, you will contend with the &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;vrykul God-King&lt;/a&gt; as he races to claim the zone's Pillar of Creation on behalf of his Legion masters. This will take you into the very heavens where the greatest champions of the vrykul await to test your worth.\n&lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;: All roads lead to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient elven metropolis at the heart of the Broken Isles. The corrupted &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; fuels the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; elves and provides them the sustenance they need to survive. Those who are cut off from it live as &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, their bodies wasting away as they search desperately for magical energy to sustain them. Atop the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;palace of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the walls of the massive city, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; Gul'dan plots the next step of the Legion's grand scheme\u2026\n&lt;a href=\"Thal%27dranath\"&gt;Thal'dranath&lt;/a&gt;: Much like &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, this zone will become available a bit later in our story.\nWhere Do We Go From Here.\nRather than linear pacing through the various zones, players will be able to pick and choose the zone they wish to adventure through, moving from one to another as they see fit. This is accomplished not by adjusting the player's stats, but rather by scaling the inhabitants of the Broken Isles to the player's level, making it simpler than ever before to connect and quest with friends. Quest rewards will likewise scale with the player as you make your way toward level 110 with your your artifact weapon helping you stay ahead of the power. Just beware, non-scaling foes will also be waiting for maximum level play.\nThe outdoor end game of Legion strives to capture the best of recent expansions' varied approaches, providing players with choices in their activities, a sense of purpose, and opportunities to continue to advance the story wrapped within a structure that provides meaningful rewards. Because of the scaling nature of the Broken Isles, we are also able to make use of the entire continent of the Broken Isles as a max-level playground. At max level, there will be varied and cycling &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;s available throughout the Broken Isles \u2013 imagine these as &lt;a href=\"garrison%20missions\"&gt;garrison missions&lt;/a&gt;\u2026 except for YOU! You'll be able to pick and choose from a variety of missions and objectives from core reputation to PvP, profession gathering, world bosses, and diverting minigames.\nWe couldn't end here without mentioning the various &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s that are planned for Legion. The stories for these locations will be integrated into the ongoing zone flow as you make your way through the Broken Isles. You'll be able to step into the Emerald Nightmare at last and make your way from the catacombs beneath of Suramar Palace to its highest spires where Gul'dan awaits. \nRaid Dungeons.\n&lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;\nLocation: Val'sharrah\nBosses: 7\nYou'll need to ascend Shaladrassil to enter the Nightmare, a corrupted version of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; that mirrors our own world but has now fallen into the deepest shadow.\n&lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Grand Palace of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;\nLocation: Suramar\nBosses: 10\nThis is Gul'dans base of operations and the center of the nightborne civilization.\nDungeons.\nThere will be 5 level-up dungeons: &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou'll be able to tackle these in any order as you level up, and you'll need to venture into several of these locations in order to recover the Pillars of Creation.\nThere will also be 5 additional dungeons that unlock at level 110: &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, Black Rook Hold, &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Suramar Noble District&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Suramar Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the goal of keeping dungeons relevant in the endgame, both in terms of difficulty and rewards, we'll also be making some exciting changes to our &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt; system in Legion. Challenge dungeons will no longer scale players down to a fixed power level, but will instead offer a system of endless increasing difficulty, with commensurate rewards. Each week, players can obtain a Challenger's Keystone that allows them to begin a specific dungeon challenge at a specific difficulty level, possibly including additional modifiers (e.g. all enemies explode shortly after dying!). Rather than multiple Gold, Silver, and Bronze cutoff times, there will be a single time to beat, and if you are successful in doing so, you can upgrade your Keystone to a higher level of difficulty and rewards! You'll earn item rewards from completing your Keystone challenge (even if you fail to beat the cutoff time), as well as a lucrative jackpot chest at the end of the week depending on the highest level dungeon you were able to complete. Our goal is to keep dungeons as a central part of the Legion experience through the expansion, offering a unique and different endgame path as an alternative (or supplement) to raiding. \nThere's much more to the panel than what we've covered here so if you want to learn more, we suggest watching it for yourself with the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%20Virtual%20Ticket\"&gt;BlizzCon Virtual Ticket&lt;/a&gt; and then go to our programming page to view the VOD in HD.\nWhat did you think of the new world and content revelations presented by the panel?"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Scarab\"&gt;Call of the Scarab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"micro-event\"&gt;micro-event&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nOn January 23, 2006, a bloody war was triggered by a simple sound: the banging of a &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;gong&lt;/a&gt;. No rallying fanfare, no bloodthirsty yell; just an eerie silence. Those long, uneasy seconds of dread. The calm before the storm.\nStanding shoulder-to-shoulder before the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;, no one could have predicted what would happen\u2014an epic ten-hour battle that claimed the lives of thousands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s bravest\u2014or fully comprehended the effect it would have.\nAction First, Faction Second.\nThat's not to say the battle at the &lt;a href=\"gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; came as a surprise. When the menace of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; turned into an urgent threat, leaders across the world pored over plans and forged unlikely connections as pressure mounted. Both factions knew war was coming and personal glory was a hubris no-one could risk. Any notion that one army could defeat &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; and his colossal battalion was soon abandoned as fantasy.\nIt was a unique time: scattered armies with varying allegiances were thrown together and faction pride was put aside. Let's be clear: the battle at &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; was won purely on the principle \u201cunited we stand, divided we fall.\u201d\nWarmongering vs. Gold Hungering.\nThis uneasy alliance was not without its critics. Some showed their disapproval by shunning the war effort altogether, but others expressed opposition through acts of aggression. Rogue elements on both sides, unwilling to stomach this perceived betrayal of their faction, did not sit idle. Just as neutral auction houses became a tool for factions to share resources, they also became virtual battlegrounds. Crucial resources were picked up for next-to-nothing and sold on for personal gain. As with all wars, those who profit aren't always the brave.\nThe sheer scale of that war effort is almost unimaginable when we live in a time of extended storage and fast mail. But back then, backpacks and cloth stacks were smaller. Getting precious resources gathered, sorted, and sent took many hours. And it took several weeks to source bandages, food, and equipment\u2014resources that were in high demand and would soon dwindle.\nThe Importance of Remembrance.\nWe would do well, in these dark times, to remember the courage and spirit of those who were there at the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj. We must have long memories if we're to make quick work of the demon forces we now face.\nFrom January 21\u201323 we ask that you join us as we remember the fallen and celebrate the victory. All of Azeroth are invited to a special holiday, \u2018Call of the Scarab,' where we will gather to perform acts of remembrance and share our factions' pride.\nPlayers who are in a different phase can speak to &lt;a href=\"Rhonormu\"&gt;Rhonormu&lt;/a&gt; near the gong to enter the correct event phase.\nWere you there? Share your memories with us in the comments below."}

Once a peaceful place of worship, corruption has turned protector into poisoner, with &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; at the helm - and the powerful &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; has one aim: to annihilate those who seek to return the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to its resting place.\nFor Mephistroth, your attempt to infiltrate the Cathedral of Eternal Night is a deeply personal matter. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s among you killed his favored general, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, stringing up his corpse and heart in &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;your Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; as both a warning and source of power. As for the rest of you, Mephistroth is seeking retribution for your recent brutal attacks on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The memories are fresh. And revenge is sweet.\nDeveloper Insights.\n\"\"We're excited to add a new 5-player dungeon to complement the Broken Shore zone and - ultimately - the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; raid. Players' ultimate purpose on the Broken Shore is the culmination of all their efforts thus far in &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;: Each of the five &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; must be used in a particular place within the Tomb of Sargeras to halt the Legion's invasion and save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; - and the dungeon tells the first part of that story.\"\n\"\"While the raid delves deep into the foundations of the Tomb, revealing mysteries and varied horrors, this dungeon ascends the spire, focusing on the dark majesty of a tarnished monument to the glory of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Entering atop a balcony overlooking the grand central hall of the Cathedral (a room that will later serve as the setting for the first boss encounter in the raid), players begin a climb that will take them past moonlit hanging gardens, towards the pinnacle of the tower where the Aegis must be placed. While the dungeon is, of course, rife with Legion presence, we deliberately focused the areas of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; contamination around the portions of the structure closest to the source of &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;fel storm&lt;/a&gt;. This amplifies the contrast and allows us to showcase large sections of untarnished elven architecture.\"\"\nCathedral of Eternal Night will be available in Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic plus difficulties.\nEncounters and Bosses.\nAgronox.\nThis ancient served the night elf priestesses of the Temple of Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal state.\n\"Overview\"\nAgronox corrupts the garden he once tended and turns it against players. Quickly defeat his Lasher minions to avoid being overwhelmed. Run from Choking Vines before you are strangled. Poisonous Spores inflict increasing amounts of damage over time.\nThrashbite the Scornful.\nSmashspite's detestable brother, Thrashbite, has been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the Cathedral's grand library. The dimwitted mo'arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning, feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and tramples priceless tomes.\n\"Overview\"\nThrashbite the Scornful favors imprecise, sweeping attacks with little regard for his surroundings. Trick him into going toe-to-toe with something thicker than himself, though, and he just might lose his balance. Beware: this ancient library contains many magical tomes with unpredictable enchantments!\nDomatrax.\nWith the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.\n\"Overview\"\nUpon reaching 90% and 50% health, additional portals open up to allow greater numbers of the Legion's soldiers to pour into the tomb. The Aegis of Aggramar provides protection against the Legion's attacks, but if drained of all its energy, this aura will fall.\nMephistroth.\nMephistroth orchestrates the Legion's invasion from the Broken Shore. With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line, Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of Aggramar.\n\"Overview\"\nMephistroth uses shadow magic to attack the party until he reaches 100% energy. Once his energy is full, Mephistroth fades away and strikes at the heroes from the shadows. During this, Illidan must be protected within the Aegis of Aggramar long enough for him to pull the dreadlord back into the light.\nPrepared for battle?\nYou have scant time to prepare, heroes. We wish you luck as you return the Aegis and take on Mephistroth. For Azeroth!"}

But the Banished One has a terrible new champion in his service\u2014a cruel instrument of despair conscripted by Sylvanas Windrunner, capable of instilling dread into the hearts of Azeroth\u2019s heroes like no creature of the Shadowlands.\nThe Covenants Strike Back.\nReturn to the Maw with the restored strength of the kyrian, night fae, necrolords, and venthyr and together fight back to reclaim the Shadowlands from the Jailer\u2019s sinister encroachment.

Dragged from the hidden byways of the In-Between, this landmass has its own strange creatures and brims with mysteries the likes of which the Shadowlands has never seen.

You\u2019ll need to work alongside other members of your faction to contribute the resources needed open the ancient citadel\u2019s gates and begin your siege on the Ruins of Ahn\u2019Qiraj and the Temple of Ahn\u2019Qiraj.\nBoth Horde and the Alliance will need to bring a steady stream of supplies to the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar or to the Military Ward in Ironforge.

With two starting zones to choose from, which one should you choose? You don\u2019t have to choose just one. Both offer a fair amount of glorious adventuring for heroes of the Alliance and Horde. There are local factions for you to help, enemies to thwart, quests to be completed, achievements to be attained, and you can do them all.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nBorean Tundra (68 \u2013 72).\nLocated in the southwest corner of Northrend, Borean Tundra is primarily a large, flat glacial zone devoid of vegetation, with small areas of rimy grass and rock. To the north of this sprawling land is Coldarra, an intimidating fortress of ice and stone tucked in a pocket protected by ragged arctic cliffs.\nThe Horde and Alliance both have strongholds in this zone, and there are zeppelins and boats to get you where you need to go.\nWarsong Hold.\nAn impregnable fortress that is a testament to the Horde\u2019s tenacity takes center stage. Heroes of the Horde who have flown here from afar will begin their journey through Northrend from this stronghold after diminishing the Nerubian numbers that plague it.\nValiance Keep.\nThis Alliance stronghold is under constant turmoil as the Lich King\u2019s army continues to lay siege. From this keep, our Alliance champions who have landed in Northrend face the first of their challenges\u2014defense against a Nerubian threat.\nInhabitants.\nThe tuskarr are prominent throughout Northrend, with their capital city of Kaskala located in the eastern part of the Borean Tundra. Kaskala is available to both the Horde and Alliance, and players will be tasked with helping the Kalu\u2019ak tuskarr.\nAs you adventure and explore, you\u2019ll meet other friends and foes along the way. Some of these are the blue dragonflight, the Drakkari tribe of ice trolls, the Undead Scourge, and the taunka, ancient relatives of the tauren.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHowling Fjord (68 \u2013 72).\nThe Howling Fjord is in the southeastern part of Northrend and is home to the vrykul of Utgarde Keep.

This is the beginning of the journey through Northrend for the Horde heroes who have landed here. They\u2019ll be tasked with assisting the plague development efforts designed to bring an end to the Lich King.\nValgarde Keep.\nDespite attacks from the vrykul from land and sky, Valgarde Keep maintains a heavily fortified staging ground for the Alliance. Courageous Alliance heroes will be challenged to help learn more about the aggressive vrykul and why they have returned after being dormant for so long.\nInhabitants.\nThe vrykul, an ancient race of half-giants, are the primary inhabitants of the Howling Fjord. Their architecture can be seen throughout the zone as they built their civilization. As you journey, you\u2019ll come face to face with this once forgotten race, along with other denizens of this region.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nGetting Around.\nThere are plenty of flight paths, but why fly when you can hop on the shell of a colossal, carrot-loving turtle? These massive, water-bound turtles ferry riders between Unu\u2019pe in Borean Tundra to Moa\u2019ki Harbor in Dragonblight.\nFrom Moa\u2019ki Harbor, players can get a connecting turtle taxi to Kamagua in Howling Fjord if they choose. Remember to grab the flight paths whenever possible\u2014sometimes, taking a turtle is slow-going.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nEverything You Need, Almost.\nIn each major hub, there is enough to get players what they need without continually traveling back and forth between the main capital cities.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nBuilt thousands of years ago to house the kaldorei\u2019s arcane secrets, the formerly great city of Eldre\u2019Thalas now lies in ruin, writhing with warped twisted forces. Competing covens once fought for control of Dire Maul\u2019s corrupted energy, but they have since settled into uneasy truces, choosing to exploit the power within their own territories rather than continue to battle over the entire complex.\nLocated in Feralas, Dire Maul is a sprawling 5-player dungeon encompassed within three wings. Adventurers can explore its ancient corridors for fun and profit and even infiltrate the entrenched ogre tribe on a Tribute Run to claim powerful rewards and buffs. You can also battle your faction-mates in the free-for-all outdoor PVP arena \u201cThe Maul\u201d within the Broken Commons outside of the dungeon. It\u2019s a great way to hone your PvP skills among friends.\nHow to Get there:.\nBosses: 16&lt;br&gt;\nLevel Range: 54-60 (Recommended 55-60)\nQuesting.\nThere are many quests available to undertake within Dire Maul beginning at level 54, but it\u2019s recommended that players reach level 55 to have a higher chance of success. Dire Maul is a particularly dangerous dungeon for the unprepared and you\u2019ll need dependable teamwork to make your way through all three of its wings.\nGetting Keyed Up.\nIf you want to go further than the East Wing of Dire Maul, you\u2019ll need to procure a couple of additional keys, have a rogue with a high enough lockpick skill, use a Large Seaforium Charge, or use a Truesilver Skeleton Key (which can be created by blacksmiths) to make your way into the two additional wings.\nTo get a key to the remaining areas of the dungeon, you\u2019ll need to track down (and chase down) the imp Pusillin in the East Wing who can drop Crescent Keys. He\u2019ll lead you on a merry chase, but don\u2019t be fooled when you think you have him cornered at last.\nYou\u2019ll need an additional key to make it all the way into King Gordok\u2019s room as well\u2014 the Gordok Inner Door Key. This key can be looted from Guard Mol\u2019dar in the Gor\u2019dok Commons.\nFortune Favors the Brave.\nDire Maul has plenty of challenges to undertake and loot to glean from within its halls if you know where to look and includes many Horde, Alliance, and class-specific quests.\nYou can also check out Wowhead\u2019s Librams Guide for more details.\n[\" List of Class Quests and Rewards \"]\nMages can undertake the quest, \u201cArcane Refreshment\u201d to learn the spell, \u201cConjure Water\u201d which gives them the ability to conjure 10 bottles of crystal water at a time. You\u2019ll need to defeat Hydrospawn in the east wing of Dire Maul to loot the Hydrospawn Essence and turn it in to Lorekeeper Lydros in the Athenaeum.\nWarlock and Paladin Epic Mounts.\nBoth warlocks and paladins can earn an epic mount beginning at level 60\u2014but they\u2019ll need a little help from their friends to claim their new rides.\nWarlock players will be able to follow a series of quests to earn the Dreadsteed of Xoroth epic mount. The questline begins with Mor\u2019zul Bloodbringer in the Burning Steppes where he\u2019ll detail what you\u2019ll need to complete in order to summon and capture this steed.\nFor paladins who have reached level 60, you\u2019ll begin your venture to claim the epic Charger mount with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind starting with the quest, \u201cAncient Equine Spirit.\u201d\nThere are many available guides for players who would like a step-by-step guide including on classicWoW.live and Wowhead (warlock, paladin).\nPaying Tribute.\nThere\u2019s more than one way to get through the North wing of Dire Maul. You can take part in what\u2019s known as a tribute run. The goal is to avoid killing all the bosses up to King Gordok. Once you\u2019ve reached the king, you can kill him and claim your place as the new king of the ogres.\nTo create the suit, you\u2019ll need the following items: Bring 4 bolts of Runecloth, 8 Rugged Leathers, 2 Rune Threads, and 1 Ogre Tannin to Knot Thimblejack and he\u2019ll create a Gordok Ogre Suit for you. This will allow you to disguise yourself as one of the Gordok Ogres.\nFor a complete walkthrough, check out Wowhead\u2019s handy guide.\nForging Quel\u2019Serrar.\nLast, but certainly not least, paladins and warriors can create and claim the epic weapon, Quel\u2019serrar.\nTo begin your quest to add this weapon to your armory, you\u2019ll need to collect Foror\u2019s Compendium of Dragon Slaying from within Dire Maul. You\u2019ll need to turn it into Lorekeeper Lydros in the Athenaeum within the dungeon. He\u2019ll give you A Dull and Flat Elven Blade. Your next step will involve a confrontation within Onyxia\u2019s Lair where you\u2019ll need her to breathe fire on the Unfired Ancient Blade, then drive the blade into her defeated corpse. Once you\u2019ve completed your epic quest, you\u2019ll receive Quel\u2019Serrar.\nIf you're looking for even more information, check out Wowhead's handy guides.\nWhat are you waiting for?

Many Deathknights begin their training within this quarter under the direction of its powerful lieutenants.\nPlague Wing (Plague Quarter).\nRife with monstrosities twisted by the undead plague, the Plague Quarter produces and refines the plague into highly efficient weapons, bent on destroying all of humanity as a part of Kel\u2019Thuzad\u2019s undead army.\nSpider Wing (Arachnid Quarter).\nThe Arachnid Quarter houses undead nerubians, an ancient race of intelligent arachnoid beings. Normally highly reclusive and suspicious of outsiders, living nerubians fought valiantly against the undead Scourge but were overwhelmed by their numbers.

Heroes of the Alliance will be able to find the following services:\nNeutral Settlements.\nThere are a handful of neutral settlements, but only a few offer supplies that will be needed during your adventurous exploration.\nPoints of Interest.\nUlduar.\nThere have been whispers of a great evil at work behind the fall of the titan-forged city of Ulduar. Heroes seeking the truth can find it in the corridors of this ancient compound. Few have braved the perils of Ulduar and returned to tell of their discoveries.\nHalls of Stone: This is the first instance in Ulduar and is protected by storm giants and crystal golems. Only the bravest adventurers can uncover more about the titans and their actions in Ulduar.\nHalls of Lightning: Ulduar's second instance can be found in the eastern part of the titan city. It is here that Loken, closely guarded by elementals and surrounded by his powerful servants, commands his forces.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nIcecrown (77\u201380).\nIcecrown is a glacial wasteland of blighted black ice and rock. Here, the stage is set for the final battle against the Lich King, or so you thought.\nPoint of Interest.\nTrial of the Champion.\nThis instance is located in the northeast corner of Icecrown. It is here that High lord Tirion Fordring presents his test of courage, endurance, and teamwork to cull those lacking the moral conviction to enter Icecrown Citadel.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nLocated in the frozen wasteland of Icecrown, the Scourge's almost impregnable fortress casts a deathly shadow across the land. From within the brooding Icecrown Citadel, the Lich King commands his undead Scourge to scour the world of all life. Champions among the races of Azeroth have stood against the Lich King only to be slaughtered mercilessly and forced to serve in his army of undead horrors. The final raid instance in Wrath of the Lich King Classic and the battle you have been pushing towards will pit you against the Lich King and some of his most vile servants.\nForge of Souls: The first wing of the Icecrown Citadel dungeon complex known as the Frozen Halls. The Forge is a massive production facility with soul grinders, the latest foul construct in the Lich King's arsenal.\nPit of Saron: This second wing in the Frozen Halls puts players in a position to rescue prisoners taken by the Scourge and forced to mine saronite or face torture and certain undeath.\nHalls of Reflection: The third and final wing of the Frozen Halls will have players enter the Lich King's chambers and engage in battle against the cursed sword, Frostmourne, before being confronted by the Lich King himself.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nSupplies and More!\nPreparing for the Journey\nKeeping yourself supplied is challenging, and available services are limited within The Storm Peaks and Icecrown. Flight paths are readily available to other parts of Northrend and other hubs. Most of what you'll need to survive can be procured without traveling to the capital cities unless you need the Bank or Auction House. Don't forget to set your Hearthstone before you go.\nWe're excited to bring Wrath of the Lich King Classic to you.

You can exchange Emblems of Conquest or Valor for Emblems of Heroism at a money changer in Dalaran, such as Usuri Brightcoin located at The Cantrips &amp; Crows Tavern in The Underbelly.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nNew Emblem of Conquest Vendors.\nNew vendors in Dalaran located in the Sunreaver\u2019s Sanctuary for the Horde and The Silver Enclave for the Alliance now accept Emblems of Conquest in exchange for powerful loot like neck, waist, hands, and leg slot items, as well as select Raid Set items and Deadly Gladiator PvP Sets.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThe Argent Tournament Begins!\nAs the might of the Scourge wanes under the pressure of Azeroth's heroes, the Argent Crusade have taken a foothold in Arthas's backyard. Off the northeastern coast of Icecrown, they have sounded the call for the most bold and brave adventurers of the Horde and Alliance to take part in the Argent Tournament. Representatives of all ten faction capitals, from Undercity to The Exodar, have traveled to the tournament grounds to find champions among their heroes who will prepare for the inevitable battle against the enemy of all living beings, the Lich King.\nWhile the tournament grounds are still under construction, you can still travel to Icecrown and visit the Argent Tournament Grounds daily quest hub to prepare for the challenges ahead.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nConquer the Arena in Season 6.\nAfter the regional weekly maintenance starting on January 17, a new Arena Season will begin.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nLearn more about Zul\u2019Drak and Sholazar Basin\u2014 two challenging Northrend zones beckoning Azeroth\u2019s bravest heroes.\nVenture into Zul\u2019Drak, a Scourge-infested wasteland inhabited by Drakkari ice trolls but beware of Scourge trying to infiltrate this zone to support the Lich King\u2019s evil efforts. Unlike any other Northrend zone, Sholazar Basin is a tropical anomaly overflowing with vicious wildlife, where champions will find themselves in the middle of a local faction war.&lt;hr&gt;\nZul'Drak (74\u201377).\nThe amphitheater of Zu\u2019Drak is a formidable temple area in east Northrend, between Grizzly Hills and Storm Peaks. This contested zone boasts one of the most inhospitable climates. While the southern part of this zone is a harsh land plagued by death, the northern part is blanketed in freezing ice and snow. This area is home to the Drakkari, a vicious tribe of ice trolls rumored to practice ritual sacrifice of their ancient loa gods to counter the threat from the Scourge.\nGetting There.\nThere are five entrances to Zul\u2019Drak. One in Grizzly Hills to the south, another on the western border of Crystalsong Forest, in the southwest, there\u2019s an entrance through Jintha\u2019kalar Passage in Dragonblight, and another through Drak\u2019atal Passage located in Drak\u2019Tharon Keep.\nInhabitants.\nAlong with this region\u2019s primary inhabitants of crazed Drakkari ice trolls, Scourge, Nerubians, and elementals, you\u2019ll encounter other denizens while you adventure.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nSholazar Basin (75\u201378).\nIn the middle of Northrend, between Borean Tundra and Icecrown Glacier, lies a tropical anomaly. A jungle thrives amid the ice and snow of Northrend, beckoning adventurous champions. Pylons erected by the titans have kept this region\u2019s climate temperate and mostly safe from the Scourge, but one of the pylons has fallen, and the protection barrier has broken.\nThe basin is filled with wildlife, thick vegetation, and hot springs. Scalding water jets out of geysers and steam vents that dot the region.\nUpon entering Sholazar Basin, heroes will find themselves in the middle of a war between the Frenzyheart Tribe of wolvar and the gorlocs of the Oracles. Reputation can be gained from either faction. However, killing members of one faction will align you with the other. If you change your mind and wish to align with the opposing faction, there is a way to change factions.\nDuring Children\u2019s Week in Dalaran, if you have aligned yourself with the Oracles, you\u2019ll be able to escort Little Orphan Roo of the Oracles. Likewise, if you\u2019ve aligned yourself with the Frenzyheart Tribe, you\u2019ll be able to escort Little Orphan Kekek of the Wolvar.\nGetting There.\nIf you don\u2019t have Cold Weather Flying yet and you\u2019re traveling on foot from Borean Tundra, you\u2019ll follow the road north. Alternatively, if you can get to Krasus\u2019 Landing in Dalaran, you can pick up the Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary? quest from Archmage Pentarus. Take the offered ride to Sholazar and talk with Monte Muzzleshot for the turn-in. You\u2019ll then get the follow-up quest, Welcome to Sholazar Basin\n&lt;hr&gt;\nSupplies and More!\nKeeping yourself supplied isn\u2019t too tricky, but available services are limited within Zul\u2019Drak and Sholazar Basin. Smaller, neutral hubs are available to Alliance and Horde heroes, with flight paths readily available to other parts of Northrend.\nSholazar Basin.\nMost of what you\u2019ll need to survive can be procured without traveling to the capital cities unless you need the Bank or Auction House. Don\u2019t forget to set your Hearthstone before you go.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWe\u2019re excited to bring Wrath of the Lich King Classic to you.

Beyond the jungle, ancient emerald dragons rise, the insidious Silithid begin to swarm, and perhaps the most dangerous sport of all gets underway: the Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Extravaganza.\nZul\u2019Gurub.\nDeep within the jungles of Stranglethorn, an ancient troll city full of untold peril awaits. Do you have what it takes to delve into its mysteries? Assemble a band of hardy explorers and make your way to Zul\u2019Gurub a max-level, 20-player raid instance with 120 new rare and epic items to procure from its verdant tree-lined avenues and lost temples.\nRaid Bosses: 13&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: 60&lt;br&gt;\nLocation: Stranglethorn Vale&lt;br&gt;\nReputation: Zandalar Tribe&lt;br&gt;\nInstance Reset: 3 Days\nGetting There.\nThe entrance to Zul\u2019Gurub is located just east of Lake Nazferiti in Stranglethorn Vale. Horde players can fly into Grom\u2019gol Base Camp and travel east past the lake to reach the dungeon. Alliance players will need to travel south from Duskwood and then head east at the lake.\nBoss Encounters.\n13 total boss encounters await within Zul\u2019Gurub, with four of those available on a rotating basis as part of the Edge of Madness encounter, which allows access to one of these bosses per reset. \nBefore you face Hakkar, you\u2019ll first want to first defeat his five priests to improve your odds of success. If left alive, they\u2019ll lend their powers to the Blood God, making him near unstoppable. They can be defeated in any order, and each has a chance to drop rewards your party may find useful in your journey through Zul\u2019Gurub.\nTo the Victor\u2026.\nGreat rewards are waiting within Zul\u2019Gurub, including 5 epic pieces of gear that can be earned through quest rewards with enough reputation with the Zandalar Tribe. If fortune favors you, you can also collect the Swift Razzashi Raptor and Swift Zulian Tiger mounts.\nCheck out Wowhead\u2019s guide for more information.\nThe Dragons of Nightmare.\nSomething is amiss in the Emerald Dream. Immense dragons of the Green Dragonflight have been sighted guarding the portals at the Great Trees . . . but these noble creatures have been imbued with an ominous new presence, bereft of the peace for which Ysera is known. To confront these Dragons of Nightmare, you\u2019ll need to call forth your staunchest allies\u2014for their powers are formidable, and they will not hesitate to crush any who draw near.\nStranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.\nGrab your fishing pole (and your sword)\u2014the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is about to get underway along the coasts of Stranglethorn Vale! Early on the appointed day, friendly neighborhood goblins will visit Ironforge and Orgrimmar to inform aspiring anglers of the grand tournament and give instructions on how to participate. At the appropriate time, a shout will ring out across Stranglethorn to bait your hooks and cast your lines!\nThe Stirring of the Silithid.\nThe arid sands of Silithus are shifting. Something is awakening beyond the wall to the south. Aid the Druids of the Cenarion Circle as they delve into the mysteries of the desert, and seek the answers behind the Twilight Hammer\u2019s mysterious presence in the area.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s mightiest protectors have defeated a seemingly endless procession of memorable foes over the years, and while the legions of heroes have since moved on to more pressing threats, those old foes from the past still brood in their lairs. There they sit, lording over their loot, agonizing over their defeats, just waiting for a chance to unleash vengeance. And you can head back into their strongholds to put them back in their place.\nWe'd like to help those who have never given taking on an older raid a shot to feel more comfortable exploring the older content. Even if visiting and looting these locales is old hat, you might still find something of value within. If you've never given it a try at all, there are actually plenty of good reasons to visit older instances:\nGoing Solo.\nAs a level 90 character, you should be able to beat most Raid encounters from classic through &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; without breaking a sweat. If you're particularly well geared and have the right &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; tools at your disposal, even &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; encounters might be possible. Gear, class &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, and individual skill all play a significant role in what you can actually handle. Please keep in mind that &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; isn't balanced with soloing past raid content in mind, so some classes might be better suited to the task than others. You might want to bring a friend along if a particular encounter is proving too much for you to handle. That said, it can add to the fun and challenge to see what you can do on your own.\nWe've delved into other raids from the past, like &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Black%20Temple%20Beat%20Down\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Now we prepare to make a house call on the early days of &lt;a href=\"the%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;the Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. That's right, next stop: &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nPositioned as the first raid in the newly released Burning Crusade expansion, &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; houses mystery upon mystery. Let us unlock the gate, pull open the creaking doors, and explore the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;'s creepy abode.\nMedivh's Magnificent Mansion of Madness.\nKarazhan finally became accessible to intrepid explorers in Burning Crusade &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.3\"&gt;patch 2.0.3&lt;/a&gt;., way back in 2007 (yes, it's been that long). Like the flavor text says, to get to Karazhan, you'll need to get to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and then travel to Deadwind Pass. Karazhan is festering in the southern reaches of the zone, and unless you have &lt;a href=\"Atiesh\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, you'll have to fly or ride to get there, as there aren't any flight points in the area.\nItems.\nHere are some of the more notable items you'll find inside the instance:\nMount.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%3AFiery%20Warhorse%27s%20Reins\"&gt;:Fiery Warhorse's Reins&lt;/a&gt; is a rare drop from &lt;a href=\"Attumen%20the%20Huntsman\"&gt;Attumen the Hunstman&lt;/a&gt;, and he has fangs.\nHe has fangs.\nFaction.\nThere's a lot of history here.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; in order to spy on &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, and after his death, the Violet Eye stuck around, acting as a resistance to the dark forces that remain in Medivh's tower. Violet Eye &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; can be gained by killing most everything inside Karazhan and completing associated questlines. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Alturus\"&gt;Archmage Alturus&lt;/a&gt; to begin with &lt;a href=\"%3AArcane%20Disturbances\"&gt;:Arcane Disturbances&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3ARestless%20Activity\"&gt;:Restless Activity&lt;/a&gt;. Nearby, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Leryda\"&gt;Archmage Leryda&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; that rewards both reputation and an epic ring.\nBreaking and Entering.\nLet's not soft-peddle this -- Karazhan is confusing on the inside. But it's easy enough to find and enter: just head to Deadwind Pass between Duskwood and the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. It's pretty much the only thing in the zone.\nHaunted House.\nYour first steps inside are in a foyer with three exits. Facing &lt;a href=\"Berthold\"&gt;Berthold&lt;/a&gt; the doorman, you'll find that Attumen the Huntsman is to the left, stairs up to the second level and &lt;a href=\"Moroes%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; are straight ahead, and the passageway to the right leads to &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hound\"&gt;hound&lt;/a&gt;s (with an optional, random boss). \nThere isn't anything in the whole place that should pose much of a threat to a level 90 character. You can move about the tower at your leisure, easily taking down as many groups of enemies as you care to round up, and steamrolling the bosses. As you work your way around the first couple of areas, Karazhan may even seem to be a pushover, but you'll want to take it in some semblance of order, or you'll spend a lot of time backtracking.\nAttumen the Hunstman - In the stables to the left, you'll find &lt;a href=\"Midnight\"&gt;Midnight&lt;/a&gt;. Attack that horse to start the encounter, and Attumen will join the fray. Once you've depleted Midnight's health, Attumen saddles up and it's a matter of taking them both down.\nAs we said above, this boss has been known to drop a ride that is highly sought by mount collectors. \nGo back, then turn left to head upstairs to the &lt;a href=\"Banquet%20Hall\"&gt;Banquet Hall&lt;/a&gt; and Moroes.\nMoroes - The tower steward will call upon four level 70-elite NPCs to help him, for what it's worth. He is the first of four encounters that you must complete in order if you want to make it to the top of the tower (and the other three are &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Event\"&gt;Opera Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;Chess Event&lt;/a&gt;).\nSlay him and his guests, then head back out toward the opposite end of the hallway, and then exit to the left at the far end, and go upstairs. This leads to another gallery, where you'll be exiting through the door to the right, then walking down that hall populated by guards and courtesans to the &lt;a href=\"Maiden%20of%20Virtue\"&gt;Maiden of Virtue&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaiden of Virtue - This &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-looking &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;construct&lt;/a&gt; can take a little more time than most, as she has a few tricks up her sleeve. Watch out for her interrupts, and you'll be fine.\nAfter she falls, go back down the hallway and turn left to re-enter the gallery you came from, then turn right and stick to the right to move upstairs to the stage and the Opera Event. The skeletal ushers will try to usher you right outta there, but keep to the right until you exit through a door, go down a ramp, then through the orchestra pit to the opposite side of the stage. Follow the backstage area until you come to a closed door and talk to &lt;a href=\"Barnes\"&gt;Barnes&lt;/a&gt; to start the event.\nOpera Event - Sure -- you told Barnes that you're not an actor, but he put you out on the stage anyway. The curtain will rise on one of three possible plays: \nExit stage left, and look for the stairs and ramps to that side of the audience that will lead you up and up. You'll find the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Stair\"&gt;Broken Stair&lt;/a&gt;, and the first indication of the disrepair that Karazhan has fallen into. As you go up the ramp, exit onto the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Master's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. Keep climbing the broken and twisted stairs until you emerge into the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Karazhan%29\"&gt;Menagerie&lt;/a&gt;.\nTip: If you are in Karazhan on the hour, listen up. You might hear the bells tolling for thee.\nKeep heading into the Menagerie, where you'll find the Curator.\nThen Things Get Weird.\nThe Curator - This big &lt;a href=\"arcane%20guardian\"&gt;arcane guardian&lt;/a&gt; drops Tier 4 gloves, and sometimes the aforementioned Menagerie Custodian battle pet. After defeating him, take the ramp on the side of the room down into the Library. This is also where you'll find the researchers for the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane\"&gt;Nitebane&lt;/a&gt; quest line.\nTip: Books can be looted!\nStrange forces are at work in the library, and space is becoming stretched and twisted. Fortunately, it's *mostly* linear. Head upward past the various &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; creatures until you come to a room with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Pillager\"&gt;Shadow Pillager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Homunculus%20%28Karazhan%29\"&gt;Homunculus&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the &lt;a href=\"Disconcerting%20Bookshelf\"&gt;Perplexing Bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; and head down the ramp.\n&lt;a href=\"Terestian%20Illhoof\"&gt;Terestian Illhoof&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt; boss starts with an &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt; servant by his side, and calls more to join him as the fight carries on, so finish him quickly. Thereafter, head back upstairs and up the ramp. You'll reach a room with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shade\"&gt;Spell Shade&lt;/a&gt;s in it and two exits. The left exit leads to a closed door and the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nShade of Aran - Here we have the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;, father of Medivh, and court advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;king of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. He died in a mysterious exchange of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al energies with his son when Medivh came of age, and now haunts this library.\nAfter the Shade is put to rest, head back into the room you came from and turn left and head up the ramp. Soon enough you'll find the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s that have come to rob Karazhan of its arcane riches. Eventually you'll come to a room that is populated by &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Thief\"&gt;Ethereal Thief&lt;/a&gt;s. There's a ramp that leads upward, to &lt;a href=\"Netherspite\"&gt;Netherspite&lt;/a&gt;.\nNetherspite - A powerful &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; is before you, and you may not be able to simply burn him down like most bosses in the tower. Once upon a time, raid teams had to coordinate movements in this fight to benefit from buffs or debuffs that made the difference between success and a boss that could not be ended. Nowadays, you'll want to experiment with where to stand (and where to position Netherspite) relative to the beams, and it should be simple enough to find a spot that does the trick.\nReturn to where you came from and follow the ramp down, and further into the twisted ramps and corridors of the library. Eventually you will come to a chamber that houses an unusually psychedelic Ethereal by the name of &lt;a href=\"Ythyar\"&gt;Ythyar&lt;/a&gt;. You can sell the items you don't intend to keep here. He was once instrumental in providing raiders with important recipes. Open the doors in his room to reach the Chess Event\nChess Event - Medivh has a room-sized chessboard, and if you want to complete Karazhan, you'll have to brave the invisible gnomes, take control of your faction's chess pieces, and defeat Medivh and he controls the opposition. For most players, especially those who are clearing Karazhan solo, this is the challenge of the entire dungeon.\nHere is a strategy that often works:\nYou've got to exit a piece as soon as you've made your move, at which point you'll find yourself to the side of the chessboard. Run back onto the chessboard to control the next piece. It can be hectic, and sometimes, Medivh has your number and you'll have to try again.\nAfter the Chess Event concludes, a chest will spawn near the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Echo of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nTip: If you came with friends, you can play chess versus them too!\nHead through the now-open doors on the far side of the room, and then veer right past the flesh beasts and up the spiral staircase toward &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;'s place.\nTop O' the Tower.\nPrince Malchezaar - The penultimate battle at the top of the tower is with a &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari%20Eredar\"&gt;Man'ari Eredar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely, he sometimes drops the &lt;a href=\"%3ASunfury%20Bow%20of%20the%20Phoenix\"&gt;:Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and Gorehowl, the axe of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick up your Tier 4 helm tokens here.\nTake a look around, and you'll notice that spacetime is really breaking down here, with all sorts of weirdness to be seen.\nBut wait! There's more!\n&lt;a href=\"Nightbane\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; - A bonus boss that's only available to you if you've completed Archmage Alturus's questline, Nightbane is worth the effort if you're here hunting for Violet Eye rep. \nThe fight goes through phases in which he'll leap into the air and perform smoking blasts and rain of bones. Don't worry if you kill him while he's in the air, he'll courteously land before giving you some sweet loot that sometimes includes the beautiful &lt;a href=\"%3ADragonheart%20Flameshield\"&gt;:Dragonheart Flameshield&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHave you visited Karazhan recently, and if so, what were you there to achieve? Do you have any tips or warnings for players who might be attempting Karazhan at lower levels? Do you know a good strategy for the Chess Event? Please tell us all about it in the comments below."}

At stake is the future of Azeroth, and only you can ensure the timeline remains preserved\u2014hopefully with a minimal number of paradoxes. This Mythic-only instance can reward you with loot coveted by time benders everywhere, including a perennial assortment of powerful gear, Dragonriding customizations, and many other surprises.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nTurning Back Time to Make it Right.\nAn optional questline related to the Dawn of the Infinite mega-dungeon will be available when Fractures in Time launches.

Now, faced with more intruders, she refuses to fail a second time.\nBlight of Galakrond.\nThese primal dragons were brought back by the necrotic energies dripping from the corpse of Galakrond.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; revamp implemented in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.0\"&gt;patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nSealed shut for many years to outsiders, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms has been the physical and spiritual center of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and a place of great beauty and reverence\u2014but something has gone horribly wrong, and this once beautiful, seemingly untouchable land has been deeply and irrevocably scarred.\nWith the war between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in full swing, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; ordered a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; dig team to set to work searching for an artifact buried deep within the heart of the Vale (see the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Dark Heart of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scenario\"&gt;Scenario&lt;/a&gt;). Ignoring the warnings of &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, they began to dig within the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Blossom%20Excavation\"&gt;Big Blossom Excavation&lt;/a&gt; site. What they found there may have been more than they bargained for.\nDeep within the site, in a long-buried secret vault created by the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s, Garrosh discovered a power that had long been thought locked away and untouchable: the &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20Y%27shaarj\"&gt;heart of Y'shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. The story of what happens next unfolds in the upcoming content update, Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar.\nPerhaps Not so Eternal.\nThe events brought about by the discovery of the artifact have drastically and dramatically changed the Vale. Where &lt;a href=\"Whitepetal%20Lake\"&gt;Whitepetal Lake&lt;/a&gt; once glimmered like a jewel, now there remains only a dried, dusty husk. With many of the lakes and rivers of the vale now devoid of water, even the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20Danio\"&gt;Jeweled Danio&lt;/a&gt; have gone. (Though never fear! The industrious &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt;s have rescued them and relocated them to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where they can thrive once more.)\nThe Lay of the Land.\nIn the wake of this destruction, the process of entering the Vale of Eternal Blossoms for the first time remains largely the same, though the quest leading there has been slightly updated to reflect the changes that have occurred. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s will no longer be ushered into the full splendor of the Vale as it once was, but will instead bear witness to the tainted landscape the war between the Alliance and the Horde has left behind.\nBeyond just the physical appearance of the land changing, new residents have taken root in the Vale, and old ones have gained more ground. Within the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Fields\"&gt;Summer Fields&lt;/a&gt;, Big Blossom Excavation, and the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Approach\"&gt;Emperor's Approach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vestige%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Vestiges of Pride&lt;/a&gt; ooze and slide over the land.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Guo-Lai\"&gt;Guo-Lai Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manifestation%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Manifestations of Pride&lt;/a&gt; fight &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Even the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Stair\"&gt;Golden Stair&lt;/a&gt; lay in smoking ruin, and the mogu have moved north to &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20Rise\"&gt;Ruins Rise&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Winterbough%20Glade\"&gt;Winterbough Glade&lt;/a&gt;, ousting the &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s that once lay in wait. (Congratulations arachnophobes, the spiders are gone, save for one . . . a big one. You thought you got rid of her? The Ashweb Matriarch &lt;a href=\"Bloodtip\"&gt;Bloodtip&lt;/a&gt; is not so easily ousted.)\n&lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt; still stands to the southwest, and the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s and the mogu continue their eternal battle within the &lt;a href=\"Tu%20Shen%20Burial%20Ground\"&gt;Tu Shen Burial Ground&lt;/a&gt;s to the south, seemingly untouched by the events Garrosh's machinations have wrought within the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.\nQuesting in the Vale.\nFor those continuing their adventures within the Vale, there remains little evidence of the grand pagoda where the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; once set heroes to task. No longer do they stand in watch against the mogu, and their enemies have spread even farther into the Vale. There is a way to continue earning reputation with these stalwart defenders, though. By killing many of the creatures within the Vale and taking on rare monsters, you'll continue to earn reputation and Guo-Lai cache keys to unlock treasure chests within the ruins.\nFor those who have yet to earn the Achievement \u201c&lt;a href=\"%3AEternally%20in%20the%20Vale\"&gt;:Eternally in the Vale&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d time is running out! Once Patch 5.4 is launched, this &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt; will become a &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; and will no longer be possible to earn. This is also your last opportunity to experience the Golden Lotus reputation story line, advanced at &lt;a href=\"Honored\"&gt;Honored&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revered\"&gt;Revered&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaily quests will still be available from the &lt;a href=\"Setting%20Sun%20Garrison\"&gt;Setting Sun Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, though there were will be fewer of them as the Shado-Pan continue to train and fight the mantid at the wall as is their sworn duty.\nWhat has happened in the Vale has left a scar, but the threat that lies within Garrosh's discovery will spread beyond Pandaria's shores. Make sure you check back for the Siege of Orgrimmar trailer\u2014coming \u201csoon.\u201d"}

After recovering a version of the artifact from the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and the allied dragonflights now rally at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate bid to use its might to defeat Deathwing.\nCreated by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s as a sanctuary for all &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;Dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;d, the crumbling Wyrmrest Temple is now the final hope for the forces allied against the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; Neltharion, once the Earth-Warder and protector of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, now Deathwing the Destroyer.

As they begin to charge the Dragon Soul with energy, Deathwing and his entire army assault Wyrmrest Temple. Players must thwart the attacking forces long enough for Thrall to charge the Dragon Soul.\nBefore you face Deathwing the Destroyer, you must prevail against six mighty &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe most powerful elemental still under Deathwing's sway, &lt;a href=\"Morchok\"&gt;Morchok&lt;/a&gt;\u2014once a passive guardian\u2014is now convinced that his only respite will come with Azeroth's demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of Wyrmrest Temple, Azeroth's last beacon of hope in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nCountless ages ago, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers waged endless war against the forces of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. Millennia have passed, but the warlord still serves the chaotic might of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing has now unleashed this legendary &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt; to crush the defenders of Wyrmrest Temple.\nSince the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yor%27sahj%20the%20Unsleeping\"&gt;Yor'sahj the Unsleeping&lt;/a&gt; has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor'sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.\n&lt;a href=\"Hagara%20the%20Binder\"&gt;Hagara the Binder&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first students of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, showed surprising potential for one who had started learning so late in life. But in her undisciplined attempts to bind &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s into servitude, she was ensnared and twisted by the &lt;a href=\"Windlord\"&gt;Windlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;. Now fiercely loyal to the Twilight's Hammer, Hagara binds others for her elemental masters to torment.\nMore an abomination of dark energy than a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt; has spent his short life absorbing the essence of captured &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Ultraxion is the only &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing has praised, and his arrogance is overshadowed only by the crackling energies surging through his twisted form. Loyal to his master, Ultraxion swears to bring about the fall of Wyrmrest Temple.\nThough once vast in number, only a few dozen twilight dragons now remain. Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight's Hammer's army: the elite drake &lt;a href=\"rider\"&gt;rider&lt;/a&gt;s of Deathwing's personal escort. Led by the insidious &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master.\nWhen Deathwing first channeled the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s power against the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, the massive energies that he unleashed threatened to break him apart. Rather than forgo this weapon, he had &lt;a href=\"adamantium\"&gt;adamantium&lt;/a&gt; plates fused to his scales to hold his body together. Later reinforced with &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt;, these plates are now his weakness\u2014the sole vulnerability to Deathwing's lethal presence.\nYour assault on the massive Deathwing will begin a battle unlike any other. It is a fight so wide-ranging and intense that it comprises two unique encounters, taking place across Azeroth. Taking to the skies, players will parachute from soaring gunships to attack the monster mid-flight and attempt to weaken him by ripping away his armor, exposing the molten flesh beneath. Should they succeed, they will plunge into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; for the final encounter.\nNo &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; has yet taken on an enemy so large and dangerous and lived to tell the tale.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nJoin a full panel of World of Warcraft developers in this deep dive as they take you into the Dragon Isles and share insights about the new lands to explore, the creatures you\u2019ll meet, and take you deeper into the various systems and changes that will come with the expansion.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWeaving the Story.\nOnce the broodlands of the Dragonflights, the Dragon Isles was once the center of the dragons\u2019 kingdom when the world was young, and the mortal races were just starting to form kingdoms of their own. When the Legion invaded in the War of the Ancients and the Great Sundering broke the world draining much of the magic of the land, the dragons were forced to leave their homeland behind. But they didn\u2019t leave it without the watchers to stand in wait\u2014ready to call back the flights when the elemental energy resurged, and the dragons could be drawn home to re-establish their kingdom.\nThe time has come for the sky to light up with the colors of the aspects once again and for Alexstrasza and the others to come home. But the land has changed a lot in all these thousands of years they\u2019ve been away, and some old threats have awakened as well.\nThe dragons we know of today are quite different than the early past of Azeroth. They were more primitive, much more savage\u2014what we now know as the protodragons.\nIn more recent history the dragons we know were empowered to become the Aspects\u2014the green dragonflight, red dragonflight, blue dragonflight, bronze dragonflight, and black dragonflight\u2014each with unique powers and abilities to protect the world in different ways. These pillars of draconic powers were appointed to defend Azeroth from threats within and without. This power was used for good in the case of most of the Aspects, but also for more nefarious reasons in the case of the black dragonflight led by Neltharion who would later become Deathwing.\nAn opportunity to reclaim their legacy and return once more as the protectors of Azeroth lays before the dragons, but they\u2019ll need the help of the heroes of Azeroth to face the challenges of this reawakening. The land has not been peacefully awaiting their return\u2014 old enemies have awakened as well and will need to be confronted and overcome if the flights are to make it their home once more.\nOne of those old foes they will have to overcome are the elemental half-giants, the Djaradin. They aren\u2019t the only residents of the Dragon Isles, however, and there are many more occupants to get to know along your explorations. You\u2019ll encounter the beloved tuskarr as well as get to know the civilization of the centaurs which predates those who we came to know in Kalimdor.\nWe\u2019ll also get to reconnect with Wrathion and see if he is ready to step into the leadership role as the leader of the black dragonflight, or if there\u2019s another path for him. We\u2019ll also meet up with Kalecgos, Ebonhorn, and Ysera\u2019s daughter Merithra to see where their return to the Dragon Isles takes them.\nA new playable race will also be available \u2014 the dracthyr. Dracthyr were an experiment created by Neltharion with the essence of the dragons and imbued with their strength, nobility, wisdom, and adaptability to become the perfect soldiers.\nExploration is a key theme for this expansion and players will be able to adventure in this ancient land and explore the landscapes and its architectural history. We\u2019ve created huge zones with many places to delve into with many old treasures and secrets tucked away. The heroes of Azeroth will work alongside The Reliquary and the Explorers\u2019 League to help the dragonflights to help them find their legacy, as they have long helped the residents of Azeroth.\nIt\u2019s a true Azerothian adventure waiting to be had and explored.\nExplore the Dragon Isles.\nPlayers will have the opportunity to traverse and explore four new zones as they aid the dragonflights in rediscovering their ancient lands. As you progress, you\u2019ll make your way through the Waking Shores, roiling with elemental power; the vast expanse of the Ohn\u2019ahran Plains; the frosty peaks of the Azure Span, and the majestic spires and temples of Thaldraszus.\nYour travels will begin in Stormwind or Orgrimmar as you journey by boat past the ancient ruins of the isles and land on the Waking Shores.\nWaking Shores.\nThe Waking Shores is the first of four level-up zones players will encounter. It\u2019s a wild untamed land that has begun to reawaken. Protodragons soar through the sky, elementals are rising as the magic of the land does, and the land is rife with opportunities.\nThe Horde and the Alliance have been engaged in an expedition with The Explorers\u2019 League and The Reliquary as they join with you to learn more of what these mysterious lands have to offer.\nHere, you\u2019ll learn more about the red dragonflight, led by Queen Alexstrasza, the Lifebinder. They have a mandate to nurture all life and it\u2019s a duty they take seriously, but it\u2019s not without its challenges, especially when it means finding ways to preserve the lives of their enemies\u2014the Djaradin\u2014 while still preventing those same enemies from adversely affecting the ecology of the land. These half-giants wield the power of magma and while the Dragon Isles slumbered, so did they, but like the land, they have also awakened and are primed to create chaos anew.\nIt is also the ancestral home of the black dragonflight, which has fallen on tough times since Deathwing\u2019s descent. Wrathion is joining Azeroth\u2019s heroes as he comes to terms with the state of the dragonflight, which is in a diminished state.\nOhn\u2019ahran Plains.\nAfter the Waking Shores, players will venture into the wide-open expanse of the Ohn\u2019ahran Plains. The area is named for the wild god of the wind, Ohn\u2019ahra, who has appeared before as a large spirit eagle who helped guide the centaurs to the Dragon Isles many years before. She blessed them and took their caravan across to the isles and showed them the plains where they could make their new home.\nThe centaur encountered the green dragonflight here and would fight for dominance only to find that neither they nor the green dragonflight was stronger than the other. And so, they made peace with each other. The green dragonflight made their homes in the groves while the centaur took over the plains. But, after thousands of years, the centaur have advanced in their culture and players will have the opportunity to explore and learn more about them.\nThese centaur originated as one strong clan led by the mighty Maruuk and Teera who helped found their new life in the Ohn\u2019ahran Plains all those years ago, and so you will need to learn their rules and traditions if you want to earn their trust and cross the plains. As the first outsiders to visit in generations, it will take some doing. Your first encounter will have you coming to their aid to take down one of the many protodragons that is harassing them.\nWith such a large expanse of land to see, the engineers have also made additional improvements to allow players to see even further so that you can fully enjoy the beauty of this rich landscape.\nAzure Span.\nOur third zone takes us into the Azure Span. One of the biggest zones created to date in World of Warcraft, it offers the largest visual elevation change of the zones players will explore through. It is inspired by one of our favorite zones in Wrath of the Lich King, Grizzly Hills, along with the California Bay area with the coastal fogs and redwoods, though there\u2019s more than just redwoods to be found in the zone.\nAs players progress through the zone, they\u2019ll eventually come upon a wide-open tundra alight with golds and reds until you reach the next level of elevation where you\u2019ll get to see the snow. The majority of the zone is covered in snow and ice with giant frozen waterfalls, ice rivers, and more.\nIt\u2019s here you\u2019ll encounter the gnolls who have made the forests of the Azure Span their home and beyond that in the wide-open tundra, the tuskarr. We\u2019ve met them before in Wrath of the Lich King and here we\u2019ve expanded upon this beloved group with male, female, and adorable child tuskarr.\nWe\u2019ll aid the tuskarr alongside the blue dragonflight. We\u2019ll follow the story of Kalecgos as he ventures into Sindragosa\u2019s archives. It\u2019s a giant zone and there\u2019s a lot more surprises that we\u2019ll have in store before you move on into the fourth zone, Thaldraszus.\nThaldraszus.\nAfter spending time seeing the many dragon building ruins in the previous three zones, Thaldraszus offers something more pristine with beautifully intact buildings in the seat of power for all five of the dragonflights and home of the dragons. Vertical lofty mountains and great cave systems (with maybe a small dragon hoard or two to be found along the way) create a compelling new land to explore.\nIt\u2019s also here that the bronze dragonflight has their own area carved out. Their power over time lends itself to a variety of gameplay options and adventures for players to undertake.\nPlayers will also reach the main city hub of the expansion here\u2014Valdrakken. This city is the culmination of all the dragon\u2019s efforts and provides several vignettes to enjoy from the blue dragonflight\u2019s public library to the red and green dragonflights own separate gardens.\nThe city will serve as a convenient hub of activity and will include access to an auction house for those looking to gain access to purchase a variety of goods.\nYou\u2019ll also be able to find Tyrhold here in Thaldraszus. Built by the Titan keeper, Tyr, this ten-thousand-year-old Titan technological marvel houses great aqueducts that reach across the valley. It was Tyr who helped the Aspects fight Galakrond and when they came to settle in the Dragon Isles, it was he who built this facility. Even though Tyr is long gone, the dragons still hold him in reverence. The Titan keepers have continued to maintain Tyrhold while the dragonflights have gone on to take part in an incredible amount of history as the defenders of Azeroth.\nFlights have nearly been wiped out. There have been invasions and betrayals, and even some Aspects have died. These are all things that have left marks on their society, but now the dragonflights have come back together in this place. It\u2019s a story that will be played out through the Dragon Isles and its many mysteries discovered over time.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMeet the Dracthyr Evoker.\nDragonflight introduces a new race and class in one known as the dracthyr Evoker, allowing players to play as a dragon (one that can still fit in a raid without crushing your allies.) This hero class begins at level 58 and will have its own starting zone. Players will be able to choose their alignment with the Horde or Alliance at character creation and will be able to take advantage of a slew of new customizations that allow them to match their dragon form closely with their humanoid visage.\nDracthyr Evokers were created by Neltharion to wield the magic of all five dragonflights providing a very distinctive style of spell casting. You\u2019ll be able to see the coalescence of these powers each time you cast. Evokers also have two distinctive specializations which take advantage of these magic types. Devastation is a DPS-focused specialization that utilizes the fast explosive power of the red dragonflight and the more focused and overwhelming magic of the blue dragonflight. Preservation serves as a healing specialization and utilizes the healing power of the green dragonflight and its more nurturing spells, while also using the power of the bronze dragonflight to manipulate time to accomplish feats such as healing wounds faster.\nWe\u2019re also introducing a new type of spell called Empower. Players will be able to hold down a button on their keyboard to power up a spell. The longer you charge the spell, the more damage it could do or the more targets the spell could hit.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nTaking to Dragonriding.\nAs players make their way through each of the areas of the Dragon Isles, they\u2019ll partner up with the dragonflights to move through the air as they\u2019ve never done before. They\u2019ll learn the Dragonriding skill which they can level up over time. Unlike what players know of flying, you\u2019ll instead hone your Dragonriding ability and learn to defy gravity while using your momentum and skills to soar to higher heights and explore the Isles.\nPlayers will also be able to customize their new drake mounts with a variety of new options including snout, horns, tails, armor, and more. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nSystem Updates.\nHUD and UI.\nIt\u2019s been some time since we\u2019ve updated our UI and technology has advanced since we first developed it in 2004. Players now have larger monitors, and the development team has better tools to look at revamping the UI to accommodate the times.\nWith the update in Dragonflight, we wanted to create a layout that would allow players to customize and move elements of the UI around their screen to better fit their needs. We recognize that add-ons today provide many opportunities for players to customize their experience, but not all players use them. With the help of our user research team, we are working to meet the goals our community needs and add those elements to the base UI. This allows us to add new functionality, improve accessibility, and make aesthetic updates to the art.\nA key component to our changes is maintaining the charm and personality of the UI that players have been using for the past eighteen years while still presenting a more modern take. You\u2019ll see with these changes the minimap and health bar appear larger, we\u2019ve removed some of the clutter to provide more visibility to your gameplay as well. As a part of maintaining the charm of the design, we\u2019ve also taken the time to update the gryphons and wyverns on the action bar at the bottom of the screen.\nNot only will you be able to move various elements of the HUD around the screen, but each component has various sets of options that you\u2019ll be able to work with. You\u2019ll be able to save, edit, copy, and name it. It will also remember which specialization you\u2019re in so when you switch between then, it will remember the HUD layout that you have for that specific spec.\nAs with anything in development, it\u2019s still a work in progress. We look forward to getting more feedback from the community as they experience these changes and more.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nTalent Updates.\nAnother UI intensive project we\u2019ve been working on is an update to the Talent system. We wanted to look at it once more and find ways to provide players with more choice in shaping their character\u2019s abilities. Currently, as you level up, you receive new spells and skills, but that progression and ordering is entirely predetermined. So, we started looking at creating a system that would provide players with a wider set of options.\nOne of these ideas that we returned to was that of trees. In this case, it\u2019s actually two trees. One tree focuses on class utility while the other focuses on specialization and the expression of your role whether that\u2019s doing damage, tanking, or healing. We want choosing your specialization to be important and want to make sure that when you choose it, it affects the tree in some way.\nWhen you look at the new tree, you\u2019ll notice the class side will have some abilities filled out for free to get you started off in the spec you\u2019ve chosen, but then you\u2019ll have your first point to spend in the class tree which could be something related to that spec or it could be something from elsewhere in the class.\nWe wanted to make sure that the new system allows players to take combinations of spells and abilities that may not have been possible in the game before. This opportunity also allowed us to inject more art and fantasy into the actual Talent UI itself.\nWe want players to be able to tinker with the trees and make a lot of changes while not necessarily feeling like you must fully commit. The power really is coming back to the player. It\u2019s not something we want people to feel locked into and so one of the things we\u2019ll be preserving is the ability to change talents at the same kind of frequency as they do now. Players should easily be able to go from their raid night to playing arena matches by taking advantage of a new feature that allows them to save and load their build. They\u2019ll be able to name it, save it, then load it up very quickly.\nTalents really are about having a breadth of options and we wanted to give players the ability to hold the building blocks of what make up their class and spec and put them together in a way that works for them.\nThis is only a first preview of what we are working on, and we are looking forward to hearing more about your thoughts.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nProfession Revamp.\nProfessions have been a staple of World of Warcraft since its initial launch and while there have been incremental updates over time, we wanted to do something a bit different in Dragonflight. We wanted take time to rethink them and figure out how to make them a part of player identity\u2014at the player\u2019s choice, of course.\nFirst up, we\u2019re introducing something we\u2019re calling Crafting Orders. Crafting Orders allow you to request for another player to craft something for you even if you don\u2019t have the skill or have the right profession to do it yourself. You\u2019ll be able to browse through any recipes that can be crafted, pick the one you want for yourself, and then include some or all the reagents needed for the recipe\u2014including ones only you can get your hands on. You can either find someone in person who craft right in front of you, or you can go to an NPC, which uses an Auction House-like interface and send the order out.\nYou\u2019ll be able to specify if the order is open to the public for any crafter to pick up, only send it to your guild, or to a specific player you know who has the ability to craft the item for you.\nOne of the other things worth noting is that the item you have crafted can also be Soulbound. In the past the only way to get access to a crafted Soulbound item was to have the profession yourself. Now anyone can have them crafted for them which really expands the number of items that we can provide to anyone.\nThere are some additional updates of note as well. The biggest is the introduction of quality of both your crafted items and gathered reagents. Quality is pretty straightforward. If you craft something that is higher quality, it\u2019s just going to be better. For pieces of gear, which may mean a higher item level. If it\u2019s a potion, it may be a more powerful effect at a higher quality.\nThe crafting UI also introduces stats specifically to your professions for both crafting and gathering.\nThe biggest source of your ability to craft items at higher quality is through crafting specializations. While there have been specializations in the past, in Dragonflight, you\u2019ll be able to go out and earn specialization points in multiple ways. You may find an old book on a bookshelf in a ruin somewhere. You could meet up with a hermit in a cave who can teach you more about your profession. In the end, you\u2019ll be able to choose as a Blacksmith, for example, to become an Armorsmith and you\u2019ll be able to put points into that skill to become better at crafting all armor. This opens opportunities for players within the same guild to specialize in varying aspects of a profession to add value to the guild.\nWe\u2019ll also be adding crafting tables for all professions within the new city hub of Valdrakken. It\u2019s a great way for crafters to meet up in the city or for other players to find a crafter if they want to meet face to face.\nCrafters will also be getting new types of gear for their profession which you will automatically swap into when doing something like tapping a mining node. This gear won\u2019t need to take any space in your backpack and will have special stats on them that will aid you in getting better in your profession.\nBy specializing and honing your craft, you could build your own clientele and build your reputation for high-quality items. How far you take it is up to you.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThis is just the very start of our journey to the Dragon Isles. Visit our new Dragonflight site for more information.

Whether you\u2019re looking for loot, a new challenge, or to learn more about this ancient land, you\u2019ll need to gather your courage\u2014 and your allies\u2014 for the trials ahead.\nLevel-up dungeons:\nMax-level dungeons:\n&lt;hr&gt;\nZone: The Waking Shores.\nRuby Life Pools.\n\"As the ancestral nesting grounds for the five flights, the Ruby Life Pools is a sacred place. The Red Dragonflight, whose charge it is to nurture all life, protect these pools and the future of all dragonkind held within them.\"\n\"However, Raszageth and her Primalists have come to steal that future away and infuse their own powers into the sacred pools. They must be stopped for dragonkind to thrive.\"\nNeltharus.\n\"Beneath the Obsidian Citadel lies Neltharus, home of the black dragonflight\u2019s hoard and the secrets behind their legendary forging. When the djaradin woke from their slumber, they chose Neltharus as the point of entry for their attack. Surprised to find it deserted, they quickly laid claim to its secrets for themselves... as well as the rest of the Obsidian Citadel.\"\n&lt;hr&gt;\nZone: The Azure Span.\nBrackenhide Hollow.\n\"Brackenhide Hollow is the largest gnoll settlement in the Dragon Isles, and home tounspeakable danger. Decay seeps from the Hollow, spreading among the gnoll tribes of the Azure Span and threatening to rot away all life. In the heart of the Hollow lies the leader of the Brackenhide, and the knowledge she gleefully shares with her withered kin.\"\nThe Azure Vault.\n\"Long ago, Malygos created the Azure Vault as a place for Sindragosa to catalogue and store away curious magical artifacts he found.

After many harsh winters on the ice, they have learned to value the warmest things in life: friends, family, a hot bowl of soup, and a long story told over a crackling fire. So, if you can fish, cook, or tell a hearty tale, the tuskarr will welcome you with open arms. However, when threatened, the tuskarr are some of the fiercest fighters in Azeroth. As new and old enemies rise against them, every spear of the community must be raised to fight for survival. Raise your spear alongside them and take a bowl of soup for the journey!\nBuilding Renown with the Iskaara Tuskarr will teach you new ways to fish, unlock exclusive fishing holes, and tools to access along the way. Fish in challenging and unique biomes with harpoons and collect fish with a net instead of a line.

These hunters, nomads, and storytellers were once guided to the Ohn\u2019ahran Plains by Ohn\u2019ahra, the Wild God of the Wind. Clans rise and fall in power, but they maintain relative peace among themselves and the dragons. Though they are initially cautious of the outsiders who just arrived on their shores, they will challenge you to prove yourself worthy of their respect.\nThose wishing to earn Renown with the Maruuk Centaur can join a Grand Hunt with Clan Shikaar. These events are group content for five or more players to engage in combat against beasts, dragonkin, giants, and elementals. There are 11 Grand Hunt locations, and players will be rewarded for each stage of the Grand Hunt they participate in.\nPlayers can complete the optional License to Hunt quest or have Renown 5 with the Maruuk Centaur to gain access to Grand Hunts. Players will also benefit from partnering with a powerful animal companion during the hunts.

Its members are now torn between the two likeliest successors: &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who champions reconciliation with other &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, a scion of Malygos who believes that his kind should withdraw from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt; and forge a new path. To end the constant debates and arguments, the flight has agreed to gather during the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an extraordinary celestial event in which Azeroth's two &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s come into perfect alignment\u2014in the hopes that a new Aspect will be selected.\"\n\"Yet a recent discovery by the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; bodes ill for this impending ceremony.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nIn the land of Drustvar, the stalwart protectors of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. Travel beyond the frontier to learn of their fate and battle the resurgence of an ancient and terrifying enemy.\nDrustvar is a region known for the tenacity of the soldiers who protect it. Long after the defeat of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; who once dwelled there, the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; and his people continue to eke out a living in this unyielding land. They are known throughout &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; as being a hearty, stoic, and deeply superstitious people, and would make keen allies in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but now it's up to you to discover why they've gone silent.\nWelcome to Drustvar.\nWhen first arriving in Drustvar, you'll be greeted by a dark and foreboding shoreline on the eastern border. Drustvar is a rugged land plagued by superstition, and signs of witchcraft are everywhere. The pathways through &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Homestead\"&gt;Glenbrook&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fallhaven\"&gt;Fallhaven&lt;/a&gt; are fraught with danger, so you'll need to stay on your guard. Dark rumors swirl as to what may have befallen the &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;Waycrest family&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and if the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has any hope of convincing the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; to join them, you'll need to untangle the mysteries that lay ahead.\nVerdigris roofs and awnings adorn buildings of brick and wood, their amber window panes alight from within. The sea's intrinsic role in Kul Tiran culture is reflected in the architecture, and anchors and other symbols of the sea decorate doorways and awnings.\nA stygian pallor looms over the town of Fallhaven, reeking of mystical meddling. A large and ominous construct stands as sentinel in the center of town, and the townsfolk are . . . unresponsive. You'll need to work diligently to break the curse on the town before you can make any progress toward getting to the heart of the troubles in Drustvar.\nCobblestone paths wind through the region and in and out of the various &lt;a href=\"Settlement\"&gt;villages and towns&lt;/a&gt;. History and culture are deeply woven into the fabric of Kul Tiras, but so too are the workings of dark witches. Cursed and hopelessly twisted townsfolk and creatures work in servitude to these mystics' machinations, set to a task you'll need to decipher and put an end to\u2014if you have the stomach for it.\nVisitors to this region will need to rely on their wits, solve a few not-so-small issues the citizenry faces, and hopefully make some inroads with the people along the way.\nThere are more mysteries to unravel, and an ancient enemy is stirring in the land, causing a tremendous slew of trouble.\nTake the Highroad.\nTraveling westward will lead to a large chain of rugged snow-touched mountains running from the northern border of the region to the southern &lt;a href=\"Iceveil%20Glacier\"&gt;Iceveil Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, nearly bisecting the region in two. Along &lt;a href=\"Highroad%20Pass\"&gt;Highroad Pass&lt;/a&gt;, you'll come across various wildlife and creatures, including &lt;a href=\"Chillfur%20Yeti\"&gt;Chillwind Yeti&lt;/a&gt;s who find the cold of the mountains to their liking and food sources plentiful.\nThe road is fraught with danger, but you'll eventually arrive in the town of &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks a valley to the west. A tribute to Arom Waycrest stands vigil even as the people here struggle against the darkness that has swept over the land.\nOn the southwestern coast you'll cross into the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Various shades of red assail your eyes and bear witness to the veracity of the name. The town of &lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt; sits on the coast, and as in your previous travels through the region, you'll find this settlement is under siege by dark forces.\nTainted Rule.\nNorth of the Crimson Forest, the &lt;a href=\"Ashenwood%20Grove\"&gt;Ashenwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; bears witness to creatures adorned with fungi and strange creatures known as &lt;a href=\"Fungarian\"&gt;Fungarian&lt;/a&gt;s patrolling the pathways. Farms dot the area and mines can be found dug into the mountainsides, but what should be bustling enterprises have ground to a halt as the witches' special brand of pestilent creatures wreak havoc.\nEach clue found and mystery solved only puts forth more questions as to what could be ultimately manipulating events in Drustvar. Perhaps you'll find the source of the troubles within &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;*\u2014ancestral home of the Waycrest family who watches over Drustvar.\n\"*Waycrest Manor is a 5-player dungeon in Drustvar.\"\nA vast coastline surrounds Drustvar to the east, south, and west, where those brave enough can fish, boat, swim, and hunt for treasure. Inland, the mountains and forests provide a chance to hunt a variety of . . . interesting . . . creatures. To the north, the rolling hills and mountains of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; await, while eastward lies &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and even more opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Kul Tirans."}

Together, this illustrious assemblage was to unite its wondrous powers and restore the World Tree for the good of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Yet this auspicious event ended in tragedy. The details are still unclear, but word has spread that an incredibly powerful Twilight's Hammer agent, shrouded to hide his identity, interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s... casting his spirit into the four domains of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. If these terrible rumors hold true, the Earthen Ring -- indeed, all of Azeroth -- has potentially lost one of its greatest champions.\"\n\u2026Is this the end of the Son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;? \nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt;, level-85 characters will have the opportunity to answer this question and more.\nWhile even the Aspects concede that Thrall may be lost to the elements forever, there is one who still believes that he can be saved from this bleak fate. Aggra, a powerful shaman in her own right, will call upon you to assist her as she travels to the ends of the earth and beyond -- to &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; -- to rescue her beloved from an eternity of torment.\nThrall is no ordinary mortal, though, and this will be no ordinary quest. You will not only have to face the denizens of the elemental planes, but the very essence of Thrall himself and everything that has shaped him into the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; he is today. Before you can return his spirit to the natural world, you must overcome his doubts, his willfulness, his desires, and his rage -- for it is these aspects that bind him to his &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; cage.\nAre you up for this challenge? Can you break Thrall from his elemental bonds and ensure the restoration of the World Tree? The fate of the world, and one of its foremost heroes, hangs in the balance."}

It's in these darkest of hours that the forces standing against Deathwing must carry out a desperate plan to put an end to his devastating &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight flight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, with allegiance from &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, have devised a dangerous and unorthodox strategy to bring Deathwing down once and for all.

In this bleak future, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; has identified an anomaly that bars access to both the past and the Dragon Soul: a powerful creature from out of time, living alone amid time-twisted echoes of the past.\nIn order for Nozdormu to provide you the ability to travel back in time to a point before the Dragon Soul was hidden by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from anyone who'd seek its power, you must first go to a distant and desolate future to discover the anomaly blocking the past. You'll find yourself in a very different &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, stripped of its snowy landscape, with little more than ruins of the once-great dragonshrines. &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; itself stands only as a reminder of Deathwing's madness -- what's left of his scorched remains is impaled atop the structure.\nBefore you confront the creature disrupting Nozdormu's access to the past, you'll first be called to fight any two of the following four ostensibly familiar leaders, chosen at random each time you play through End Time.\nThese long-dead heroes are mere echoes of their former glory, further warped by the corruptive force of time. Their presence here is a great mystery, even to Nozdormu. Once these shades have been laid to rest, the maniacal figure blocking Nozdormu's vision will be revealed at the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. None of the Dragon Aspects could have predicted what entity would have such power to interrupt the sight of the Timeless One\u2026 the ability to create a new and &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.

In Eternity's End, you'll face him, and perhaps save Azeroth and the Shadowlands from a fate worse than death. Eternity's End features include:\nNew Zone: Zereth Mortis.\nZereth Mortis was created by the First Ones, and it's intended to create afterlives. Its denizens\u2014the automa\u2014have created all that exists in the Shadowlands, Azeroth, and realms beyond. It is a strange, alien location that defies all concepts of reality or physics. The Jailer intends to use Zereth Mortis' power to reshape everything according to his design.\nMeet The Enlightened.\nThe Enlightened are brokers that arrived on Zereth Mortis a long time ago. They no longer see their world in a transactional manner, but instead they treat their dwelling as a sacred place, and hope to answer to a higher calling\u2014the pursuit of knowledge. Find common ground with The Enlightened to succeed and defend Zereth Mortis.\nDecode the Cypher of the First Ones.\nThe automa of Zereth Mortis speak in a musical language that is incomprehensible to mortal races. Team up with a curious automa sidekick in this new progression system to learn the lost language of the Progenitors and delve deeper into the secrets of Zereth Mortis, unlocking an array of new zone activities, daily quests, events, and rewards.\nNew Raid: Sepulcher of the First Ones.\nDeep in the Sepulcher of the First Ones lies the key to unlock the Jailer's plans. Gather the power of the First Ones as you pursue Zovaal into the Sepulcher and fight through his forces\u2014but first, you must face Anduin, and discover a way to resist the Jailer's terrifying Domination magic.\nClass Tier Sets Return.\nHarness the power of the First Ones by collecting distinctive class armor sets via raids, PvP, or Mythic+ dungeons. Each set comes with powerful 2- and 4-piece set bonuses that complement your unique abilities.\nOther features in Eternity's End.\nWe hope you've enjoyed this early look at Eternity's End.

It's about the changes to &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt; releasing in .\nArticle.\nDragonflight is just around the corner. A new expansion presents a unique opportunity to start your adventures in World of Warcraft, check the new expansion out, or bring new friends to Azeroth. Available to both veteran players and new, the introductory excursion to Exile's Reach is a great way to begin forging your path through the world. Here's everything you need to start your journey.\nAn expedition has gone missing, and you have been called to be a part of a new crew of novice adventurers charged with discovering what\u2019s become of them. As with many such journeys, you\u2019ll find yourself as part of a crew aboard a ship bound to their last known location. When things take a turn for the worse, you\u2019ll make landfall on the island of Exile\u2019s Reach.\nIt is here that you\u2019ll begin to face the challenges the island presents, each increasing in difficulty as you work your way through your first 10 levels. As you progress, you\u2019ll begin to learn more about using the new skills and abilities at your disposal.\nAt the culmination of your adventure, you\u2019ll face two new bosses in a \u201cmini-dungeon\u201d designed for 1 to 5 players.\nLearning New Skills.\nThis experience is carefully crafted to teach you a variety of skills needed to be successful in Azeroth and beyond.\nAs you make your way through Exile's Reach, you\u2019ll learn all about the fundamentals of playing World of Warcraft, while also diving into some of the most important mechanics for your chosen class. Warriors will learn the essentials of a good Charge; Rogues will go through the gauntlet of proper use of combo points; while Hunters will learn how to tame and stable their pets.\nAlong the way, you\u2019ll encounter new allies in Exile's Reach who are willing to teach you more abilities for your class. Paladins will encounter the ghost of a former paladin willing to teach them Divine Shield, while Monks will receive guidance through meditation to learn Touch of Death.\nThese fundamentals are the building blocks you\u2019ll need to take on the many challenges waiting in Azeroth, and will help you along the path to success\u2014wherever your adventure takes you.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nFor New Players.\nIf you\u2019re new to World of Warcraft and have never created or leveled a character, you will automatically begin your journey into Azeroth with the starting experience\u2014helping you learn the basics of your class and the fundamentals of interacting with the world you\u2019ve become a part of.\nAfter completing the adventure, you\u2019ll move into Battle for Azeroth, where you\u2019ll be able to dig into the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde and level through to level 60, before moving on into the Dragon Isles\u2014and the new high level areas introduced in Dragonflight.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nFor Veteran Players.\nIf you\u2019re a veteran player or you\u2019ve leveled a character before, you can choose to opt out of the starting experience and begin instead at level 1 in the starting area for your race. Upon reaching level 10, you can either continue into Battle for Azeroth or speak with Chromie to choose a Timewalking Campaign. Choose an expansion and continue leveling until you're ready to enter the Dragon Isles at level 60. Players with Allied race characters will begin at level 10. Non-Allied race Death Knights and Demon Hunters will automatically begin at level 8 and play through their own starting experience before moving on around level 10.\nIf you'd like to select a different Timewalking Campaign, simply speak to Chromie again. With phase 2 of the Dragonflight pre-expansion patch, Timewalking Campaigns scale to level 60 and include the Shadowlands.\n&lt;hr&gt;\n/New Player Has Joined the Chat.\nAfter creating your new character and beginning your journey into World of Warcraft for the first time, you will automatically be added to a Newcomer Chat channel, where you can talk with other new players and seek advice from experienced players on the same faction who will be your guides as you level through the new starting zone of Exile's Reach. New players and guides will be able to recognize one another in the chat channels and by icons above their characters' heads that only they can see. Upon reaching level 50, new players will continue the journey ahead on their own and will no longer have access to the Newcomer Chat. Beginning with phase 2 of the Dragonflight pre-patch, the level limit for Newcomer Chat will be updated to 60.\nIf you're a veteran player and interested in guiding new players as they experience World of Warcraft for the first time, head over to Stormwind or Orgrimmar and speak to the guide recruiter once you've met the following criteria:\nIf you no longer wish to be a guide, you can speak to guide recruiter once again. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nA New Age of Adventure is About to Begin.\nDragonflight launches November 28, and you can pre-purchase the expansion from the Shop right now. Whether you're a newcomer or a long-time veteran, we hope you'll join us on the journey to the Dragon Isles. See you in Azeroth!"}

Adventurers will gain access to each of the leveling dungeons as they progress through the zones of Bastion, Maldraxxus, Ardenweald, and Revendreth.\nDungeons of Bastion.\nThe Necrotic Wake.\n\"In an unthinkable act of treachery, forces from Maldraxxus, the realm charged with defending the Shadowlands, have invaded the Temple of Courage. They have pillaged anima and taken slaughtered kyrian to fuel their dark practices. If left unchecked, the necrotic forces of the necropolis Zolramas will pillage Bastion leaving destruction in their wake.\"\nLevel: 51&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 4&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulty: Normal, Heroic, Mythic\nSpires of Ascension.\n\"Floating among the clouds and representing the pinnacle of kyrian ideals, the Spires of Ascension is the Archon\u2019s seat of power. Unquestioned and unchallenged for countless eons, the rule of Bastion has always embodied the virtues of duty and service. But with drought and instability causing fractures in the belief system of the Ascended, the Archon\u2019s reign faces an unimaginable peril as one of her most trusted followers falls under the sway of the darkest of evils.\"\nLevel: 60&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 4&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulty: Heroic, Mythic\nDungeons of Maldraxxus.\nPlaguefall.\n\"Underneath the ruined House of Plagues, lies one of the most destructive forces Maldraxxus has ever known. Those who covet this power search the plague-ridden debris in a race to claim this weapon for themselves. Whoever captures this prize will hold the fate of the Shadowlands in their clutches.\"\nLevel: 53&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 4&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulties: Normal, Heroic, Mythic\nTheater of Pain.\n\"In Maldraxxus you must constantly be tested and measured as the best to defend the Shadowlands. The best place to prove yourself is the Theater of Pain. Throngs of contenders face off for the hope of facing one of the champions. Brutality! Mayhem! Violence! And of course, Pain! Only the strongest become champions of their house, and only one can be the strongest.\"\nLevel: 60&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 5&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulties: Heroic, Mythic\nDungeons of Ardenweald.\nMists of Tirna Scithe.\nLevel: 55&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 3&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulties: Normal, Heroic Mythic\n\"The lush grove called Tirna Scithe has ever been diligently protected by the fae folk, for it is a sacred place said to hold ancient secrets. Legends warn that an unwary traveler might find themselves lost for an eternity wandering its countless mist-shrouded paths. But as drought depletes the forests of Ardenweald, enemies seek to plunder the grove\u2019s potent magic. Even the realm\u2019s native denizens are driven by hunger and desperation to consume that which the Winter Queen holds most dear.\"\nDe Other Side (Maximum Level Dungeon).\n\"Bwonsamdi has kept a secret place in the Shadowlands he refers to as De Other Side. When the dead started funneling into the Maw, Bwondsamdi hid several souls in his little domain, keeping his troll followers safe. But this broke an old deal with Mueh\u2019zala and now the ancient loa has come to harvest those souls and destroy their caretaker. Bwonsamdi will need help collecting on some of his other dealings if he is to survive this onslaught and protect the souls within.\"\nLevel: 60&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 4&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulties: Heroic, Mythic\nDungeons of Revendreth.\nHalls of Atonement.\n\"Under the Accuser, the Halls of Atonement were a tribute to Revendreth\u2019s mission. While the halls rang with suffering and sin, it was all directed to redeeming the souls and keeping them from falling into the Maw. But the recently promoted Lord Chamberlain has bent the hall\u2019s purpose to selfish reaping of anima, often to the point of leaving souls unable to be redeemed. Someone will have to put an end to the depravity that has grown within these walls.\"\nLevel: 57&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 4&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulties: Normal, Heroic, Mythic\nSanguine Depths.\n\"Far below Castle Nathria lies the Sanguine Depths, a prison created to house Sire Denathrius\u2019s most intriguing dissidents. Prisoners here are kept for eons, drained of their anima for research and study. The Sinfall resistance knows of a particular prisoner here that helps tip the balance of their fight with Sire Denathrius to their favor and have asked for assistance in extracting them.\"\nLevel: 60&lt;br&gt;\nBosses: 4&lt;br&gt;\nDifficulties: Heroic, Mythic"}

Those few dragons who remember the island know that it is taboo to visit, a place where something dreadful fell. Those who have braved the shores found little of consequence in this cauldron-like caldera apart from a shattered landscape and nature-claimed ruins half buried by magma.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nNo Longer Forgotten.\nNeltharion the Earth-Warder fashioned these lands as a secret training ground for the ultimate soldiers, the dracthyr. But in the aftermath of a terrible battle, the island lay dormant and abandoned for ages. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nTime To Wake.\nDeep beneath the surface, vast underground chambers contain legions of dracthyr, resting in magical stasis for thousands of years. As an ancient, magical surge ripples through the Forbidden Reach, the dracthyr are waking from their long slumber.\nIn this place of ancient power, dracthyr Evokers will begin a journey that will lead them further into the mysteries of their past.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nInhabitants of the Forbidden Reach.\nOver the ages, the Forbidden Reach has been reclaimed by nature and wildlife who have made this land their home.

The &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Snake\"&gt;brown snake&lt;/a&gt; is native to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-controlled territories. It seems unremarkable until its victims are within range.

Hunted for its beautifully patterned skin, the majestic &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Boa\"&gt;emerald boa&lt;/a&gt; thrives alongside Azeroth's lush rivers. When hunting or evading predators, the &lt;a href=\"moccasin\"&gt;moccasin&lt;/a&gt; can travel on the surface of water for short distances. Native to Azeroth's desert regions, the resilient &lt;a href=\"sidewinder\"&gt;sidewinder&lt;/a&gt;s can survive for weeks without water. &lt;a href=\"Zooey%20Snake\"&gt;Zooey snakes&lt;/a&gt; possess hooked scales, allowing them to slither up &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;'s rocky slopes and steep cliffs.\nUnlike other snakes that actively hunt, the crafty &lt;a href=\"adder\"&gt;adder&lt;/a&gt;s hide in thick foliage and ambush their prey. The &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Adder\"&gt;coral adder's&lt;/a&gt; venom is so deadly that one bite has been known to kill a full-grown &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; beast. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Python\"&gt;Elder pythons&lt;/a&gt; have been known to swallow &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s in one gulp.\nLate in life, if the environmental conditions are correct, a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Adder\"&gt;Death Adder&lt;/a&gt; may shed its skin and undergo a transformation into an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Python\"&gt;Imperial Python&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to recent accidents, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt;s have prohibited anyone from bringing snakes on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;. Snakes of all types are venerated throughout &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; culture. The &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Snake\"&gt;crimson snake&lt;/a&gt; is favored among the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls for not only its vicious nature, but also its steadfast loyalty. &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; trolls often capture the powerful &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Python\"&gt;tree pythons&lt;/a&gt; to keep as pets... or to cook as meals. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"wyvern%20rider\"&gt;wyvern rider&lt;/a&gt;s carry envenomed spears that have been coated with the lethal venom from Stranglethorn's giant jungle snakes. When pierced by these spears, the riders' enemies are weakened and slowly eaten alive as the vile poison courses through their bodies.

Also, if there are unpoisoned targets nearby, snakes will not melee, but will instead spit more poisons on that target, making snakes an excellent AoE boost. For example, if the hunter knows where a mage's AoE will be, they can place a snake trap there and most mobs at this location will get poisoned.\nWhen the trap is activated, snakes start to attack the nearest targets. It is possible that some snakes will attack one target and some will attack other. After the target is dead, snakes attacks next target (in close range).\nSnakes at level 80 have 107\u00a0hp and 9729 armor.\nThe Vipers hit for 38-53. 4 of these appear.\nThe Venomous Snakes hit for 16-24. 4 of these appear.\nBoth types of snakes use all 3 of the different poisons (Crippling, Mind-Numbing, and Deadly).\nThe damage they do does not scale with attack power, 2p T7, or aspect of the beast."}

Please, if you can spare your strength, help clear them out.\nRewards.\nYou will also receive: \nProgress.\n&lt;Yue sighs.&gt;\nIf only we'd kept up with our maintenance, the situation would not have come to this.\nCompletion.\nYou have my gratitude, &lt;name&gt;.\nPlease take this as a token of my appreciation.\nNotes.\nAfter picking up &lt;a href=\"Ashyo%27s%20Vision\"&gt;Ashyo's Vision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bottletoads\"&gt;Bottletoads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Watery%20Woes%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Watery Woes (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, on the way up to the top tier of the pool, adventurers come across Zhang Yue, who offers this quest. Pick it up, as the dragon turtles up top will aggro on the player whether or not they're on this quest. After accepting the quest:\nAshyo is a few yards to the west of Zhang, so do his event, turn in Ashyo's Vision and pick up &lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Dream\"&gt;The Golden Dream&lt;/a&gt; from Yue.\nHead up the hill to the top level of the Pools of Purity and pick up the sprig of dreamleaf behind the statue. Up near the dreamleaf, be on the lookout for , a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt; with 368,000 health. Kill it to loot &lt;a href=\"Krosh%27s%20Back\"&gt;Krosh's Back&lt;/a&gt; and start &lt;a href=\"Guess%20Whose%20Back\"&gt;Guess Whose Back&lt;/a&gt;. The bottletoads/snap judgement quests can be completed up here as well. Turn in Snap Judgment on the way down to the lower level for Watery Woes. Kill the cranes and loot the glimmering flies, which are critters. Then turn in at New Cifera.\nWhile out and about in the Gilded Fan, up in the northeast corner near the waterfall is a named &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;, . Kill it to spawn his mother, . She drops an &lt;a href=\"Enormous%20Crocolisk%20Tail\"&gt;Enormous Crocolisk Tail&lt;/a&gt;, which starts &lt;a href=\"A%20Crocolisk%20Tale\"&gt;A Crocolisk Tale&lt;/a&gt;."}

Snapdragons are not a natural species: ten thousand years ago, on order of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, they were created by the mage &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Elryna\"&gt;Professor Elryna&lt;/a&gt; and her students in &lt;a href=\"Nar%27anan\"&gt;Nar'anan&lt;/a&gt; by modifying &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. Mainly found on &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, they are captured at a young age by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and raised to serve their &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as loyal and fierce companions. While quiet hunters in the water, they are far less stealthy on land. When a snapdragon bites you, the worry isn't about the bite itself, but the poison that will begin to eat away at the wound. Snapdragons will eat anything, including your arm if you don't move it away quick enough. The claws of a mature snapdragon are razor-sharp and more durable than steel.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ascension%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;period following the Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; used snapdragons in battle and bred them at &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Grounds\"&gt;Spawning Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nSnapdragons are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt; family.\nIn the RPG.\nThe snap dragon is a long, wiry, lizardlike creature. It runs with an undulating grace reminiscent of a snake. Its head is also snakelike, and a red tongue darts from its mouth. It is obviously amphibious, with a red, finlike ridge extending down its spine. Large fins flare from its head and tail. They appear as trained beasts in many naga armies. In the wild, snap dragons dwell along tropical coasts, entering the water to lay in wait for prey. When they sense it coming near, they rise and spit acid until the prey falls. The snap dragon then ambles over and feasts on the partially liquefied meal.\nMany snap dragons exist in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, where they are a danger. All avoid them except the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, who train the beasts for war. Snap dragons spend much of their time on land, where their acidic spit is effective, but use the water to surprise prey and to move quickly through their territory.\nSnap dragons attack from ambush. They use watery environments to conceal their presence, and to move to where they can attack prey from the most advantageous places. They spit at their prey repeatedly and retreat from attackers, only to circle around and try again. They bite only if cornered or if underwater.\nSnap dragons function equally well on land and in the water."}

There are 2 types of snares: area-based snares, such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Trap\"&gt;Ice Trap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Earthbind%20Totem\"&gt;Earthbind Totem&lt;/a&gt;, and debuff-based snares (also called Slows), such as &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Poison\"&gt;Crippling Poison&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20Howl\"&gt;Piercing Howl&lt;/a&gt;. \nSnares can be most useful to &lt;a href=\"Ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; when fighting opponents who only possess &lt;a href=\"Melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attacks, allowing them to &lt;a href=\"Kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; the opponent. Conversely, snares can be very useful for melee classes seeking to prevent ranged opponents from escaping beyond reach of their attacks. Snares are also useful to prevent enemies from fleeing to safety or running for help (in &lt;a href=\"Instance\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; especially).\n&lt;a href=\"Spell\"&gt;Spell&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; with a snare effect usually have a percentage listed (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Daze\"&gt;Daze&lt;/a&gt; is a \"50% snare\"). The target's full movement speed is reduced by this percentage.\nMechanics.\nSnare debuffs do not stack. Instead, the debuff that gives the most movement speed reduction takes precedence. If any lesser snare is applied while a greater snare is active, it will not be applied, even if the greater snare will expire sooner."}

If you were fast you could also run away fast from the shredder, then Sneed would not be pulled, but you could have difficulties with targeting him again.\nAlso, players had to be aware that if the tank did not know that Sneed would jump out, and would start looting the shredder, it would be VERY difficult to prevent a wipe, since Sneed moved fast, attacked fast, and hit pretty hard.

After Terenas' murder at the hands of his son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, the crown was secretly whisked away and buried at the lighthouse outside &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaped \"more like a spiked helmet than a coronet\", the crown is adorned with blue gemstones and a ring of metal spikes. At the front, it features the symbol of Lordaeron flanked by two &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s rampant above an especially large gem.\nHistory.\nWhen Arthas murdered Terenas with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Terenas' crown fell off of his head, bounced down the steps from the throne, and landed on the floor of the chamber, broken and stained by the dying king's blood. An unknown individual or group\u2014believed by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; to have been &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s of Lordaeron\u2014recovered the crown, brought it south to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and secretly buried it in a small grave behind the lighthouse on an island in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Flynn believes that with Terenas' body destroyed and Lordaeron infested by &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, Terenas' subjects must have wanted a place to mourn their king and that this was their quiet way of doing so. The site is marked by a simple tombstone, whose inscription has faded and become unreadable with time.\nTerenas' empty tomb in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; features a plaque which ends with the statement:\n\"May the Father lie blameless for the deeds of the son.&lt;br&gt;May the bloodied crown stay lost and forgotten.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; doesn't know who wrote this part, but speculates that it was done on the orders of Terenas' friend, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. When Thoras himself died, he was &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;buried&lt;/a&gt; with a secret epitaph whose text seems to cryptically hint at keeping a secret about something buried on an island. As such, he was probably involved with\u2014or at least aware of\u2014the crown's disappearance as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; noticed that the crown was missing when she entered the imperial chamber for the first time at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;Plaguelands civil war&lt;/a&gt;. She was unconcerned by this, as the crown wasn't what she'd come for. Terenas' daughter &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia&lt;/a&gt;, who is unaware of the crown's fate, believes that it is lost to time and that neither she nor her lost daughter will ever wear it.\nDuring Mathias Shaw and Flynn Fairwind's survey of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Flynn pieced together several clues and realized where the bloodied crown was buried. He and Mathias dug it up to confirm the theory, then buried it once more and agreed to continue keeping the location secret, as Terenas would've wanted."}

Upon acquiring a target, Mandokir dismounts and fights with his mount Ohgan.\nBloodlord Mandokir\nOhgan\nOhgan has 91,560 health and remains active until killed. He will not despawn upon Mandokir's death.\nChained Spirit\nChained Spirits automatically move toward dead players and cast Revive on them, which \"consumes\" the spirit. There are a limited amount of spirits per attempt.\nDing!\n\"Grats!\" yells &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt;. The Bloodlord has one more very tricky thing. When you die, he gains experience. Three deaths will level him, making him hit harder, take less physical damage, and grow in size. If this happens more than a couple times, it will almost certainly be a wipe. Try not to let this happen. It is fairly easy to tell when he levels, as he has the same animation as a normal character will when he or she levels.\nThere are also spirits around that will resurrect you when you die, with full stats. They randomly choose a corpse to resurrect, so use it when you get it. But attempt to stay alive as best you can, as your death fuels his strength.\nPriests should be aware that the ghosts are currently bugged and will not resurrect you if you have the spirit of redemption talent. Clicking it off immediately may allow it to work (this remains untested).\nStrategy.\nThe Bloodlord is a much more difficult fight than the snake and bat aspects. He levels with your deaths and has an extremely fast-moving, quite deadly raptor.\nThere are two primary methods of dealing with him, each with their separate strategies. To begin with either, begin the fight by pulling the speaker. Kill him; he only has a few thousand HP. Then, you must first separate the raptor and the Bloodlord. Many groups pull the raptor up to behind the stakes, though that is up to the raid leader. Meanwhile, the Bloodlord remains beneath the stakes in almost all cases. Both strategies consist of having the main tank on the Bloodlord and the offtank on the raptor. In either case, have the Mages in the raid group place Amplify Magic on every character, as this fight is purely physical.\n1.\nThe focus of this strategy is to avoid the Bloodlord's enrage when Ohgan dies; it significantly increases his attack power, and it is also suspected to increase the variability of his charges. In affect, the raptor is to be offtanked until the Bloodlord is dead, at which point, the raid may finish the encounter by killing the raptor. The raptor has a stackable debuff effect which decreases the target's armor by a high amount; 7 to 8 sunders will make the tank wearing them squishy as a cloth wearer. Make sure to switch tanks between 3 and 5 sunders. This fight does require 3 tanks. This makes this strategy difficult for the healers; without gear, this makes the fight near impossible for the healers and their mana to survive.\n2.\nThe alternative is to kill the raptor first and the Bloodlord second. This is more dangerous for the raid overall, but it probably amounts to the same difficulty as the first strategy, as your healers are all focused on either the MT or the random person who gets hit by the charge. Again, leave the MT on the Bloodlord, with two offtanks on the raptor, switching off as prescribed in the first strategy. When the raptor falls, the Bloodlord will enrage, increasing attack power, as well as (it seems) increase the randomness with his attacks. The enrage lasts for approximately a minute, but it does make him hit very hard. Every healer should be on the main tank, and the tank should be prepared to make last-minute saves, such as Shield Wall.\nControlling Mandokir.\nThe main issue in fighting this boss is getting the aggro back on the MT as quickly as possible after he charges. He seems to charge randomly, but in actuality, he charges anyone who is singled out away from the group and DPSing. Thusly, the easiest way to control him is to deliberately give him someone to single out, while the rest of the group huddles. Hunters work well, as they can Feign Death to aid in the MT's recovery of Mandokir. After Mandokir charges, he will move on the next highest aggro, which is not the MT since he partially dumps the threat associated with the highest aggro producer prior to the charge. This makes it necessary for the one who has the highest threat to run for the MT. DPS should pause after he charges, to enable the tank to easily reestablish his threat.\nLoot.\nMandokir drops several important items. High-end guilds will kill him for his &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Idol\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Idol&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to a very powerful class-specific enchant. \nIn addition to that, he also drops a very rare epic mount. It is called the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Razzashi%20Raptor\"&gt;Swift Razzashi Raptor&lt;/a&gt; and it is the only possibility for Alliance members to ride a raptor. Horde members can ride it, too, including &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nMandokir, along with &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt;, has a high drop rate on the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Kossack\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Kossack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Aegis\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Aegis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Tabard\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Tabard&lt;/a&gt;, which are otherwise rare."}

He can still be found near his old location, but he now has a small arena where he fights against the players, as the path to his old fighting area has collapsed.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The infamous Bloodlord Mandokir died a torturous death before Bloodscalp trolls desecrated his body years ago. Word has now spread that Mandokir walks the jungles of Stranglethorn yet again, using the corpse of the mighty Bloodscalp chieftain Gan'zulah as a host for his malevolent spirit.\"\nStrategy.\nBloodlord Mandokir will begin mounted on his raptor, &lt;a href=\"Ohgan\"&gt;Ohgan&lt;/a&gt;. His main ability is to Decapitate a random player and kill them instantly. This is completely unavoidable except for immunity spells such as Ice Block. When a player dies, a Chained Spirit on the arena edges will run up to their corpse and revive them with bonus health, damage, healing and reduced damage taken. Once the first Chained Spirit is used up, Mandokir will dismount his raptor and send him to kill the spirits helping you out. All DPS should focus fire this raptor before it kills any of the spirits. Mandokir will eventually revive the raptor after it dies so DPS need to pay attention.\nHis other abilities to watch out for are Devastating Slam. This makes a huge patch of rumbling earth appear in a random player's direction. When this appears, everyone has to get out of it quickly or they will die.\nHis other ability is Bloodletting. He will target a random player and deal damage equal to half their current health every 2 seconds for 10 sec. This spell always deals at least 7500 damage, which means that it will deal a total of at least 120,000 damage over the course of the effect (the target will need to have started with at least 120,016 health in order to reliably survive). Don't heal the target of Bloodletting heavily, but do give them enough healing to keep them alive, since Bloodletting can now easily kill its targets.\nAt 20%, Mandokir will frenzy, doubling his attack speed and allowing him to Decapitate more often. This is a burn phase and healing intensive, so players should save some cooldowns for this part.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "390358", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=390358", "title": "Bloodlust effect", "text": "A bloodlust effect, bloodlust ability, or simply \"a bloodlust\" (\"heroism\" may also be used in place of \"bloodlust\" in any of these cases) is one of several effects that significantly increases &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; for 40 seconds for all raid members, with an effective 10 minute cooldown. The true bloodlust effects are the shaman abilities &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, the mage spell &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;, the hunter pet ability &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Rage\"&gt;Primal Rage&lt;/a&gt;, and the evoker spell &lt;a href=\"Fury%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Fury of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Those abilities and their associated &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s function identically to each other, and are often referred to interchangeably.\nDetails.\nThe true bloodlust effects are identical except for their names. All \"increase melee, ranged, and spell casting speed by 30% for all party and raid members\" and last 40 seconds. All are &lt;a href=\"instant%20cast\"&gt;instant cast&lt;/a&gt; abilities. The &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s are 5 minutes for the player spells and 6 minutes for the pet abilities - however this is usually irrelevant due to their application of a 10 minute &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; to all targets affected, which prevents those characters from being receiving a similar ability's effects. The debuff \"is not\" cleared by &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28gameplay%29\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, but is cleared when a raid boss resets due to a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodlust effects cannot be used in &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;s. The 40 second buff provided is magical, which means it can be &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;led and is vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodlust effects play distinctive sounds when used (even if nobody is actually affected due to the debuff) and increase the size of those affected by 30%.\nSeveral effects of \"war drum\" leatherworking items are similar but inferior to the true bloodlust effects.\nUsage.\nBloodlust effects are most prominently used during &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s, but there's no reason they can't be used in other situations. \nRegardless of context, any player benefiting from Bloodlust should typically use damage &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Wrath\"&gt;Avenging Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arcane Power (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vendetta\"&gt;Vendetta&lt;/a&gt; if available; the damage boosts will stack multiplicatively, resulting in slightly higher overall damage compared to being used separately. The exception to this is other haste-increasing abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Power%20Infusion\"&gt;Power Infusion&lt;/a&gt; if those abilities would cause a character to run into a &lt;a href=\"Haste%23Haste%20cap\"&gt;haste cap&lt;/a&gt;. Players in possession of such abilities may want to calculate for themselves the optimal combination of haste buffs for their various ability breakpoints.\nUse against raid bosses.\nBloodlust abilities provide a large boost to a raid's damage output, so raid leaders almost always ensure they have at least one provider of the effect when assembling a raid for any on-level &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; content.\nBecause it only lasts 40 seconds, raids should utilize it according to the needs of the fight. Casters should be especially careful not to use it at a time when damage dealers would not be able to make use of its full duration, for instance if the boss will go invulnerable in 20 seconds.\nThe 10 minute cooldown debuff is cleared upon death, allowing the next attempt after a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; to use it once again. Those surviving a wipe will not have their debuffs cleared, and should be aware they may not receive the benefits of the next bloodlust along with the rest of the raid.\nOther uses.\nBloodlust effects \"may\" be used on instance &lt;a href=\"trash%20mob\"&gt;trash mob&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly larger trash pulls, although this is never necessary and rarely expected. When a raid &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; is pulled, the debuff is cleaned, so it may be a good idea to use it in a big pull before the boss, as long as there are at least two Bloodlust sources in the raid.\nBloodlust effects can certainly be used in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, especially when two large groups of enemies are meeting each other. Priests and other offensive dispellers may listen for the sound of the abilities, and look for the buff and increased size of enemies to identify targets for a dispel. Because of the long duration, even single-target dispels are worthwhile.\nWhen soloing or in small groups, bloodlust effects may be useful against &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; mobs or large groups of mobs, or for surviving in panic situations. While it does not reduce damage taken, it can allow quicker casting of healing spells, crowd control, and escape abilities, or simply allow the player to kill the opponent first.\nWar drums.\nDrums crafted and used by &lt;a href=\"leatherworker\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt;s can approximate bloodlust effects, although level restrictions prevent them from being relevant in modern raids. Most obvious are the &lt;a href=\"Drums%20of%20Rage\"&gt;Drums of Rage&lt;/a&gt;, which like the true bloodlusts provide a haste increase to the raid for 40 seconds, and apply a debuff preventing re-use for 10 minutes. However, the benefit is only 25%, not 30%. Note that the debuff prevents the drums from being used in conjunction with true bloodlust abilities. These drums can only affect characters level 90 or below, the level of \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" raids.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drums%20of%20Battle\"&gt;Drums of Battle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drums%20of%20War%20%28item%29\"&gt;Drums of War (item)&lt;/a&gt; provide 30 second buffs to the raid that increase either haste, or attack and intellect. These effects \"can\" actually stack with those of true bloodlust powers. However, they only affect players level 79 and below, and therefore are not relevant to raids beyond the level of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNames.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; provides the general name for these effects because, while it and &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; were added to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" at the same time, Bloodlust has been around since \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", making it the most well known ability of this type. The specific ability Bloodlust should always be capitalized, whereas the general term \"bloodlust effect\" should not be capitalized.\nIt is common to refer to all bloodlust abilities as just Bloodlust or Heroism or one of their nicknames, especially in the heat of battle. All function the same, so this allows raid leaders to describe strategies and call for proper usage without worrying about which version is available. Raids will commonly hear \"LUST!\" or \"HERO!\" at at least one point in a boss fight, regardless of the ability used. \"Lust\" has a slight edge as the generic term, but \"Hero\" is extremely common among &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; raids, even when &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; or another effect is used.\nHistory.\nThe first appearance of Bloodlust was as a &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20abilities%23Ogre-Mage%20Spells\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; available to the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20units%23Knight%20/%20Ogre\"&gt;Ogre Mage&lt;/a&gt; unit which doubled all damage types of another unit for about 25 seconds. It was considered one of the most powerful abilities in the game. In \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", Orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; received the ability, which was changed to increase attack rate by 40% (very similar to the modern spell) and movement speed by 25% for 60 seconds. This ability was also single-target, but could be &lt;a href=\"autocast\"&gt;autocast&lt;/a&gt;; a shaman with full mana could buff 10 other units.\nA common misconception holds that &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; was added to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" before &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, since shaman were initially a Horde-only class. In fact, Bloodlust was not added until \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", when it and Heroism were added as level 70 abilities as part of the decision to allow &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; in both factions.\nPart of the design philosophy of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" was to make good on &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard's instruction to raid leaders to \"bring a player, not a class\". For this reason, mages learned &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; and beast master specced hunters received access to &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hysteria\"&gt;Ancient Hysteria&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt; pets. This eliminated the requirement to bring a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; to every raid, and instead only asked that one of those three types of characters was present - a high likelihood in even 10-man raids. At the same time, bloodlust effects were banned from arenas, which (as with raids) removed it as a consideration for team composition.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", non-Beast Master hunters gained access to bloodlust effects via Nether Ray pets with the &lt;a href=\"Netherwinds\"&gt;Netherwinds&lt;/a&gt; ability, making three full classes that could grant the ability to raids.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", both bloodlust effects from hunter were replaced by &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Rage\"&gt;Primal Rage&lt;/a&gt;, an ability shared by all Ferocity pets.\nTrivia.\n is a shaman spell in the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" card game, granting temporarily increased attack ability to the player's minions (allies). The other bloodlust effects are not yet present in the game.\nBloodlust or \"lust\" is the most common term used to reference Bloodlust effect abilities due to Bloodlust being a spell in lore with a similar effect since Warcraft II, which all other iterations of Bloodlust and Bloodlust effect abilities are based off.

North of the main island, &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Bloodmyst is often the next step in the journey for ambitious young draenei.\nBloodmyst Isle has been ravaged by &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Radiation\"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; from the crashed draenei ship, the \"Exodar\". Red crystals dot the land, and the eerie red mist for which the isle was renamed covers everything. Even the great pine trees which cover the island have taken on a crimson tinge. The creatures of the isle have mutated, in some cases becoming hostile. The &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find a way to restore the island, have set up an outpost known as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt; near the center of the island.\nSeveral giant creatures can be found on Bloodmyst Isle. The northwest of Bloodmyst Isle is home to a huge spider called &lt;a href=\"Zarakh\"&gt;Zarakh&lt;/a&gt;, its spawn grown to unnatural sizes due to contamination by the spaceship debris. Near the &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Coil\"&gt;Vector Coil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; have set up camp to control its energies and use it to empower their &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;secret leader&lt;/a&gt;. Heroes of the draenei are called upon to bring her down. A smaller island off the coast to the northeast, called &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt;, is now home to the ghost of a dragon called &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, this island was once heavily populated by &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, centered at the large &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves who once inhabited this city were blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and its queen &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; rode these powerful &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s into battle while also living alongside them. The city was destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; betrayed their green kin and descended upon the unwary night elves and green dragons. Led by a lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight wiped out &lt;a href=\"Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and its defenders in a savage maelstrom of flame and death. The city of Loreth'Aran's destruction was made complete by the cataclysm, as the ocean swept in and the earth erupted, leaving only a few remaining ruins scattered across separate islands where once a shining city stood. &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt; is now home to bones, the restless spirits of slain green whelplings, and the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf prince of Loreth'Aran.\nThe island was originally known as Silvergale when the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; first landed, as beautiful as nearby &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The island has for a long time lain out of view from central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and has largely been left to itself by the neighboring &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely that this is why many enemies of the night elves, such as &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, have found a haven here. &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s also inhabit the island.\nThe island was corrupted by blood red crystals from the draenei's dimensional ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". Blood-like liquid seeps from many of the crystals into the ground. The corruption from the liquid caused creatures and plants to become irradiated. The air was polluted with red-tinted mist from the red liquid. Due to the corruption, the island was renamed \"Bloodmyst\". When the \"Exodar\" crashed on Azuremyst Isle, several large pieces of the dimensional ship fell on Bloodmyst. These pieces are now used both by the draenei and by other creatures as a form of shelter.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; reported that the beasts of Bloodmyst were badly weakened from the toxins, and not much wildlife has been spared of the illness over the years.\nGetting there.\nThe dock in Rut'theran connects to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; via a portal, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; by flight path and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; by sea.\nGeography.\nBloodmyst Isle lies off the west coast of northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The island is divided into two sections by a narrow strip of water. The smaller section, which is connected by a bridge to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, is yet untainted by the red mist which covers the main part of the island.\nThere are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds on Bloodmyst Isle. The micro dungeon, the &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Coil\"&gt;Vector Coil&lt;/a&gt;, can be found here. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt; serves as the zone's travel hub, connecting it to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel hubs.\nThe only travel hub on Bloodmyst Isle is Alliance aligned &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei outpost serves as a communication and transportation connection to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;."}

Major conflicts on the island include battles against the irradiated wildlife, the local satyrs and the blood elves known as &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s. Most of the questing is done from Blood Watch in the center of the island, though there are a couple of other questing hubs.\nThe progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle%20Quests\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nKessel's Crossing.\nThe first place Draenei players arrive is Kessel's Crossing, right on the border between Azuremyst Isle and Bloodmyst Isle. There, &lt;a href=\"Kessel\"&gt;Kessel&lt;/a&gt; has numerous quests for them revolving around defending the crossing from the threats of the Blood Elves and the Naga. Other quests in the area involve &lt;a href=\"A%20Favorite%20Treat\"&gt;collecting fruit from the island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Predators\"&gt;balancing the local ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; after the Exodar's crash unbalanced it.\nKessel's Quests:\nWith &lt;a href=\"Saving%20Princess%20Stillpine\"&gt;Saving Princess Stillpine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Exarch%20Admetius\"&gt;Report to Exarch Admetius&lt;/a&gt;, players move on to Blood Watch.\nBlood Watch.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt;, players have many quest lines dedicated to the defense of Bloodmyst Isle against the myriad threats being faced by the newly-arrived Draenei. In order to combat these threats, there are Vindicators who offer specific quest chains dedicated to countering each threat. The quest chains intertwine with each other to lead to the ultimate goal of the safety of the island.\nSunhawks.\nThe main Vindicator giving quests to defeat the Sunhawks is &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving at Blood Watch from the quest &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Exarch%20Admetius\"&gt;Report to Exarch Admetius&lt;/a&gt;, players are sent to Boros who immediately sends them into the field to terminate Sunhawks and collect crystals.\nAfter some time, players can then help Vindicator Boros as he searches for information on how the Sunhawks are fighting so valiantly against the Draenei. They discover the existence of Sun Gates - portals to Outland that the Sunhawks are using to summon reinforcements. This information is taken to Prophet Velen in &lt;a href=\"Audience%20with%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Audience with the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. He proposes that the Sun Gates can be located by the presence of Void anomalies. Using these Void Anomalies, players locate the Sun Gates and then destroy them in &lt;a href=\"The%20Sun%20Gate\"&gt;The Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nVindicator Boros:\nVindicator Kuros:\nOn finding Galaen's Journal, players discover that &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Saruan\"&gt;Vindicator Saruan&lt;/a&gt;, a Draenei leader, was captured and tortured by the Sunhawks before being brutally transformed into some sort of abomination. On hearing this, Vindicator Kuros is furious and has players capture the Blood Elf responsible, &lt;a href=\"Matis%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Matis the Cruel&lt;/a&gt; so he may be brought to justice.\nVindicator Aesom:\nHaving learned of the torture of Vindicator Saruan and destroyed the Sun Gates, players are directed to Exarch Admetius himself for the final stage of the plan to destroy the Sunhawks - destroying the &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Coil\"&gt;Vector Coil&lt;/a&gt;. Players interrogate a Sunhawk prisoner to learn the weaknesses of the Vector Coil and are then dispatched to Vindicator's Rest to prepare the way for the assault. This starts the Vindicator's Rest quest lines.\nCrystal Corruption.\n&lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Mikolaas\"&gt;Harbinger Mikolaas&lt;/a&gt; is concerned with the nature of the crystals that were scattered around Bloodmyst Isle by the Exodar's crash, and the effects they are having on the local wildlife. He has players travel around and collect three crystal samples from the island so he can properly study them and their effects.\nOther Draenei leaders are more concerned with the effects that the crystals are having and have players collect samples from the mutated &lt;a href=\"Water%20Elemental\"&gt;Water Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and slay the mutated Spiders.\nSatyrs.\nVindicator Aalesia has players join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; by investigating and slaying the satyrs of Bloodmyst Isle. It is discovered that the Satyrs are trying to contact the Legion in &lt;a href=\"Signs%20of%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Signs of the Legion&lt;/a&gt;, so the Satyrs must be destroyed.\nOther.\nThere are several miscellaneous quests not related to the battle for survival that players can accept in Blood Watch.\nIn Classic, the introduction to Flight paths happens in Bloodmyst Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Morae\"&gt;Morae&lt;/a&gt; is investigating the Murlocs of the area and has players tag some of them for her, then goes on to investigate the treants and has players collect samples.\nMaatparm asks players to collect mushrooms from around Bloodmyst Isle for her collection in &lt;a href=\"Maatparm%20Mushroom%20Menagerie\"&gt;Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie&lt;/a&gt; and then from Wyrmscar Island in &lt;a href=\"Ysera%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Ysera's Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tracker%20Lyceon\"&gt;Tracker Lyceon&lt;/a&gt; has players collect materials from around the island so he can fashion them into tools to help the draenei cause.\n&lt;a href=\"Clopper%20Wizbang\"&gt;Clopper Wizbang&lt;/a&gt; needs help studying the Blacksilt murlocs on the North of the island, then thanks players who help him with a Treasure Map. This leads them on a trip all around the island until the eventual discovery of &lt;a href=\"Nolkai%27s%20Box\"&gt;Nolkai's Box&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorae later asks players to find her husband &lt;a href=\"Galaen\"&gt;Galaen&lt;/a&gt;, though it is discovered that he is dead and players return to Morae with this sad news.\nIn Classic, Shamans recieve a quest chain to obtain their Water totems at level 20.\nHarbinger Mikolaas sends players onwards to Vindicator's Rest in &lt;a href=\"Talk%20to%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Talk to the Hand&lt;/a&gt; while Exarch Admetius sends them in &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Vindicator's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, moving the quest hub to Vindicator's Rest.\nVindicator's Rest.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Vindicator's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, players must first help Scout Jorli return to Blood Watch for medical help and then slay the Void critters that wounded him. This brings players back to Blood Watch before returning to Vindicator's Rest.\nAnother quest involves rescuing members of a research expedition captured by spiders:\nOn returning, players can join Vindicator Corin in clearing out all the threats around Vindicator's Rest before assaulting the Vector Coil itself and destroying it in &lt;a href=\"Ending%20Their%20World\"&gt;Ending Their World&lt;/a&gt;\nPlayers can return to the Exodar to talk to Prophet Velen and be congratulated for their work.\nWyrmscar Island.\n&lt;a href=\"Messenger%20Hermesius\"&gt;Messenger Hermesius&lt;/a&gt; will deliver players an urgent message from Admiral Odesyus, who sends them to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt;. On the Island, the long-dead Captain Edward Hanes has them help defeat the Naga of the island and end the mysterious Bloodcurse that is afflicting the souls of those who died on the island.\nAlso on the island, Prince Toreth has players retrieve Dragon bones from thieving Wildkin and then release the trapped spirits of the Emerald Whelps on the island, before slaying the abomination &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, onwards to &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; to take a boat and begin the Ashenvale storyline."}

They are under the observation from the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n&lt;a href=\"Muigin\"&gt;Muigin&lt;/a&gt; tried to train them to obey commands as they have some minimal intelligence Bloodpetal sprouts are the plants that haven't fully sprouted yet. Within the bloodpetal sprouts grow bloodcap mushrooms used for a toxin to pacify great creatures.\nThe plant life reacts strangely to the bloodpetals in the &lt;a href=\"Roiling%20Gardens\"&gt;Roiling Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. The trees are enveloped with more flowers and vines than usual. Large, sporous blossoms project themselves from the ground where they once did not. The bloodpetals destroy the balance. Upon death, they may leave pollen scent.\nLife cycle.\nThe Bloodpetals have a fascinating life cycle. The trees in the southern &lt;a href=\"Marshlands\"&gt;Marshlands&lt;/a&gt; bear seeds that fall down into the river, when they mature, and then travel down the river to the north where the seed hatches. This life cycle is known as the waterborne seed. After they hatch their next phase begins, known as the pack of juveniles, these Bloodpetals after hatching quickly form gangs and travel together, offsetting their weakness with overwhelming numbers. During this time, while they normally keep to themselves, if one is agitated they all become agitated.\nAfter hitting their adult stage, they split up and fend for themselves.\nIn the RPG.\nBloodpetals are a type of medium-sized plant. The plant has a huge blood-red flower and a thick stem extending five feet to the ground. The creature ambles along on many wiry roots, which act like legs and its thorn-covered arms wave back and forth. Bloodpetals are found all over the floor of &lt;a href=\"Un%27goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodpetals are ambulatory plants that dwell in the steamy jungles of the Un'Goro Crater. The plant has a hugh blood-red flower and a thick stem extending five feet to the ground. The creature ambles along on many wiry roots, which act like legs; its thorn-covered arms wave back and forth menacingly. They are covered in nasty thorns that exude a crippling toxin; although not terribly dangerous alone, they tend to use swarm tactics. Otherwise, not much is known about these curious creatures, although the Explorers' League produces a few reports. Colonies of bloodpetals, apparently always less than 30 in number, stake out a territory typically in some remote area where threats are at a minimum. They defend this area carefully while new bloodpetal sprouts grow. A sprout remains immobile for several months before its legs fully develop. Once a bloodpetal patch grows too large for nearby resources to support it, the creatures send out scouts. These scouts range far and wide, and thus are usually the first bloodpetals a visitor to Un'Goro encounters; interestingly, a scout avoids conflict and fights only to defend itself, giving the illusion that bloodpetals aren't terribly aggressive-a fact that leads many explorers into trouble when they encounter an actual patch.\nBloodpetals typically stand about 5 feet high and weigh about 100 pounds. They speak no languages as far as anyone knows, although they do seem capable of communicating with each other in some unknown manner. A bloodpetal attacks by striking out with its thorny arms, attempting to poison its foes. Once a creature no longer seems a threat, the bloodpetal moves to the next target or, if combat is over, departs. Bloodpetals don't consume animal matter, although they might bury a corpse for use as convenient fertilizer.\nUnlike most creatures in Un'Goro, they are passive and do not attack unless attacked first. Once angered they will attack with thorns, poisons or entangling roots. They seem to grow as sprouts before becoming full, moving flowers, not unlike the Timberlings on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir sprouts make a tasty meal for other creatures of the area, yet the fully grown plants are not-edible due to their thorns and poison they have to help them survive in the harsh region."}

It generates 20 rage instantly, and a further 10 &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt; over 10 seconds (1 rage per second), at the expense of 16% of base health upon activation. It is one of the most basic rage generation abilities, and one of the few that can be used outside of combat.\nIn patch 4.0.1, Bloodrage has been removed, and replaced by rage generation from other abilities. &lt;a href=\"Commanding%20Shout\"&gt;Commanding Shout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Shout\"&gt;Battle Shout&lt;/a&gt; generate 20 rage (25/30 if improved with &lt;a href=\"Booming%20Voice%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Booming Voice (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;) and when improved with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Glyph of Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt; also generates 5 rage.\nNotes.\nThe health cost is the user's unmodified health, and so will cause considerably less damage then the 16% implies. At level 80 when warriors have tons of stamina, the health is barely missed.\nThe health cost can be completely removed via the (minor) &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Bloodrage\"&gt;Glyph of Bloodrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and tactics.\nUseful in all manner of situations as it is one of the few ways to kick-start a warrior's &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt; from rest. (Others include &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Potion\"&gt;Rage Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and some items). The alternative is simply to wade into combat and wait for the &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt; to charge up through damage done and taken, which puts the warrior at a significant initial handicap.\nParticularly useful in PvP encounters, where sudden use of an ability may be required instantly.\nIf you know a rogue is nearby, Bloodrage may be a useful skill to use. You can use the rage to use two Demoralizing Shouts, which will unstealth the rogue if it lands.\nBloodrage does not start the global cooldown. Therefore, you can use it at the same time you use any other ability. Combines well with &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; to generate a massive amount of rage very quickly. Fury warriors will find that creating a macro to use Bloodrage and improved Berserker rage at once will generate a whopping 45 rage at once. Also works well with &lt;a href=\"Intercept%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Intercept (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamstring\"&gt;Hamstring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt;, where you often need to use the skill immediately and can't spare even a second to wait for rage.\nAs a tank, Bloodrage is a crucial skill to master in order to perform effective pulls. It should be used immediately after the pull is made, as the Rage generated causes a very small amount of threat \u2013 not enough to reliably hold aggro, but enough that &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; can be applied by other group members without risk of drawing aggro off the tank. If a mispull is made, activating Bloodrage immediately can even draw some of the aggro onto yourself from other group members, although again it is best not to rely exclusively on this to hold aggro, instead using the generated Rage to solidify aggro with &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Devastate\"&gt;Devastate&lt;/a&gt;s, or other high-threat-generating abilities. The cooldown is short enough that it can generally be used on every pull, and the damage taken is small enough that it does not put you into a threatening position immediately. However, make sure your healers know that they should not heal the damage cause by Bloodrage as the pull is being made, and especially they should not cast a &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; spell on you before a pull."}

They are the bane of many a merchant in the high seas and are sworn enemies of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Their base is &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;Bloodsail Hold&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. Their sub-organizations include the &lt;a href=\"Brashtide%20Crew\"&gt;Brashtide Crew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Boomers\"&gt;Bloodsail Boomers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough extremely dangerous, they are the least wealthy of all pirate groups. This is due to the simple fact that no one survives a Bloodsail attack, which means the pirates don't allow survivors to be possibly robbed again in the future.\nHistory.\nBefore the Cataclysm.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Jerias%20Bloodvein\"&gt;Jerias Bloodvein&lt;/a&gt; once abducted &lt;a href=\"James%20Blackridge\"&gt;James Blackridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bram%20Woodring\"&gt;Bram Woodring&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them into becoming pirates themselves. After some time, the three escaped, killing Jerias in the process.\nThe Bloodsail plot to plunder and cripple the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;-controlled port &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, that was under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. It was likely the Bloodsail Buccaneers came to take advantage of the city's current loss of its fleet off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, in which two of its ships were destroyed and the remaining ship forced to find shelter in a cove where its crew currently fights to survive skirmishes against the &lt;a href=\"Daggerspine\"&gt;Daggerspine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The pirates had a deal with &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn preparation for the attack, the Bloodsail Buccaneers took up positions in key locations near the city. They had three ships anchored along the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Shore\"&gt;coastline&lt;/a&gt; south of Booty Bay, clear of the town's defensive cannons, with camps also being built along the same coast in preparation for the attack. In addition, a scouting party landed just west of the entrance to the city, reporting all activities, and a compound was being constructed along the road leading towards the city and was likely able to stop any re-enforcement from coming to aid Booty Bay.\nBoth the Bloodsail Buccaneers and Blackwater Raiders seek to achieve their goals without having their forces engaged in battle; to this end, each side seeks the aid of adventurers sympathetic to their cause.\nAfter the Cataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; caught a Bloodsail Buccaneers ship captained by &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Admiral%20Eliza\"&gt;Admiral Eliza Goreblade&lt;/a&gt;, and they were forced to take shelter near a patch of tiny islands not far from &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; as the seas heaved to and fro. After the initial unrest passed, Eliza Goreblade noticed that rogue waves had revealed a cache of gold, jewels, and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;pair of weapons&lt;/a&gt;, the last stash of the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;\". The buccaneers gleefully took it all. Admiral Goreblade reserved a pair of gleaming cutlasses for herself, the only weapons in the cache that hadn't become rusted and worn over time. Unfortunately, that decision led her crew to ruin.\nAfter claiming these cutlasses, Goreblade was taken by a vision. She saw herself commanding an impossibly large pirate fleet, one that could conquer the high seas and all the nations of Azeroth. Every ship that dared to challenge her burned, and every city gave up its treasures or was destroyed. It was an intoxicating sight, and she drank every drop of its promise. When she awoke, she had her crew set sail for a rival pirate hideout. The corrupted Bloodsail Buccaneers proceeded to slaughter all the unfortunate souls they found there. The loot they took was secondary. The killing was what truly satisfied them. These weapons had taken root deep within their minds, and now there was no escape. Goreblade's buccaneers became an unseen, deadly menace on the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. The master of these weapons, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;, had seen what attracting too much attention would do, so he encouraged Admiral Goreblade to attack only isolated ships and make certain they did not escape.\nFor several years, the pirate crew did exactly what they were told. They killed without mercy, and the power of the cutlasses grew ever stronger. When other Bloodsail Buccaneers learned how deep into insanity this crew had fallen, they tried to intervene. Goreblade's pirates survived the counterattack and managed to steal the Bloodsail Buccaneers' most prized ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Veil\"&gt;Crimson Veil&lt;/a&gt;\", for themselves.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodsail Buccaneers ships \u2014 the \"&lt;a href=\"Orca%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Killmonger\"&gt;Killmonger&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 led by &lt;a href=\"Ironpatch\"&gt;Ironpatch&lt;/a&gt; attacked the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20King\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt;\" of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; killed the \"Sea Kings captain, &lt;a href=\"Adashe%20Flintwill\"&gt;Adashe Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, and his two brothers, &lt;a href=\"Akashinga%20Flintwill\"&gt;Akashinga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amahle%20Flintwill\"&gt;Amahle&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Orca\" parted with the new loot, and as Ironpatch was preparing to kill the rest of the crew, &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\" appeared and sabotaged the \"Killmonger\". They infiltrated the \"Sea King\", resulting in Bloodsail defeat, and Ironpatch's death by &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, avenging the deaths of her brothers.\nAround the time of the Cataclysm, three Bloodsail ships were headed to the southern part of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Deep\"&gt;Shimmering Deep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. They were spotted by Makasa, &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, and their friends who were sailing on a boat. In order to get away from them, the travelers decided to land on the western part of the Deep and continue to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; by foot through the mountains on the border. Makasa wished to sneak on the ships, but her responsibility towards Aram convinced her otherwise.\nA &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; member of the Bloodsail Buccaneers, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Koslov\"&gt;Captain Koslov&lt;/a&gt;, led an ambush to &lt;a href=\"Catelyn\"&gt;Catelyn&lt;/a&gt;'s ship in Booty Bay shortly before the Invasion of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodsail based around &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; are under the command of &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; and are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;. They were able to dock \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Veil\"&gt;The Crimson Veil&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, but it was not a cheap arrangement.\nDragonflight.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, on a &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; ship in the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Coast\"&gt;Shrouded Coast&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Return%20of%20the%20Nightsquall\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the Bloodsail Buccaneers were welcomed to sail under the flag of Nightsquall's crew, who aimed to build the biggest pirate fleet Azeroth has ever known. The volunteers were invited to travel to the Dragon Isles and plunder its secrets in the name of &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Admiral%20Nightsquall\"&gt;Dread Admiral Nightsquall&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nThere is only one way to increase your &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the Bloodsail Buccaneers and that\u2019s to unleash your wrath on any citizen of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; who can be found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Be warned that doing so will also cost you reputation with Booty Bay. In addition to this whatever you lose with Booty Bay you will also lose half of that in the other three goblin towns. For instance, if you lose 25 points in Booty Bay, you will also lose 12.5 points in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso, a few people from Booty Bay will cause you to lose Steamwheedle Cartel reputation instead of Booty Bay reputation. This is a hidden reputation meter in the game, which cannot be seen with your four &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; Steamwheedle Cartel factions and goes up and down independently of them. The only possible way to see this meter is when you reach a lower or higher level of faction status such as friendly or honored, as with any faction in the game. If you gain or lose Steamwheedle Cartel faction points, you lose that same amount with all four goblin towns. Losing Steamwheedle Cartel reputation does not necessarily increase your Bloodsail Buccaneer reputation.\nKnown faction-related bonuses.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, all you could get was the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Admiral%27s%20Hat\"&gt;Bloodsail Admiral's Hat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%27s%20Uniform\"&gt;Buccaneer's Uniform&lt;/a&gt;, which you couldn't wear all the time. But thanks to the people on the official World of Warcraft forums, first started by Bloodysaber &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D44797551%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and continued by Rhamidarigaz &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D86010263%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;in this follow-up thread&lt;/a&gt; with a second follow-up &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D1230413267%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a third one &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D4913971912%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard has heard the voice of the people, and added a title for &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Admiral\"&gt;Bloodsail Admiral&lt;/a&gt;s. Other requests, such as a &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; and more pirate-related clothing, are still desired, but it is not yet known if these will appear in the game anytime soon.\nAs of , several additions were made to the holiday &lt;a href=\"Pirate%27s%20Day\"&gt;Pirate's Day&lt;/a&gt;, including a special vendor named &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Techt\"&gt;Edward Techt&lt;/a&gt; that is only accessible to people who have the Bloodsail Admiral title. He sells only one item, the &lt;a href=\"Jolly%20Roger\"&gt;Jolly Roger&lt;/a&gt; toy.\nGetting help with \"Avast Ye, Admiral\" and other tactics.\nPreliminary test attacks show that attacking the baron spawns at least two &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay%20Bruiser\"&gt;Booty Bay Bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s in the doorway near the baron who either melee or started shooting with their knockback guns. The fleet master and baron pull separately as of &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;. This was tested with a level 60 &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; who had status with Booty Bay, so I don't know if the fleet master will &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; just because of your bad reputation with Booty Bay if you're doing this quest. Ranged attacks might get by without aggro. \nFlying into Booty Bay and dispatching the guard near the flight point should get you close enough to the baron and fleet master to start your attack. I just killed the baron and fleet master with my \"Booty Bay Friendly\" rogue to see what reputation loss there was and the &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; times of the mobs:\nIf someone buffs or heals you during the fight, chances are they're going to lose this rep as well, but if you have another player fear, kite, seduce, sheep, etc the guards or other accidental adds but not kill them, the player shouldn't lose any of their reputation with Booty Bay.\nFrom the Horde's perspective.\nAvast Ye, Admiral! is probably easier for members of the Horde, as their flight master is located right around the corner from both Baron Revilgaz and Fleet Master Seahorn. There are approximately 6-8 guards within the aggro radius of both the baron and the fleet master, including at least two on the landing platform itself. Done as a level 70 Demonology-specced orc warlock, the idea was to use Seed of Corruption for AoE damage and focus all offensive spells (including &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;) on Revilgaz and Seahorn (in either order). A good pet to use as a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; would undoubtedly be the &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 once both Revilgaz and Seahorn are dead, sacrifice it and jump down to the dock and into the water to make your escape.\nIn Cataclysm.\nSince \"\" came out, grinding to 11999/12000 Honored has become much easier. By doing a quest chain starting in Booty Bay with &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; you will eventually come to the quest &lt;a href=\"Doublerum%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Doublerum (quest)&lt;/a&gt; which will start an assault on Booty Bay by the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Once this starts all the bouncers will become level 35. You can then kill the Booty Bay residents for reputation. A good speed path will take you from Baron Revilgaz to the blacksmith where residents line up, to inside the leatherworker's building, down to the end of the dock, fly to the bankers, in through the inn/bar and back up to Baron Revilgaz.\nAt max level, the grind is trivial to complete, though it does still take time, several hours at least.\nAnd while the city is under attack by mobs of the Bloodsail Buccaneers, they are not actually affiliated with the in-game faction, meaning killing them does not decrease reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers nor increase it with Booty Bay.\nNote: doing this method results in Booty Bay being permanently under attack, unless you bring back up your Booty Bay reputation to neutral.\nAchievements.\nAvast Ye, Admiral!\nThe &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Avast%20Ye%2C%20Admiral%21\"&gt;Avast Ye, Admiral!&lt;/a&gt; can be earned through completing the quest &lt;a href=\"Avast%20Ye%2C%20Admiral%21%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Avast Ye, Admiral! (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis rewards the player with the &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; of \"Bloodsail Admiral\".\nInsane in the Membrane.\nThe &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Insane%20in%20the%20Membrane\"&gt;Insane in the Membrane&lt;/a&gt; requires earning with Bloodsail Buccaneers and with all goblin factions. It has been confirmed that you no longer have to have the reputations at the same time.\nThis achievement rewards the player with the &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; of \"\"&lt;name&gt; &lt;a href=\"the%20Insane\"&gt;the Insane&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nFannin of Crushridge US has taken the time to write an extensive guide on how to do this achievement:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//files.spectralcoding.com/files/wow/index.html\"&gt;Insane in the Membrane FoS Guide - By Fannin of Crushridge-US&lt;/a&gt;\nThere is a section dedicated to reaching Honored with the Bloodsail Buccaneers. It is recommended that you read this guide (in addition to this page) if you are serious about attempting to get \"the Insane\" title.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Bloodsail Buccaneers are one of the most notorious &lt;a href=\"buccaneer\"&gt;buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; bands in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. During the events leading up to and following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, several criminal &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt;s appeared around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. One of these were the Bloodsail who commit acts of piracy, smuggling, and revenge. They are cutthroats and ruf\ufb01ans of the worst sort. Many dress in rusty reds, browns, and blacks to show their af\ufb01liation. They are the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, and at the behest of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Falrevere\"&gt;Duke Falrevere&lt;/a&gt;, they make forays against the Raiders' ships and, occasionally, their headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Their symbol is a double-masted ship's silhouette against a bloody sun.\nThe Buccaneers' primary base is on &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt;; they control a fort called &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;Bloodsail Hold&lt;/a&gt; and it is well protected and strategically located. The &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s range throughout the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s west and south coasts; occasionally they make raids along &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s coasts as well.\nThe pirate lord &lt;a href=\"Dannol%20Scurvgrin\"&gt;Dannol Scurvgrin&lt;/a&gt; has ties to them.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nSix or seven years ago, a man named Falrevere had a &lt;a href=\"Falrevere%27s%20estate\"&gt;grand estate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest rivals on the island, and he boasted a dozen merchant ships and twice as many warships. Falrevere enjoyed sailing and was good at it; he often joined his men on the seas, patrolling for pirates and following his goods down the coast, breathing the sea air and seeing interesting sights. Falrevere was not particularly friendly or likable, but he kept his people fed and safe, and so they liked him. Falrevere was a staunch believer in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; supremacy. He advocated harsh measures against the other races, which made him unpopular but attracted people of like mindset.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began, Falrevere was at sea with one of his battleships. A &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; found him and the small \ufb02eet with which he sailed; the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; told him of the war and begged him to come to the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Drisburg\"&gt;Drisburg&lt;/a&gt;, on the northern coast of Kul Tiras. Falerevere sneered at the dwarf but agreed, and put his sail to the wind. Upon sighting Drisburg, the duke saw that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had landed a small army on the coast and laid siege to the town. The defenders \ufb01red catapults and a few cannons at their besiegers, but there was little they could do. Falrevere calculated and came to the conclusion that if he landed and fought the Scourge, Drisburg would have about a 50% chance of surviving the onslaught, but most of its people, and Falrevere's people, would die. Many of Drisburg's citizens were &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; and dwarf immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and so, Falrevere's choice was clear. He turned his ships around and bid goodbye to the doomed settlement. Many of his crewmembers railed against this action. Falrevere threw the loudest overboard.\nKnowing he could never set foot in Kul Tiras again, Falrevere sailed to the mainland for news of the war. He learned that the invasion was in full swing. &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s north had become a &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; and twisted land, overrun with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities. He thought this was due to humanity becoming friends with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and dwarves. Thus, Falrevere decided he would not be part of that land's folly anymore. He gathered his crew and announced that any &lt;a href=\"sailor\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt; who wished to do so could disembark there and \ufb01ght for Lordaeron. As for himself, he was going to reestablish his estate elsewhere; a tropical island in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps, where the Scourge could not reach them and he could choose his friends. Many of his soldiers left his ships and died on Lordaeron soil, but more joined him. A month later, Falrevere found &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; and began construction of his new fortress, &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Hold\"&gt;Bloodsail Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Once a stalwart &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; noble, Duke Falrevere became a professional pirate lord.\nThe Bloodsail Buccaneers.\nThe Bloodsail Buccaneers are a bunch of vile bastards, and everyone who knows them knows it. Others see them as ruthless and devoid of scruples, which they are. Five years on Plunder Isle has done little to improve Falrevere's disposition, and he and every pirate under his banner seem to bear a personal grudge against everyone they come across \u2014 especially non-humans. This grudge is particularly strong when it comes to the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. Falrevere despises them because the despicable &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 provide the Raiders with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, equipment and other support. Falrevere believes that humans rightfully deserve control of the seas. Tavern tales also say that the Blackwater Raiders are responsible for the death of Falrevere's son, &lt;a href=\"Magrann%20Falrevere\"&gt;Magrann&lt;/a&gt;, though the same tales mention that Falrevere was never fond of him. The Buccaneers and the Raiders have clashed numerous times over the last 5 years.\nAs for themselves, the Bloodsail Buccaneers revel in their reputation. They display their characteristic rust-red, black and brown clothing with pride, and make sure their symbol is always predominant. The Buccaneers sail the waters between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the South Seas, and occasionally travel west toward &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They frequent seedy taverns in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; (where they and the Blackwater Raiders duel in the streets and bars), &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Port\"&gt;Steamwheedle Port&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to ambushing merchant ships that cross the sea, they and the Blackwater Raiders are embroiled in a private naval war that spans the length of the South Seas.\n&lt;a href=\"Wallace%20Boltscrew\"&gt;Wallace Boltscrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Annetta%20Crank\"&gt;Annetta Crank&lt;/a&gt; have crafted several &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s that could prove extremely dangerous. Duke Falrevere is holding these vessels secretly beneath Bloodsail Hold for now, for fear of tipping his hand to the Blackwater Raiders before he is ready.\nOrganization.\nDuke Falrevere runs the Bloodsail and is usually sailing the seas on his \ufb02agship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shark\"&gt;Devil Shark&lt;/a&gt;\". Four commodores assist him \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Jessi%20Falrevere\"&gt;Jessi Falrevere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wallace%20Boltscrew\"&gt;Wallace Boltscrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Zank\"&gt;Lester Zank&lt;/a&gt;, and an unknown fourth commodore \u2014 each of whom is in charge of about a dozen pirate ships. Fleet masters command smaller groups of ships, captains command individual ships, and their \ufb01rst mates take over when they fall. Most of the Bloodsail elites are former members of Falrevere's estate \u2014 knights, reeves and the like who joined him in his exile.\nWhen a commodore falls, Falrevere personally selects a replacement. He picks those he trusts; loyalty is more valuable than skill, for Falrevere knows what an odious bunch he commands and realizes the potential for mutiny and betrayal. However, his experience as a noble proves valuable in his new role, and while he has become a thoroughly unpleasant individual he keeps his men and women well fed with food, plunder and blood, and so most are glad to have him at their head.\nFalrevere prefers to give his commodores, \ufb02eet masters, and captains free reign, but when they \"err\", he responds with veiled threats and detailed explanations of what went wrong and what could have been done to make it right. Despite his threats, he is protective of the Buccaneers and each of its members, and only rarely does he execute pirates under his command \u2014 though he has no problems with individual captains engaging in such brutal justice.\nMembers.\nImagine the most bloodthirsty and depraved person you can. This person is probably a member of the Bloodsail Buccaneers. About half the Buccaneers are remnants of Falrevere's original crew that betrayed &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; for a life of piracy; the remaining members come from waterfront saloons and docks. The Bloodsail Buccaneers are not above press-ganging people into their service.\nAs Falrevere has a reputation for treating his people reasonably well, new members are in ready supply \u2014 at least, they are enough to replace the &lt;a href=\"buccaneer\"&gt;buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;s who fall on their missions. These are people with nowhere else to go, or those who enjoy bloodshed and the seas, or those who want to vent their hatred of non-humans, or those looking for an easy gold piece. The Buccaneers do not try to train new members (though a few individual captains implement such schemes); for the most part, the life of a new Bloodsail Buccaneer is, often literally, sink or swim. Falrevere and his pirate followers blame the fall of Lordaeron and the rise of the undead on other races, like &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and elves. That is why they are so pissed at everyone and have cultivated an exclusive group.\nCommodore Wallace Boltscrew and his collection of fellow &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Wallace%27s%20Warriors\"&gt;Wallace's Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, are valuable additions to Falrevere's crew. Wallace and the other tinkers improve the Bloodsail Buccaneers by adding technology to their equipment. Armored plating and more powerful cannons were only the \ufb01rst step. Wallace has tried numerous other experiments as well, and has slain only a dozen or so sailors testing them.\nSpeculation.\nSince he mentions Firallon's beard and due to his clothes, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zvezdan\"&gt;Captain Zvezdan&lt;/a&gt; and his ship \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Barnacle\"&gt;The Barnacle&lt;/a&gt;\" were probably members of the Bloodsail Buccaneers."}

His mother died in his childbirth, and Fandral formed a very strong relationship with him. A proud and noble &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, Valstann was deeply dedicated to his father and always wanted to please him. He had a wife named &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe War of the Shifting Sands.\nAround 975 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Valstann fought alongside his father in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters. When news arrived that &lt;a href=\"Southwind%20Village\"&gt;Southwind Village&lt;/a&gt; was under attack, Valstann volunteered to lead a detachment to defend the village, and Fandral reluctantly agreed. Three days later, the qiraji &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; brought an injured Valstann to the front of the qiraji lines and held him up for all to see. Realizing that Southwind had fallen and his son's detachment wiped out, Fandral and his forces could only watch in horror as Rajaxx proceeded to rip Valstann in two with his claws. The ambush plan was devised by the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis remains were apparently retrieved, and buried in &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Grave\"&gt;a simple grave&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. After his death, his widow Leyara gave birth to their daughter &lt;a href=\"Istaria\"&gt;Istaria&lt;/a&gt;. Many centuries later, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Fandral had become a pawn of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;'s lord, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, who sent a hallucination of Valstann to lead the Archdruid astray and trick him into believing that his dead son was alive again. Malfurion destroyed the shadow masquerading as Valstann, causing Fandral to become terribly traumatized. After the Nightmare's defeat, the druids brought Staghelm to the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that he would recover, though many suspected that his mind was permanently broken from losing Valstann a second time.\nDragonflight.\nA projection of Valstann appears in &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Maxdormu\"&gt;Professor Maxdormu's&lt;/a&gt; history lesson about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the original \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Vampiric Embrace was the 21-point &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt; in the Priest's Shadow Magic &lt;a href=\"talent%20tree\"&gt;talent tree&lt;/a&gt;. The ability was an instant cast &lt;a href=\"Curse\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; effect with a 60 second duration and a 10 second cooldown, that caused 20% of all shadow damage dealt (30% with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Improved Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt;) by the casting priest to heal the priest and their &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. This healing was not split and was capable of crits, even if the ability that triggered it did not crit. Up through the majority of \"\", Vampiric Embrace received very few changes, notably being modified to a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28dispel%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect, its duration increased to 5 minutes, and having its healing nerfed several times.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; saw the first major redesign for Vampiric Embrace, changing the ability into an undispellable buff on the priest, rather than a targeted debuff that needed to be applied every time the caster changed targets. Aside from numerical changes, the ability remained constant throughout the \" expansion.\nWith the complete overhaul of the talent system in \", Vampiric Embrace became a baseline ability for the Shadow specialization and saw its second redesign, changing it to become a powerful raid &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; rather than a persistent group heal. Since then, Vampiric Embrace has received at least one major change with each expansion's arrival."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; his village was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Khariel\"&gt;Khariel&lt;/a&gt;, was torn apart by a &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;. Vandel killed the felhound with a knife, and encountered &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; when he stumbled out of his house. Believing the Betrayer to be behind the attack, Vandel attacked him, but Illidan easily fended off his attacks and asked Vandel to serve him, impressed that he had killed a demon with only a hunting knife. When Vandel refused, Illidan told him to seek him out later if he truly sought vengeance.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nEventually, Vandel did seek out Illidan, finding a way to reach &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and scaling the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan readily welcomed him into his service, and told him he would find what he sought or die trying. Vandel befriended the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Elarisiel\"&gt;Elarisiel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Needle%20%28night%20elf%29\"&gt;Needle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fellow novice &lt;a href=\"Ravael\"&gt;Ravael&lt;/a&gt;. In the process of becoming a demon hunter, Vandel devoured the heart of a felhound to bind its soul to his own and was forced to not only relive his memories of his son's death, but shown visions of the infinite, invincible might of the Burning Legion; like the others, Vandel was so traumatized by what he saw that he clawed out his own eyes. Thereafter, Vandel constantly heard the whispered thoughts of the demon whose soul had been bound to his, tempting him not only to violence but to join the Legion. When he later discovered that he was growing scaly patches of skin, he tried to carve them off, nearly bleeding to death before he was found by Illidan's &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; servants and taken to &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; for healing. During a training bout with Ravael, the latter lost control and assumed his demon form, overpowering the wards meant to blunt their weapons. When Vandel realized that no one was going to step in to save him, he gave in to the demonic whispers and killed Ravael, consuming his fallen foe's soul to heal his own wounds.\nIllidan named Vandel as one of the leaders of his demon hunters, including him in his meetings with &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Council\"&gt;Illidari Council&lt;/a&gt;. When not otherwise occupied, Vandel liked to walk the Black Temple's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, which reminded him of Ashenvale. Vandel was at Illidan's side not only during the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;, but also during a raid on a demonic caravan that first brought them into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was reopened and the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; marched through to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, Vandel saw that Kruul was poised to destroy them and convinced Illidan to intervene, even holding his own for a time against the &lt;a href=\"doomlord\"&gt;doomlord&lt;/a&gt; until Illidan struck the killing blow.\nWhen the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the Black Temple, Vandel watched their enemies throwing themselves at the wall until he felt Illidan telepathically commanding him and the other demon hunters to join their master deep within the temple. Vandel sensed both the urgency of the call and the stirring of powerful magic within, but was prevented from joining his brethren when he encountered the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; as he crossed the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Illidari Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev attacked him, and though he tried at first to convince her he was not her enemy, she did not relent and he was forced to defend himself, ultimately assuming his demon form to try and destroy her. He fell for a feint, however, and her blade cracked into his skull; Maiev left him to die as she headed into the temple in search of Illidan.\nVandel's demonically-enhanced endurance saved him, however, and he awoke some time later to find the invaders celebrating Illidan's defeat. Though he initially considered killing as many as he could before dying in battle against them, he faintly heard Illidan's voice telling him to prepare. Knowing that others must be trained in the war against the Burning Legion, Vandel slipped away into the night.\nLegion.\nYears later Vandel reunited with the Illidari during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of &lt;a href=\"Belath%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Belath Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;'s scouts. While on &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, he sends a message up to the Illidari's hijacked &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\", stating that the demon hunters down below are under attack and taking heavy losses. &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; and the Illidari's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; travel to the planet's surface as backup, where Vandel reveals that all was quiet until recently, when suddenly Legion portals opened and the scouts began to fight for their lives. Vandel saw &lt;a href=\"Lady%20S%27theno\"&gt;Lady S'theno&lt;/a&gt; run off on her own.\nQuotes.\nThank you for coming so quickly, Slayer &lt;name&gt;!"}

After the parents of the future Blood Knight Matriarch died, Vandellor adopted the girl.\nHistory.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nVandellor adopted Liadrin after the latter's parents had been slain by Amani trolls. His passion for the Light inspired the young Liadrin, who pursued a similar path in life, eventually sharing his title.\nThough elderly by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Vandellor joined Liadrin and Belo'vir in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; had been killed by the evil prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. Vandellor's great healing proved a boon to the defenders, though not enough to turn the battle around. The elves eventually evacuated the city and retreated to &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to defend the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nVandellor provided support for &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; after the king arrived to stop the Scourge invaders. During the battle, Belo'vir was mortally wounded by Arthas; Vandellor rushed to his friend's side, though was killed in the process, torn apart and slain by a rampaging &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;. Belo'vir, who had promised Vandellor he would protect Liadrin, teleported her safely away from the carnage shortly before succumbing to his own wounds.\nVandellor was raised as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; thrall sometime after the battle, and Liadrin, returning to the isle with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s raid, was forced to kill him. Vandellor's cruel fate on Quel'Danas was a huge blow to the priestess, and a large contributing factor to her denunciation of the Light. Claiming vengeance against the Scourge in Vandellor's name became one of Liadrin's primary goals. Liadrin looked back on him fondly as both a good mentor and father.\nHeritage of the blood elves.\nA vision of High Priest Vandellor can now be seen alongside &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Liadrin\"&gt;High Priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, in visions from the past during the Heritage of the Sin'dorei questline.\nShadowlands.\nUpon his death, Vandellor's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;. He was sought out by &lt;a href=\"Salandria\"&gt;Salandria&lt;/a&gt;, ward of his own adopted daughter Liadrin, but Vandellor had given up his mortal memories and could only ponder at the nostalgia the young elf's presence stirred within him. Vandellor assisted Salandria in empowering a ranseur that might be used to slay a &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;sinister immortal&lt;/a&gt; tormenting his forgotten homeland of Quel'Thalas.\nQuotes.\nThere is a time and place for everything."}

It was a large settlement, with its own &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; and military garrison.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; lived in hiding in Vandermar Village. The village was safe from aggressors (save for a handful of &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s) and for a long period of time, Vandermar Village remained unscathed while the Scourge rampaged through Lordaeron.\nAfter returning from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and succeeding his father through regicide, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; to the outskirts of Vandermar Village.

The local town guard had begin suspecting the acolytes and chasing them, but Arthas gathered the cultists and saved those in danger, destroying the village in the process. During his battles with Vandermar's garrison of soldiers, Arthas bolstered his forces by reanimating the dead bodies recently laid to rest in the local cemetery.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nVandermar village is not present in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" in any identifiable form.

She was present when Edwin was killed and decapitated by the Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s onboard his &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;. After her father's death, Vanessa was adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldeans&lt;/a&gt;. They named her &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Saldean\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and raised her as their own daughter, unaware of her true identity. Her identity as Hope Saldean worked to her advantage as she secretly reformed the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the shadows for years.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, she took advantage of the economic crisis that affected the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and began to rally the population of Westfall to her cause. As the new Kingpin of the Defias, she took over her father's plans to complete the juggernaught in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. However, she was confronted by the adventurers and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;, and \"died\" by committing suicide with explosives at the end of the battle.\nIt was later revealed that she had faked her death by using hallucinogenic drugs against the adventurers. Under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; who took her under his wing, she became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; and provided assistance to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadowblade&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, Vanessa was betrayed by the remaining Defias who followed &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt;. After she helped &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and a champion of Stormwind to defeat her former followers, she decided to seek a new and less violent path to help the people of Westfall. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt;, she helped in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of farmers and ex-Defias who sought to revitalize Westfall.\nUnlike her father, she is not especially skilled in close combat. However, she has very impressive skills in making poisons, especially ones that cause hallucinations or insanity.\nBiography.\nLittle is known about Vanessa VanCleef's early childhood except that she was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, the only people who knew about her birth were &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Furlbrow\"&gt;Theodore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Verna%20Furlbrow\"&gt;Verna Furlbrow&lt;/a&gt;, having seen her as an infant. Vanessa considers &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; to be her home. Approximately five years prior to &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return, she watched from the shadows as her father was defeated by a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Salma%20Saldean\"&gt;Salma Saldean&lt;/a&gt;, \"in the dead of night, a little girl walked right into our farmhouse and collapsed on the floor. Nobody had a clue as to her identity. The poor thing had no recollection of who she was or where she came from - truly a lost soul.\" The Saldeans adopted her and named her &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Saldean\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; due to the hard times that had fallen on them. At some point, Hope started caring for the poor and destitute and ended up at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nHowever, she secretly began plotting the resurrection of the Brotherhood. Having learned or known that the Furlbrows recognized her face from when she was a baby, Vanessa arranged their deaths to prevent any possibility of the couple prematurely identifying her, something she considered regrettable but necessary for her plans. Soliciting the help of such unsavory characters as the ogre &lt;a href=\"Glubtok\"&gt;Glubtok&lt;/a&gt; and the goblin &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Gearbreaker\"&gt;Helix Gearbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, she used &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw\"&gt;Riverpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; attacks to distract the forces of Sentinel Hill so the Defias could rescue the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; Admiral &lt;a href=\"Ripsnarl\"&gt;Ripsnarl&lt;/a&gt; from his imprisonment there. When the gnolls proved ineffective, she resorted to anti-Stormwind propaganda, targeting the homeless masses in Westfall. Vanessa personally delivered a rousing speech to the masses in &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, denouncing King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; among others and the toll the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; had taken on the people of Westfall.\nThe investigations of Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Laine\"&gt;Horatio Laine&lt;/a&gt; into a murder at &lt;a href=\"Furlbrow%27s%20Pumpkin%20Farm\"&gt;Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm&lt;/a&gt; led to incremental revelations about Vanessa VanCleef's dealings, disguised as a \"Shadowy Figure\". Once her forces were sufficiently bolstered, she revealed herself to Marshal &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; as the newly reconstituted Defias Brotherhood mounted a surprise attack on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Stoutmantle, Laine, and the other leaders were tied up and forced to watch as the Defias burned Sentinel Hill virtually to the ground.\nThe forces of Stormwind then attacked the Deadmines and &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;defeated Vanessa&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nVanessa had easily faked her death in the Deadmines because her opponents' minds had been affected by her neurotoxin. After an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is made one of the leaders of &lt;a href=\"The%20Uncrowned\"&gt;The Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; proposes a toast, Vanessa attacks with a poisoned brew that incapacitates the rogues. Vanessa had planned on taking that final spot on the Uncrowned's council and challenged the adventurer to a battle to claim it. After losing, Vanessa is told she can become the adventurer's agent or be executed, and Vanessa chooses to stay alive. Afterwards, Lord Ravenholdt tells Vanessa that her father would have been disappointed in her for her actions.\nVanessa participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the invasion.\nFollowing the Legion's defeat, Vanessa remained an occasional informant for &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; under the agreement that so long as she kept the Defias on a short leash, he and the wouldn't come after her for their crimes. Though she tried to reign in their banditry to focus on aiding the people of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;l, she began to realize that between &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms and Stormwind's earlier offer of pardons, nearly all of the principled Defias that were still alive had departed the organization, leaving only the thieves and bullies with no qualms about targeting innocents.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his report that the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; were still active, and that Vanessa was still an active and recognized member of the organization.\nDragonflight.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the Defias to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Using its powers of manipulation, he convinced the Defias to turn against Vanessa VanCleef and march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of using it as a staging ground to pillage the city of Stormwind itself. Seeing how easily a noble turned the Brotherhood against her made Vanessa realize that she was no longer one of them, and she told those Defias who stayed behind to return home and help the people of Westfall in other ways. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Defias were defeated, Count Clessington was slain, and the Drakefire Amulet was destroyed. In the wake of their victory, Vanessa determined that she would find her own legacy, rather than continuing her father's.\nLater, she returned to the &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt;. After so many years, the Saldean couple was happy to see their adopted daughter again at home, regretting the actions she committed as Vanessa VanCleef, but that she would forever remain Hope for them.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nVanessa VanCleef is an Outlaw Rogue &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt; obtained during &lt;a href=\"Rise%2C%20Champions%20%28rogue%29\"&gt;Rise, Champions (rogue)&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nVanessa can also be assigned as a &lt;a href=\"bodyguard\"&gt;bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;:\nAs a combat ally, she has the following abilities:\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\n\"Vanessa appears in disguise as a Shadowy Figure during some of these quests.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nReady for a rematch, &lt;name&gt;?

In their battles against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the enormous servants were accompanied by their sister-race - the &lt;a href=\"aesir\"&gt;aesir&lt;/a&gt;.\nTribunal of Ages.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, an archive created by keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and filled with adjusted and warped historical events, says that following the imprisonment of the Old Gods, the vanir were appointed as protectors of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Their children are the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and cursed &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s who helped them carve out the earth. Like the Aesir, they tend to stay away from mortal creatures. Vanir titans know the location of all stonework (such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction, unsafe stone surfaces, shaky ceilings, natural and artificial tunnels and caves, and the like) within 1 mile. Something that is not stone but is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A Vanir titan always knows his depth underground. They have a connection to the element of Earth."}

A character wearing the set or a &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; of the set will tend to have a consistent appearance, so they are often collected purely for this purpose. They should not be confused with gameplay-affecting \"formal\" &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;s, which are named and defined in-game and grant &lt;a href=\"set%20bonus\"&gt;set bonus&lt;/a&gt;es when worn together. Most armor sets do form vanity sets due to their matched art design, but there are many vanity sets that are simply collections of regular items that do not depend on or enhance each other in gameplay.\nThese terms are also used in the community to describe any player-created group of items used for transmog or vanity wear, even if it is not a \"proper\" matching set intentionally created by game artists. On some reference sites, a distinction is made between player-made and \"natural\" vanity sets. On others such as that are not designed to feature player content, \"vanity sets designed by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;\" is usually what is meant.\nHistory and terminology.\nVanity sets were originally collected and worn by high level characters for appearance's sake when in social or other non-combat situations, such as in &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;. Such a set (or part of one) might also be worn on an ongoing basis by a character at the level intended for its items, either consciously or simply because those were the best items available through the course of typical leveling gameplay. The phrase comes from the &lt;a href=\"vanity\"&gt;vanity&lt;/a&gt; label meaning that the gameplay value of an item is subservient to or nonexistent next to its \"fun\" use, and so \"vanity set\" implies that the set is not useful to a maximum-&lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; player in combat - but it is also used as a blanket term when cataloging item designs so that high- and low-level item art can be discussed in the same way.\nThe addition of &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; removed the need for high level characters to swap between combat and vanity sets before and after entering battle, by allowing combat gear to take on the appearance of a desired set of items. The term \"transmog set\" (short for \"transmogrification set\") quickly became popular to describe sets used for this purpose, although the term is slightly misleading since all transmog sets can still be worn without using transmogrification, as was done in the past. The term is also slightly narrower than \"vanity set\" since not all wearable items can be transmogrified, like &lt;a href=\"common%20%28quality%29\"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; quality items.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"cosmetic\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; set\", describing vanity sets with no significant combat &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;s, also became more prominent with the new feature. Cosmetic sets did exist beforehand, such as the &lt;a href=\"Haliscan%20Brimmed%20Hat\"&gt;Haliscan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuxedo%20collection\"&gt;tuxedo collection&lt;/a&gt;s, although it is notable that those cosmetic sets are not valid transmog sets due to their &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;. Transmogrification made cosmetic sets attractive for many more players, and consequently they became prominent additions in areas like the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe increase in popularity of transmog sets also led several WoW web sites to begin cataloging them, and to the creation of new websites dedicated for that purpose.\nArt design.\nThe primary characteristic of a vanity set is a very specific visual style or concept. There are many dark colored, tough looking plate armor pieces, but a given vanity plate set might employ specific shades, geometric elements of a certain shape and size, adornments that curve in a given fashion, AND a distinctive overall style evocative of a certain period of real-life history. At least one of these properties is likely to be lacking in any item outside the set. Thus it's usually possible to distinguish between the items that were actually designed to be worn together, and other items that are only \"close enough\".\nIn some cases the connection between pieces of a set may not be apparent if the set is missing key items. For instance the &lt;a href=\"Contender%27s%20Dragonscale\"&gt;Contender's Dragonscale&lt;/a&gt; employs different designs on the lower leggings and boots than it does on the upper pieces, so without the &lt;a href=\"Contender%27s%20Dragonscale%20Leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt; (which contain elements from both sub-styles) it would be difficult to tell that the &lt;a href=\"Contender%27s%20Dragonscale%20Boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; belonged in the same set as the &lt;a href=\"Contender%27s%20Dragonscale%20Shoulders\"&gt;shoulders&lt;/a&gt;. Despite artistic quirks of that nature and the inherent subjectivity of design, the community has largely been able to agree upon which items were designed together. Between the number of sets identified by the community, and Blizzard employees' statements about the item graphic design process, it is clear that most items were indeed designed in concert with others to achieve a cohesive look when worn together, especially in modern &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIdentical, lookalike, and recolored models.\nMany items have the same art as another. In other words, these items may replace each other with no change to a character's appearance. In most cases they are therefore considered to be alternates within the same vanity set, since both are equally effective in complementing the other pieces in the set. In some sets there may be quite a few choices for each item slot. With certain sets where one specific selection of items is considered to be more definitive, such as named raid \"tier\" &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;s, items that have the same model as the definitive version may instead be grouped and labeled as a separate \"lookalike\" set. This distinction is meaningless from a purely visual standpoint. \"Lookalikes\" may also refer to pieces that are \"not\" identical but very similar, especially when the true set pieces are difficult or impossible to obtain.\nSome items with visual differences may be considered alternates within the same vanity set as long as the majority of the item is the same. A common example is a sleeveless version of a chest item when the torsos are identical. For example, the sleeveless &lt;a href=\"Mooncloth%20Vest\"&gt;Mooncloth Vest&lt;/a&gt; is an alternate to the sleeved &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Armor\"&gt;Arcane Armor&lt;/a&gt;, since both match the color and style of the other two pieces in the set.\nSome items are palette swaps or \"recolors\" of another, meaning they have the same geometry and outlines but different colors. Different &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20difficulty\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raid%20difficulty\"&gt;raid difficulty&lt;/a&gt; versions of an item are often recolors. When the items in a set are recolored versions of those in another set, the two sets are said to be recolors as well. There may be multiple recolor versions, each corresponding to a different color palette. Recolor sets may be different sizes from one another as long as the &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt;s that they do have in common are recolors.\nIdentification and categorization.\nThe ways in which vanity sets are made available to players makes it easier to identify and corroborate set membership than by visual inspection alone. Items in a given set tend to appear at about the same point in the progress of a character through an &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;, so it is often possible to narrow down pieces of a set by looking at items of a given &lt;a href=\"armor%20type\"&gt;armor type&lt;/a&gt; within a certain item level range or &lt;a href=\"content%20patch\"&gt;content patch&lt;/a&gt;. This also makes it possible to categorize sets as being obtained while &lt;a href=\"leveling\"&gt;leveling&lt;/a&gt;, in early &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt; content, or in late end-game content; even finer divisions may be made depending on the set and content type.\nThe following patterns can be useful for identifying item sets:\nBecause many items may use the same models and are therefore usable in the same vanity set, some sets may contain pieces that fit more than one of these patterns. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Contender%27s%20Dragonscale\"&gt;Contender's Dragonscale&lt;/a&gt; is a formal set associated with a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20season\"&gt;PvP season&lt;/a&gt;, but its pieces also match a number of items from heroic dungeons; PvP gear sometimes matches PvE content of an equivalent patch or level; and world drops may match rewards from quests of similar levels.\nIn general, the game has become more focused and consistent in the way it presents sets of items. A number of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" items reused models from &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt;, but modern expansions are more likely to have their own styles with fresh artwork. &lt;a href=\"Item%20collections\"&gt;Collections&lt;/a&gt; in the past, such as the Abjurer's series, often had splits where some did not match the others, but now are very likely to be consistent throughout.\nThere are a couple logical arguments that may also aid in identifying sets:\nNaming.\nDetermining a name for a set can be quite arbitrary, and depends on the will of the community. When sets are recolors or lookalikes of another, they will often use the name of the other set appended with \"(recolor)\" or \"(lookalike)\", either to respect the notability of the referenced set or simply to avoid having to make up a new name. When numerous pieces inside a vanity set share a formal &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;, name, or other key word, it is common but not universal to refer to the set by that term. Names of items that were released in the game first may receive precedence. Other criteria may be used, but in many cases it simply varies from case to case."}
