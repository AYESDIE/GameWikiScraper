He is \"evil of the purest form\", the biggest and strongest fire elemental in Un'Goro.\nBiography.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Blazerunner guarded an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"%3AGolden%20Flame\"&gt;:Golden Flame&lt;/a&gt; and used its power to give himself an aura that made him almost invincible. None were able to penetrate the aura, and many who tried to face him found themselves knocked off of the volcano. &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Expeditions\"&gt;Marshal Expeditions&lt;/a&gt; consequently kept their distance from him. The warrior &lt;a href=\"Linken\"&gt;Linken&lt;/a&gt; came to Un'Goro to fight Blazerunner and retrieve the Golden Flame, but after he lost his memories, it was &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who ended up facing Blazerunner\u2014using the &lt;a href=\"%3ASilver%20Totem%20of%20Aquementas\"&gt;:Silver Totem of Aquementas&lt;/a&gt; to dispel his aura\u2014and obtained the Golden Flame.\nAfter the Cataclysm, Blazerunner still lives at the top of Fire Plume Ridge. &lt;a href=\"Williden%20Marshal\"&gt;Williden Marshal&lt;/a&gt; asks adventurers to kill him out of worry that he and the other fire elementals might wreak havoc on &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Marshal's Stand&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was previously a world boss in the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;original Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; event.\nBackground.\nDragons of Nightmare.\nIn recent times, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted lieutenants have been warped by a dark new power within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. These wayward sentinels passed through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, intending to spread madness and terror throughout the mortal kingdoms.\nLethon's exposure to the Nightmare not only darkened the hue of the mighty &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s scales but also empowered him with the ability to extract malevolent shades from his enemies. Once joined with their master, the shades imbued the dragon with healing energies. It came as no surprise, then, that Lethon was considered to be among the most formidable of Ysera's wayward lieutenants. Lethon was in the end slain, however, this was not the last seen of him: Lethon's dreamform survived the defeat and thrived in the Emerald Dream.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Lethon attacked &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; but she was able to defend herself. He was among the strongest of the Nightmare's servants and repeatedly helped to thwart the efforts of those fighting against it. Lethon attacked &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt;, When they were to enter into Emerald Nightmare. Gnarl tried to protect the night elves, only to be sucked into the Emerald Dream. Lethon then attacked Eranikus in order to corrupt him, but then &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; came and Lethon alongside &lt;a href=\"Emeriss\"&gt;Emeriss&lt;/a&gt; were forced to retreat.\nAfter Ysera was captured and imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ysera\"&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and Ysera's consort Eranikus attempted to free her, but Lethon ambushed them and attempted to corrupt Eranikus. As Lethon preached about a future where the walls of the Nightmare would break down, and they would fly Azeroth's skies unimpeded, Eranikus shifted them both into the unstable boundary between the Emerald Dream and Azeroth. Though Lethon desperately tried to draw upon the Nightmare's power, the chaotic energies between the two worlds tore him apart.\nLegion.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; is taken by the Emerald Nightmare once again, the corrupted spirits of her deceased comrades join her in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, including Lethon. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, Lethon's spirit along with the spirits of the other three former Dragons of Nightmare are seen in the restored Emerald Dream."}

However, some dragons were more challenging than others. Lethon was considered to be the hardest, although this was largely a popular myth. The Shadow Bolt Twirl was deadly if not handled well but if the raid had a capable Main Tank who knows what to do, Lethon became one of the easier outdoor bosses.\nAll four dragons shared the Sleep (summoning \"Dream Fog\"), Noxious Breath, Tail Sweep, Mark of Nature and Aura of Nature abilities. Each dragon also had a few unique abilities. One of these were considered the dragon's ace move, and were performed when the dragon lost 25 \u00b1 5% of its max life. In other words, the ace move was only performed three times; when the dragon was at 25%, 50%, and 75% life. When it is performed, the dragon also yelled something.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Khadgar described them as;\nAzeroth lay on one part of the \"table,\" Draenor a distance away. \nWith his extensive studies of the planes and planar travel, Khadgar well understood that the various planes were surrounded by another interstitial plane, the Twisting Nether. \nAs the guardian of Nethergarde he was particularly attuned to the idea of invasions from the other planes."}

They are not particularly good at finding secret doors, opening locks, or disarming traps. Instead, a contender's preferred tactic is to confront an opponent and relieve him of his weapon. A contender is supremely confident in his fighting abilities; sneaking around is beneath him. After surprising his mark, the contender hands him a blade and challenges him to a &lt;a href=\"duel\"&gt;duel&lt;/a&gt; to the death. This duel is the height of adrenaline for a contender. The challenge gives the contender the opportunity to test his abilities against a worthy opponent. Since losing means death, the contender knows he will not hold anything back; he can see his true mettle. Simply knifing someone in the back is beneath this supremely confident, professional killer. The contender's focus is competition. The possibility of failure drives him. By facing an opponent who might best him, he faces the fears within himself \u2014 and overcomes them. Contenders target anyone they consider worthy opponents, especially individuals from opposing factions."}

It is said to be some sort of piece of an &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; and bears close resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Saronite\"&gt;Saronite&lt;/a&gt;, but lacks several key characteristics. Due to the geography it may indicate the presence of an &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; though previous expeditions have never indicated as such. However the cataclysmic events of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return have revealed several hidden relics.\nThe Artifact appears to be directly related to the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Blue%20Stone\"&gt;Whispering Blue Stone&lt;/a&gt; found in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Kurzen's Expedition&lt;/a&gt; that looks just like certain rocks seen near the &lt;a href=\"Mosh%27Ogg%20Ogre%20Mound\"&gt;Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Mosh%27Ogg%20Bounty\"&gt;Mosh'Ogg Bounty&lt;/a&gt; containing the Artifact was found. While it is a Blue Crystalline substance native to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; it is neither a &lt;a href=\"Singing%20Blue%20Crystal\"&gt;Singing Blue Crystal&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Pulsing%20Blue%20Shard\"&gt;Pulsing Blue Shard&lt;/a&gt;, nor is it a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Mind%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Mind's Eye&lt;/a&gt;.\nSamples may have been sent to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; for further analysis in better facilities that can protect the analysts from the Artifact's effects.\nProperties.\nThe Artifact reacts explosively to the application of &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%27s%20Mixture\"&gt;Zanzil's Mixture&lt;/a&gt; in contrast to what would be expected of &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts which are largely inert.\nRelics of this type tend to emit harmful effects and any contact with this artifact could pose a great risk to one's well-being, those who have been affected by it have described themselves as feeling woozy.\nIt also appears to be responsible for the faint purple glowing scars that mark the &lt;a href=\"Disfigured%20Mosh%27Ogg%20Hand%20%28starter%29\"&gt;Disfigured Mosh'Ogg Hand (starter)&lt;/a&gt; that are highly unusual in that their glow persists even after death.\nThe related &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Blue%20Stone\"&gt;Whispering Blue Stone&lt;/a&gt; appears to be the source of the madness that afflicts &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Kurzen's Expedition&lt;/a&gt; where it was used as part of a &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20Remedy\"&gt;Jungle Remedy&lt;/a&gt; composed primarily of &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Spine%20Basilisk%20Blood\"&gt;Crystal Spine Basilisk Blood&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%20Medicine%20Man\"&gt;Kurzen Medicine Men&lt;/a&gt; to quelch insubordination under the guise of \"medicine\".\nSpeculation.\nThe region now called Stranglethorn appears to have once partially been located within the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.

Any &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can be attacked by a player of an opposing faction while in these zones. Some contested territories are &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated (for example, some will only feature &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; cities and NPC, while other will do same for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;), though a big number of contested zone either favor both or none of them.\nAbout two thirds of all zones accessible by all players are considered contested. From that, about half the zones are faction-affiliated. Most notably contested zones include &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, once a player on a PvP server reaches level 20, they will be prone to start &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;ing in contested territories. Above level 30, all worthy quests will only lead there.\n&lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt; cities may be located within these zones where Alliance and Horde coexist, such as &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to do &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; while near a guard in a neutral city will result in the guard becoming hostile to whoever started the fight. Both Alliance and Horde must behave while within earshot of a guard, as they'll do a little more than ask you to take it outside. Even indirect participation in a fight (i.e. healing one of the combatants) will flag the healer for PvP and bring the guards down on the player.\n&lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; are also contested territories, regardless of the realm type you are playing on."}

A huge war between the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s occurred on the main landmass, followed by a great ordering of the planet.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, 10,000 years ago, Azeroth had one singular continent called &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; broke apart this landmass into various continents and islands. Currently, the ancient landmass known as Kalimdor would be called a supercontinent since all the land of the planet was once a part of it.\nThe number of continents has grown and shrunk as time has gone by. This is due to the discovery of new lands, the importance of those lands, and maybe politics. Currently on Azeroth, there are four continents: the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; (formed of three subcontinents) in the east, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; (formed of three subcontinents) in the west, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in the north, and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; in the south. These continents are bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, which occupies all the water expanse between them, and some other &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAzeroth's continents.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; Azeroth had &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; as a single landmass.\nConcepted during development.\n&lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;The Undermine&lt;/a&gt; in the early \"World of Warcraft\" Betas, not as a city on an island, but instead as a continent southeast of Kalimdor (where Pandaria is located now).

For example, while the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; is labeled as an in-game continent, lore-wise it is just a big chain of &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nThe continents were changed by the war between the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, which \"ripped Azeroth into new shapes\".

It is strongest to a Shaman investing further in the Elemental tree, and Shamans who are devoted to destruction might consider getting both Convection and &lt;a href=\"Concussion\"&gt;Concussion&lt;/a&gt;.\nPvP Shaman would probably be better off saving the 5 points for something else. Most PvP fights don't last long enough for the reduced mana costs to have any real affect. PvE Shaman however should consider taking both Convection AND Concussion as there can be some hard burns which can deplete your mana quickly."}

Speak with &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; to begin the mission.\nDescription.\nZandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to bolster Lei Shen's army.\nIf we can capture the palace &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure.\nI have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nCompletion.\nExcellent work! With that blasted warship out of commission, the bombardments on our forces along the coast will cease.\n&lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; has informed me that the Shado-Pan will keep vigil over Stormsea Landing, freeing up Sunreaver resources to press the siege elsewhere. Taoshi will be there. I am sure she will be glad to work with you again.\nWe are all grateful for your contributions, &lt;name&gt;. Thank you.\nNotes.\nOn accept:\nSpeak with her again:\nStage 1: Blending In.\nStep a few yards closer to Taoshi and Thunderwing:\nHop on. Taoshi will take the skyscreamer northward and attack the over-reaching guard:\nStage 2: Path of Smoke.\nWhile on Thunderwing, the champion has access to one ability:\nUse the smoke bomb to take out 10 totems. Taoshi will only allow ten to be taken out, so choose targets wisely!\nStage 3: Shadows in the Storm.\nOn foot, Taoshi buffs the champion with Infiltrating Stormsea Landing: \"Taoshi uses Wu Kao shadow arts to stealth herself and her ally, enabling the use of Knock Out on targets afflicted by Mark of Taoshi. May be detected by enemies within 5 yards or revealed by sentry totems.\" The champion will have a 5-yard-radius circle extending from it's position. So long as no zandalari get within that circle, the champion will stay stealthed. However, to use Knock Out, which is provided via the bonus action button, get behind the marked &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Wingrider\"&gt;Veteran Wingrider&lt;/a&gt; and inch forward until the red circle includes the NPC. This will bring up the bonus action button, so use it.\nIf the champion's cover is blown, Taoshi will drop a purple smoke flare on the ground that functions like a &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;:\nStep into it to regain stealth.\nAfter knocking out the wingrider on the right, Taoshi will inch foward and indicate two wingriders standing to the starboard side of deck. Another is patrolling behind them, so make sure to take the two standing guards out when the patrolling one isn't looking. Once those two are down, Taoshi will sneak foward and casually knock out the patrolling wingrider. Take out the next to marked wingriders to continue. Taoshi will neutralize another, then trap the two starboard siege weapons:\nTaoshi will mark one of two wingriders near the skyscreamers. Tap it and Taoshi will do her thing, then trap the two port-side siege weapons. Incapacitate the last wingrider to finish this stage.\nStage 4: Wetwork.\nFollow Taoshi forward, then get within range of Halu'kal and attempt to kill him:\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Halu%27kal\"&gt;Captain Halu'kal&lt;/a&gt; is a level-90 elite Zandalar troll with 2 million health. See his article for abilities and a full strategy.\nGet out of the Wallop area of effect and try to run away from the Keg Toss. Halu'kal will gain Well Fed on occasion, which will heal him and increase his damage output for ~12 seconds.\nOccasionally, a &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Wingrider\"&gt;Drunken Wingrider&lt;/a&gt; will awaken with a terrible Hangover. Take it out or not (it only has 788K health), but keep focusing on the captain.\nFinish him off:\nStage 5: Keep Quiet.\nTaoshi will tag along beside the adventurer. Assuming a decent path was made, move along it to get up the hill toward the gate. &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Spirit-Twister\"&gt;Zandalari Spirit-Twister&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Handler\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Handler&lt;/a&gt;s lead &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Conscript\"&gt;Zandalari Conscript&lt;/a&gt;s in patrols of the grounds. Steer clear of the patrols and also of the blue circles denoting the range of the sentry totems.\nShould the champion enter the detection radius of a sentry totem, the totem will move a beam of light in the direction of whomever it detected. If the beam reaches the intruder, it will break the champion's and Taoshi's stealth for 10 seconds.\nAlong the way, the trolls find out about the trapped siege weapons the hard way:\nKeep moving up the hill and get close to Hu'seng:\nStage 6: Light Up the Night.\n&lt;a href=\"Hu%27seng%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Hu'seng the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; is a level-92 elite &lt;a href=\"terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;terracotta warrior&lt;/a&gt; with almost 4 million health. See his article for abilities and a full strategy. \nHu'seng will likely start off with an Empower Axe cast. Start running away from him with help via the Fixate speed increase, but don't get too far that he starts casting Hook.\nAt 50% of total health remaining, Hu'seng will cast Cease, summoning chains that will root the champion in place. The chains only have ~100K health, so quickly destroy them before he gets his Desist cast off, which will hit all units in the marked area of effect for ~150K Physical damage.\nAt 20% total health remaining, Lei Shen will get upset and unleash a Lightning Storm upon the area. Standing in the pools will inflict 15K Nature damage a second, so move quickly.\nFinish Hu'seng off:\nLoot the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%27s%20Orb\"&gt;Gatekeeper's Orb&lt;/a&gt; from Hu'seng's corpse.\nFinal Stage: Breaking Out.\nTollow Taoshi up the steps to the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Crossing\"&gt;Bloodied Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and use the orb on the Deactivated Access Generator.\nThis completes the \"Assault the Shipyard\" portion of &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Isle of Thunder (achievement)&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollow Taoshi and interact with the portal to end the scenario and return to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with Lor'themar to turn in."}

He can very nearly be killed without having to kill any other naga in the area if the ruins are approached from the north. Lord Xiz is a level 13 warrior. You must use the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Banner\"&gt;Draenei Banner&lt;/a&gt; on his corpse, to gain credit for the quest."}

Dedicated raiding guilds have set weekly raiding schedules, but usually don't make raiding mandatory, and are fairly lenient on people who don't show up to raid if they signed up, although repeated absences can lead to harsher penalties.\nDedicated guilds make progress at their own curious rates: weeks of simply \"treading water\", and bringing down the same bosses over and over again without bringing down new ones, often precedes short but brilliant bursts of rapid progress bringing down a string of new bosses in a short period of time only to again, tread water for a few weeks.\nIn raids, dedicated guilds will not hesitate to spend an hour or two bashing their heads on a new encounter, trying to gauge where the weaknesses with the guild lie, such as a general lack of understanding of the fight's intricacies or gear. However, prolonged exposure to the futile head bashing tends to cause decrease morale and overall raid performance, sometimes extending the water treading periods unnecessarily.\nThis burst-drought cycle tends to spawn from having two sets of players in the guild, \"more hardcore\" and \"less hardcore\" as well as a solid and well established loot system such as &lt;a href=\"EPGP\"&gt;EPGP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt;, but no strict rolling rules like, tanks first, healers second, top DPS third, bottom DPS 4th; if you have the highest score, roll, and can use the item, you get the item. The \"more hardcore\" players tend to have higher scores, allowing them to get the gear earlier on, and allowing them to sit on large stockpiles of points while the \"less hardcore\" players, with smaller scores, get the gear later on. Usually, the bursts occur when both the more and less hardcore players have finally all caught up to each other in gear and knowledge, allowing for a burst into new territory where the cycle repeats itself: the more hardcore players quickly accumulate better gear, and the less hardcore players slowly reach that level.\nDedicated guilds tend to be lax on specifying what classes and roles they are accepting, often stating that \"We could use a few more healers, but we'll look at your application regardless of your class or spec\", however, since there are usually a small handful of more hardcore players in the upper echelons of the guild, raid makeup tends to be a little stricter and ordered. As a side effect of this, gear requirements for admission and raids tend to lean more stricter hardcore side.\nSee Also.\n&lt;a href=\"Hardcore%20Raiding\"&gt;Hardcore Raiding&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Casual%20Raiding\"&gt;Casual Raiding&lt;/a&gt;"}

However, in interviews with Alamo's player as shown below, it was meant to be a parody due to the fact that he does grasp the English language. His topic has given way to an interesting catchphrase, while not of the magnitude of &lt;a href=\"Leeroy%20Jenkins\"&gt;Leeroy Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, \"Cat Durid is 4 fite!\"\nSimilar posts include &lt;a href=\"Kralnor\"&gt;Kralnor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, for &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D2366701801%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;Vllaana&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, for &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, and for &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;ers.\nBlizzard has made tributes to Alamo. On the TBC Druid spells page, the last three screenshots depict a Tauren male druid in full Dreamwalker, whose name is Alamo. Moreover, Alamo was featured in the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt; set &lt;a href=\"Drums%20of%20War%20%28TCG%29\"&gt;Drums of War&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ally.

As their name suggests, they serve mostly as walking alarms, and many shout and/or upon detecting enemies.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of alarm-o-bot can be seen.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s live underground, and the natural darkness and rugged terrain of their surroundings provide ideal conditions for enemies to hide. In an effort to catch prowling and skulking creatures of all types, gnomes developed the alarm-o-bot. The small &lt;a href=\"robot\"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; looks like a child's toy with various wires and sensor arrays jutting out in all directions, enabling it to \u201csee\u201d in the dark. When it detects a living creature or any sort of movement, it emits a high-pitched warning. The &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; make heavy use of this device.\nThe alarm-o-bot's operator can program the device to either stand in place or walk a predetermined, simple path involving no more than four turns. The alarm-o-bot cannot maneuver around obstacles; if it encounters terrain more than a few inches higher or lower, it stops moving but remains vigilant. Setting up the bot, or changing its movement pattern, requires 5 minutes of programming and testing. The alarm-o-bot's detection abilities are entirely visual; it cannot detect sounds. The bot \u201csees\u201d any motion, heat, or even unusual shifts in air currents, allowing it to detect invisible creatures or those shrouded in magical darkness. If it detects anything suspicious, it immediately shrieks \u201cINTRUDER ALERT!\u201d and flashes a bright red light for 30 seconds.\nThe screech and flare can be stopped only by destroying the alarm-o-bot, magically silencing or darkening it in some way, or if the owner uses a standard action to switch it off. Switching off a screaming alarmo-bot requires a DC 15 Use Technological Device check. The bot also issues its warning if it takes damage from any source but is not destroyed by that damage.\nThe alarm-o-bot can be set to ignore certain sizes of creatures, such as anything smaller than Tiny, or anything that isn\u2019t Medium. Its heat or motion detection functions can also be switched off independently if desired. Finally, the owner can select a specific motion, such as a vigorous hand wave or repeated jumping, that acts as a \u201cpassword\u201d to cause the bot to not activate its alarm. This enables the owner to approach without being deafened.\nThe alarm-o-bot uses 1 vial of &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt; for up to 8 hours of continuous use. However, issuing its alarm draws additional power, counting as 10 minutes off this time."}

During a duel, Alastair began to cast the spell chain lightning at her. She readied a counter spell, and cast \"dispel magic\". She tried to use the spell \"spirit touch\" to try to capture the spell for later use. However while she successfully countered his spell, she failed to capture the spell. Alastair then cast \"fly\" and \"bull's strength\" on himself. Leanine then cast \"dispel magic\" in prepartaion to use \"steal magic\" on him (a combination that if worked would transfer the spells to her rather than eliminating them). The dispel cast succeeded, allowing for her to use rob magic to transfer the spells to herself. She succeeded at transferring \"bull's strengh\" to herself, but failed to transfer \"fly\" (the dispel backfired and he was able to retain his fly spell) While they were still engaged in combat he then attempted to cast \"frost nova\" and she again prepared a counterspell, she successfally countered the spell. Shen then decided to deflect the spell onto Alastair's cronies, the \"frost nova\" exploded among his friends injuring them. Then Alastair attempted to cast \"cripple\" and she again successfully dispelled it, and this time reflected the spell back at him, causing Alastair to cast the spell on himself. In the end the duel just wasn't very successful for Alastair, because Leanine countered everything he threw at her."}

A malicious gnome, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Weavil\"&gt;Doctor Weavil&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island with his flying machine, and now resides in the largest house of the island, guarded by several of his minions. At the same time, King Varian Wrynn disappeared from his prison cell. His former cell is now home to a naga called &lt;a href=\"Tidelord%20Rrurgaz\"&gt;Tidelord Rrurgaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile you could attack Doctor Weavil, he had approximately 326K &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, and after fighting him for about 15 seconds, he would &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt; you and you would be his minion for two minutes. At that point he resumes his nap and, when the &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; expires, the fight starts over again.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt; scenario, Alcaz island becomes deserted. Adventurers can speak to &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt;, a bronze dragon, to see the land of the past and return to the present. She is located at the end of the bridge west of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the defeated Doctor Weavil returned to Alcaz island and bumped up the security. Monsters there comprise a mechanical army of level 110 elites. Anti-air turrets will now shoot down anyone trying to fly near the island.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAdventurers with the &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; profession can venture to an &lt;a href=\"Jewelhammer%27s%20Vault\"&gt;underwater cave&lt;/a&gt; on the north side of Alcaz Island to obtain plans for the &lt;a href=\"Jewelhammer%27s%20Focus\"&gt;Jewelhammer's Focus&lt;/a&gt; (as part of the Tools of the Trade questlines introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.1.5\"&gt;Patch 8.1.5&lt;/a&gt;). The cave is an exact replica of the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Observatory\"&gt;Primordial Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.\nNPCs.\n&lt;a href=\"Strashaz\"&gt;Strashaz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nOnce a human settlement, naga have taken over Alcaz Island and seem to be protecting something. Rumors abound, but so far no one has uncovered what the naga may be hiding. Alcaz was a small &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; village with an underground tunnel system, and presumably the tunnel system might be where the naga are hiding whatever it is they are guarding. Hydras also dwell off the coast; these may be native to the area, or the naga may have summoned them."}

They take on the positions of &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, apprentices, and masters. Alchemists use &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s to create strange, magical brews that heal, empower, and produce a variety of positive effects - invisibility, elemental resistance, &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; restoration, and much more. They can also transmute mystic materials into rare and exotic new forms. With their power to create valuable consumables, alchemists are highly useful to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. By creating rare materials, alchemists can make a great deal of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, enable the creation of powerful weapons and armor, and even influence the economy of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the specialties they can dedicate themselves to, they can become masters of potions, masters of elixirs, or masters of transmutation.\nCharacteristics.\nAny alchemist will tell that matter is malleable, any substance can be transformed into another - but nothing is really created or destroyed. As &lt;a href=\"transmuter\"&gt;transmuter&lt;/a&gt;s, they use &lt;a href=\"Philosopher%27s%20Stone\"&gt;alchemist stones&lt;/a&gt; of various qualities, and can learn to overcome all these limitations. In their work, they mix &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flask\"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mana%20oils\"&gt;mana oils&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wizard%20oils\"&gt;wizard oils&lt;/a&gt;, and other alchemical substances into vials using &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;s. Their concoctions can restore &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; and paralyze, make invisible, enhance &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, or provide any number of other useful effects. High level alchemists can also transmute essences and metals into other essences and metals. Their most numerous and prized requests concern the concoction of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; potions in times of conflict.\nIt is important for an alchemist to take great care in their trade. Patience and precision are important for an alchemist, as even slight alterations to a potion's ingredients can change it fundamentally. They are used to gathering foul substances safely, and in time, are used to the smell. One trained in alchemy is able to sense the magical potential from the resources they use. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; has long practice in alchemy, which lets him identify individual components in alchemical mixtures.\nSome alchemists can craft an extract that will induce a vision. For an alchemist, the creation of a truth serum is tricky business, demanding keen instincts, perfect timing, and improvisation at every step. Plants have properties that allow alchemists to re-energize and reinvigorate others through potions. The &lt;a href=\"Deathrose\"&gt;Deathrose&lt;/a&gt; is a rare flower that grows only in the deepest, darkest swamps of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and in the hands of a master alchemist, the petals of the flower can be used to create some of the deadliest &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s known to exist in all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll alchemists have their own alchemy station, it's a personal workbench they take care of, and for which they spend years assembling the materials and components necessary to work on. Among their instruments, they notably use a burner or &lt;a href=\"Leyflame%20Burner\"&gt;leyflame burner&lt;/a&gt;, corks, a mixing flask, volatile reagents, filters, a crucible, a calibrated burette assembly, and a decoction conduit.\nPotion stains on their tabard and crushed herbs on their boots are one way to easily recognize an alchemist. All the stirring during their labors makes their arms strong.\nBackground.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beth%27Amara\"&gt;Beth'Amara&lt;/a&gt; was one of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s most influential alchemists, and she alone was said to have mastered transmuting metals among other things.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Urheld%20Darkstone\"&gt;Urheld Darkstone&lt;/a&gt;, despite being an alchemist of great skill, was thought insane by his contemporaries and, hence, did not share his research.\n&lt;a href=\"Walleye%20Sprysprocket\"&gt;Walleye Sprysprocket&lt;/a&gt; was a famed alchemist who lived long ago. After he studied &lt;a href=\"Vial%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Sandstone Drake&lt;/a&gt;s in great detail, he developed &lt;a href=\"Vial%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; to mimic the drakes' physiology.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; alchemical society created by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;new undead plague&lt;/a&gt; to wipe out the Scourge. They are constantly brewing up new plagues and poisons to unleash upon Sylvanas' enemies, and the other races of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; once believed they were working on a remedy to cure their \"illness\".\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Putricide\"&gt;Professor Putricide&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; was one of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful weapons. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Adrianna\"&gt;Alchemist Adrianna&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to obtain pure samples of the toxins, in order for their researchers and alchemists to concoct an antidote that would save countless lives.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwindian alchemists brew a potion that would help individuals sleep and keep immune against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; took to protect himself.\nCataclysm era.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; sent several Horde alchemists to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to assist the night elves in looking over the slaughter' site, where many tauren and night elves &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; have been murdered by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and also to examine the blood and clothing of which the Horde was accused.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt; the Royal Chemist and &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; collaborated to create a serum to help &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; keep his &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; affliction controlled and secret. It was later used on bitten Gilneans to fight the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Harris\"&gt;Oliver Harris&lt;/a&gt; also worked on a way to restore the mind and sanity of the feral worgen, and through alchemy, he managed to cure &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt; from his madness.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; fell under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, a dwarven &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess and alchemist gave &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; an invisibility potion to flee &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Queen-Regent Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. At the request of &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, alchemists later came to check the sickly state of &lt;a href=\"Sky%27ree\"&gt;Sky'ree&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed that she was old instead of ill.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn order to fight the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; alchemists created gas bombs for their agents, sowing chaos and delaying their actions for days anywhere that they set them off.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn , alchemists have been known to show an interest in digging up &lt;a href=\"gronnling\"&gt;gronnling&lt;/a&gt; bones for research purposes.\nLegion.\nAs potent alchemy can be used to prevent insects from infesting fields of farmlands, the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; used to trade bug sprayers to the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, a few alchemists traveled to &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt;, carrying with them &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-tainted alchemist stones. &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20Funen\"&gt;Alchemist Funen&lt;/a&gt; later helped them to purify the stones and elevate the power within.\nDragonflight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s%20Consortium\"&gt;Artisan's Consortium&lt;/a&gt; is a company that provides goods and services to crafters and gatherers in need across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They have a vast network of artisans and gatherers of all professions, notably alchemists, that can craft and obtain the highest quality goods, and their business connects those artisans and gatherers to the customers.\nGoblin alchemist.\nDue to the influence of the &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt;, goblins became excelent alchemists. These maniacal and brilliant alchemists are masters of volatile chemicals, explosives, and strange mechanical devices. Some of them were seen as allies of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, as well as allies of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and capital of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; is home to goblinhood's finest alchemists.\nIn the RPG.\nMany are those who know how to create the simplest items in the alchemist's repertoire \u2014 small sticks with bits of alchemical gold that glow brighter than a torch when struck, vicious acids, and stones coated with a special dust that causes a loud explosion when struck against something solid. But these are only the basics of an elaborate and incredible art, easily as expansive as any form of spellcasting. Indeed, the simple alchemist's fire and thunderstones are to the heights of alchemy what little cantrips are to the greatest forms of magic.\nMany alchemists \u2014 at least, many alchemists who are also spellcasters \u2014 often find themselves drawn away to the \u201csuperior\u201d art of potion-brewing. However, not all alchemists have that option. More than one skilled alchemist can cast no spells whatsoever, and many are the warriors among both the Forsaken and night elves who supplement their deadly skills with the heights of alchemical knowledge.\nMechanical devices and steam &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; are the latest attraction, leaving alchemy as \"the old technology\". Alchemists resent the disparaging tone that accompanies \"old\".\nOne can also become an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20alchemist\"&gt;arcane alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, consulting old books and performing lengthy mathematical calculations to achieve similar results than the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Potion%20doc\"&gt;Potion doc&lt;/a&gt;s work differently than basic alchemist, as they tool brewing and alchemy to a different level, operating in a different way than a basic alchemist or witch doctor, and combining science and magic in their unique art."}

While named simply as the Alchemist in-game, in other official material he is also known as the Goblin Alchemist.\nIn this unconventional pairing, a fanatical &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; master rides on the back of his &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; slave. Despite undergoing a series of chemical \"treatments\" to enforce compliance, the Ogre sometimes shows signs of independence and even outright defiance. However, these outbursts are swiftly quelled by the Goblin master, who can be like his concoctions \u2014 harsh and volatile. Though personal differences may at times distract this duo, when it comes to biological warfare and raw, brute strength, the Goblin Alchemist and his Ogre slave are truly at the top of their game!\nHero names.\nRazzil Naypolm, Niffy Gurglebeaker, Ezzel Darkbrewer, Lapis Concocter, Savvy Foulmixer, Fictious Warpotion.\nInformation.\nThe Alchemist is a melee hero. He inflicta great damage that can be further boosted with his Chemical Rage. But despite his capacity to deal large amounts of damage, he works better as a support hero like the &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;. The Alchemist works out of range from enemy attacks, preferably behind units that can protect him where he can fling his concoctions and affect the battle from a distance. If its necessary, the Alchemist can rush in to finish off weakened enemy units.\nAlthough the alchemist deals large amounts of damage and provides healing, he is rather fragile due to his low armor stats, making him an easy target to take down. Focus on surrounding the Alchemist to take him out.\nSpells and abilities.\nHaling Spray.\nHealing Spray makes the Alchemist one of the few Heroes in the game with a healing ability, and the only healing Hero among the Neutral Heroes. This can be very useful, especially early in the game when fighting creeps.\nIt can be used to heal several units at the same time, including the Alchemist. The more units you can cluster together, the more you can heal at once. A good combination with this spell would be the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Walker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spirit Walker&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Spirit_Walker_%28Warcraft_III%29%23Spirit_Link\"&gt;Spirit Link&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe major downside with Healing Spray is that it doesn't just heal your own or allied units, but all units in the target area. In battles where a lot of units, both friendly and hostile, moves around, it is nearly impossible to heal a decent amount of friendly units without healing the enemy as well. It is thus easier to target ranged units that are a lot more stationary, but these usually doesn't suffer as much damage as the melee ones.\nAs Healing Spray is channeled, it is possible to interrupt it with a stun.\nChemical age.\nNotes: Even though the green colored attack speed indicates that the Alchemist's attack speed is increased this is not true. In fact the Alchemist is only replaced by a unit with a higher base attack speed. In this form Alchemist can exceed 400 speed limit and reach 522 speed limit.\nMany alchemists find this useful to use when escaping instead of attacking. Likewise, it is also good for scouting.\nCombat-wise, it is perfect for chasing and damaging fleeing enemies. It is also good for hit-and-run attacks.\nStuns can be used to prevent the alchemist from both running away and fighting.\nAcid omb.\nAcid bomb is very effective against clustered ranged units when combined with fast melee attackers like &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;ghouls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcid Bomb is especially useful against targets that are running away.\nIt is also good for boosting attacks used by other Heroes.\nProbably (not confirmed) dispels, such as the one used by the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nransmute (Ultimate).\nTransmute is an unique spell as it is the only Hero-spell which specifically is used for increasing the player's amount of gold (along with killing things). Because of this, it is a nifty spell for any player who has trouble getting enough gold.\nTransmute cannot be used on Heroes, summoned units, nor creeps above level 5.\nThe amount of gold received is 100% of the unit's gold cost. This amount is reduced if you are in Low or High Upkeep.\nUsing Transmute on a critter yields no gold, despite causing the visual gold-coins-effect (see gallery).\nWhile transmute will make little difference in a huge battle, it is nearly impossible to counter. Your best shot is to kill the Alchemist before he pulls it off, or fight him with only non-transmutable units, such as Heroes."}

Concoctions can be made to restore health and mana, grant temporary invisibility, grant temporary good luck through treasure finding, temporarily change appearance, temporarily improve statistics, and much more.\nAlchemy is useful to all character &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es. Melee fighters can use alchemy to create &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; and healing potions. Spell casting classes can use alchemy to create &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; potions and related buffs. Players can create potions, sell them to others, or give them to their party members and friends. Alchemists are well loved when they hand out potions.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Alchemists use herbs to create strange, magical brews that heal, empower, and produce a variety of positive effects - invisibility, elemental resistance, mana restoration, and much, much more. They can also transmute mystic materials into rare and exotic new forms. With their power to create valuable consumables (one-use items), Alchemists are highly useful to groups and raids. By creating rare materials, Alchemists can make a great deal of money, enable the creation of powerful weapons and armor, and even influence the economy of Azeroth!\"\n\"Most alchemical brews can be created anywhere, as long as you have the appropriate reagents - supplies that you can buy from vendors, trade for with other players, or find in the wild.\"\n\"Alchemy is often paired with the gathering profession Herbalism, since herbs found in the wilderness are required to concoct the majority of alchemical mixtures.\"\n\"As you advance further in the craft of alchemy, you'll be given an opportunity to choose a specialization. After completing a unique quest, you can specialize in either Transmutation, Potions or Elixirs. An Alchemist with a specialization has a chance to create bonus materials when working within their area of expertise.\"\nAdvancing as an Alchemist.\nAlchemists improve their skill by creating items. For general information on levelling professions (including Alchemy) see &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Increasing%20professional%20skill%20level\"&gt;Increasing professional skill level&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew recipes can be learnt when the alchemist achieves the requisite skill level. The method in which new recipes are learnt depends on the expansion in which the recipes are based. All pre-Mists of Pandaria recipes are learnt from alchemy trainers for a small amount. Some recipes can also be learnt through '&lt;a href=\"Discovery\"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;'. Remember to check with your alchemy trainer regularly for newly available recipes.\nThe method in which Mists of Pandaria recipes are learnt is a little different. Only two recipes are available from alchemy trainers: &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%27s%20Rejuvenation%20%28recipe%29\"&gt;Alchemist's Rejuvenation (recipe)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Healing%20Potion%20%28recipe%29\"&gt;Master Healing Potion (recipe)&lt;/a&gt;. When making these potions, the alchemist has a chance to learn a new recipe. Recipes discovered in this way also have a chance to grant a new recipe to the alchemist. Only recipes appropriate to the alchemist's skill level will be discovered in this way. The result of this is that the alchemist becomes self-taught; all further recipes can be learnt simply through practicing alchemy. However, their discovery is somewhat randomised; although limited by the alchemist's skill level, there is no fixed order to the discoveries, and certain recipes may remain undiscovered for some time. The likelihood of discovering a new recipe is not tied to the difficulty of the item being crafted, and seems to be even for all recipes, with even recipes with a grey skill level having a good chance of teaching the alchemist a new one. Grey recipes can therefore be considered to be more worthwhile in the Mists of Pandaria era; although they will not advance the alchemist's skill level they can still be quite useful for making discoveries.\nVials.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elixir\"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flask\"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;s will require a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vial\"&gt;Crystal Vial&lt;/a&gt;, which can be purchased from any trade goods or Alchemy vendor. \nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, there were five types of vials: Empty, previously used to create lower-level potions; Leaded, used to create mid-level potions; and Crystal, Imbued, or Enchanted Vials, used to create higher-level potions and flasks. Following the Cataclysm, all non-Crystal vials were converted to &lt;a href=\"poor\"&gt;poor&lt;/a&gt; quality &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Vial\"&gt;Shattered Vial&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRecommended Additional Professions.\n&lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt; is not technically required, but is highly recommended as nearly every alchemy recipe requires &lt;a href=\"Herb\"&gt;Herb&lt;/a&gt;s to make, and herbalism can alleviate most of the cost of leveling up. Also, the wide variety of different herbs makes it difficult to simply purchase what you need from other players, because many potions will require more than one type of herb to make, and the herbs are often very expensive.\nTransmutation.\nHigh-level alchemists can perform transmutations on gems, elemental materials, and some metals for use with other tradeskills. &lt;a href=\"Arcanite\"&gt;Arcanite&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in pre-TBC &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; recipes, cannot be mined \u2013 it can only be transmuted from &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Crystal\"&gt;Arcane Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, which is derived from &lt;a href=\"Thorium\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Truegold\"&gt;Truegold&lt;/a&gt; has no other source than alchemy. Many other transmutations are possible; see recipe lists.\nBefore an alchemist can perform any transmutations, he or she must create a &lt;a href=\"Philosopher%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Philosopher's Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Much like the blacksmith's &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Hammer\"&gt;Blacksmith Hammer&lt;/a&gt; or enchanter's &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Copper%20Rod\"&gt;Runed Copper Rod&lt;/a&gt;, this stone must be in the inventory or equipped to perform any transmutations. Making multiple Philosopher's Stones will not reduce the cooldown time. Philosopher's Stones are Soulbound and cannot be disenchanted, so it is not advised to create more than one. Higher level alchemists can replace their Philosopher's Stone with any Alchemist's Stone, such as the &lt;a href=\"Lifebound%20Alchemist%20Stone\"&gt;Lifebound Alchemist Stone&lt;/a&gt; introduced with Cataclysm.\nSome transmutations have a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. This cooldown is shared across any transmutation that requires a cooldown. The cooldown resets at 00:00 time on the server each day. So, a transmute performed at 23:00 server time will prevent any other transmutes requiring a cooldown from taking place for one hour, but a transmute performed at 08:00 server time will prevent cooldown-required transmutes for 16 hours.\nDiscoveries.\n&lt;a href=\"Discovery\"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; is a mechanic used to learn certain alchemy and &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt; recipes. You have a small chance every time you perform a &lt;a href=\"transmute\"&gt;transmutation&lt;/a&gt; or when you make a potion, elixir, or flask that was introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\". The recipe is learned automatically.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", almost all recipes are learnt through 'discovery'. The recipes &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%27s%20Rejuvenation%20%28recipe%29\"&gt;Alchemist's Rejuvenation (recipe)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Healing%20Potion%20%28recipe%29\"&gt;Master Healing Potion (recipe)&lt;/a&gt; can be learnt from Alchemy trainers. When making these potions, you have a chance to learn other Pandaria alchemy recipes. Discovered recipes can also reveal additional recipes when created. However, you won't be able to learn some recipes until you reach the appropriate skill level. This is intended to provide each alchemist with a unique skill-levelling process.\nAlchemy specializations.\nUpon reaching a Classic Alchemy skill of 300, trainers offer quests to learn one of three specializations: \nSpecializing gives players a chance to create an extra 1 to 4 (for a total of 5) items while crafting in the field you have selected. For example, a Master of Potions may be able to craft more than one &lt;a href=\"Super%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Super Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt; for the same material cost as one. For more details on the probability, see &lt;a href=\"%23Percentage%20explanation%20attempt\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanging specializations.\nTo change a specialization in alchemy:\nOnce unlearned, alchemy trainers in major cities will offer you a choice of three quests, one for each specialization. The quests involve bringing rare materials to a alchemy trainer. eg.: 4 &lt;a href=\"Living%20Steel\"&gt;Living Steel&lt;/a&gt; for Transmutation Mastery.\nThe specialization NPCs are:\nSpecializations can be changed as often as desired.\nPercentage explanation attempt.\nWhile the exact percentage of the specialization proc is unknown, people have speculated that this ability can happen as often as 10-25% of the time.\nOne theory is that each extra item created also has a 15% chance to create its own extra item. Probability in this type of case is multiplicative and luckily analytical \u2013 we do not have to do a Monte-Carlo analysis to determine the probability. It works the same way as the probability of flipping N number of heads in a row with a coin. The chance of flipping 1 head is 50% or a 0.5 probability. The chance of flipping 2 heads in a row is 0.5 *0.5 or .25 or 25%. The chance of flipping 3 heads in a row is 0.25 *0.5 or 0.125 or 12.5%\nSo, if the 15% assumption is correct, when creating an item, you have approximately a 15% chance of creating exactly two items instead of one, a (0.15^2) or 2.25% chance to create three items instead of one, a (0.15^3) or 0.3375% chance of creating four items instead of one, and a (0.15^4) or 0.050625% chance of creating exactly five items instead of one.\nAlchemy perks.\nAlchemists gain a few perks as compared to other professions, namely the Mixology passive, reusable potions, and potions with combined instant health and mana regeneration.\nAbilities.\nAlchemists gain the passive &lt;a href=\"Mixology\"&gt;Mixology&lt;/a&gt; ability, which doubles the duration and increases the effect of many &lt;a href=\"flask\"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt;s when used by the alchemist.

There are many varieties of alcoholic drinks, and several different strengths. Alcoholic drinks are &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s that can be procured either through adventuring or a vendor. Unlike other drinks, most alcohol does not restore mana (although there are some exceptions). However, alcohol shares a global cooldown with all other drinks. Some alcoholic drinks also grant benefits such as &lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;Well Fed&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, alcohol is used purely for recreation (as in real life). If you drink enough alcohol, you will first become \"tipsy\", then \"drunk\", and finally \"completely smashed\"; after enough alcohol, you will &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Vomit\"&gt;vomit&lt;/a&gt;. As you continue to drink, other effects will set in to simulate real life drunkenness. While there are many common alcohols, there are also a number of exotic drinks to be had \u2014 which this list tries to compile.\nEffects.\n \nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, when you become tipsy, drunk, or completely smashed, the game will announce what you were drinking at the time.\nThe effects of alcohol are generally mild and don't set in early, though effects like blurred vision depend heavily on what your computer's video quality. \\At first, you will become &lt;a href=\"tipsy\"&gt;tipsy&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, being tipsy will not affect you much. Slight vision blurring or unintentional turning may occur. Continuing to drink while tipsy will make you &lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the video effects simulating blurred vision can be turned off by adding SET ffxGlow \"0\" to your WTF&gt;Config.wtf file.\nSee &lt;a href=\"tipsy\"&gt;tipsy&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nBeing &lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt; will cause heavier vision blurring and more movement effects, and the swaying can cause significant loss of course if running or riding (please do not drink and ride \u2014 it's not worth it). In addition to the tipsy effects, when you try to talk, the letter \"s\" will become \"sh\" and occasionally \"...hic!\" will be added to the end of your chat line. In &lt;a href=\"patch%201.6\"&gt;patch 1.6&lt;/a&gt;, however, words that became profane through this (such as \"sit\") no longer had the \"s\" to \"sh\" change applied. You might, for instance, say \"this is an example\" and it will appear as though you said \"thish ish an example...hic!\". Drunkenness also simulates delusions of grandeur, aggressiveness, and/or confidence by making the level on mobs or flagged enemies appear five levels lower, though it doesn't actually modify the mob's stats and you still receive the same amount of experience.\nSee &lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nBeing completely smashed doesn't seem to have any new effects, but some, such as screen blurring or turning, are said to appear to worsen. After drinking enough alcohol at smashed the character will cast &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Vomit\"&gt;Drunken Vomit&lt;/a&gt;, stunning the character and spewing a green stream of vomit onto the ground.\nThis table charts the quantity of each type of alcohol that must be consumed to reach each level of inebriation.\nList of alcohol.\nThis section will attempt to list all types of alcohol, but because they are so numerous, it is highly likely more exotic kinds will be missed.

They are servants of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, and assist them in their battle against the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They are also at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, and compete with them for power within Shattrath and for the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;'s favor.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldor still answered to the naaru first and foremost.\nBackground.\nOriginally led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldor were &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s charged with the safeguarding of the draenei holy sites and altars, &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Unending%20Light\"&gt;their holiest&lt;/a&gt; being located to this day on the &lt;a href=\"Aldor%20Rise\"&gt;Aldor Rise&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; from the west.\nTwo hundred years after the draenei arrival to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s started a genocidal war against &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. The last and fiercest battle was fought in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, with the Aldor failing to protect the city from her enemies. The city was left in ruins and darkness for many years, but the order returned and conducted its rites inside a temple in the Lower City. It seems they also fought the sin'dorei loyal to Kael'thas when Illidan's reign as Lord of Outland began.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;\"born from Light\"&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to fight the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, they were drawn to Shattrath. The Aldor regained strength as word spread that the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; had returned and reconstruction soon began. The ruined temple was repurposed as an infirmary for injured refugees. Though the Aldor had suffered much at the hands of the blood elves who later became the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, they put aside open warfare for the sake of the Sha'tar.\nA group of Aldori warriors aided the first &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian forces stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; when it was reopened.\nOne of the most important positions in the Aldor is that of Lightwarden. The Lightwarden's role is twofold. Protect the priesthood at all costs first and foremost. Destroy the enemies of the Light wherever they may hide second. The position is currently held by &lt;a href=\"Adyen%20the%20Lightwarden\"&gt;Adyen&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers can acquire &lt;a href=\"Lightwarden%27s%20Band\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naaru%20Lightwarden%27s%20Band\"&gt;bands&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Lightwarden%27s%20Girdle\"&gt;girdle&lt;/a&gt; related to the role through various means.\nReputation.\n\"Characters may join the Aldor or Scryer by completing the quest chain &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Light\"&gt;City of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completion of City of Light, the Allegiance Quest &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20the%20Aldor\"&gt;Allegiance to the Aldor&lt;/a&gt; becomes available. Completion of this quest grants with the Aldor, with the Scryers, and access to the Aldor reputation quests.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; gains with the Aldor correspond with a 10% greater loss of reputation with the Scryers. All characters start off as with the Aldor, with the exception of Draenei and Blood Elf characters. Draenei are automatically with the Aldor and with the Scryers, whereas blood elf characters are automatically with the Aldor and with the Scryers. However, this does not mean that either character is restricted to or prohibited from the Aldor: they may choose to join the Aldor just like any other &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of character by completing &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20the%20Aldor\"&gt;Allegiance to the Aldor&lt;/a&gt;. \nStrategy.\nUntil Honored.\nTurning in ten to &lt;a href=\"Adyen%20the%20Lightwarden\"&gt;Adyen the Lightwarden&lt;/a&gt; in Aldor Rise will yield +250 reputation with the Aldor. There is also a repeatable quest for single mark turn-ins which yields +25 reputation with the Aldor. These marks drop from low-ranking Burning Legion members (mostly Shadow Council affiliated orcs) found in most &lt;a href=\"regions\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; of Outland, including the two camps north of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. In addition these quests provide &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; reputation: +125 reputation per ten or +12.5 reputation per single turn in.\nPlayers who have completed &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20the%20Aldor\"&gt;Allegiance to the Aldor&lt;/a&gt; must turn in 220 marks to reach status with the Aldor, with the exception of Blood Elf characters, who must turn in 340 marks due to starting out as with the Aldor, and Draenei characters, who must turn in only 100 marks due to starting out as . Players who have not completed &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20the%20Aldor\"&gt;Allegiance to the Aldor&lt;/a&gt; due to defecting from the Scryers must turn in 360 marks to reach status.\nPlayers who also desire &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; reputation may prefer killing &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20Fortress\"&gt;Kil'sorrow Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, as they yield as well as +10 reputation with the Kurenai or Mag'har per kill.\nUntil Revered and Exalted.\nBesides completing the faction-specific non-repeatable quests, players seeking to attain and status with the Aldor may turn in upon reaching level 68. Each turn-in of ten Marks yields +250 reputation with the Aldor, and each turn-in of a single Mark yields +25 reputation with the Aldor. These Marks drop from high-ranking members of the Burning Legion (i.e., &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; level 66 or higher). These mobs may be found in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. In Blade's Edge Mountains, &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Door\"&gt;Death's Door&lt;/a&gt; boasts the most compact group of mobs that drop . Assuming no additional reputation from any other source is earned, it takes approximately 1320 Marks of Sargeras or 95 to reach status from status with the Aldor.\nFel Armaments.\n may be turned in at any time to High Priestess Ishanah inside the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Unending%20Light\"&gt;Shrine of Unending Light&lt;/a&gt; on the Aldor Rise. Each turn-in yields +350 reputation with the Aldor. In addition to reputation gains, characters will receive , a form of currency used to purchase shoulder &lt;a href=\"enchants\"&gt;enchants&lt;/a&gt; in the Aldor &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 17 are required to go from to status.\nSwitching to Aldor.\nIt is possible to defect from the Scryers to the Aldor, though doing so eliminates all reputation previously earned with the Scryers. In order to switch factions, players must find &lt;a href=\"Sha%27nir\"&gt;Sha'nir&lt;/a&gt;, an Aldor located in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;. She offers the quest &lt;a href=\"Strained%20Supplies\"&gt;Strained Supplies&lt;/a&gt; which requires characters to turn in eight for +250 reputation with the Aldor. This quest may be repeated until achieving status with the Aldor, at which time it becomes unavailable. Please note, there will be a point when a player is with both factions and therefore unable to use any bank or inn, so it is probably a good idea to hand in all needed venom sacs at once. Characters previously allied with the Scryers who are by the Aldor will need to complete the quest approximately 168 times, requiring 1,344 individual Dreadfang Venom Sacs, to attain status. After the switch, some quests will be available although the player has finished their Scryers' counterparts:\nRewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Xorith\"&gt;Arcanist Xorith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haldor%20the%20Compulsive\"&gt;Haldor the Compulsive&lt;/a&gt; sell specialized &lt;a href=\"flasks\"&gt;flasks&lt;/a&gt; usable only in raid zones to characters who are with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, the Sha'tar and their respective faction (i.e., either Scryer or Aldor).

Allegiance to the Aldor and completing quests for them will result in reputation loss with the Scryers. The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Unending%20Light\"&gt;Shrine of Unending Light&lt;/a&gt; is the main seat of rule for the Aldor.\nAldor Rise has an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; and a variety of vendors, including vendors who distribute &lt;a href=\"Tier%204\"&gt;Tier 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tier%205\"&gt;Tier 5&lt;/a&gt; gear. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryer's Tier&lt;/a&gt;, there is no &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt; vendor.

Scryer-favored players who wish to take the shortcut to Nagrand through the Aldor rise should be warned not to take the elevator between the Scryer's Tier and Aldor Rise, since aggroing the guards and getting Banished from Shattrath City is very easy. Instead, take the main elevator from the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; and dodge past the NPCs and the Inn to get to the tunnel. \nThe elevator taking adventurers upwards to the rise is notorious for having at least a dozen skeletons, at any given time, of those who miscalculated getting on the elevator and fell to their unlucky deaths at the base. Use caution with Aldor Rise's elevator and don't play games with it. It's better to wait the extra second or the next time the elevator comes up than to jump straight on and waste gold and time getting yourself back together."}

They were one of the few to ever stand against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;; when &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; offered them a place in the Legion, the aldrachi refused, slaying innumerable demons before Sargeras himself killed their greatest champion, &lt;a href=\"Toranaar\"&gt;Toranaar&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered the Legion to bathe their homeworld in fel fire for all time. All that remains of the race are the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; bestowed upon the traitorous &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, so that she might wield a portion of the aldrachi's might with which to devastate the races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe scattered legends that remain of the aldrachi speak of their unsurpassed skill as warriors. These proud people were bred from birth for combat, and their entire culture revolved around it. Military service was mandatory for all aldrachi, and it began as soon as a child could walk.\nMore than titles or wealth, the aldrachi coveted weapons as prized possessions and symbols of status, and warblades eclipsed all other types of arms in prestige. These mighty weapons were fashioned from rare crystals found deep below the earth. The strange minerals had many unique properties, the greatest of which was their ability to absorb the spirits of the dead. Blacksmiths employed closely guarded techniques to enchant these crystals and forge them into instruments of death. The resultant warblades could consume the souls of their victims, and each devoured spirit imbued the weapon with greater power. The most ancient warblades contained thousands of souls, and they were revered just as much as \u2014 if not more than \u2014 the fearsome aldrachi warriors who bore them in battle.\nStories of the aldrachi eventually reached the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and its ruler, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Titan was always eager to find mighty new races that he could bend to his will and use as agents of destruction, and the aldrachi seemed like the perfect candidates. Rather than destroying the aldrachi world outright, Sargeras ordered his forces to invade it and wear the warrior race thin until they were ripe for conversion. He knew that the Legion would suffer great losses to the enemy, but that did not discourage him.\nWar with the Legion.\nThe aldrachi proved more resilient than the Legion had anticipated. The warriors held the overwhelming forces of demons at bay, with even a single one of the aldrachi being able to cut down hundreds of enemies before being killed. Their greatest champion was &lt;a href=\"Toranaar\"&gt;Toranaar the Indomitable&lt;/a&gt;, who was like an army unto himself, his blades howling over the clamor of battle, rending anything that came near. Despite the aldrachi's resilient defense, the Legion slowly and methodically whittled away at their resistance and pushed them back to the towering stronghold in the heart of their war-torn capital. Only Toranaar and a handful of champions remained, each armed with warblades teeming with the souls of thousands of demons. Corpses of aldrachi and demon alike blanketed the earth in all directions, and it is said that not a bare patch of ground could be seen for leagues.\nToranaar and his allies prepared themselves for another Legion assault, but it never came. To the contrary, the demons halted their advance, and then Sargeras himself emerged from the Legion's ranks with an offer for Toranaar. Though no one knows for sure what form Sargeras took to confront the aldrachi, some &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; records say that he infused a sliver of his power into an &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; and dispatched it to the aldrachi stronghold. Whatever the truth, it is certain that Sargeras promised Toranaar and his allies untold power if they joined his Burning Legion. They would serve as his personal guards and command tens of thousands of demons in war, an offer Sargeras believed would prove irresistible to the battle-loving race. Toranaar, however, refused. He vowed to destroy the Legion and avenge the deaths of all of the aldrachi killed by the demons or die trying, and said that he would never bow to the Dark Titan.\nWhat followed was a duel between the champion of the aldrachi and the lord of the Burning Legion. The Legion host watched with rapt attention as Sargeras dueled with Toranaar. The Dark Titan could have simply annihilated his foe at any moment, but he did not seek to destroy Toranaar, but to corrupt him. For days, Sargeras battered the aldrachi with just enough force to wear him down. Toranaar recognized Sargeras' ploy and knew that he could not best the Legion's ruler in combat. Thus, he decided on one final act of defiance by feigning submission. When Sargeras let his guard down, Toranaar struck, his warblades ripping through the titan's hide and drawing his molten blood. Though it was only a minor injury, the other aldrachi howled in triumph.\nInfuriated by Toranaar's defiance, Sargeras instantly ripped him and his fellow aldrachi champions to pieces, leaving nothing of their bodies but dust. The Legion's ruler then commanded his armies to bathe the aldrachi world in an inferno that would smolder for eternity.\nLegacy.\nThough the attempt to corrupt the aldrachi had failed, the warblades of Toranaar and his kin remained intact. Sargeras gave the warblades to his lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered him to distribute them to the Legion's greatest warriors. Those who met Kil'jaeden's standards received a set of warblades, which would come to massacre entire races and consume the souls of a hundred thousand dead. In time, Kil'jaeden had distributed all of the warblades, save Toranaar's, the most powerful arms taken from the aldrachi. The demon lord kept the last set of warblades under close watch for years, until he found someone worthy of wielding them: &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; who had willingly turned against her &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; allies. In her hands, the instruments of dignity and defiance would become tools of betrayal and murder.\nWhen a demon hunter adventurer tracks down Caria to retrieve the warblades for themselves, she summons &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Revenant\"&gt;Aldrachi Revenant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Soulwraith\"&gt;Aldrachi Soulwraith&lt;/a&gt;s to fight them."}

After enduring countless torments by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Rezan would merge the glimmer of his essence to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who had sought to rescue him.\nHistory.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nKnown as the Loa of kings, Rezan was the symbol of leadership and strength for the Zandalari peoples since the earliest days of the empire.\nWhile escaping from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Rezan lent his strength to &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; so that she and her &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; could escape from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; capital. As Talanji, Zul, and the Horde headed towards &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji called on Rezan for guidance as she felt that her father might not agree with partnering with the Horde. In response, Rezan declared she was bold and powerful and used his powers to send her to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; before the advancing &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ships could overtake her.\nRezan is first encountered when his follower, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, was near death after being betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Despite all of his healers' attempts, Rastakhan was unable to be revived because his soul was in the grip of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, loa of death. To get Rastakhan back, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; appealed to Rezan to confront Bwonsamdi and claim back Rastakhan's soul. He was successful, with the caveat that Bwonsamdi would be seeing him again in time.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Rezan\"&gt;Rezan's temple&lt;/a&gt;, Zul's &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; sought to drain Rezan of his power in the same way the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; once did to their loa. Rastakhan and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; slew &lt;a href=\"Vilnak%27dor\"&gt;Vilnak'dor&lt;/a&gt;, the troll performing the ritual, and once he was freed Rezan unleashed his fury upon the Atal'zul and their &lt;a href=\"Kao-Tien\"&gt;Kao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; allies. Afterward, Rezan convinced Rastakhan to realize he had grown soft and Rastakhan swore to take Zul's head.\nWhen the time came to hunt Zul, Rezan was among the army that Rastakhan gathered and led the charge into &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Mugamba\"&gt;Mount Mugamba&lt;/a&gt;. However, during the confrontation with Zul, Rezan was slain. Without his power keeping Bwonsamdi at bay, Rastakhan began aging fast. Rezan's essence was used by Zul to revive &lt;a href=\"Dazar\"&gt;Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the first king of the Zandalari, and his undead corpse walked the lower levels of Atal'Dazar until it was destroyed by a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShadowlands.\nWith the machine of death broken, Rezan's soul traveled into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. At an unknown point in time after his arrival, Rezan would be captured and tormented by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exhaurbius\"&gt;Exhaurbius&lt;/a&gt;. By the time &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived and killed Exhaurbius, Rezan was nearly lost. The dying Rezan then rejected Vol'jin's offer to save him and instead used the last of his strength to merge the last glimmer of his essence within the troll, while declaring that he was the one their people needed, not him. Vol'jin subsequently vowed to not waste his gift, and that Rezan would always be remembered.\nFollowers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; are Zandalari trolls &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, also known as &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt;s, that served &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; as the highest order of holy warriors to serve any &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. After Rezan's death, the prelates were cut off from his power except for a handful of his followers. However, even with the Loa of Kings gone, his ideals remained. The prelates chose to lead those who are lost, and through their faith for the loa, to stand as a beacon of light against the darkness."}

When the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; first meets Rhan'ka at the inn, he appears to be talking to imaginary friends in the form of a group of inanimate &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; skulls (&lt;a href=\"Grenja\"&gt;Grenja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Man%27zul\"&gt;Man'zul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Volni\"&gt;Volni&lt;/a&gt;). After introducing the adventurer to the Goldtusk Gang, Rhan'ka sends them to gather &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; blood in &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Pass\"&gt;Dead Man's Pass&lt;/a&gt; so he can make his \"famous scorpid blood drinks\" and also asks them to look for &lt;a href=\"Zulsan\"&gt;Zulsan&lt;/a&gt;, a lost member of the gang.\nHowever, while the adventurer is away, &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury trolls&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Gozda%27kun%20the%20Slaver\"&gt;Gozda'kun the Slaver&lt;/a&gt; attack the inn and kidnap the members of the Goldtusk Gang. Rhan'ka flees with only a banana in hand (as it seemed important at the time) and meets up with the adventurer at the pass. Holding onto the gathered scorpid blood, Rhan'ka asks the adventurer to save the other Goldtusks from the Sandfury hideout, kill Gozda'kun, and get some \"honey\" from Rhan'ka's friend Rikati. Rhan'ka then rides back to the inn with Zulsan, telling Rikati to hide his honey from the Sandfury hooligans along the way.\nWhen the hero returns to the inn, they find Rhan'ka cowering inside a cauldron with a banana bunch on his head. In return for their efforts, Rhan'ka and his companions decide to allow the adventurer into their gang and let them \"see what we see\". When the adventurer drinks a ritual cup of boiled scorpid blood spiked with Rikati's &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt; honey, it is revealed that Rhan'ka's Goldtusk Gang are not merely skulls but actually troll ghosts that the adventurer was simply unable to see before. After the hero helps the gang out with various tasks, the inn receives its first guest in the form of the adventurer's old companion &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Tarkaj\"&gt;Bladeguard Tarkaj&lt;/a&gt;. After the hero helps Tarkaj recover from his injuries, the Goldtusk Inn officially becomes open for business, and Rhan'ka begins offering his services as an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the hero that as a lifetime member of the gang, they will always be welcome at the inn. Afterward, Rhan'ka sends the adventurer to begin advertising the Goldtusk Inn across Vol'dun, starting with the vulpera scavengers at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Zak%27rajan\"&gt;Court of Zak'rajan&lt;/a&gt;.\nVendor information.\nThe following items only become available for purchase from Rhan'ka after completion of &lt;a href=\"A%20Goldtusk%20Greeting\"&gt;A Goldtusk Greeting&lt;/a&gt;."}

A powerful &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; mage, he was also known to be skilled with the sword. Rhonin was instrumental in breaking the power of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; by freeing the Dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; from her imprisonment by &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; who used the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to keep her prisoner. He later traveled back to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; in order to heal a rift in time.\nAs the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; intensified, Rhonin came to the forefront, leading the Kirin Tor from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the rebuilt city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. He announced the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; and was involved in the final quests after defeating him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin sacrificed himself in order to localize the explosion of a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; created by the Horde that destroyed &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. He also saved &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who succeeded him as leader of the Kirin Tor, as another had foreseen beforehand.\nBiography.\nRhonin didn't grow up in a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; family. A rift appeared between him and his kin when he decided to enter the ranks of &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;ry, not ever seeing any of them again after acting on his chosen calling.\nAs a student of magic, Rhonin's nose was once broken by a fellow apprentice. Rhonin decided by his own choice to not get it properly fixed by magic.\nSecond War.\nRhonin was once a promising mage of the Kirin Tor until a disastrous mission involving the reckless use of magic during the Second War \u2014 whilst Rhonin was casting a spell, others in his group got in the path of his attack. Rhonin's action succeeded in preventing a band of orc warlocks from raising a demon from the dead, but it also cost the lives of all his comrades. Rhonin was cast into probation until the opportunity for penance arose with a dangerous mission into &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. He was assisted in this mission by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; ranger &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Dragonreaver\"&gt;Falstad Dragonreaver&lt;/a&gt;, and the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; (who was the instigator of this mission).\nHe was also assisted (at first) by the evil &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, but Deathwing's true purpose was to steal some of Alexstrasza's eggs to replenish his own decimated dragonflight. With a gemstone created from Deathwing's scale, Rhonin was able to destroy the Demon Soul and release Alexstrasza. During this mission, Rhonin and Vereesa fell in love, and were later married.\nThird War.\nWhen Vereesa's sister &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; vanished on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa and Rhonin took in their son &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhonin fought against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as they invaded &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. He and his wife were among the few survivors of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Most of Rhonin's family however, including his father, were killed during the fall of the town of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhile he and Vereesa were preparing for the birth of their twin offspring, Rhonin was once again summoned by Krasus for help. Apparently, the dragon-mage had discovered a rift in time, which swallowed both of them, along with the orc veteran &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. The three were sent 10,000 years back in time to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;first invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in the past, Rhonin encountered legendary beings such as &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;. He became friends with the heroes &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Rhonin actually became Illidan's mentor, not in the least to try and harness his reckless power, but despite Illidan's admiration much of Rhonin's work involved cleaning up Illidan's mistakes. When Illidan defected, Rhonin assumed command of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;. As a reward for Rhonin's courage, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; allowed Rhonin to return to Vereesa at the moment she went into labor to ensure he would not miss a moment of the twins' lives. Nozdormu also offered the children the friendship of the bronze dragonflight.\nNight of the Dragon.\nIn more recent years, Rhonin has found himself in the position as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, having been approached by the Kirin Tor in desperation. In Rhonin's own explanation to &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;, \"the Alliance is still looking to Dalaran for a lot and the wizards are looking for me to think different than they've been doing for the past several hundred years.\" However, even though all he really wants is to be with his family, his sense of responsibility impels him from ever abandoning such important roles, or his people. Much like &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, he is still loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; despite its recent hostility against the Horde.\nFollowing the attempted kidnapping of his children by &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin remained behind in Dalaran to protect his sons and direct the Kirin Tor as his mate left to bring her cousin to justice. Growing increasingly concerned by her absence Rhonin tried to portal to her location only to be surprised at ending up near &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. He would encounter the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; Iridi and end up forming an alliance with the local raptors (who had formed &lt;a href=\"Raptor%20army\"&gt;an army&lt;/a&gt;, as it were, due to the ominous on goings at Grim Batol). Working together the unlikely allies would launch an assault on the fortress where upon the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; was freed and in gratitude engaged in battle against &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. During this time Rhonin would briefly engage in battle against the new master of Grim Batol - the Black Dragon &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, the prime consort of Deathwing before she departed to fight Krasus.\nAfter Zzeraku's draining battle with Dargonax, it appeared that the nether dragon would not be able to defeat the twilight dragon. In turn, Iridi gave all of her staff's power, and in the end almost all of her own, to empower Zzeraku. Even with the combination of the staff's and Iridi's power, Zzeraku was unsuccessful in fighting Dargonax and was devoured by the latter. In one last desperate hope to slay the twilight dragon, Iridi - with help from Rhonin, Vereesa, Krasus, and Kalec \u2014 used the last of her energy to destroy Dargonax. With Dargonax, Zendarin, and Sintharia (being seemingly destroyed by the staff as well) slain the unlikely group would depart from one another with Iridi being taken to be buried in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; per her last request by Kalec, Krasus to return to his queen, and Rhonin and Vereesa returning to their children at Dalaran.\nMage (manga).\nIt fell on the once reviled mage, Rhonin, to lead his kind from the brink, and to begin quickly the restoration of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Under his leadership, the Kirin Tor were able to recreate and enhance Dalaran's defenses.\nAfter lifting the city, and moving it towards &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaran was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; mid-flight. This assault was a diversion, however, as a &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;Blue dragonflight agent&lt;/a&gt; with in the Kirin Tor sought to crash Dalaran into the ground. Fortunately, this plan was foiled thanks to the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Aodhan\"&gt;Aodhan&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin, and Master &lt;a href=\"Simeon\"&gt;Simeon&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; declaring war on all mortal magic-users, especially the Kirin Tor, Rhonin had no other choice but to rally the Kirin Tor and lead it in a war to kill the Lord of Magic. To help with this endeavor, he called on his old allies, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nRhonin appears in the \"\" expansion as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. He is located in the rebuilt and relocated city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; at his side. He is fighting the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, who is determined to destroy mortal magic-users.\nWhen your character hits level 80, Rhonin will mail him or her a &lt;a href=\"%3AMagically%20Wrapped%20Gift\"&gt;:Magically Wrapped Gift&lt;/a&gt;, containing 5 each of the following items: &lt;a href=\"%3ARunic%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;:Runic Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3ARunic%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;:Runic Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3APotion%20of%20Speed\"&gt;:Potion of Speed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%3ADalaran%20Firework\"&gt;:Dalaran Firework&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also sends a mail with &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Mastery\"&gt;The Schools of Arcane Magic - Mastery&lt;/a&gt; for completing the &lt;a href=\"Higher%20Learning\"&gt;Higher Learning&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nSecrets of Ulduar.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; discovered the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin summoned &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to discuss how to deal with this threat. When Varian and Garrosh began fighting, Rhonin stopped them, claiming that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stood to lose everything if they didn't work together. His proposition was turned down, leaving a distressed Rhonin to wonder out loud who was left to challenge Yogg-Saron.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s defeated &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; within Ulduar, he informed them that they had to transmit &lt;a href=\"%3AReply-Code%20Alpha\"&gt;:Reply-Code Alpha&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s re-origination. Brann and the adventurers hurried back to Dalaran and met up with Rhonin. As they transmitted the signal into the skies from the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin held a speech for the citizens of Dalaran to celebrate their victory.\nStormrage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin was among those caught by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Rhonin attended the wedding of Malfurion and Tyrande along with his family. At his offering, he and his accompanying magi from Dalaran created a series of magnificent rainbows in the night sky, which marked the ten millennia of his friends' relationship. As with Korialstrasz, who later appeared with Alexstrasza, it was quite clear that Rhonin would not have missed this pivotal moment for anything.\nTides of War.\nSoon after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; began, Rhonin encouraged &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to take on the gnome &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt; as her apprentice. When Kalecgos visited Rhonin for help in locating the missing &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin directed him to seek out Jaina when they discovered the Iris was in Kalimdor.\nWhen Jaina appealed to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to help defend &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; against an attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they decided that doing nothing could be seen as a tacit approval of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s path of conquest, and sent Rhonin and a number of other magi to defend the city. In particular, both Rhonin and his &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; comrade &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; recommended &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; for the task. However, Thalen (actually a spy for &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;) turned on the Kirin Tor during the battle and assisted the Horde in breaking through Theramore's defenses. Rhonin was disheartened to learn of Thalen's betrayal when the latter was captured by &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt;, though maintained that Aethas was likely unaware of the spy's true nature.\nWhen it seemed as though the battle had been won, Rhonin saw a goblin sky galleon approaching with an enormous &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; powered by the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;. Thinking quickly, he realized that Jaina's tower was heavily warded in magic and as such drawing the mana bomb to it would localize the mana bomb explosion. Believing that Jaina was the future of the Kirin Tor, he brought her into her tower and redirected Jaina's portal that she opened. When Jaina realized exactly what Rhonin was doing, she tried to stop him by pointing out that he had a family and was the leader of the Kirin Tor. Knowing that localizing the mana bomb explosion would ensure his beloved would be safe from the blast, Rhonin bluntly told Jaina that she was the future of the Kirin Tor and then pushed her through the portal when the bomb was dropped. Just before the portal closed, Jaina caught a glimpse of Rhonin, his arms raised with a determined expression on his face, exploding in a cloud of lavender ash as the mana bomb detonated in front of him. His last thoughts were to save his wife and everyone around him.\nA memorial service was later held for him in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, attended by his family and nearly every member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. His eulogy was given by Jaina, who had accepted the position as leader of the Kirin Tor. His wife was eager to avenge him.\nWar Crimes.\nVereesa was left devastated and heartbroken after her husband's death, leaving her twin sons in Dalaran most of the time. She all but broke down and cried when she was forced to witness Rhonin's death and his selfless sacrifice to protect her. Overwhelmed with anger and grief, avenging her husband became her main motivation to plot for Garrosh's death until she was reminded of her children and how they had already lost one parent. She was convinced that they would not lose another.\nLegion.\nIn remembrance to Rhonin, Dalaran has erected a statue of him at the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhonin makes a cameo appearance in a flashback to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, riding &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA vision of Rhonin briefly appears in Jaina's memories during her ordeal in &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, berating her for allowing her \"personal biases\" taint the Kirin Tor, and calling himself a fool to think she could be their leader.\nDragonflight.\n&lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin's former apprentice, led the &lt;a href=\"Sullied%20Banner\"&gt;Sullied Banner&lt;/a&gt; after the death of the archmage, as she was mourning his loss and wanted to help her discontent mage colleagues.\nIn the RPG.\nPersonality.\nRhonin is a studious type who knows a little bit about a great many things but generally keeps his knowledge to himself. He is very young, but his youth disguises a spellcaster of great power and flexibility. He is reckless and hot-headed and is known frequently not to look before he leaps, a character flaw he recognizes in himself and yet is hard-pressed to keep under control. He also has a great sense of humor and is used to seeing huge dragons (such as Alexstrasza and Dargonax).\nCombat.\nAs a quick study of his spell selection will indicate, Rhonin prefers to use his sorcerer abilities for versatility in combat while his wizard spells are usually left to more mundane tasks. He generally starts off a fight with the most powerful spells at his disposal, working his way down to employing searing arrows in concert with his crossbow once all his other combat spells are exhausted.\nIn Hearthstone.\nRhonin appears as for the mage class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"A masterless shamurai.\", referencing the fact that the name \"Rhonin\" sounds similar to , a term used to describe a samurai with no lord or master in feudal Japan.\nThe , a rare card in the \"\" expansion, appears to be a depiction of Rhonin's statue in the &lt;a href=\"Eventide\"&gt;Eventide&lt;/a&gt;."}

Knaak is the author of several \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" books, and has also written for &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard's&lt;/a&gt; other franchises, \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInvolvement.\nKnaak was approached by Blizzard because of his work for \"Dragonlance\". Some of the heads of Blizzard had grown up on his \"Dragonlance\" works and asked him to write for both Warcraft and \"Diablo\". Knaak accepted because it allowed him to write for both of the kinds of fantasy that he liked: \"Lord of the Rings\"-type fantasy (Warcraft) and dark fantasy (\"Diablo\"). He familiarized himself with Warcraft by playing \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" quite a bit. He also played \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" a little bit, but used a lot of background material and screen shots for inspiration. Knaak communicates regularly with Blizzard's lore department to make sure that the facts presented in his works are consistent.\nKnaak was heavily involved in the draconic mythos. The characters of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining dragon &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s (both Alexstrasza and Deathwing were in the mythos previously), were introduced in \"Day of the Dragon\", which set the stage for many of the new developments in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\". The characters remain vital to lore today.\nUntil recently, most characters introduced in Knaak's books were not physically present in games. The minor character of &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt; was introduced with the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; were introduced with &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; were added in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4.0\"&gt;patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera and Nozdormu both make small cameos in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; act as &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt;s in Wrath of the Lich King in a storyline centered around Malygos.\nTrivia.\nKnaak's favorite classes are &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s.

If a ride point is available a green will appear above its head, and the ride beast will appear as a on your &lt;a href=\"mini-map\"&gt;mini-map&lt;/a&gt;. Once you learn a ride path, it will be offered as route by the ride beast. If you've learned all consecutive ride paths in between, you can choose a far-off destination in the ride map window and you'll automatically ride there -- the routes will be chained together."}

{"id": "55194", "revid": "49848256", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55194", "title": "Burst damage", "text": "Burst damage is a term used to describe dealing high amounts of damage in a very short period of time. Spells which qualify for burst damage are often &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; inefficient. Burst damage may refer to a short period of focused damage dealing, or simply a quick flurry of powerful attacks. Burst damage may also refer to some &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; encounters in which a boss will inflict a lot of damage in a short time. \nBurst damage can be achieved in a number of ways: using powerful but inefficient spells or abilities rather than a more sustainable rotation to maximise damage output; blowing powerful &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s to increase damage dealt for a short period; or using &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;s, stacks of &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s and secondary &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;s to provide substantial temporary bonuses to damage dealt. Numerous abilities have synergies rewarding their use in combination with other attacks, making them perfect for dealing quick bursts of damage.\nMaximum burst damage output is often achieved by combining all possible sources of burst, such as by using several damage-enhancing cooldowns all at once. Combined, these effects often produce a remarkable - if temporary - increase in damage output. However, focusing on burst damage can cause players to run out of resources such as mana much faster, or leave them without cooldowns to fall back on if things turn sour.\nIn PvE, dealing burst damage has a chance of drawing &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;, making it inefficient and even dangerous as a means of beating bosses in most cases. However, in some encounters, burst damage is necessary. Burst damage can be very useful when a boss will soon &lt;a href=\"enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt;, or when an add must be quickly destroyed.\nCorrectly managing burst damage is one of the most powerful techniques in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. It usually aims to bring an enemy down fast, giving enemy healers as little chance as possible to heal the damage inflicted. When several players focus their burst damage on a single target, the combined onslaught can be extremely difficult to survive. Players often seek to counter cooldown-enhanced burst damage through using &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; to suspend the player from play while their cooldowns expire. Periods of burst damage are particularly effective when healers are temporarily incapacitated. Focused application of burst damage often forces players to employ defensive and/or evasive cooldowns to survive.\nDealing quick spikes of burst damage is a potent ability in PvP, due to the potential to surprise and overwhelm players. Slow and predictable damage is relatively easy for players to manage, predict and respond to, while unpredictable burst damage is capable of swiftly overwhelming opponents, and is far harder for healers to anticipate and react to in sufficient time. Players can also be easily panicked by spikes of damage, leading them to waste powerful cooldowns. This type of burst damage is of minimal benefit in PvE.\nAbilities that can be used to do burst damage normally cause an unusually high DPS (for example, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt; and most instant cast &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Damage\"&gt;direct damage&lt;/a&gt; spells) or extraordinarly high damage (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Fire\"&gt;Soul Fire&lt;/a&gt;). Talents that allow burst damage often increase the damage caused (&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arcane Power (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;) or give the opportunity to cast a spell instantly (&lt;a href=\"Presence%20of%20Mind\"&gt;Presence of Mind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Swiftness\"&gt;Nature's Swiftness&lt;/a&gt;). Burst damage is primarily dealt through direct damage abilities, although it can also be achieved through a combination of &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; and direct damage effects.\nSpecializations.\nCertain classes and specs are better at burst than others. Some of the best are:"}

The Eggs must be destroyed when he is over them which will cause massive damage to Buru. At 20% he will blow his shell off at which point it becomes a more traditional fight, in which fast DPS is essential.\nThings to know before the fight.\nThis boss looks like a giant tick... He cannot be tanked during stage 1.\nOne thing that's extremely useful against this boss is Greater Nature Protection Potions. Pass them out to all raid members and wait for phase 2 before consuming.\nThis fight requires the raid to be divided into two groups. One to kill the broodlings, and one to kill the eggs.\nMake sure everyone in the raid gets a feel for where the deep water starts and ends before the fight begins (you can swim to up to any side of it without drawing the aggro of Buru). If someone tries to swim through it while they are bring targeted, there is a good chance Buru will catch up to them. As horde (or alliance with a draenei shaman), this can be easily avoided by having the shaman bring plenty of fish oil for this fight. Simply have them cast water walking on whoever is being targeted and kiting becomes very easy.\nPhase 1.\nWhen the fight begins, Buru will start following a random person. The key here is to pull him near an egg and then destroy it while he's on top of it. Each time an egg is destroyed it will do a lot of damage to Buru (assuming he is on top of it) and an add will spawn. He will also start following someone else. You can tell who he's following by reading your chat. This will continue until he is at 20% at which point he goes into phase 2. During phase 1 when the raid is DPSing down eggs, have a Paladin Judge Wisdom on another egg and keep it up for casters to wand in case they are low on mana. Traditionally once one egg is down, whichever egg had wisdom on it would be the next egg to target. Use raid symbols to tell people which egg to wand or light DPS for mana.\nStrategy 1: Always focus on taking two eggs at a time. Also, make sure you have a group taking out the elites that spawn from the eggs. If they build up on you they will more than likely kill your raid.\nStrategy 2: I would suggest players to use their Revered-boots from Arathi Basin Battlegrounds for this event. The Boots allow you to run a bit faster than normal. Start running up the ramp while Buru chases you. Try to reach the top, of the ramp, then jump down. Healers need to keep healing the player after they jump down. In the meantime, players need to cause damage to the six eggs of Buru\u2014but DO NOT destroy them. Once the eggs have 5% hit points, spam on Raid chat \"BRING HIM\", to alert the runner to bring Buru and make him walk on top of the eggs. (Edit: Buru often evades when jumping down from off the hill, I really wouldn't recommend this tactic as he gained full health twice from doing this.)\nStrategy 3: When the raid is ready to begin everyone should start damaging the egg closest to the raid. Get the egg to 5% and wait till Buru is directly over the egg. Then destroy the egg, this will damage him. The most difficult part of phase 1 is coordinating the kiting and the egg bursting. Have the next egg in rotation marked, and previously reduced to 5%, with a dps class standing by to burst it as soon as Buru passes on top of it. If getting the egg to 0% takes too long, Buru's target will likely be killed while waiting for the burst. If you are an organized guild with a voice protocol system, this is most likely the best choice.\nThe easiest way to make sure everyone knows which egg is next, is to go round in a counter-clockwise direction. You start on the South egg, then go Southeast, Northeast, North, Northwest, Southwest, South again. Do this, with each egg hitting Buru correctly, and you will finish up with the South egg being the one that starts Phase 2. Then you can fight on the land, and everyone will know to be there.\nStrategy 4: An emote will say \"...and put his eyes on X\", and he will chase down that person (X). The person being chased needs to kite him around the area by running on land as much as possible and not in the water. Keep kiting him till the raid has the next egg ready to be destroyed. Healers must heal the kiting player during the kiting. When an egg is destroyed a broodling will usually pop out. Again, half the raid should focus on killing the broodlings, until they are dead, then assist in killing the eggs. When one egg is destroyed (again only when Buru is over the egg), the group killing the eggs needs to move to the next egg in a counter-clockwise fashion. This will continue till he reaches 20% where his shell will explode off exposing his brains.\nFor any of the strategies, the priests should come prepared with feathers for levitating. While the watched person kites Buru around the edge of the water, the priests can levitate in the middle of the deep water avoiding the adds and be in range of the kiter with a few steps in any direction.\nPhase 2.\nPhase 2 starts around 20%, Buru will start shaking and his shell will burst off. He now will do a debuff to everyone which does massive damage. You have more or less 30 seconds to kill him or it will be a wipe. At this point, he hits for far less damage (750 to cloth) and lacks the Dismember bleed effect. He also has a standard aggro list (although Phase 2 is an aggro wipe,) however, it is not advisable you try to tank him.\nStrategy 1: Before entering phase 2, make sure the boss has about 21% health before breaking the last egg, so the shield will go off at about 15%. The best way to do this is to put damage over time spells on Buru, and then time it. If you have any kind of Nature Protection Potion, now would be the time to use it. Elites will spawn so make sure you keep them feared while you're going all out DPS on Buru. Everyone needs to jump in and just plow on damage after damage. The faster you get him down the easier it is on the raid.\nStrategy 2: If you are having trouble downing him during phase 2, put your highest DPSers in a group with a priest and have the priest spam Prayer of Healing. You can't do this indefinitely, as the poison debuff increases exponentially, but having 4 DPSers up for 10-20 more seconds can make the difference between wiping and killing Buru. Also, Curse of Doom applied at 25%, about 40 seconds before the start of Phase 2, will help immensely.\nStrategy 3: Phase 2, fear the adds, DPS like mad, and healers keep the mages/hunters up.\nStrategy 4: In phase 2 he will do a debuff to everyone which does massive damage. All healers must be DPSing as well as much as possible.\nStrategy 5: Treat Buru as a Lava Annihilator. That is, everyone comes into melee range with him. This way, the melee can keep up a consistent DPS as he won't run around constantly. The tanks should wear their DPS gear during this fight, as there is no tanking involved.\nThe key to this part of the fight seems to be having your priests spamming Prayer of Healing in your highest DPS groups, forgetting about actually tanking Buru and just going all out. Don't forget to Sunder him anyway though - 2250 less armour is a huge difference in DPS.\nIdiot's Run.\nThis is a strategy used to get to Buru without completing the Rajaxx event and is named \"Idiot's Run\" after the Doomhammer guild \"Village Idiots\".\nThis strategy consists of a mounted rush through the General's army and straight down the tunnel to Buru, with plate wearers leading the charge.\nThis should not be attempted without warlocks (for summoning and soul stones) and priests (for resurrecting).\nEveryone should charge straight through Rajaxx's army with the plate wearers drawing primary aggro. Everyone needs to keep moving in their wake until everyone dies or is inside Buru's chamber.\nSomeone should stay behind to watch and make sure Rajaxx's army resets.\nWhen it's reset, anyone inside Buru's chamber should pop soulstones, resurrect those around them, and wait. Anyone not in Buru's chamber needs to release and return to the instance, so they can be summoned to Buru.\nThe obvious pro of this is that the Rajaxx event is avoided, however, the con, is that anyone who has to release, must be summoned.\nCataclysm.\nBuru will now be tameable, making him the 2nd boss to be tamed, the first being the gigantic dragon &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt;. When tamed, the Gorger will be a Silithid.\nKnown Bugs.\nBug 1:\nWhen caught on the hill at the bottom of his arena, he will bug out. at this point, whoever he is targeting will be teleported to him, unless nobody is attacking. He will reset, and start the aggro himself.\nBug 2:\nHe sometimes switches targets without notification. This may cause a raid to wipe.\nThis bug can be \"repaired\" by dragging him over an egg, and destroying it. He should give out notifications after that."}

Burx was also secretly a member of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cult, not out of disrespect for his &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; but rather out of an intense hatred for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nBurx grew up a &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;orcish internment&lt;/a&gt;. He was not placed in an &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;, but instead worked at a human &lt;a href=\"estate\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; where his owners continually beat him, taunted him, defecated on him, and then forced him to do even more degrading tasks while laughing at him. This experience made Burx extremely resentful of humanity, to the point that he thought that they were worse than the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s who had brought the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. From his point of view, although the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had used the orcs, they had at least never humiliated them.\nAfter being &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Burx eventually joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, enticed by the demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt;'s promises that the cult would try to kill every human on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, Zmodlor hoped to cause the humans and orcs to exterminate each other and had recruited many humans into another branch of the Blade, making similar promises to them about killing all of the orcs.\nWhen Zmodlor's human puppet, &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;, found himself on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;'s throne following the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; reinforced, even though a buildup of soldiers at Northwatch would be viewed as an act of aggression by the Horde. Thrall was told of the influx of troops at Northwatch, and Burx (on orders from Zmodlor) convinced Thrall to send him to investigate, and to give him command of an army of at least six hundred. Between them, Zmodlor's two dupes succeeded in starting another conflict between orcs and humans, as when Burx arrived at Northwatch he gave the humans an ultimatum: either dismantle the entire keep and vacate the land in \"one hour\", or be slaughtered.\nAn hour later, when Burx's terms had not been met, he gave the order to attack. Fortunately for all concerned, Thrall heard what had happened from Jaina and headed for the scene aboard a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, he immediately stopped the battle and denounced Burx. Burx angrily protested that he was only acting in the Horde's interest. For his treachery, for consorting with a demon, and after he tried to strike down the human commander &lt;a href=\"Davin\"&gt;Davin&lt;/a&gt; with his axe despite the battle being over, Thrall smashed his skull with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; on the spot."}
