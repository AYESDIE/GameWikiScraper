He did so for several years until the friends of Greydon's son, &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; found the cave. Unbeknownst to Aram, he had sketched the same dragon. That is how &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and the others found him. At first, they charged at each other, but Makasa recognized the dragon in Aram's sketchbook and showed it to the dragon, catching his attention. Once he changed to his humanoid form, and mistakenly froze &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; beneath the cave's water, he listened to their story and believed them upon hearing about Greydon. Rescuing the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to leave the cave and join Makasa's group. Immediately, Telagos and the bookish &lt;a href=\"Galena%20Stormspear\"&gt;Galena Stormspear&lt;/a&gt; became good friends.\nLater, after Makasa learned the truth about &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; being her father and ran away from a glade near &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, the group sent Telagos to find her. He located her at the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lakeshire quarry&lt;/a&gt;. She was looking inside because she had found the final crystal shard of the blade. Telagos used his magic to retrieve it from the water.\nWhen the group planned their next steps to free Aramar and Greydon, Telagos offered to guide them to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Where Makasa's group reunited with friends and allies from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, most of who were surprised to see a blue dragon. During the march on the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Telagos, the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and her three cubs, and the fastest &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s went ahead to scout the way to &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and the gnolls fought in the citadel's valley, Telagos waited for Makasa to signal the &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20murlocs\"&gt;Everstill murlocs&lt;/a&gt; to join the fray. When Murky called his brethren, Telagos emerged from behind a bank of clouds, the dragon charged and breathe his frost magic at the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, sealing them off from retreat.\nUpon reaching the top chamber, he and Galena worked together to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s called by &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;. Makasa's friends had been successful and released the Thornes who now fought against Malus. After Malus was killed by Makasa, Greydon noticed his old friend, Telagos, praising him that he was once again helping the Order of the Seven Suns.\nAfterward, they all returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and said goodbye to each other. Telagos and Galena accompanied the Woodpaws and Feral Scars back to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, and then they turned north to the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling with the dragon helped Galena be more confident. In the Moonglade, Telagos spend several days studying the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and the druids studied him.\nAlmost one year later following the battle at the Hidden citadel, the young friends reunited at the &lt;a href=\"Forever%20Tree\"&gt;Forever Tree&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to honor it and the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Makasa told them that there's a surprise for them on a shore south of the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;, so they began their journey there. After a bit, Murky complained of sore feet, so Telagos transported them. On the shore, they found Makasa's new ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;\", and the young travelers boarded it.\nDescription.\nThe dragon has smooth blue wings, shimmering scales, a slender head, two horns curling back from its prominent brow, and white eyes.\nIn his humanoid form, Telagos is a tall and thin man with ash-blond hair and pale eyes. He has a soft, scholarly voice and a scar on his cheek. He wore a suit of trim blue scale mail, cinched at the waist with a belt. Six or so scrolls were tied neatly to his belt."}

Created shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, Teldrassil served as their home and primary base of operations, its thick crown housing the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Other major settlements on the tree included &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dolanaar\"&gt;Dolanaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;. Owing to its size, Teldrassil possessed its own unique ecosystem with a various flora, fauna, and vast twilit forests.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, as a World Tree, Teldrassil was linked to the very health of Azeroth, affecting not merely its immediate surroudings, but those lands beyond the island, and a Teldrassil that was not well could not properly maintain the balance between nature and decay. The new tree was not blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s at its birth, unlike its predecessor &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, which would ultimately leave it vulnerable to corruption from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. However, just before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it would receive the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. All known lingering corruption was finally purged during the Cataclysm.\nTeldrassil served as the largest bastion of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; power in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and maintained naval connections to the mainland, the nearby &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and the distant &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Many young and ambitious night elves began their journey out into the world from the verdant shelter of the World Tree. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;\u2014roughly a decade after its creation\u2014Teldrassil was burned down by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, killing many of the night elves dwelling in it.\nHistory.\nBirth.\nAfter the cataclysmic events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; became trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. In Malfurion's absence, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took over leadership of the night elven druids, and convinced the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; that it was time for the night elves to create a new World Tree and regain their immortality.\nThe Circle of the Ancients and the wise &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s led by Fandral combined their powers to grow an immense tree in the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt;. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning \"crown of the earth\" in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves made their new home of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time. However, the tree did not restore the night elves' immortality; &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, whose blessing on &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; had been the source of their immortality, saw the night elves' wish as arrogant and refused to bless Teldrassil.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nOver time, the land atop Teldrassil fell into the shadow of a sinister presence. Local creatures such as &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt; went mad, and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s appeared, intent on further corrupting the land. &lt;a href=\"Giant%20turtle\"&gt;Giant turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"thresher\"&gt;thresher&lt;/a&gt;s known to inhabit the waters surrounding Teldrassil began fleeing the tree to beach themselves and die on &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. The source of this corruption remained a mystery for some time until the conflict of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; spilled into the waking world.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Teldrassil was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nAfter Malfurion was freed from the Emerald Nightmare, he flew to Darnassus, and discovered that a remnant of a great evil had been grafted into Teldrassil by Fandral. By grafting &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-tainted branch into Teldrassil, Fandral had given Xavius, as well as the evil behind his transformation into the Nightmare Lord, a tie to both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion managed to remove the corrupt branch and eventually restore the tree to a state closer to what it originally should have been. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, impressed that the tree could prosper alone without her influence or her kin's, blessed it belatedly. She later blessed it again, along with &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; this time, during the wedding of Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a blessing which protected Teldrassil to its final day. The tree flourished even more under the gifts from the Life-Binder and the Dreamer, though it still cannot return the night elves' immortality without a blessing from &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the worgen arrived to the cleansed Teldrassil. When Malfurion Stormrage checked the heart of the World Tree, there was no apparent corruption. The archdruid, however, remained vigilant as he knew that pockets of the taint remained in the Emerald Dream, so Teldrassil was still vulnerable.\nSome time later, Teldrassil's recovery slowed, and signs of the Nightmare's corruption resurfaced. Though already burdened by political tension and the vast destruction unleashed by the Cataclysm, the night elves worked to find the cause of their World Tree's ailment. They discovered that this was no new corruption, but lingering remnants of the original corruption, being pushed out by Teldrassil itself. With the corruption having been buried deep within Teldrassil, it would have been impossible to strike at the source without killing the world tree itself, but the Aspects' blessing allowed Teldrassil to force the taint to the surface in a form that the night elves could destroy. The &lt;a href=\"Bough%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Bough of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; was the one last remnant of &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; on Teldrassil, and was the source of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Moss\"&gt;Fel Moss&lt;/a&gt; that tainted the &lt;a href=\"gnarlpine\"&gt;gnarlpine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"timberling\"&gt;timberling&lt;/a&gt;s, and other creatures.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of night elves were fleeing toward Darnassus from other parts of Teldrassil.\nTeldrassil was &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;burned down&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde used &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;-enhanced payload, while the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; in Darkshore conjured winds to amplify the flames. It was the largest fire Azeroth had ever seen. Many survivors escaped to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; via portals, where they settled in the area around &lt;a href=\"Olivia%27s%20Pond\"&gt;Olivia's Pond&lt;/a&gt;, with injured refugees in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and other small groups scattered throughout the city. Other survivors sailed to the beaches east of the besieged &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. From there, preparations were made to evacuate them to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; while other night elves stayed in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to continue fighting the Horde.\nDuring a meeting with Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; vowed to recover Teldrassil, but was apparently unable to directly assist the night elves for the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, as the Alliance could not spare soldiers to help retake what remained of Teldrassil.\n&lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; is present at &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, and is able to send players back in time to see the region along with Teldrassil before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven after the Fourth War, the husk of the tree still smoldered from the fire.\nGeography.\nThe majority of Teldrassil's upper reaches resembles a mid-sized forested island. &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; occupies a large chunk on the western side of this tree-island, while the towns of &lt;a href=\"Aldrassil\"&gt;Aldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dolanaar\"&gt;Dolanaar&lt;/a&gt; dot the remaining forest. All forms of terrain exist here, including streams, lakes, hills, and mountains. The waterways were created and continue to be fed by the dew collected by the massive World Tree, and the night elves manipulated the waterways around Darnassus to maintain the splendor of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Gardens\"&gt;Temple Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entire &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; of Teldrassil is, in fact, one huge tree, grown on an island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As such, there are no &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; deposits here and the night elves are not known as crafty &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s. However, because the tree is so full of life, &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s are numerous.\nTeldrassil contains no &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raid%20dungeon\"&gt;raid dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"micro%20dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. It is the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and contains a very sheltered 1-5 leveling area, &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in this zone, though the travel hub is actually located at &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; (accessible by portal from Darnassus).\nAt the tree's base, there are some pieces of wooded land between its roots, one of which has an abandoned furbolg house on it, as well as &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Teldrassil is only the size of a mid-sized island in width, its sheer height dwarfs many other islands.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamona.de/worldmap2/map_teldrassil.html\"&gt;A detailed area map (lists all creatures).&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D26\"&gt;A topographic map of Teldrassil.&lt;/a&gt;\nTravel hubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; is connected to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;. Players can also reach Rut'theran Village by &lt;a href=\"Transportation%23Boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is also the only way for Horde players below level 60 to get to the island by themselves. One can attempt swimming from Darkshore using &lt;a href=\"Swim%20Speed%20Potion\"&gt;Swim Speed Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and health potions, but this is not recommended.\nNotable characters.\nTeldrassil is home to several night elves of status. From the top of the tree &lt;a href=\"Aldrassil\"&gt;Aldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenaron%20Stormgrip\"&gt;Tenaron Stormgrip&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young elves out into the outside world. In &lt;a href=\"Dolanaar\"&gt;Dolanaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tallonkai%20Swiftroot\"&gt;Tallonkai Swiftroot&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to fight back the corrupted furbolgs and satyr of the Great Tree, while in his small tent near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Al%27Ameth\"&gt;Lake Al'Ameth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denalan\"&gt;Denalan&lt;/a&gt; seeks to understand the nature of the strange affliction seeping into Teldrassil.\nQuests.\nChapter 1: Shadowglen.\nThe night elf hero began their quest in &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;. The instructor &lt;a href=\"Ilthalaine\"&gt;Ilthalaine&lt;/a&gt; introduced himself and impressed upon the hero the importance of balance in nature. The spring rains led to an overpopulation of nightsabers in the surrounding area and Ilthalaine politely asked the hero to cull them a bit. Upon returning, the hero overheard Ilthalaine telling &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Sandrya%20Moonfall\"&gt;Huntress Sandrya Moonfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dentaria%20Silverglade\"&gt;Dentaria Silverglade&lt;/a&gt; that there were no new recruits ready yet. Without giving more details, Sandrya warned him that they were running out of time\u2014a battle was fast approaching the roots of Teldrassil. Dentaria left Ilthalaine to his work and turned to the hero, telling them that their help in battle would be needed soon. Ilthalaine then sent the hero to collect fel moss from &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt;kin nearby, concerned that there is still lingering corruption within Teldrassil. The hero's return with the fel moss confirmed Ilthalaine's fears\u2014there was still corruption within Teldrassil. Ilthalaine concluded that the hero was now ready to join the fight and sent them to their class trainer for further instruction.\nAfter learning a few new abilities, the hero's trainer directed them to assist Dentaria Silverglade to the north of &lt;a href=\"Aldrassil\"&gt;Aldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Dentaria was pleased to see the new hero had progressed so quickly through their training and was ready to get to work.\nDentaria asked the hero to gather rare flowers to help her cure their friend &lt;a href=\"Iverron\"&gt;Iverron&lt;/a&gt; from the venom of the webwood spiders. While Iverron recuperated, Dentaria asked the hero to make contact with the dryad &lt;a href=\"Tarindrella\"&gt;Tarindrella&lt;/a&gt; north of Aldrassil to investigate the spider threat. Tarindrella confirmed that the spiders still suffered from corruption\u2014and further, were more susceptible to it than other wildlife on Teldrassil. She and the hero slew a great many of them and in doing this they discovered that the corruption was not the result of mind control or some other effect\u2014it was due to the corruption of their broodmother &lt;a href=\"Githyiss%20the%20Vile\"&gt;Githyiss the Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Upon killing Githyiss, they discovered a furbolg totem\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Gnarlpine\"&gt;Gnarlpine&lt;/a&gt; had installed a totem to corrupt the broodmother and her offspring that they would attack the nearby night elf settlements. Tarindrella brought the hero back to Dentaria to complete their training and departed to further investigate the source of the Gnarlpine corruption.\nDentaria sent the hero on a final mission to complete their training\u2014learning some of the recent events in night elves' history. A ritual at the nearby moonwell helped the hero recall the recent events confronting their people\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in which the Burning Legion was defeated but night elves lost their immortality, the release of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from his prison and the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual complete, Dentaria sent the hero to &lt;a href=\"Tenaron%20Stormgrip\"&gt;Tenaron Stormgrip&lt;/a&gt; with a vial of the waters of the moonwell\u2014evidence that their training was completed. Tenaron agreed it was time for the hero to move on from basic training and begin addressing the issues of their people. Tenaron sent the hero on to &lt;a href=\"Corithras%20Moonrage\"&gt;Corithras Moonrage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dolanaar\"&gt;Dolanaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 2: Council of the Forest.\nOn the way to Dolanaar, the hero met the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zenn%20Foulhoof\"&gt;Zenn Foulhoof&lt;/a&gt; who promised them \"things you never dreamed of having\" in return to a variety of \"reagents\" culled from the corpses of forest dwellers. When the hero returned with the items, Zenn revealed that they had been tricked and thanked the hero for being so gullible.\nUpon arriving in Dolanaar, the hero was admonished by &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Kyra%20Starsong\"&gt;Sentinel Kyra Starsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syral%20Bladeleaf\"&gt;Syral Bladeleaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Shayla%20Nightbreeze\"&gt;Sentinel Shayla Nightbreeze&lt;/a&gt; who told them that their actions aiding Foulhoof had offended the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Council of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; and demanded that the hero acquire some corrupted seeds to play a trick on Foulhoof to be redeemed. The hero collected the seeds and Zenn gobbled them up without hesitation. The ruse worked, and within moments Zenn was turned into a frog.\nThe success of the trick redeemed the hero in the eyes of the Council, which then asked the hero to attack &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Rock\"&gt;Fel Rock&lt;/a&gt; which had been taken over by a small army of corrupted grellkin. Syral Bladeleaf asked the hero to purge the army while &lt;a href=\"Tallonkai%20Swiftroot\"&gt;Tallonkai Swiftroot&lt;/a&gt; had a more specific target in mind\u2014the satyr &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Melenas\"&gt;Lord Melenas&lt;/a&gt; who had marshalled them together. When the hero returned with Melenas' head the Council's agents thanked them and returned to their normal duties.\nSidestory: Reminders of Home.\nWhile in Dolanaar, a cooking supplies vendor &lt;a href=\"Nyoma\"&gt;Nyoma&lt;/a&gt; asked the hero to bring a recipe book to her friend &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Aquinne\"&gt;Sister Aquinne&lt;/a&gt;, who is studying to become a &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Nyoma told the hero the easiest route to the capital would be to fly by &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; which they could arrange via the local &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fidelio\"&gt;Fidelio&lt;/a&gt;. Fidelio told the hero that everyone in Dolanaar is so proud of Aquinne's devotion to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and gives the hero a suggestion of where they might find her in the city before sending the hero on their way. When the hero delivered the book Aquinne was ecstatic and promised to use it that very evening. Aquinne wrote a thank-you note and asked the hero to deliver it back to Nyoma. &lt;a href=\"Leora\"&gt;Leora&lt;/a&gt;, the flight master in Darnassus, explained to the hero the importance of meeting the flight master whenever they reach a new place so that they might arrange easy travel back there in the future. The hero then delivered the letter to Nyoma, who thanked the hero and lamented she hasn't had the opportunity yet to visit Aquinne in person yet.\nChapter 3: Starbreeze Village.\n&lt;a href=\"Athridas%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Athridas Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; in Dolanaar informed the hero of a troubling development. The warden of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ban%27ethil%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Ban'ethil Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;--&lt;a href=\"Gaerolas%20Talvethren\"&gt;Gaerolas Talvethren&lt;/a&gt;\u2014has not reported to him recently. Athridas asked the hero to investigate. Before the hero departed, Tallonkai asked the hero for another favor. He explained that he used to live in Starbreeze and when he left because of the increasing Gnarlpine activity, he left behind a good-luck charm, an emerald dreamcatcher which he had received from Gaerolas. The hero agreed to retrieve the amulet.\nThe hero arrived in Starbreeze to find the village ransacked by the Gnarlpine. Gaerolas was found mortally wounded by the furbolgs and pleaded with the hero to notify Athridas before the furbolgs could reach the barrow den as he would be unable to make it back. He identified their leader: &lt;a href=\"Ursal%20the%20Mauler\"&gt;Ursal the Mauler&lt;/a&gt;. The hero returned to Dolanaar after retrieving the Tallonkai's amulet and delivered the disturbing news to Athridas.\nWhen the hero presented the amulet to him, Tallonkai noticed immediately it was missing its emerald. He surmises that the Gnarlpine mystic &lt;a href=\"Ferocitas%20the%20Dream%20Eater\"&gt;Ferocitas the Dream Eater&lt;/a&gt; must have it, and asks the hero to slay the furbolg to retrieve the gem on their next trip to Starbreeze. The hero agreed and returned with the gem.\nAthridas warned the hero that the druids sleeping in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den would be forever trapped in the Emerald Dream if their physical bodies were to be killed while they are asleep. The hero set out to retrieve the tools necessary to peacefully break wake them so that they could flee safely. While collecting the items from the Barrow Den, the hero was attacked by the body of &lt;a href=\"Oben%20Rageclaw\"&gt;Oben Rageclaw&lt;/a&gt;, which the Gnarlpine had found a way to animate and use to attack intruders. The hero assisted Oben's spirit in determining how the Gnarlpine had done this and ultimately at Oben's request the hero slew his physical body.\nWhen the hero returned to Athridas with the items, Athridas sent them to kill Ursal, the last remaining obstacle to saving the druids. With Ursal dead, Athridas was able to complete the ritual and the druids escaped safely.\nChapter 4: Lake Al'Ameth.\nSyral Bladeleaf notified the hero that package had arrived for &lt;a href=\"Denalan\"&gt;Denalan&lt;/a&gt;, an herbalist with a camp near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Al%27Ameth\"&gt;Lake Al'Ameth&lt;/a&gt; to the south and asked them to deliver it. Denalan thanked the hero for the package and asked for the hero's help investigating why the &lt;a href=\"timberling\"&gt;timberling&lt;/a&gt;s were becoming so violent when the healing of the world tree should have pacified them. The champion set out to collect timberling seeds and sprouts for Denalan's experiment to find the cause.\nDenalan asked the hero to bring one of the specimens to his colleague &lt;a href=\"Rellian%20Greenspyre\"&gt;Rellian Greenspyre&lt;/a&gt; to help the druid with his own efforts to purge the timberlings' corruption. Rellian thanked the hero for the seed but lamented that it was likely beyond his skill. The timberlings near &lt;a href=\"Wellspring%20Lake\"&gt;Wellspring Lake&lt;/a&gt; to the north were the most corrupted in particular, and Rellian sent the hero to slay them and collect their mossy tumors so that they may be burned. Denalan suddenly arrived with important news: he had discovered that the corruption stemmed from &lt;a href=\"Oakenscowl\"&gt;Oakenscowl&lt;/a&gt;, a large timberling who had the largest tumor of all. The hero slew Oakenscowl and returned the gargantuan tumor to Denalan and Rellian for study.\nChapter 5: The Vengeance of Elune.\nCorithas Moonrage, after observing the hero's growing power and understanding, instructed the hero to visit the moonwell under the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Tree\"&gt;Oracle Tree&lt;/a&gt; for another vision. At the moonwell, the hero learned of Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the most powerful druid in Azeroth after Malfurion and the reverence he is due in spite of his conflicts with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. After viewing this, Corithas sent the hero to a final moonwell to rendevous with Tarindrella for another attack against the corruption of Teldrassil. On approaching the moonwell, the hero saw a final vision about the most recent events\u2014Archdruid Staghelm and his closest followers have left the Night Elf society without a word, but Malfurion has awoken from the Emerald Dream and reunited with Tyrande. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; have finally provided their blessings to Teldrassil, allowing the tree to begin to grow properly. Hope for a better future dawns anew for the Kaldorei.\nAfter the vision, Tarindrella informed the hero that she has located the source of the corruption near the tree's edge. She provided the hero with a blessing using the collected power of the moonwells that allowed the hero to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Bough%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Bough of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;. With the source of the corruption destroyed, Tarindrella sent the hero to return it to Corithas, who in turn directed the hero to bring it to Tyrande. Tyrande explained that the disappearance of Staghelm is worrisome but Malfurion's return has given her hope in spite of the dark days ahead.\nIn Cataclysm.\nRut'theran Village has been ripped from the side of the tree and is now an island.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt; implemented, it is now trivial for any level 60 Horde and up to bypass both Rut'theran Village and Darnassus by flying up the side of Teldrassil. It is also possible to use a flying mount with &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Expert Riding&lt;/a&gt; to fly across the &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;deep water&lt;/a&gt; separating Rut'theran Village and the mainland of Darkshore.\nAreas affected:\nKalidar.\nKalidar was the name &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; had originally used on their preview website as well as on several concept maps and in the \"World of Warcraft DVD\" for the island off the northwestern coast of Kalimdor where Teldrassil was grown. The night elves moved their capital to this island. The &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the wise druids pooled their power to create a &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; which eventually outgrew the island and the night elves built the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; atop it. The island now takes the name of the tree as well, and a twilit forest covers it.\nKalidar was also referenced in quests, such as an unused quest from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Shayla%20Nightbreeze\"&gt;Shayla Nightbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and an earlier version of &lt;a href=\"The%20Woodland%20Protector%20%282%29\"&gt;The Woodland Protector (2)&lt;/a&gt;. Further, most of the objects seen on Teldrassil (trees, bridges, etc) are labeled as \"kalidar\" in the game files.\nOfficial website.\nTaken directly from the official site:\n\"Kalidar, the new home of the reclusive &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; and a stunning testament to the power of their magic and their connection with nature. After the cataclysmic events that followed the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and powerful &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s combined their powers to grow an immense new world tree on Kalidar. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning \"crown of the earth\" in their native tongue. The night elves made their new home in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time. However, the calm of the enchanted forest has slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Crazed &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and fouler beasts have appeared in Kalidar, and it occupies all the attention of the vigilant &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the wise druids to ensure the safety of their new home.\"\n\"A sprawling city of moonstone and wood, the night elf capital of Darnassus stands as a shining beacon atop Kalidar. Within its mighty walls are housed countless druids, hunters, and warriors, led by the priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. A stunning marvel to the ability of night elven craftsmen, the ethereal &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; rises above the tree line, balanced by the druids' meticulously cultivated meditative grove. Trade from the main continent bustles through the city's trade quarter, where night elves, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s alike haggle for wares and services. Delicate bridges and pathways crisscross the serene waterways of the city, the pristine waters reflecting the glowing light from the moons above.\"\nIn the RPG.\nTeldrassil, meaning \"Crown of the Earth\", is the massive second &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. It is a marvel and unlike any location you could have ever visited. Within the massive tree's branches are entire cities of elves \u2014 and the homes of less friendly creatures as well. Located on an island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Teldrassil is isolated from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and generally is a safer and more tranquil place. It is best known for being the location of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the cultural center of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; race and one of the most impressive cities in the known world.\nThings are a bit wilder outside Darnassus' gates, but there are several other friendly villages as well. Small communities of night elves thrive, and one can find a few camps of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; as well. These last two groups are uncorrupted, but can nevertheless be dangerous.\nThe island takes the name of the tree as well, and a twilit forest now covers it.\nHistory.\nEven though &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; was healing, it would take another century or two for the World Tree to regain its former glory and power. Unreconciled with their loss of immortality, a splinter group of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; were planning to create a second World Tree.\n&lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; entered a deep coma, and sleeps in his base at &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. No one knows why, and no one knows how to wake him. His absence leaves control of the druids to &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who has become the new &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;. Before his coma, Malfurion opposed Fandral's plan to grow a new World Tree. After Malfurion fell into his coma, Fandral met with the other druids and, without Malfurion to argue against him, convinced them of the wisdom of creating a new World Tree, and them, most believing that Fandral was right about the tree, created Teldrassil, and erected a new capital in its branches. Despite a widespread distrust of Teldrassil and Fandral, the city of Darnassus remains the focal point of night elf culture and life.\nRealizing they needed help to survive in this new world and to oppose the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which chose their continent as its new home, the night elves reluctantly joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Commerce began between &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves, as the two cultures shared values and ideas. The night elves remained withdrawn, however. There are still many places considered too sacred for dwarves or humans to venture into, and only when they\u2019re drunk do they really loosen up around other Alliance races.\nIn Darnassus the atmosphere is a bit strange; there's a mix between carefree, joyful elves and grim citizens with suspicions similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. The druids and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; here are keenly aware that the tree is being corrupted, and both sides try their best to combat the effects with minimal success. More interestingly \u2014 and perhaps more dangerously \u2014 the druids and the priests are beginning to blame each other for the mess.\nA few of the non-elves here (a few &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and two &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Explorer's Guild&lt;/a&gt;) can give you an outsider's perspective, and you can get a pretty blunt summary: Archdruid Fandral Staghelm hates &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s guts. At least, things certainly seem that way. The archdruid questions High Priestess Whisperwind's leadership abilities, and that causes strife in the community. Tyrande was the companion to Malfurion Stormrage, the greatest of all druids, and many elves see the rift between their orders as both shocking and appalling. The situation hasn't reached the point where people choose sides, but things could get there, and that could turn real ugly real fast. The dwarves there suggest someone needs to wake up Malfurion before circumstances get messy. With an unstable political climate and the growing corruption of the World Tree, danger lurks within Teldrassil.\nThe World Tree's decay begins to accelerate, and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; is unable to find the source. Rather than continue to explore the slow destruction of the tree, the druids finally agreed with the priests of Elune that they need outside help. They sent champions to find the only beings who may be able to save the World Tree \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. If the champions could gain the blessing of even a single Aspect, the corruption could halt for a time \u2014 perhaps forever. With the blessing of more than one Aspect it could reverse the damage that had already been caused.\nGeography.\nThe majority of Teldrassil's upper reaches is open forest, and it resembles a mid-sized forested island. Darnassus takes up a large chunk on the western side of this island, and smaller cities dot the remaining forest. All forms of terrain exist here, including streams, full-sized lakes, and a few hills that non-dwarves might consider mountains.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "663610", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=663610", "title": "Teldrassil (Classic)", "text": "Off &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s northern coast lies the island, and &lt;a href=\"great%20tree\"&gt;great tree&lt;/a&gt; of the same name, Teldrassil, the new home of the reclusive &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and a stunning testament to the power of their magic and their connection with nature. \nIn recent times, the night elves have moved their &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; to an island off northwest Kalimdor. It was here that the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the wise &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s pooled their power to create another &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, but on a smaller scale. They called this tree Teldrassil (\u201ccrown of the earth\u201d) and built their city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; atop it. The island takes the name of the \"tree\" as well, and a twilit forest now covers it.\nTeldrassil is truly massive, a huge trunk rising out of the sea and holding the entire night elf homeland, and the capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, in its boughs. The enterprise was not blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, however, and the tree's growth has been flawed. Regardless, the behemoth of a tree dwarfs &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, even large enough that a decently large amount of land has emerged atop its gargantuan limbs. Trees, flora, and fauna are now verdantly spreading across the magical tree.\nTeldrassil sees very little &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; action due to the fact that &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players have to cross through Darnassus. The only way for Horde players to get to Teldrassil itself is via ship from &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; on mainland Kalimdor. Most other &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt;s are directly accessible by the opposing faction without such hazards.\nHistory.\nAfter the cataclysmic events that followed the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; went missing. Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took over the leadership of the night elven druids, convincing the Circle of the Ancients in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; that it was time for the night elven people to rebuild the World Tree and regain their cherished immortality. However, his plan failed due to the fact that &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the night elves immortality, did not bless the tree.\nThe Circle of the Ancients and powerful druids combined their powers to grow an immense tree in the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt;. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning \"crown of the earth\" in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves made their new home in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time. \nHowever, the calm of the enchanted forest has slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Crazed &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and fouler beasts have appeared in Teldrassil, occupying all the attention of the vigilant &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the wise &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to ensure the safety of their new home.\nGeography.\nThe majority of Teldrassil's upper reaches is open forest and it resembles a mid-sized forested island. Darnassus takes up a large chunk on the western side of this island, while smaller cities dot the remaining forest. All forms of terrain exist here, including streams, full-sized lakes, and a few hills that might be considered mountains.\nThe entire &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; of Teldrassil is in fact one huge tree, grown on an island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As such, there is no &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; to speak of here and the night elves are not known to be &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s. However, because the tree is so full of life, &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s are numerous here.\nTeldrassil contains no &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raid%20dungeon\"&gt;raid dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"micro%20dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. It is the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and contains a very sheltered 1-5 leveling area, &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in this zone, though the travel hub is actually located at &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; (accessible by portal from Darnassus).\nAlthough Teldrassil is only the size of a mid-sized island in width, you must also take into account the sheer size in height that rivals any other island. It has been described as an \"island continent\". Another reference in the book and other sources simply call it an island.\nTravel hubs.\nThough the flight path to Teldrassil is technically in &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, the village is connected to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; and is indeed the only way to get into the rest of the zone. Players can also reach Rut'theran Village by &lt;a href=\"Transportation%23Boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only way for Horde players to get onto the island.\nNotable characters.\nTeldrassil is home to several night elves of status. From the top of the tree &lt;a href=\"Aldrassil\"&gt;Aldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenaron%20Stormgrip\"&gt;Tenaron Stormgrip&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young elves out into the world. In &lt;a href=\"Dolanaar\"&gt;Dolanaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tallonkai%20Swiftroot\"&gt;Tallonkai Swiftroot&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to fight back the corrupted furbolgs and satyr of the Great Tree, while in his small tent near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Al%27Ameth\"&gt;Lake Al'Ameth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denalan\"&gt;Denalan&lt;/a&gt; seeks to understand the nature of the strange affliction that is seeping into Teldrassil.\nQuests.\nOne of the most important quests for new night elf adventurers in Teldrassil is the quest chain. In this chain, night elves are sent to gather &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s scattered all over the island. Each time they return with the moonwell water, they learn a little more of the night elf history. Other important quests include the quest chain, in which adventurers must help investigate a corruption of the &lt;a href=\"timberling\"&gt;timberling&lt;/a&gt;s of Teldrassil, and the chain, which deals with the corruption of the local &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; population."}

Magi use their knowledge of the arcane to bend the fabric of reality to circumvent the distance between two points. Teleportation is an internal effort that transforms the mage into a portal. &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; is the most basic teleportation spell. It is taught by the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, which designates specific destinations for teleportation spells to prevent mages from accidentally teleporting into other objects or people.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, portal and teleport spells are a great privilege and responsibility; however, portals and teleportations are negatively used as a means for garbage repository in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nFor a caster to include anyone but themselves in the teleportation spell required line of sight\u2014at least. However, &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Archmage Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; once told his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; that one could also do it if one was in what he called \"line of mind.\" It required the mage to reach out and touch the thoughts of whomever they wished to teleport. This was a lot riskier, as there were many whose minds were difficult or dangerous to touch. Other mages and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s generally had protections against such things, and even someone particularly strong-willed would probably be able to resist.\nWhen the mage &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; tried to teleport with her sister &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, she was too weak to beat the cursed tower's pull. Consequently, Lieren offered her access to her lifeforce, as she could only use it to power the spell rather than magic. The strain of the teleportation caused her hair to become streaked with white.\nMass Teleport is an extremely powerful spell that allows the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; to teleport himself and his army. However, due to the delicate nature of the spell, archmagi can only teleport to places where someone they know currently is.\nTeleportation can be twisted so that the mage is able to send power to another, just like the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; used to do with their Spearheads.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; invasions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, teleportation spells were temporarily perturbed by emanations from the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; laid. During that time, only the most powerful mages such as &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; used those spells with confidence, for an unwary spellcaster might have otherwise materialized away from their intended target. This didn't stop the expert mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; teleporting to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from their embassy in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;.\nPractitioners.\nA mage specialized in teleportation is called a &lt;a href=\"telemancer\"&gt;telemancer&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; and their telemancers in the Horde greatly improved their teleportation network, as seen in their &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; expedition.\n&lt;a href=\"Warp%20stalker\"&gt;Forest stalkers&lt;/a&gt; were native to many areas of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and following the planet's destruction they became corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into warp stalkers and gained the ability to teleport by phasing in and out of the physical and astral dimensions at will.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; is a skilled &lt;a href=\"transmuter\"&gt;transmuter&lt;/a&gt;, and has developed a powerful variation of the mass-teleport spell capable of moving a significant portion of an army with minimal effort. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt; is a master of portals and teleportation.\n\"Warcraft\" film universe.\nTeleportation is the magical art of near-instantaneously transporting matter from one place to another. The art may be related to &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nTeleportation is not taught by the , possibly due to its inherent danger. Despite this, the is well-versed in its use, presumably having learned the art in the years following his formal training in .\nFunctionality.\nTeleportation appears to require first magically defining the area in which the spell is to take effect. This is achieved through runic markings, typically placed on the ground beneath the target area. The runes can be marked using mundane materials, even charcoal. For smaller areas, powerful mages can create the teleportation circle with a simple wave of their hand.\nOnce the circle is complete, the mage speaks an incantation to start the spell, and gathers the strands of magic in their hand, as if taking the reins of a horse. The magic forms a dome, bubble or sphere over the target area, crackling with the blue-white light of arcane energy.

He first etched runic symbols at each of the four compass points, and drew a circle in the earth with the end of his staff. Gathering the luminous strands in his hand, he delicately drew up the magic until he held it over his head, and then brought his arm down with a swift, precise movement, causing the strands to leap and join into a crackling dome, illuminating the area with a bright blue glow. Once Khadgar and Lothar stepped into the circle, Medivh completed the spell, startling the guards in the Stormwind throne room into which the three suddenly appeared.\nMedivh later used teleportation to send his daughter back to Stormwind, to be with the grieving Lothar following the death of his son &lt;a href=\"Callan%20Lothar\"&gt;Callan&lt;/a&gt;. He created the circle with an effortless movement of his hands, perhaps due to his recent bathing in Karazhan's magical font. Once Garona stepped into the circle, the spell activated itself without command, although this may have been triggered by the gift of a flower crafted of magical energy, given to her by Medivh, which she accepted from him.\nDespite not knowing of the magic until his first encounter with Medivh, Khadgar seems to learn the art quickly, making use of it a short while later to teleport himself and Lothar to Karazhan to defeat the possessed , drawing on the prison floor with a piece of burned wood from a brazier.

From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-weaver, the guardian of arcane magic and hidden arcanum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he lost most of his dragonflight, killed by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. After their loss, he hid out in Coldarra for thousands of years, slowly going mad. When Deathwing was defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he seemed to be coming back to himself. When the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, they decided to claim the Nexus for themselves. Awakening from his seclusion, Malygos destroyed them all and absorbed back their energies. In doing so, his eyes were fully opened to the state of the world once more.\nWith lucidity restored to him, there were some - particularly the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;members of his own&lt;/a&gt; - who did not like where his mind was going. Believing that the spellcasters of the mortal races were responsible for all of Azeroth's troubles, Malygos began a &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;terrible war&lt;/a&gt; to purge the world of \"rogue\" magic users, including the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing the situation had grown out of hand, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; rallied the remaining dragonflights in the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; to combat Malygos' genocidal crusade. After much conflict around the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, heroes entered Malygos' inner sanctum and, with the aid of the red dragonflight, killed him, ending the war but depriving magic of its appointed guardian at a crucial point.\nBiography.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nMalygos was the oldest of the five Aspects. Malygos was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. When he was younger, he and another proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Tarys\"&gt;Tarys&lt;/a&gt; were especially close.\nWhile on a hunt in the wastes of Northrend, he met a proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; who was searching for her lost brother. Proud of his intelligence, Malygos agreed to aid her in her search. The two were attacked by a savage gray proto-dragon, and though they fought it off Alexstrasza noted that it was frightened of something. Alexstrasza and Malygos would later find her brother, though he was a shriveled husk of flesh and bone.\nLater, Malygos and dozens of other proto-dragons of varying colors were hunting herds of grazing caribou. He watched as Alexstrasza helped her sick younger sister, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, though Ysera refused to take the sympathy. A rival proto-dragon of Malygos' named &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt; glared at him as he ate his own kill. Malygos also witnessed a brown proto-dragon predicting the herd's movements and snatching two at a time while others around him would only crash into the ground.\nYsera and Alexstrasza approached Malygos and Ysera asked how her brother died, but they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. After the gigantic terror had flown away, a confident grey proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; taunted them all for being afraid. Malygos turned to head home, but was ambushed by Coros and two other proto-dragons. Neltharion arrived to help Malygos fight them off, then declared the blue a good fighter and that they were blood brothers. Malygos noticed something in the hills nearby, but Neltharion couldn't see it. As he flew off, the land moved - a ripple no larger than a tall human.\nYsera and Alexstrasza would later come across the shriveled-up corpses of two proto-dragons, including Malygos' old companion Tarys. A small and terrified purple proto-dragon insisted that Galakrond had devoured the dead dragons, which matched theories Malygos had expressed to the two sisters. They went to fetch Malygos so he could meet the purple dragon. After his arrival, the corpses stirred and attacked as undead. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Ysera tore them apart.\nLater, when Galakrond began devouring proto-dragons, Coros cut off Malygos and hid in a crevasse he had intended on using for cover. This left Malygos open as Galakrond's jaws surrounded him, though the quick actions of friend Neltharion and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; would save Malygos' life. Under the threat of Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos like all the other proto-dragons would recognize &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt; as alpha, despite the fact that Malygos personally didn't trust her.\nMalygos was disturbed by the favor that Talonixa showed Coros, as evidenced by her letting him hunt with her, and feared nothing good would come of it. Later he was surprised to learn that Coros was encouraging Ysera's dream of peace with Galakrond and had used his influence to speak Talonixa and the others about her plans. While seemingly supporting her Malygos later learned that Coros used the meeting as a distraction so that he could slip away unnoticed. Ever distrustful of his rival Malygos quickly began to hunt him down to discover his intentions.\nWhile tracking Coros down, Malygos was eventually assaulted by an undead proto-dragon, whom he managed to defeat, but was left with a bite mark that began throbbing. After the assault, Malygos caught scent of Coros and his band and found that they have attacked a member of Alexstrasza's family. There, he saw Coros and his followers ripping off pieces of flesh from a member of Alexstrasza's, and devouring it whole. After Coros and the other proto-dragons left, Malygos felt the urge to give chase, but found himself enticed by the ravaged corpse of a member of Alexstrasza's family. A hunger for something more than flesh was instilled inside Malygos, he craved the corpse's lingering life essence, but Malygos became repulsed at this craving, and flew as far away from the corpse as possible. Once he came back to his senses, he turned back to the path Coros' band had taken, but Malygos sensed that the wrongness that pervaded wherever Galakrond flew now tainted their scent. Hearing a rasping sound while in pursuit of Coros, Malygos followed it only to be attacked by two members of Coros' family, one of whom was sickened. While the sickened proto-dragon attacked with an almost mindless fury and almost killed Malygos, he left Malygos with number of wounds that caused the throbbing where Malygos was bitten to begin anew, causing the intelligent Malygos to enter a state of bloodlust, mercilessly biting and tearing at his attackers in retaliation. Yearning for the kill, he lunged at his second opponent and bit his throat, tearing almost half of it, then attempted to swallow it, but as he came to his senses, he disgorged it. Malygos came to realize that the bite from the undead had infected him, urging him toward the same foul course that Galakrond and Coros followed.\nHorrified at himself Malygos stubbornly pushed on in order to discover what Coros was planning and bore witness to Coros' betraying the other proto-dragons to Galakrond. While Galakrond seemingly left, Malygos stayed hidden, which ensured his survival as Galakrond quickly returned and devoured Coros and his fellow cohorts. After ensuring that Galakrond had left Malygos quickly took to inform the rest of the proto-dragons about Coros' betrayal. However, when he arrived, he discovered a schism had broken the army of the gathered proto-dragons as they had discovered that those bitten by the not-living acted like Galakrond. After a brief argument, Talonixa appeared to agree to Ysera's plea to spare the bitten, on the condition that they be quarantined for the safety of the others. Agreeing to this condition Ysera watch the bitten dragons be herded into a canyon and then watched in shock as Talonixa collapsed it, eventually killing all those trapped inside. It was after this event that Ysera would notice that Malygos had been bitten on his leg and would keep silent about it.\nMalygos later found himself as part of Talonixa's proto-dragon army that moved to combat Galakrond. Before the proto-dragon army engaged their enemy in battle Malygos devised a plan in which the army would fly higher in the air where Galakrond could not fly. Quickly informing Talonixa of his plan, Malygos was relieved that she was considering it. However, hearing his sigh Talonixa took it as a sign of Malygos' satisfaction with her bowing to his wisdom and engaged Malygos in battle. While Nozdormu and Neltharion were quick to help Malygos, Talonixa was helped by her two lieutenants. Despite Nozdormu encouraging a retreat, Neltharion openly called for Malygos to fight Talonixa and became the new alpha an action which enraged Talonixa and brought more of her followers to join her, which caused the trio to flee high into the air.\nUsing his not-living, Galakrond was able to lure Talonixa's army into a trap, where he erupted from the ground when the army was in position and swiftly shattered it. After killing Talonixa, Galakrond was unable to devour the fast of the army due to the actions of Malygos, Nozdormu, and Neltharion. As Malygos broke off to find Ysera and Alexstrasza, he found them in the company of the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Tyr\"&gt;Watcher Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, who he briefly met before. Ysera attacked him when he tried to kill the bound undead proto-dragon. As Tyr spoke with Malygos Ysera freed the undead proto-dragon in order to make it see reason, an action which could have killed her if not for Malygos' timely intervention. After destroying the undead Malygos briefly succumbed to the hunger for flesh, but Ysera was able to recall him to his senses and Malygos was then cured by Tyr. Tyr then proposed hunting Galakrond, and decided to stand by the proto-dragons this time, revealing a war hammer from beneath his cloak. Lastly, he pulled out an octagonal artifact, moving it to the three proto-dragons as it glowed, with the promise that he was \"trying to ensure some future.\"\nYsera would witness Galakrond returning outside the cavern, chasing Neltharion and Nozdormu. Malygos and Tyr moved to the entrance to witness their battle, and Tyr was overjoyed at the proto-dragons' coordination. Alexstrasza, Malygos, and a now full-sized Tyr joined in the battle. Temporarily stunning Galakrond with his hammer, Tyr ordered the proto-dragons to flee as he stayed to battle the monster.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a mountain range to the north and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the octagonal artifact before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond's slumbering place, which Kalecgos would later note in his visions was nowhere near Galakrond's Rest. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the octagonal object on Tyr's belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr's hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true dragon.\nIn the battle, Tyr's hammer and the strange artifact were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the artifact, just as Galakrond's massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr's hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger. An unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. After being attacked by two not-living Ysera and the others found they could not find Tyr where they left him, concluding that some beast must have taken him for food.\nAfter recuperating Malygos and the others decide to hunt down Galakrond in order to kill him once and for all or die trying. It was during this time that Malygos feeling burdened by leadership role cast upon him gave it to Alexstrasza, after she took charge in response to his unvoiced question. Malygos, along with the others would be stunned to learn that Galakrond had begun to devour the not-living in order to feed his hunger and shortly after would engage in battle with the behemoth. During the battle, Malygos would work closely with and the pair would ultimately kill Galakrond after they forced a boulder down his throat.\nAfter killing Galakrond, Malygos and the others were approached by two other watchers, who revealed that they had taken Tyr to help him. Agreeing to protect Azeroth with his friends the two watchers were joined by two others and the titans acted through the keepers to transform Malygos and the others into the Dragon Aspects, where one of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that titans created them from Galakrond. This was done to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nWhen fallen &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; instigated the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies fought on the earthen's side. However, when Tyr realized that they could not win against the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; alone he called upon the Dragon Aspects for aid. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead titan-forged. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn's iron ranks.\nMuch as they had done in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the aspects worked in unison to overwhelm the vrykul army. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. Malygos drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in tomb cities across northern Kalimdor. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\nThe War of the Ancients.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;The War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to allow the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; access to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Great Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s congregated at the lair of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the coming invasion and what part they should play in defending the world. Neltharion proposed that to end the invasion of &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, the dragonflights should create a weapon with which they could eradicate the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; armies.\nNeltharion persuaded Malygos to aid him in convincing the other Great Aspects to lend a part of their power to create the weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The artifact was a simple unassuming golden disc created by Neltharion. The Dragon Soul was to be used as a weapon against the demons. All the Great Aspects and their flights contributed a bit of their power in creating the Dragon Soul with the exception of Neltharion. Through the disk, Neltharion was able to magically take control of all other dragons including the other Great Aspects.\nDuring one of the final battles the Great Aspects called all of their flights together and flew toward the battle where the Ancients had already perished and only night elves were holding back the Demons. With ease, a crazed Neltharion, now known as Deathwing, destroyed both demons and night elves by using the Dragon Soul\u2014now known as the Demon Soul\u2014against them. The other Aspects tried to stop Neltharion. Malygos' flight surrounded Deathwing in an attempt to take the Demon Soul from him. With a single command, they were engulfed by the magic of the Demon Soul and were pulverized. Malygos was also terribly injured, both mentally and physically, but did not suffer the same fate as his flight.\n&lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; helped ease this loss by going to Malygos' lair, taking eggs that still had life and storing them somewhere unknown; at the end of the war, he handed them over to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith his flight nearly annihilated, Malygos began to lose his mind. He felt deep guilt for his role in convincing the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to infuse their powers into the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. He traveled to his lair in Northrend, where he hid out in Coldarra for thousands of years, slowly going mad as the feelings of remorse paralyzed him. During the ten thousand years following the War of the Ancients, he was rarely seen by the other Aspects. His body was a caricature of his former self, almost always being in the form of an insect-like creature; a thin body surrounded by frozen ice, almost skeletal.\nDuring ten thousand years, his guardian and prime consort was &lt;a href=\"Saragosa\"&gt;Saragosa&lt;/a&gt;. She survived Deathwing's betrayal, but Malygos' madness caused them to abandon her clutch. &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; found this particular clutch of eggs, which would include &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and [Kirygosa], and safeguarded them so that the blue flight would not die out.\nDay of the Dragon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza was kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and taken to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Her younger consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, known as Krasus when disguised as an &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, later visited Malygos to seek his aid in an attempt to free Alexstrasza. Although Malygos initially refused, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; convinced Malygos to assist him by revealing that Deathwing was still alive and that Deathwing had indirectly led the Dragonmaw orcs to find the Demon Soul. Krasus finally said that Alexstrasza could use her powers over life to grant Malygos a new dragonflight. Seeing an opportunity to avenge the death of his flight, see their resurrection, and redeem himself, Malygos agreed to rejoin the world and confront Deathwing.\nAfter Deathwing was defeated and the Demon Soul destroyed, Malygos seemed to reclaim the vitality of his former self. &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the artifact using a scale of Deathwing and with a spell, all the magic and power of the Demon Soul was transferred back to the other Great Aspects, returning their full power to them. Although still a sparsely populated dragonflight, the blue brood grows slowly, giving hope to Malygos.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nAfter sensing the great power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron, Malygos summoned most blue dragons and sent young &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; to investigate instead of an elder. &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; soon departed for she feared he is in danger. After their quest with the Sunwell was done, Malygos learned what happened from Tyrygosa.\nNexus Point.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; learned in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; that nothing could save the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s unless an extremely powerful source of arcane power could revitalize them enough to free themselves. Tyrygosa, &lt;a href=\"Kadavan\"&gt;Kadavan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; opened a dimensional rift to Azeroth and brought a group of enthralled Netherwing dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; where they began absorbing its magical energies. Yet Zzeraku and the nether dragons grew mad with power and, frustrated with everyone they've ever encountered trying to use them, decided to be masters of their own destinies and conquer Azeroth for themselves. Tyrygosa tried to reason with Zzeraku, telling him that by following Deathwing's path, Azeroth would rise against them and lead to their destruction. Though conflicted with Tyrygosa's sincere concern for his kind, Zzeraku believed that only by gaining power could he safeguard his people. The Netherwing dragons attacked the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and in the midst of the chaos, Malygos awakened from his slumber. In his insanity, Malygos misinterpreted the nether dragons' arrogant proclamations of being the embodiment of the Nexus and absorbed them and their power. The dragon's Nether-warped physiology began to affect the Spell-Weaver himself, ultimately helping him regain some of his lost sanity.\nNight of the Dragon.\nMalygos sent Kalecgos on a mission to discover what was going on at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nexus War.\nMalygos, with clearer eyes, took note of the large number of mortal spellcasters running around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, recklessly using arcane magic, and worried they may bring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth in force again, as the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; once did (one of his last few memories before going mad).\nPrior to the Nexus War, rifts that seeped magical energy opened up in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;'s face and beneath the water around it, a sign of Malygos' plotting that set off little quakes up and down the coast.\nAs he deemed the lesser races' use of magic as unacceptable, Malygos proceeded to declare war on all magic users, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. He then decided to realign the flow of magic to point toward &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; gathered all this &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. Dalaran, therefore, moved to Northrend, as a capital for both the war against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the Kirin Tor's fight with Malygos. The &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; - keeping Alexstrasza's promise to Rhonin after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" - stepped up to defend the mortals from their cousins' crusade against spellcasters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt; was given to Malygos ages ago by the titan &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, the Arcanomicon has been continuously updated and revised by the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s over the long years of Malygos' seclusion. Malygos planned to use the Arcanomicon to locate and tap into the ley lines and divert the magical powers that course beneath the earth to his home base in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. The consequences had been violent, dangerous, and deadly. The world's crust had splintered, and the resulting unstable rifts had torn the very fabric of the magical dimension known as the Twisting Nether. Malygos' misguided attempts to \u201ccorrect\u201d the perceived misuse of arcane magic had to be halted - whatever the cost. Dragon had fought against dragon in the bitter Nexus War, and it had been the Life-Binder herself who had reached the agonizing decision that Malygos \u2014 not long recovered from millennia of insanity \u2014 had to be destroyed. Alexstrasza had taken her flight and allied with the magi of the Kirin Tor. With the world at stake, the remaining flights had agreed to join the reds in their bitter task. The alliance of dragons became known as the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of Kirin Tor mages decided to help the blue dragonflight and Malygos transformed them into &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhat Malygos did not know was how much damage his plan would wreak if implemented fully. While the Pantheon had told the Dragon Aspects many things, what they did not tell them was that Azeroth held a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, a dormant titan. Malygos' campaign had upset the equilibrium of the world, sparking natural disasters from Northrend to the southern tips of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Unless something was done, these disasters would spiral out of control and cause irreparable harm to Azeroth's world-soul.\nMage (manga).\nAfter the magi of Dalaran had elevated their city into the skies of Northrend and began to stabilize their place, Malygos had ordered the blue dragonflight to attack them. Malygos' followers eager to put an end to the mortals' reckless use of magic carried out his will and assaulted the city even as magi such as &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded the defense of Dalaran by creating a massive shield over the city. Despite treachery from &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;within&lt;/a&gt;, the magi of Dalaran were able to push back the blue dragonflight, but not before they resolved to crush the Kirin Tor once and for all.\nColdarra.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Keristrasza\"&gt;Keristrasza&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; by Malygos when she refused to bow to him. After she was released from the arcane prison he locked her in, she continued the fight against him in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; and lured &lt;a href=\"Saragosa\"&gt;Saragosa&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos' consort, to her death with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. In vengeance, Malygos forced Keristrasza to be his new consort. He tormented her in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, and branded her body with runes until she went madder than him. The only escape for her after that was death.\nThe Eye of Eternity.\nMalygos made his final stand in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, his personal realm. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; arrived to lend their aid, attacking the Aspect of Magic alongside the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who had come to defeat him. At the end, Malygos was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, with a lot of help on the ground.\nIn his last breath, Malygos was questioning the reasoning of Alexstrasza's actions, imploring her to see that mortals would destroy everything. The &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Heart of Magic&lt;/a&gt; was taken from his body by Alexstrasza and given to &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to Alexstrasza and her allies, the Heart of Magic contained the last essence of the Spellweaver. As Malygos' essence saw and felt the sadness of his old friends and allies, he felt regret and started questioning if he had been the one to betray them, before the memories of his final moments overwhelmed him and vengeance consumed his being.\nShortly after Malygos' death, Alexstrasza declared that the Nexus War had officially concluded.\nLegacy.\nDuring the battle against &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos appears in a form resembling a male high-elf with blue hair, along with the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, during a flashback of the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, ten thousand years earlier. Malygos is also wearing the &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Robe\"&gt;frostfire robes&lt;/a&gt; in their original coloring.\nMalygos' legacy is carried on in the confines of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; are torn between two new leaders in Malygos' absence. The first, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, believes that the flight should take a more active role in world affairs. The second, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, believes the opposite - that the Blue flight should retreat into seclusion from the world. Their rivalry comes to head when it is revealed that Arygos had entered into a dark alliance with none other than the Blue Dragonflight's original despoiler, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Deathwing the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, to remove Kalecgos from the picture. Deathwing, though eager to see Kalecgos dead, warns Arygos not to make the same mistakes as his father.\nArygos' plot is later unveiled, and he flees Coldarra, swearing that Neltharion will destroy them all. Kalecgos thus becomes the official successor to Malygos, as both the leader of the Blue Dragonflight and the Aspect of Magic.\nDragonflight.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; sought to lay the essences of Malygos and &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; to rest at the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, the violent nature of the deaths caused their memories to arise and spread over the Ossuary and even reach the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; itself. After the memories were put to rest, the essences of Malygos and Sindragosa were eventually taken to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt;. Working together as one, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy within the Azure Archives to break the loop of death that Malygos and Sindragosa had found themselves trapped in, where Kalecgos subsequently found himself fighting Malygos, while adventures clashed against Sindragosa. After being defeated, the pair were properly soothed and released from their torment, and Malygos formally apologized to Kalecgos and declared that the burden as Aspect should not be his to bear. However, Kalec countered that Malygos hadn't left a burden but a brilliant legacy that he and the flight will carry onward. Recognizing that the blue dragonflight was in good hands the Spellweaver and his Azure Queen departed to the afterlife, hand in hand.\nPersonality.\nAs a young proto-dragon, Malygos was very prideful of his abilities. He proudly declared his intelligence, and looked at more animal-like proto-dragons with contempt. It was not just talk, either, as it was Malygos who found a connection between the shriveled proto-dragon corpses and &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos aided in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. He also left many of his surviving dragons in the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; speculates that this was his last sane act.\nBackground.\nMalygos, Lord of Magic, is said to have created magic and spells. His command of magic is quite impressive, rivaling that of a demigod, although he does not aspire to such power. While physically he is not as powerful as some of the other Aspects, Malygos counters this disadvantage with his phenomenal command of magic.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos was described to often appear with an amused expression on his face. While physically dragons cannot smile, it appeared he often walked around with a smirk. He is said to have had a sense of humor and an optimistic personality, enjoying using magic and illusions to entertain audiences.\nLike most of his kind, Malygos is a solitary creature who avoids contact with others. He dwells in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, in a lair filled with some of the greatest magical artifacts known to exist. He spends his days studying magic, refining his abilities, and studying the various planes of the multiverse both remotely and in person, while his few remaining children scour the world for ancient artifacts and repositories of arcane power.\nCombat.\nMalygos does not seek out combat, and although he and his dragonflight are still routinely hunted by black dragons, he avoids their kind if at all possible. He protects his lair and himself with illusions and misdirection. Those who discover his home are encouraged to depart through a variety of means; Malygos takes direct action only as a last resort. When he does fight, he engages spellcasters first, using his breath weapon and other abilities to sweep spells from their minds.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Dropping a power spark and standing in it can speed phase one, and ranged dps can take advantage of Malygos' lengthy speech to deal extra damage before phase 2.\nIn phase 3, build stacks of the DoT (button 2) and HoT (button 3) by refreshing them before they fade while avoiding Static Field. It may be necessary to slow down to build energy before growing the DoT stack (button 2)\nIn a nutshell:\nVariations include smaller numbers of combo points, to as few as two (ie, 11, 2, 3 repeat).\nRaiding Strategies.\nPhase One.\nDuring Phase One, Malygos is tanked in the center of the room by one tank. Everyone else is beside or behind Malygos to avoid his cleave and cone attacks.\nPower Sparks: designate a stack location for ranged DPS, and have a Death Knight pull the sparks to that spot. Once pulled, root them to keep them in place while you kill them. \nA &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; to quickly target and grip Power Sparks:\nDuring Vortex, if Malygos has the buff from a Power Spark reaching him, it will be removed. Rogues may Shadowstep and Killing Spree out of the Vortex and continue DPS; Mages can Iceblock out of it as well. Lots of casters will most likely have under 20,000 health, so healers will want to use any instant casts they can on anyone under 20,000. Without a Paladin, only instant spells may be cast, though Hunters can cast Steady Shot but they will suffer from pushback. Paladins can use &lt;a href=\"Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Concentration Aura&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Mastery\"&gt;Aura Mastery&lt;/a&gt; to allow casters in range of the aura to continue normal casting while in the air. This makes the first (and maybe third) Vortex extremely easy. Tell the raid to use healthstones and/or potions in Vortex two and you are set. When Vortex ends and you fall, Hunters can avoid fall damage by Disengaging from Malygos, Mages and Priests can Slow Fall and Levitate, and Warlocks can Demonic Portal if they placed one near the Vortex prior to getting sucked up. \nNote: Once Malygos reaches 50%, he will slowly take off, however he remains targetable throughout, so burn him as best you can while he is taking off, and continue to hit him with instants once he's in the air.\nPhase Two.\nPhase Two begins at 50%. \nMalygos himself is not targetable during this phase. It will end when the adds he spawns are all killed. \nDuring this phase Malygos drops pink anti-magic zones onto the ground. The raid MUST stand inside of these; they reduce magical damage taken by 50%. They shrink over time, so it's important that your raid moves to each new one he drops. \nDuring this phase there are two types of NPCs riding around on disks in the room: Nexus Lords and Scions of Eternity. The Lords will move down onto the group, and need to be tanked; they will one-shot a non-tank. The Scions will cast Arcane Blast on random targets (on disks or not), which is mitigated by the anti-magic zones. \nAs the NPCs die, they drop disks which players can mount. Melee should take disks to DPS Scions. While mounted on a disk, players do not take damage from Malygos. \nHEROIC TARGET PRIORITY: In 25-man, tanks and melee who are not yet on a disk should focus fire the Lords, while ranged focus fire the Scions from the beginning of Phase Two. (Of course, melee who get a disk transition to Scions.) This method consistently ends phase two 30\u201345 seconds faster than starting the phase with all DPS on the Lords.\nAfter all of the NPCs riding on the disks die, players on disks need to dismount as Phase 3 is about to begin. \nNote: After all the Scions are dead, you will get a short burn period on Malygos before he breaks the floor. Use any DPS increase cooldowns that are available at this time, as you will not be able to use them once you mount your dragon. If executed well you can take an extra 5%-10% off his HP before you enter phase 3.\nPhase Three.\nMalygos destroys the floor of the room, and the raid falls onto dragon mounts. Malygos will move into center of (destroyed) platform and then he does not chase dragons, he just turns to his current target.\nThe dragons use combo points and energy similar to a rogue. The combo points are used for special finishing moves. Many unit frame addons do not show these combo points, however simple counting in your head can suffice as the abilities are quite basic.\nDuring this phase Malygos has 3 main abilities.\nThe dragons have 6 abilities: \nA common misconception is that there are offensive and defensive combo points, and that each of the finishers requires a different type. This is not true. The combo points are linked to your current target when you use an ability that generates points. For example, if you target Malygos and shoot 5 Flame Spikes, you will have 5 combo points on Malygos. This means you can use your Flame Shield ability while you have him targeted. If you change target to yourself, you will have no combo points on yourself and the shield will not fire. Similarly, if you target yourself (or another drake) and cast the heal on it, you can then Flame Shield so long as you have that target targeted. \nConfusing? Go do the \"Aces High\" daily quest in Coldarra. It's the same drake you control in Malygos. It's designed as a practice tool specifically for the fight. Even the enemy drakes in that quest have an ability that is similar to Malygos' Surge of Power ability.\nA basic strategy that has worked to kill Malygos on live realms goes as follows:\n- All drakes group up on one spot, roughly level with Malygos. Must be at least 30 yards away from him, and close enough to use Flame Spike.\n- 3 drakes should be designated healers. They cast 5 HoTs on themselves and then cast Life Burst. (Note: This only works \"if you have yourself targeted\". Some UIs may not easily allow this; in this situation, either click a random drake and use 3,3,3,3,3, 4, or target Malygos and use 1,1,1,1,1, 4.) This heals all drakes within 60 yards for roughly 25% of their HP. If a particular drake gets low on HP (they were slow to move from Static Field, or failed at Flame Shield usage) you can cast the 5 HoTs on them instead, then Life Burst with that drake targeted. Remember: The HoT stacks are not your combo points. You may have 5 HoTs still on yourself, but you just used a Life Burst, so you need to cast another 5 HoTs to get 5 combo points again. You can cast a 5-combo-point Life Burst roughly every 7\u20138 seconds. With 3 healers, this means every drake gets healed for ~25% of their HP every 3 or so seconds. (Only 2 healers are needed in the 10-man version, possibly only 1.)\n- The other drakes must build their Engulf Flame stack. Cast Flame Spikes for combo points, then Engulf Flame to add another charge to your stack. It can grow indefinitely, and this is the only way Malygos will die within the enrage timer.\n- When Static Field is cast on the pack of drakes, everyone needs to strafe to one side until you are out of the field. You will slowly rotate around Malygos with this method. Do not move more than you need to, as you may rotate all the way around to a previous Static Field if you are too fast.\n\"USEFUL TIP: Assign one of the raid members to lead the whole raid through phase three. Once everyone lands on their drakes, everyone should type /follow NAME where NAME is the name of chosen player. Everyone will follow that player automatically and can focus on healing or burning Malygos without other concerns like range for healers or avoiding Static Field.\"\n- Any drake can be the target for Surge of Power. When you get a boss emote, use the 3-second Malygos cast-time to ensure you have enough combo points/energy, and then cast Flame Shield once it begins channeling.\nDue to the above method of Shielding, DPS drakes should ensure they are using 5-combo-point Engulf Flames on the target. This means their Engulf stack will stay up for a long time, so they can use any current combo points they have to Shield themselves instantly when targeted, then quickly refresh their Engulf before it times off.\nAll drakes should also pretend that the bottom limit for their energy is 25. If you have self control and never go below 25 energy, you will always have enough energy to cast a Flame Shield on yourself. It will also help DPS drakes refresh their Engulf Flames stack should they need to use Flame Shield at an unfortunate time in their DPS cycle.\nAnother VERY effective drake DPS strategy for advanced players is using Engulf Flames at 3 combo points, making your debuff stack up even faster, however this is more energy consuming and requires a lot more energy management. The trick is to do 3 Flame Spikes, cast Engulf Flames, and wait until your revivify is at 1 second before renewing your revivify stack, then pump out your 3 combos and another Engulf Flames. When Malygos uses his Arcane Surge on you, you will most likely be waiting to restack your revivify. Stack it twice on yourself, and use your shield once he casts it. This will save you some combo points, and try shooting 2-combo-point Engulf Flames as fast as possible after, then go back to waiting revivify to hit 1 second.\nThe reason you need to wait so much is so you don't stay low energy and have enough energy to use your shield fast enough. The main trick is to not panic while doing it. You can take your time since revivify lasts 10 seconds, so basically you have 10 seconds to cast your 3 spikes and your engulf and revivify. This rotation racks up severe damage, a lot more than 5-combos Engulf Flames can, since the number of combo points only affect its duration. With this strategy, I have seen players reach 900k damage and up to 24 stacks, which is nearly 1/3 of Malygos's HP in phase 3, which means 3-4 players DPSing would be enough to bring him down if they do it correctly, so try practicing this while doing the daily \"Aces High!\".\nFirst Time Maly Kill - Tips.\nThe tactics above assume that your raid has good coordination and all of them play correctly. However, as any raid leader knows you have to come up with a technique of coping with the members of your group who slack.\nFor our first Maly kill we used a different tactic in phase 3. The 1-1-2 works fine if you have around 2-3 mins left when phase 3 starts, but on your first kill you are likely to have closer to 1-1.30 mins left. If you have all 10 people left alive, quickly designate 2 healers. Their job is simply - 1-1-1-1-1 AoE heal! The 8 DPS should follow the tactic 1-2-1-2-1-2, etc. Since combo points only determine how long the DoT is there for, the 1-2-1-2 method allows you to stack your DoT a lot faster. This means Malygos is likely to be taking double damage in half the time. The only downside being, if you get surged, you may have to take a tick or 2 before you have the energy to pop your shield.\nThe main thing to remember is - even if the enrage triggers, it ain't over yet! Malygos has no real AoE pwnage in phase 3, and so must kill each drake individually. The remaining drakes have around 2\u20133 seconds to spam 1 and get their final DoT off. By this time there should be around 8 DoTS on Malygos, all with around 10 stacks and hitting Malygos hard - this DoT keeps ticking even when he enrages, as long as their is a drake left alive.\nOn our first kill, we had 400k left to do when he enraged and the DoTS did that while we fled, hopelessly being picked off one by one.\nALL raid leaders should note that if your group CAN reach phase 3, they are geared for this raid, and it's simply a matter of refining the technique.\nSpecial Concerns.\nThere are a number of tricks and bugs associated with this fight that can cause aggravation if not addressed:\nThe End.\nThen you just burn him until the end of the fight, where Alexstrasza enters and finishes the battle. The loot for the fight comes from &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Alexstrasza's Gift&lt;/a&gt;, the fight rewards two badges. \nThe exit portal respawns, and you can fly over to it. The floor of the instance does not respawn.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend, and the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; on the Dragon Isles. However, they are frequently hunted and slain by poachers, the most notable of which is &lt;a href=\"Kaw%20the%20Mammoth%20Destroyer\"&gt;Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, a member of &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt;'s hunting party.\nThey are used as mounts by the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nNormally placid beasts, these intelligent animals form a strong bond with their riders, making them loyal and fearless in battle. Ancient manuscripts depict merchants traveling across the frozen tundra with these colossal beasts, leading scholars to believe they are the first domesticated mounts. Riders and merchants alike trust only the strong and steadfast &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Traveler%27s%20Tundra%20Mammoth\"&gt;tundra mammoth&lt;/a&gt; to carry them safely across the frigid tundra.\nDirectly descended from the original progenitor of the mammoth race, &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Wooly%20Mammoth\"&gt;wooly mammoths&lt;/a&gt; are considered more feral and primal than their shorter-haired cousins. This wild variant of the mammoth is not bred for riding. Most wooly mammoths are captured in the wild and tamed by their riders, resulting in a fierce, cunning mount.\nRarely, a war mammoth is born stronger and more tractable than its peers. These mammoths are dubbed \"grand\" and carry more than one rider to the front lines. Once used by &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s to carry heavily armored warriors, the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Grand%20Black%20War%20Mammoth\"&gt;grand black war mammoths&lt;/a&gt; can easily bear more than one rider of less-than-giant stature.\nAt home on the narrow, icy trails of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Grand%20Ice%20Mammoth\"&gt;grand ice mammoths&lt;/a&gt; are the only mounts the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s trust to carry large loads and multiple riders. The &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; believe that riding an ice-white mammoth will protect the rider from frostbite and snow blindness. Many ice giants claim that they have trained their favored white mammoths to trigger avalanches with their trumpeting calls.\nSure-footed and unflappable, the dark-furred &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Black%20War%20Mammoth\"&gt;black war mammoths&lt;/a&gt; are prized for their steady temperament going into battle.\nAs a mount.\n&lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20mounts\"&gt;Mammoth mounts&lt;/a&gt; are vanity mounts that were added in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Some can accommodate passengers, and they all (currently) have subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) shadings for each faction. You can also try out a mammoth mount for free during a &lt;a href=\"D.E.H.T.A\"&gt;D.E.H.T.A&lt;/a&gt; quest and deploy its devastating charge, trample, and bellow attacks.\nAs a hunter pet.\nMammoths were made tamable as a family of Tenacity &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;. The family also includes &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe mammoths of \"\" differ somewhat from their appearance in \"World of Warcraft\", possessing horny protrusions jutting out of their foreheads and backs in addition to having long tusks. They are capable of dealing frightening damage in combat.\nThey come in three sizes: &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mammoths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icetusk%20Mammoth\"&gt;Icetusk Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Mammoth\"&gt;Dire Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;s."}

He was usually the brains behind the gang's thefts back in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He is apparently quite bitter over his fate, insisting that the gang should have stuck to his plan. He wears a distinctive eyepatch that \"twitches with magic\" but which &lt;a href=\"Rhan%27ka\"&gt;Rhan'ka&lt;/a&gt; considers to be uglier than a &lt;a href=\"saurolisk\"&gt;saurolisk&lt;/a&gt;'s backside.\nLike most of the other Goldtusks, Man'zul initially appears to just be an inanimate skull that Rhan'ka talks to when &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s arrive at the inn. When &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury trolls&lt;/a&gt; attack the inn, Man'zul's skull is kidnapped and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20Hideout\"&gt;Sandfury Hideout&lt;/a&gt; (where it sits next to a bottle of grog) until Rhan'ka sends adventurers to get him back. After adventurers are initiated into the Goldtusk Gang, they gain the ability to see the ghosts of the gang members. Man'zul's ghost is seen floating in a corner at the back of the inn. He suggests that to better market the Goldtusk Gang, the inn should be adorned with a giant gold tusk. However, as he doesn't know where to find any gold tusks, Man'zul instead asks adventurers to retrieve a rib from the saurolisk &lt;a href=\"Bloodcrest\"&gt;Bloodcrest&lt;/a&gt;, which he carves to resemble a tusk and plants above the inn's entrance.\nWhile Man'zul's ghost bears a &lt;a href=\"stable%20master\"&gt;stable master&lt;/a&gt; title from the moment he becomes visible, he only begins offering the services of a stable master after completion of &lt;a href=\"A%20Goldtusk%20Greeting\"&gt;A Goldtusk Greeting&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "451621", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=451621", "title": "Mana", "text": "Mana (or Magic point) is a substance and a magical power resource which &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt;s draw upon when casting their &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic can be used to control the flow of mana, which is just a measure of a fundamental power\u2014if mana were water, then arcane would be steam pressure. The existence and mixture of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;various forces and energies&lt;/a&gt; form powerful vortices of mana.\nWhen they run out of mana, spellcasters can no longer use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and are left exhausted. As magic draws its energy from the physical forces of the caster, for instance the magi with the arcane, the only way to regenerate the body is by consuming food, especially protein. They may also drink while resting, or use mana &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s prepared by &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s. The more a living being's mana is consumed or drained, the more they are weakened, and if abused, it can cause fainting or death. In this case, the only way to save them is to restore their mana.\nIt is possible for the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;des&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;cend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt; afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"magic%20addiction\"&gt;magic addiction&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;drain mana&lt;/a&gt; from a surrounding source, including mana-bearing items, artifacts, &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, or even creatures and mortals possessing mana. All &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s hungered for magic, such as the &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s who hunted down those with the gift for magic, draining their victim's mana to death.\nIn older times, when &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was less understood and spells required vast amounts of mana to cast, gems were used to store mana for use in complex spells. Mana batteries can also be created with &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; cores. On the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3AAncient%20Mana\"&gt;:Ancient Mana&lt;/a&gt; is a byproduct of the underground &lt;a href=\"leyline\"&gt;leyline&lt;/a&gt;s beneath &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; which had naturally reached the surface, and while the result can come in many forms, a crystalline form is the most common. For the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; that were dependent on the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, it was an effective, if crude, substitute for the &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;mana wine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; is the source that is drawn upon by its denizens when using &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;death magic&lt;/a&gt;, and is comparable to the mana used in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nLey lines.\nThe ley lines are channels of immense power that course through the earth of &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;s like blood vessels carrying magic instead of scarlet fluid. On the surface, they tend to crystallize in the form of glowing purple mana crystals, but they require time to form. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; once used the ley lines to communicate over long distances, which requires the caster to channel their mana through a projected &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runic&lt;/a&gt; construct.\nMana crystals.\nThe mana crystals are &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; creations used to store magical energy. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, they are typically crimson in design. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; entered a state of &lt;a href=\"magical%20addiction\"&gt;magical addiction&lt;/a&gt; that forced them to suck mana crystals. In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas' magisters had refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they could siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds.\nUnstable mana crystals, if not handled properly, could explode with enough force to blow a hole into a city's walls.\nMana bombs.\nMana bombs are powerful explosive devices developed by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; for use against enemy spellcasters. These bombs are fueled by pure &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy and kill instantly.\nManaforges.\nAfter taking control of the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; blood elves harvested its parts and used them to construct the manaforges, in order to harvest the chaotic magic of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. The magic was then channeled to the &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt; where it was packaged into manacells of &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; design. According to &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Orelis\"&gt;Exarch Orelis&lt;/a&gt;, manaforges are a form of energy recharger, which was never designed to be used so close to land. This use was ripping Netherstorm apart and accelerating its deterioration.\nManacells were originally meant to contain a matter known as \"energon\", which might have over time become &lt;a href=\"Bottled%20Nethergon%20Energy\"&gt;nethergon energy&lt;/a&gt; and a separate concept.\nMoonwells.\nMoonwells are upwellings of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al waters created by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to maintain and restore their magical powers. Holding the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, and bound to the magic of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, they are places of healing for both the land around them and those who drank of their waters. &lt;a href=\"Caster\"&gt;Caster&lt;/a&gt;s can refresh their mana there, a gift of the Mother Moon to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s defenders.\nIn the RPG.\nThe powers of the &lt;a href=\"spellbreaker\"&gt;spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; are terrifying to those with knowledge of magic, for their blows shatter the mana from a spellcaster's body.\nThe second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; is a massive pool of water infused with raw mana at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Coveted by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, and many &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, the well is the greatest source of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic in the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Mana%20surge\"&gt;Mana surge&lt;/a&gt;s are magic-based elementals which are a type of &lt;a href=\"air%20elemental\"&gt;air elemental&lt;/a&gt; and are an example of an &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;. They are an aberration in the natural flow of magic. If &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"moon%20well\"&gt;moon well&lt;/a&gt;s are the arteries and organs of the magical world, mana surges are its cancer.\nIn exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' loyal service, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; gave them a place to live, as well as further techniques to siphon mana from anything with arcane power. Blood elves on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; now hunt demons and feed off the demons' magic. Separated from the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; more by cultural differences than physiological ones, it has since been determined that they are, in fact, beginning to evolve into a separate race, due largely to their consumption of mana from primarily fel sources.\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20dragon\"&gt;Nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s feed on mana and magic of all kinds and constantly patrol the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and those worlds open to it, such as Outland, for nourishment.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, spellcasters get an additional kick from drinking &lt;a href=\"%3AMoonberry%20Juice\"&gt;:Moonberry Juice&lt;/a&gt;, as it gives a major rush of mana, refreshing the soul as well as the mind."}

It is accessed north from the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Observance\"&gt;Ring of Observance&lt;/a&gt;. Note that although the instance itself is called Mana-Tombs, the entrance area outside the portal is called Mana Tombs without the dash.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; is a former &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; holy site and Horde fortress in the middle of the Bone Wastes, in Outland's &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. It was a holy ground for draenei burial until the Shadow Council took over, summoned an extremely powerful demon as old as time itself, and destroyed half of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Different factions now vie for power in this magical spot: Ethereals suck the arcane energy from the Mana-Tombs, the Burning Legion harvests souls inside the Auchenai Crypts, arakkoa zealots work dark magic in the Sethekk Halls, and the Shadow Council plots its domination of Outland from within the Shadow Labyrinth.\nIts inhabitants are mostly &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s opposing the &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;. The Mana-Tombs provide reputation for the Consortium until Honored; afterwards, in order to gain rep with the Consortium in Mana-Tombs, it must be run on Heroic (which requires honored with &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;). The ethereals of the Consortium cannot enter due to the anti-ethereal wards set by &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Shaffar\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Shaffar&lt;/a&gt;; they have attempted to breach the gates with little success, but have still tested whether or not their efforts worked - often resulting in the spotaneous combustion (for lack of a better term) of the ethereal tester sent through the gate. According to the Consortium, the ethereals in the Mana-Tombs are robbing it blind and if you wish to do business with them, you'll have to aid in taking out the competition.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel beneath the forests of Terokkar.\"\nWalkthrough.\nGroup and Level Guidance.\nIt is recommended that you take characters in the 64-66 level range. It is essential to have Crowd Control and/or Anti-caster abilities in group. One primary mage or warlock and a secondary can be helpful (Mage, Warlock, Second Priest, Hunter, Rogue). Tanking is not nearly as important in mana-tombs as it is in other instances so an off tank is not required. Having a back up healer is also helpful on boss fights, but they should be able to add to dps when demanded. A Priest or paladin is also needed for their shadow resistance buffs.\nPreparation for the Instance.\nHaving Shadow resist items will make the first boss a lot easier, in fact, shadow resist items will be essential for players at the lower end of spectrum (63-64) that do not have a perfectly well formed party.\nIn order to summon Yor, at least one player from your party must have the quest &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Shaffar%27s%20Personal%20Chamber%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Shaffar's Personal Chamber (quest)&lt;/a&gt; (Repeatable) or have completed &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Haramad%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Eye of Haramad (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nStealth Runs.\nThis dungeon provides moderate to heavy difficulty for a party made entirely of rogues and druids. No mobs have stealth detection, but there are several 'pinch-points' where 2 saps may not be enough to sneak by.\nQuests.\nThe following are part of a quest chain that begins with in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Mark%20of%20the%20Nexus-King\"&gt;The Mark of the Nexus-King&lt;/a&gt;:\nReputation.\nReputation gains go to &lt;a href=\"Consortium\"&gt;Consortium&lt;/a&gt;.\nA complete clear of Mana-Tombs will give about 1200 reputation with the Consortium until Honored, and 2400 each Heroic clear."}

{"id": "13201", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13201", "title": "Mana (game resource)", "text": "Mana is a magical power resource available to &lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt;s which they draw upon when casting &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. It has some parallels with other \"bar\"-type &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;s, but unlike the others is consumed relatively slowly. The amount of mana currently available to the caster is denoted with a special blue mana bar below their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bar. By default, casters start with a full bar of mana which is then depleted as they cast spells. \nCharacters have an innate replenishment of both health and mana. Some passive abilities can raise the replenishment rate for these stats independently. During combat mana regeneration is reduced, but some mana can be replenished instantly during combat using mana potions from &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; or from various magical items. Out of combat, mana regeneration can be increased significantly by using various &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;s. Mana regeneration can also be increased through the use of certain &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s. \nSince &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum amount of mana available to a caster is determined by their spec and level, although certain modifiers such as &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Shadowspirit%20Diamond\"&gt;Ember Shadowspirit Diamond&lt;/a&gt; can increase it by a small amount. \nPrior to \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" the maximum amount of mana available to a caster was determined by a combination of the character's class and their level. Prior to \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Spirit\"&gt;Spirit attribute&lt;/a&gt; affected rate at which mana replenished (&lt;a href=\"mana%20regeneration\"&gt;mana regeneration&lt;/a&gt;).\nTerms.\n&lt;a href=\"Base%20mana\"&gt;Base mana&lt;/a&gt; is a term used to refer how much mana a character has before it is modified by other effects. Many spells require a percentage of your base mana to be cast. &lt;a href=\"Mana%20pool\"&gt;Mana pool&lt;/a&gt; refers to the total amount of mana a player possesses, disregarding any increasing or decreasing effects (though it usually refers to the sum of increasing). \"Mana pool\" should not be confused with \"&lt;a href=\"resource%20pooling\"&gt;mana pooling&lt;/a&gt;\", a relatively rare resource management strategy.\nWhen out of mana, codice_1 issues a verbal comment to others around stating that you are &lt;a href=\"out%20of%20mana\"&gt;out of mana&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"low%20on%20mana\"&gt;low on mana&lt;/a&gt;. You can also just use \"OOM\", \"oom\", \"LOM\", or \"lom\" in &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;.\nBase mana and mana pool.\nDifferent specialisations have different relationships between base mana and their actual mana pool. While a character's mana pool is fixed by their level, it can be either equal to their base mana, or 5 times the base mana (400% greater than base). This affects the interpretation of spell costs, which are usually quoted as a percentage of base mana, not necessarily mana pool. The cost of abilities for hybrid classes should be divided by 5 to convert them from a percentage of base mana, to a percentage of mana pool. As an example, the Shaman's &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; and Priest's &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; have a similar purpose. However, Healing Wave's cost is listed as 9% of base mana. As a real percentage of mana pool, 9/5 is 1.8%, much closer to the value of 1.85% for Heal.\nNote that there are minor deviations to this rule, such as the aforementioned &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Shadowspirit%20Diamond\"&gt;Ember Shadowspirit Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and the Gnome racial &lt;a href=\"Expansive%20Mind\"&gt;Expansive Mind&lt;/a&gt; that increase the Mana pool in relation to Base mana regardless of class or specialization."}

It is advisable for everyone to stand close together in a tight cluster to prevent the mobs from running all over, as well as make maximum use of &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Flurry\"&gt;Blade Flurry&lt;/a&gt;. If you have hunters in the group they can stand away from the main group. Do not have them chase the mobs to the hunters, they will return when they &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir arcane damage output on the raid is negligible - nothing that should really trouble your healers - but usually these Feeders are accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Sentience\"&gt;Chaotic Sentience&lt;/a&gt; who can cast debuffs on random players that dramtically increases their damage taken from the Feeders. It is very important to dispel this debuff as quickly as possible or tank the Chaotic Sentience a good distance away from the raid out of range for its debuff.\nReward.\nReputation: Provides 3 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;."}

It can be a mage's best friend or worst killer. When this shield is up, physical and magical damage will be absorbed at the cost of 1 mana per point of damage. The shield collapses after absorbing a set amount or 1 minute passes, whichever comes first.\nTips and Tactics.\nAfter it absorbs the given damage (consuming equal that amount of mana) it will collapse, but no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; means you can recast immediately, or even while it's still partially up to \"refresh\" the absorption pool.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Incanter%27s%20Absorption\"&gt;Incanter's Absorption&lt;/a&gt; talent can make the mana used up worth the trade-off. 10/20% of the damage absorbed per hit will be added to your spell power. This effect lasts for 10 seconds but, it stacks on top of prior hits while refreshing the buff timer. This can make you keep the buff for the entire duration of the fight (as long as you get hit every 10 seconds) and the longer the fight goes, the more power you gain (up to 5% of your max health). A hit large enough to remove the Mana Shield in one hit (at level 85 with 8000 spell power) will increase &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; by 789/1577 for 10 seconds."}

It is a very powerful mana regeneration tool when used with many mana users.\nNotes.\nMana Spring Totem is a Water totem, and thus cannot be used at the same time as another water totem. Like all shaman totems it only has 5 hit points and is easily targeted and destroyed. The effect does not stack with a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Blessing of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nMana Spring Totem will restore the mana used to cast it within a few seconds. The longer you stay in range of the totem or the longer a fight lasts, the more valuable it becomes. Since the mana restored is per target, having more mana users in the group makes the totem increasingly more valuable.\nWhile the amount of mana restored per tick may seem small, it quickly adds up in a group of mana users, making this a very powerful totem in long fights and raid encounters.\nTips and tactics.\nSince the totem's effect does not stack with a &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Blessing of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, the shaman can use a different totem if there are plenty of paladin buffs, such as &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Stream%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Stream Totem&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the closing hours of Burning Crusade the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was reignited and began to feed the sin'dorei addiction for magic again, thus removing the need to tap mana from other creatures. The practical reason however was that while it had its uses, such as a ranged cornerpulling tool for blood elf paladins, the mechanic to maintain three charges to release arcane torrent was deemed too much of a hassle, especially in raids and other content that required more attention to other functions.\nIt is still referenced in the &lt;a href=\"flirt\"&gt;flirt&lt;/a&gt; emotes done by female blood elves. It is also still used by some blood elf NPCs in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nRole in the lore.\nMana tap is unique in that it is (or was) one of the few racials not only directly referenced in the lore, but a large part of it. Via &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was able to learn a formidable technique by which to sate the elves' magical addiction: the process of forcibly taking arcane magic from external sources. A servant of his, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, went on to spread these teachings back home in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the general sin'dorei populace (of which we the players belong to) to better deal with the pangs of addiction. Prior to its removal in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, instruction in its usage (mana tapping the crazed &lt;a href=\"mana%20wyrm\"&gt;mana wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s around the isle) was among the first things taught to new blood elf players. \nReckless overuse of the technique led to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, a group of physically warped magical addicts who showed neither restraint nor sensibility in their mana tapping. \nThe racial's removal also ties directly into the lore, as with the revival of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, there is no longer any need for blood elves to continually sustain themselves with energies from any other source than the well.\nIn the lore, even non-magi ordinary blood elves like &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; are able to use Mana Tap for potent semi-offensive purposes, such as Valeera critically weakening &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; during his arena fight; absorbing magical energies from the naga during their confrontation at sea; and preventing several assassins from slaying &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; after they reached the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nIn \"Heroes of the Storm\", Mana Tap is one of the Talent choices for ."}

The &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Code\"&gt;final code&lt;/a&gt; to set off the bomb is held by a blood knight named &lt;a href=\"Sharth%20Voldoun\"&gt;Sharth Voldoun&lt;/a&gt;, who resides at the top of the tower high above the courtyard.\nTides of War.\nThe archmage &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; eventually created a mana bomb of his own, its destructive power augmented by the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, which had been stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. By crushing &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and making a brazen display of his superior numbers, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; goaded the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; into moving many of their strongest members \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and a portion of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 into &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; to defend against the inevitable attack. The mana bomb was then dropped from a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, completely obliterating the city and everyone in it. Because of the use of the Focusing Iris, the mana bomb was so powerful that it tore holes in the fabric of reality, and magically altered the physical structure of those caught in the blast.\nIsle of Thunder.\nTactical mana bombs were utilized during the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Girana%20the%20Blooded\"&gt;Girana the Blooded&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that they were created during the war against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; through a joint operation with the Kirin Tor, though not perfected until recently. She also mentions using them hoping to make Jaina squirm with rage.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA mana bomb is located in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Vol'jin's Spear&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nArcane bombs are used during the &lt;a href=\"assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; resides, detonated by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. Three are later used on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to destroy &lt;a href=\"Terminus\"&gt;Terminus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, the primary port-of-call for Legion ships, in order to take out the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s infrastructure.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sullied%20Banner\"&gt;Sullied Banner&lt;/a&gt;, a sect of &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;rogue mages&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt;, tried to recreate the mana bomb that destroyed Theramore several years ago. They created several &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Mana%20Bomb\"&gt;prototypes&lt;/a&gt; that could cause issues if they were even accidentally detonated.\nSpeculation.\nAs the apparent mechanics of mana bombs and the known mechanics of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Bomb\"&gt;Arcane Bomb&lt;/a&gt;s (which are crafted by Engineers) are somewhat similar, it could mean Mana Bombs are an extremely powerful variant of Arcane Bombs. It is further reinforced by the fact that the mana bombs used against the Burning Legion at the Broken Shore were simply called arcane bombs."}

Unlike the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, they are typically crimson in design.\nThe crystals have multiple uses. In addition to storing arcane energy, they can protect blood elven towns and outposts by empowering a large dome around them, interconnecting with other nearby crystals to increase the shield's radius. This dome is resistant to both physical and magical attacks, while the crystals themselves can act as a natural insulator of substances such as lightning. They can also be used offensively: as seen at the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt;, the crystals (if moused over in-game, these are named the Defense Crystals) possess magical anti-air attacks capable of striking aerial enemies down at mid-to-long range. They can also be modified to serve as arcane wards to dissuade intruders.\nThe crystals require some degree of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; input to be fully charged. If siphoned using a smaller &lt;a href=\"Bloodgem%20Shard\"&gt;Bloodgem Shard&lt;/a&gt;, the crystals can give the user a charge of arcane energy to boost their abilities for a limited amount of time, though if a blood elf undergoes this process, the exposure to raw arcane energy augments the elf's innate addiction to magic and is considered hazardous. Subsequent appearances of the crystals (such as on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;) are utilized on the inverse principle: the blood elves channel magical energy \"into\" the crystals, rather than out.\nThe crystals can also be used for scrying purposes; the largest crystal in the Dawkseeker Promontory is explicitly named the \"Scrying Crystal,\" and overlooks the entire Isle of Thunder. The crystals can come in smaller forms (the aforementioned bloodgem shards; &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Carinda\"&gt;some elves&lt;/a&gt; also mention possessing smaller mana crystals to draw upon directly) too. Unstable mana crystals, if not handled properly, could explode with enough force to blow a hole into a city's walls.\nIn order to fight their &lt;a href=\"magical%20addiction\"&gt;magical addiction&lt;/a&gt;, many blood elves started draining arcane power from compact mana crystals (which became a popular product). In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas' magisters had refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they could siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds. They did this by attuning smaller &lt;a href=\"Bloodgem%20Shard\"&gt;bloodgem crystal shards&lt;/a&gt; to larger, fully charged ones.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that the mana crystals are the regular state of the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s (also known as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crystal\"&gt;Burning Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s), which were once used to store &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic energy in the same manner as the mana crystals store the arcane. Both crystals share the same design and textures, though the fel crystals were fel-green instead of crimson. It may be that storing demonic energies in the mana crystals caused their complexion to change thusly. It is also possible that the red crystals were the more demonic, though kept that color in current times for aesthetic reasons."}

Most characters who use mana strive to increase this amount though different mana-increasing factors, which usually makes \"mana pool\" the result - or sum - of these factors. A character's mana pool and &lt;a href=\"base%20mana\"&gt;base mana&lt;/a&gt; will be the same (have the same values) if the player isn't affected by any such factor.\nFor example, a level 60 character may have a mana pool of 6000, while a 85 character may have 100000. Albeit a large mana pool is useful to all classes using mana, it is considered especially important for &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s. A large pool will allow the casting of several healing-spells before the healer is &lt;a href=\"oom\"&gt;oom&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, a healer's ability to heal is often estimated from the mana pool, in a similar manner to how a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;'s (role) ability to tank (action) is estimated from his/her &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; (although this is rather simplistic). \nAffecting factors.\nA player's mana pool may increase or decrease depending on different factors / effects.\nComparison to regeneration.\nA character's \"effective total mana\" is not only decided by the mana pool, but also by the character's ability to regenerate mana (&lt;a href=\"mana%20regeneration\"&gt;mana regeneration&lt;/a&gt;). For healers, this causes &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; to be a second important &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; beside intellect. A large mana pool is however often considered more important than a powerful regeneration, possibly due to the fact that it's much easier to estimate a mana pool than the effective total mana based on regeneration. Mana regeneration was previously also \"weaker\" than the mana pool when the &lt;a href=\"five%20second%20rule\"&gt;five second rule&lt;/a&gt; was in use."}

Mana regeneration is made up of two components: Combat regen and Spirit regen. Combat regen is listed in combat under the Spells category. Spirit regen can be viewed by mousing over your Spirit stat in the character menu.\nOut of combat, players will regenerate their full mana regen amount which is the combination of their Combat regen and Spirit regen.\nIn combat, players will normally only regenerate their Combat Regen value, however healer specs have access to the &lt;a href=\"Meditation\"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt; passive which allows 50% of their Spirit Regen to continue in combat.\nMana regeneration takes place once per &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, but it's measured in MP5 (Mana Per 5 seconds), because that's the unit used in the tooltips.\nSpirit regen.\nSpirit is the primary stat that regenerates mana, and is primarily useful for healers.\nThe mana-regeneration formula is as follows. \nCombat regen.\nCombat regen is made up of a base regen value and any bonus in-combat regen you might receive (such as &lt;a href=\"Meditation\"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt;).

Mana surges are approximately 1 foot in diameter and weigh almost nothing, although their relative size fluctuates depending on how much magic they have drained recently.\nMana surges are air elementals spawned in areas where magical energy naturally combines with electrical storms. They consume magic and are drawn to sources of power, such as magic items or spellcasters. They move constantly but randomly, ever seeking new sources of energy on which to feed. Mana surges are aggressive, especially if they sense magic nearby. They distract foes with electrical charges while consuming whatever magic they can absorb. Once sated, they lose interest and fly away. A mana surge can be distracted by giving it a charged item, such as a wand or staff, to feed upon.\nAlthough sometimes captured for use against spellcasters, they cannot be trained and make poor pets. Mana surges automatically sense the most powerful source of magic in the area and attack that opponent exclusively, ignoring all other threats. They drain magic until sated and then depart the area to digest. Mana surges have no sense of self-preservation and attack regardless of any danger to themselves.\nMana surges are an aberration in the natural flow of magic. If &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"moon%20well\"&gt;moon well&lt;/a&gt;s are the arteries and organs of the magical world, mana surges are its cancer. Some believe that these creatures are the side effects of powerful summoning spells or a violent disruption of ley lines. A few &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s research these creatures, hoping for some dramatic insight into the nature of magic. More experienced scholars warn all to stay clear. A mana surge is rather like an &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt; in many ways, though its substance is incredibly concentrated magic rather than protoplasm. Mana surges are sometimes found with treasures. Random magical forces can transmute its surroundings into valuable metals or even enchant objects. Whether the mana surge wanders away before destroying such items is a matter of chance. Though a surge appears like liquid or gaseous coalescence of energy, its consistency is rubbery to the touch."}

The manaforges were built from parts of the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; designed to power the vessel during its travels by siphoning energy from the Twisting Nether. According to &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Orelis\"&gt;Exarch Orelis&lt;/a&gt;, manaforges are a form of energy recharger, which was never designed to be used so close to land. This use was ripping Netherstorm apart and accelerating its deterioration.\nThe blood elves controlled four of the five manaforges as &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ultris\"&gt;Ultris&lt;/a&gt; was taken over by &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s along with the &lt;a href=\"Access%20Shaft%20Zeon\"&gt;mine beneath it&lt;/a&gt; after it overloaded and exploded.\nBackground.\nAfter taking control of the Tempest Keep, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves harvested these parts and used them to construct the manaforges, despite concerns about the safety of using the technology on land. Those that were against it were immediately silenced.\nThey fed energy through pipes into Tempest Keep. The magic was then channeled into the &lt;a href=\"Mechanar\"&gt;Mechanar&lt;/a&gt; where it was packaged into &lt;a href=\"mana%20cell\"&gt;mana cell&lt;/a&gt;s both for Kael'thas' use and to be sent to feed Kael's people in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; urged Kael'thas to continue his work and dispatch the mana cells as he secretly believed that the blood elf prince could later use the cells to help craft the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s portal in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the manaforges were shutdown by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and their allies, and following Kael'thas' defeat at the Tempest Keep, Kael used ethereals to smuggle the remaining mana cells to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;."}

Most who venture beyond the gates with axe in hand do not return, and those few brave souls who have tell of roots rippling out of the ground like hungry serpents, and splintered stumps assembling themselves into a jagged, towering monstrosity wielding a woodsman's axe. These reports are doubtlessly referring to Splintergraft, the closest thing to an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; treant that has been encountered. Her rage-fueled strength is immense, but more than her brute strength, her most frightening aspect is her ability to infect other creatures and turn their flesh and blood to wood and sap. The transformation wildly increases the victims' strength but renders them powerless to resist the Witchwood's commands. Yearning for vengeance against those who split her trunks in life, Splintergraft is impatient for the day that the roots of the Witchwood make a tomb for Gilneas."}

This can easily be done with aoe damage or frequently switching targets.\nNow the major problem with this achievement is that while casting, the clones will not die until they finish. While this isn't a big problem with short cast spells such as Polymorph, the long, channeled Blizzard spell lasts long enough to fail the achievement. Because of this, players should be ready to stun or interrupt.\nOne last thing to worry about is pets; they won't switch targets and thus can damage one clone faster than the others, and might even kill one early. As such, you should frequently have you pet change targets or not use a pet at all. Also, abilities such as Mirror Image or Army of the Dead should not be used, because the pets cannot be controlled.\nNotes.\nIf Telestra is killed before her 2nd split (possible with enough DPS), the achievement can still be obtained as long as the achievement was not failed on the 1st split.

The Goblin-Titan Defense System activates when several players activate the chest. The encounter consists of a two-group &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; to destroying the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; spoils on both sides of the room before the defense system wipes the raid. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; gazed across Pandaria, he saw untapped power. During the course of his campaign, Garrosh has plundered weapons, treasures, and artifacts of the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. They are kept in a warehouse deep within his underground base, guarded by a mysterious security system that appears to be of Titan origins.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"When we were coming up with concepts for the different rooms and wings of Garrosh\u2019s base, we envisioned a warehouse in which he kept the various artifacts, weapons, and other treasures he had plundered during the Horde campaign in Pandaria. An archaeological conservationist Garrosh is not. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve made a Raid encounter that didn\u2019t have a single conventional \u201cboss,\u201d but the objective here is simply to shut down the security system before it blows you all up.\"\nOverview.\nPlayers trigger the self-destruct mechanism in a &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; treasure storage. Breaking open crates and defeating the enemies contained inside releases Titan Energy that charges manual override levers that are used to shut down the defense system before it destroys the storeroom and everyone trapped inside. Two of the four quadrants of the room are accessible initially, and the other half is unlocked once the first two override levers are pulled. Activating and pulling all four levers completes the encounter.\nAbilities.\nMassive Crate of Goods.\nThese massive crates of goods carry monstrous war-torn creatures. A large amount of Titan Energy powers them, but it may take considerable effort to defeat them.\nStout Crate of Goods.\nThese hefty crates of goods carry seasoned enemies. A medium amount of Titan Energy fuels their animation and caution should be taken to defeat them.\nLightweight Crate of Goods.\nThese small crates of goods carry front-line enemy forces. A small amount of Titan Energy fuels their creation and can be defeated with fewer players.\nCrate of Pandaren Relics.\nThese small crates of goods carry rare artifacts of Pandaren origin. Titan Energy does not fuel their animation, instead they are guarded by powerful Pandaren spirits.\nQuotes.\nA large device of unknown origin hums in front of you. Several words are scratched into the side:\n[Goblin-Titan control module]\nIt appears to be protected by a voice-recognition module.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They are ancient enemies of the &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s. The deadly &lt;a href=\"sporebat\"&gt;sporebat&lt;/a&gt;s are a more highly evolved sub-species of the spore walkers.\nBackground.\nThe marsh walkers of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; are towering creatures that prowl the wilds, feasting on any lesser creatures they come across. It is believed that the spore walkers evolved over time from the simple organisms that dwell within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; into the more efficient hunting, killing and eating machines that they are today. Utilizing their environment, the spore walkers are able to derive toxins from the spores and fungi of the marsh, which they in turn use to stun or immobilize their prey. When traveling through the marsh, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s would be wise to steer clear of these highly accomplished predators. Spore walkers also have a potent apparatus on their face that can fire a powerful laser, out-doing even the best lasers of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; design. It's unknown exactly how they work. Wild marsh walkers are dangerously aggressive, but they're loyal and affectionate if you manage to tame them.\nMarsh walkers are ancient enemies of the &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s, whom they've put through unspeakable pain over the centuries. The sporeling &lt;a href=\"T%27shu\"&gt;T'shu&lt;/a&gt; claims that the spore walkers have taken more innocent sporeling lives than any creature he has ever seen.\nThere is only ever one great mother of the marsh walkers in Zangarmarsh. She is always known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Stalker\"&gt;the Black Stalker&lt;/a&gt;, and she hatches from one of the eggs left behind when her mother dies.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; has empowered some fen striders with mind-bending powers, though it is unknown how she has accomplished this. Even at an early age these creatures show significant psychic ability.\nAs a hunter pet.\nSpore walkers can be tamed by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the the &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;exotic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"water%20strider\"&gt;water strider&lt;/a&gt; family."}

Like their walker cousins, the sporebats draw ingredients from the environment and combine them to form virulent toxins used in subduing the sporebats' prey. Unlike the walkers, however, the sporebats have the added advantage of flight in their arsenal. No corner of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; is safe as long as these silently gliding death-dealers are on the prowl.\nSporebats are usually docile, but when they attack, their stingers wrap around exposed limbs and can even tear through reinforced leather like it is paper. This is because the entirety of their long, whip-like tentacles are barbed. When some species of sporebat collapse, they release a series of spores which affects a variety of species and provides a short-term buff of considerable power.\nWild sporebats are vicious creatures, but if tamed at a young age, they can be loyal companions.\nAs a hunter pet.\nSporebats are a family of &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20pets\"&gt;Cunning pets&lt;/a&gt;."}

The sporelings are native to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately, the changing climate of the marsh has put them in danger. Adventurers that assist their survival will be justly rewarded.\nThe Sporeggar were not always made of mushroom.\nReputation.\nPlayers start at with Sporeggar, but can gain reputation quickly.\nStrategy.\nReputation with Sporeggar begins at , and because some one-time and repeatable quests become unavailable at higher reputation levels, its recommended to make use of them early on to reduce the amount of grinding necessary.\nTo begin, when at level 60 or above, visit &lt;a href=\"Fahssn\"&gt;Fahssn&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern edge of The Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh, and pick up the two quests he offers: &lt;a href=\"The%20Sporelings%27%20Plight\"&gt;The Sporelings' Plight&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Mature%20Spore%20Sac\"&gt;Mature Spore Sac&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Enemies\"&gt;Natural Enemies&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Bog%20Lord%20Tendril\"&gt;Bog Lord Tendril&lt;/a&gt;s). These are one-time quests which open up repeatable versions (&lt;a href=\"More%20Spore%20Sacs\"&gt;More Spore Sacs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"More%20Tendrils%21\"&gt;More Tendrils!&lt;/a&gt;) which are can't be picked-up after reaching . The most efficient method is to pick -one- of these (either spore sacs or tendrils) to complete and then repeat its follow-up all the way to , and save the other one for later. Consider that More Spore Sacs are bind-on-pickup and have to be collected yourself, while Bog Lord Tendrils are tradeable and might be found easily on the Auction House.\nOnce you reach , pick up &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Sporeggar (quest)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fahssn\"&gt;Fahssn&lt;/a&gt;, and travel to the town. There pick up and complete &lt;a href=\"Glowcap%20Mushrooms\"&gt;Glowcap Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. Its recommended to not do the repeatable version (&lt;a href=\"More%20Glowcaps\"&gt;More Glowcaps&lt;/a&gt;), since &lt;a href=\"Glowcap\"&gt;Glowcap&lt;/a&gt; is used as currency for the reputation vendor.\nReturn back to &lt;a href=\"Fahssn\"&gt;Fahssn&lt;/a&gt; and continue doing your chosen repeatable turn-in (either &lt;a href=\"More%20Spore%20Sacs\"&gt;More Spore Sacs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"More%20Tendrils%21\"&gt;More Tendrils!&lt;/a&gt;) until you reach . At that point, the repeatable quest stops being offered. Now turn in the quest you were holding (&lt;a href=\"The%20Sporelings%27%20Plight\"&gt;The Sporelings' Plight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Enemies\"&gt;Natural Enemies&lt;/a&gt;). \nNow that you're at , several new quests open in the town of Sporeggar: &lt;a href=\"Fertile%20Spores%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Fertile Spores (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Now%20That%20We%27re%20Friends...\"&gt;Now That We're Friends...&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fhwoor%20Smash%21\"&gt;Fhwoor Smash!&lt;/a&gt;. You can pick them up, and in due course complete them (possibly alongside other quests in Zangarmarsh), but its probably best not to turn them in until you reach . This is because you can kill the &lt;a href=\"Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Withered%20Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Withered Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Starving%20Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Starving Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Hungry Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Giant\"&gt;Fungal Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Giant\"&gt;Withered Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Starving%20Fungal%20Giant\"&gt;Starving Fungal Giant&lt;/a&gt;s in Zangarmarsh until you are and they stop giving reputation.\nIf you're going for Loremaster or just leveling through the zone, its recommended to do all the other zone quests now. If you're grinding this reputation at higher levels, then you can kill Bog Lords and Fungal Giants in the zone for 15 reputation each. You can also do full clears of &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt; for reputation and to collect . These should be saved to complete the one-time quest &lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20A%20Shrubbery%21\"&gt;Bring Me A Shrubbery!&lt;/a&gt; and its repeatable version &lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20A%20Shrubbery%21\"&gt;Bring Me A Shrubbery!&lt;/a&gt; after you reach .\nAfter reaching , you should now go ahead and turn in all one-time quests you're holding (&lt;a href=\"Sporeggar%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Sporeggar (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fertile%20Spores%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Fertile Spores (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Now%20That%20We%27re%20Friends...\"&gt;Now That We're Friends...&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fhwoor%20Smash%21\"&gt;Fhwoor Smash!&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20A%20Shrubbery%21\"&gt;Bring Me A Shrubbery!&lt;/a&gt;), and complete as many repeatable versions you'd like. You can also continue to clear Underbog. See below for strategies for grinding in Zangarmarsh and the Underbog.\nGrinding mobs in Zangarmarsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Withered%20Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Withered Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Starving%20Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Starving Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Bog%20Lord\"&gt;Hungry Bog Lord&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Giant\"&gt;Fungal Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Giant\"&gt;Withered Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Starving%20Fungal%20Giant\"&gt;Starving Fungal Giant&lt;/a&gt;s in Zangarmarsh will net you 15 reputation each all the way to and occasionally drop &lt;a href=\"Bog%20Lord%20Tendril\"&gt;Bog Lord Tendril&lt;/a&gt;s. They also can be harvested by herbalists and net &lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Life\"&gt;Mote of Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20Plant%20Parts\"&gt;Unidentified Plant Parts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; reputation.\n&lt;a href=\"Marsh%20Dredger\"&gt;Marsh Dredger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Marsh%20Lurker\"&gt;Marsh Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s found in the &lt;a href=\"Funggor%20Cavern\"&gt;Funggor Cavern&lt;/a&gt; also give 15 reputation per kill. Killing them and the named mob &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Klaq\"&gt;Lord Klaq&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly going in and out of the caverns is an option if you are looking for a mindless, quick grind. The mobs also respawn rather quickly, so by the time you run one circuit of the caverns and clear the mobs directly outside the caverns, those inside the caverns should have started respawning.\n&lt;a href=\"Spore%20Walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;s (Marsh Walkers and Fen Striders) and &lt;a href=\"sporebat\"&gt;sporebat&lt;/a&gt;s do not give reputation, but drop &lt;a href=\"Fertile%20Spores\"&gt;Fertile Spores&lt;/a&gt; about 30% of the time. Turning these in for &lt;a href=\"Fertile%20Spores%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Fertile Spores (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"More%20Fertile%20Spores\"&gt;More Fertile Spores&lt;/a&gt;, makes each kill approximately 37.5 reputation on average.\nThe quests &lt;a href=\"Now%20That%20We%27re%20Friends...\"&gt;Now That We're Friends...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Now%20That%20We%27re%20Still%20Friends...\"&gt;Now That We're Still Friends...&lt;/a&gt; (the repeatable version) involve killing 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses (level 61-64 mobs). This is 31.25 reputation per kill, and 41.66 per kill for the repeatable version, which is more reputation per kill on average than farming Fertile Spores, assuming a 30% drop rate. For a non-human, it would take 16 runs (288 kills) to move through to (12,000 reputation) and 28 runs (504 kills) to move through to (21,000 reputation), 792 kills total. Assuming 37.5 reputation per kill when farming Fertile Spores, it would take 320 kills to go from to and 560 kills to go from to , 880 kills total, and it requires a random drop.\nWith a flying mount it is possible to gain 3000 reputation every 15 minutes. Once you reach friendly fly to Sporeggar. Grab the quest &lt;a href=\"Now%20That%20We%27re%20Still%20Friends...\"&gt;Now That We're Still Friends...&lt;/a&gt; and fly to the northwestern corner of Zangamarsh. Kill all of the Greater Sporebats, collecting the Fertile Spores. You should be able to gather at least 12 spores for two &lt;a href=\"More%20Fertile%20Spores\"&gt;More Fertile Spores&lt;/a&gt; turn-ins (750 rep each). Then fly to the islands in the middle of Marshlight Lake (just NE of Sporeggar) and kill the necessary naga for the quest. Turn in that quest (825 rep) and pick it up again. You can also turn in the spores if you like. Fly back to the naga, complete the quest again, then turn in (750 rep). Pick up the quest again and repeat. Killing the Sporebats gives the naga time to respawn, and earns a glowcap for each &lt;a href=\"More%20Fertile%20Spores\"&gt;More Fertile Spores&lt;/a&gt; turn in, on top of the ones you find.\nGrinding Underbog.\n can drop from any mobs up to the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in the instance and is also found as a ground spawn - found in The Underbog and used for the quest &lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20A%20Shrubbery%21\"&gt;Bring Me A Shrubbery!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20Another%20Shrubbery%21\"&gt;Bring Me Another Shrubbery!&lt;/a&gt; - and has a relatively short respawn timer. It's worth 5\u201310 minutes running back through the instance after you've finished killing the final boss to collect any new respawns; doing this can net you enough for another 1-2 quest turn-ins (750-1500 rep).\nThese runs net a minimum of 3750 rep every 30 mins. It is also easier than the repeatable naga quest since you don't have to hunt for the Bloodscale Slavedrivers, and it removes the travel component. At honored if you are not a human, it will take 220 Sanguine Hibiscus to get from honored to exalted. If you are a human then it will take about 200. To get from revered to exalted then you will need 140 hibiscus or about 130 when you are a human. This can easily be achieved by a few hours of farming Underbog or buying hibiscus from the Auction House if it is available.\nRewards.\nRewards can be purchased from the Sporeggar Quartermaster, &lt;a href=\"Mycah\"&gt;Mycah&lt;/a&gt;, who is in a small mushroom building on the west side of Sporeggar .\nAs most of the rewards for this faction are bought with glowcaps, they cannot be resold to vendors.\nThere are also three items as quest rewards from an revered quest, &lt;a href=\"Fhwoor%20Smash%21\"&gt;Fhwoor Smash!&lt;/a&gt;:\nSpeculation.\nMany residents of Sporeggar may be named after sounds commonly associated with an allergy (such as hayfever), most notably &lt;a href=\"Hch%27uu\"&gt;Hch'uu&lt;/a&gt; (achoo), &lt;a href=\"Khn%27nix\"&gt;Khn'nix&lt;/a&gt; (Kleenex), &lt;a href=\"T%27shu\"&gt;T'shu&lt;/a&gt; (tissue), and &lt;a href=\"Gzhun%27tt\"&gt;Gzhun'tt&lt;/a&gt; (gesundheit)."}

Their capital, &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar%20%28town%29\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the western bogs of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile fearful of travelers (especially those significantly larger than them), the sporelings are quick to welcome anyone to help them. They are beset by many enemies, including the &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"marsh%20beast\"&gt;marsh beast&lt;/a&gt;s and more recently the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to ask for aid from passing &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBackground and culture.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, spores from the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse settled in the wilds, giving sentience to existing forms of plants. The jungles stirred as new beings took shape and walked the land, among which were the small and simpleminded &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s and sporelings. The sporelings of &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt; were not always made of mushroom.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; claims that the sporelings would be cute if they didn't smell so bad.\nSporeling young emerge from spore sacs at the &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Glen\"&gt;Spawning Glen&lt;/a&gt;. The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted.\nAlthough they may seem primitive, sporelings possess a natural bond with Zangarmarsh and gladly share their home's secret blessings with their friends. They are shy and careful by nature and have learned to craft cloaks that let the wearer slip through the marshes. They also have an intuitive knowledge of &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and know how to extract useful properties from the swamp's many mushrooms. Rather than using shiny round pieces of metal as currency, sporelings use shiny round mushrooms called &lt;a href=\"glowcap\"&gt;glowcap&lt;/a&gt;s, which grow everywhere in Zangarmarsh. Glowcaps are also the favorite snack of young sporelings. &lt;a href=\"Tallstalk%20Mushroom\"&gt;Tallstalks&lt;/a&gt; are incredibly useful mushrooms, and being able to grow them allows the sporelings to do many things with them. The tallstalks are vital to rebuilding Sporeggar, but due to the sporelings' short stature, their options for gathering tallstalk spores are limited and they are instead forced to ask adventurers to gather the spores from the appendages of wandering &lt;a href=\"sporebat\"&gt;sporebat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"marsh%20walker\"&gt;marsh walker&lt;/a&gt;s. Sporelings also use the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Hibiscus\"&gt;sanguine hibiscus&lt;/a&gt; shrub for a number of purposes.\nThere is a sporeling saying that all is fair in mushrooms and war.\n&lt;a href=\"Captured%20Firefly\"&gt;Fireflies&lt;/a&gt; are commonly used by sporelings as a light source as they navigate the waterways of Zangarmarsh. The luminescent insects help them avoid the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Bogflare%20Needler\"&gt;bogflare needlers&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations.\n&lt;a href=\"Msshi%27fn\"&gt;Msshi'fn&lt;/a&gt;, the elder of Sporeggar, mentions trading with other sporelings for food and supplies. The &lt;a href=\"sporelok\"&gt;sporelok&lt;/a&gt;s are a sporeling group that dwell in &lt;a href=\"Funggor%20Cavern\"&gt;Funggor Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Their home has recently been invaded by &lt;a href=\"marsh%20beast\"&gt;marsh beast&lt;/a&gt;s, leading the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to send adventurers to intervene.\nWhile the sporelings are a peaceful people, they are at war with the &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s, whether they like it or not. The two races have never gotten along well, but in the past the sporelings have managed to keep the giants at bay with spears and stones. Lately, however, the giants seem to have become more aggressive (or desperate) and no longer fear the sporelings or their weapons. Due to the threat of starvation, the fungal giants of &lt;a href=\"Quagg%20Ridge\"&gt;Quagg Ridge&lt;/a&gt; have begun venturing into the &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Glen\"&gt;Spawning Glen&lt;/a&gt; and devouring the sporelings' pods, threatening to wipe out the entire race. A notable exception to this rivalry is &lt;a href=\"Fhwoor\"&gt;Fhwoor&lt;/a&gt;, a friendly fungal giant who was saved from the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and has stayed in Sporeggar helping with things ever since.\nThe &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;s are ancient enemies of the sporelings. According to &lt;a href=\"T%27shu\"&gt;T'shu&lt;/a&gt;, while the spore giants may be attacking the sporelings in the present day, the marsh walkers have taken more innocent lives than any creature that he has ever seen, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Stalker\"&gt;the Black Stalker&lt;/a&gt; and her brood have put the sporelings through unspeakable pain over the centuries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodscale%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodscale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; have recently begun killing the people of Sporeggar, even though the sporelings only wish to be left in peace.\nAlternate Draenor.\nOn the , sporelings can be found in &lt;a href=\"Gloomshade%20Grove\"&gt;Gloomshade Grove&lt;/a&gt; along the northern coast of . They are, however, easily missed due to their very small size. They tend to follow the other much larger fungal creatures around, and can also be found gathered about near several rocky outcroppings and fungal growths near the waterline.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gloomshade%20Grove\"&gt;Gloomshade Grove&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen dancing around images of sporelings projected on top of a mushroom by &lt;a href=\"Leaf-Reader%20Kurri\"&gt;Leaf-Reader Kurri&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have been shown visions of the future by the mushroom. Kurri also speaks of \"power in mushrooms\" and urges his followers to \"wash in holy spores [and] feel might of mushroom\". He also drops an item called the &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Mushroom of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral deceased &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Miner%20%28Bloodmaul%20Slag%20Mines%29\"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Miner%20%28Ashran%29\"&gt;sporeling miners&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul%20Slag%20Mines\"&gt;Bloodmaul Slag Mines&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Sporeling%20Sprout\"&gt;Sporeling Sprout&lt;/a&gt;s can be captured in pet battles around Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Leaf-Reader%20Kurri\"&gt;Leaf-Reader Kurri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vignette\"&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;noted above&lt;/a&gt;, seems to imply that the podlings are destined to eventually transform into sporelings, likely due to being infected by the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;Zangar encroachment&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to be supported by the statement that the &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt; were not always made of mushroom. This notion is somewhat contradicted by the revelation in \"Chronicle Volume 2\" that the podlings evolved alongside sporelings, but it can be speculated that some groups of sporelings were always sporelings, while others were originally podlings that were transformed by the Zangar encroachment."}

They consumed everything in sight, eventually tapping into the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, allowing all of Draenor's plant life to act as a single organism: the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naanu\"&gt;Naanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, and another unnamed Sporemound were eventually all destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain given life by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, and his descendants known as the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;. Centuries later, the &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated the creation of a new Sporemound called &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, but it was subsequently destroyed by the Apexis superweapon known as the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBirth of the Evergrowth.\nThe Sporemounds' tendril-like vines slithered over Draenor's earth and strangled every primitive beast that they could reach. As they grew, the Sporemounds consumed more and more, their hunger and need to expanding knowing no end. They blossomed into living mountains of tangled brambles and noxious pods. Wherever their tendrils crept over the earth, lush forests and swamps took root, and before long, a labyrinth of deep wilds stretched to the far corners of Draenor.\nNot even Draenor's elemental energies were safe from the Sporemounds. As their roots wormed deep underground in search of water, they tapped into the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;fifth element&lt;/a&gt; that suffused Draenor's soil. The primordial energy ignited a crude communal sentience within the Sporemounds and the surrounding wilds, allowing Draenor's plants to act as a single massive organism, becoming collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt;. If any major threat arose, the Evergrowth reacted in unison. However, such threats were non-existent, for the Evergrowth dominated everything in sight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; came across Draenor in his travels, he was intrigued by the world, but foresaw doom for the planet if the Evergrowth was allowed to grow unchecked, as it would eventually consume everything on the world, including the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt;. Once that happened, the Evergrowth would devour itself, and Draenor would be left a wasteland devoid of life. Aggramar's natural affinity for order compelled him to take action, but he did not wish to completely destroy Draenor's plant life, only to temper it. Thus, he would need to neutralize the Sporemounds, the heart of the Evergrowth's power.\nThe battle with Grond.\nThe titan considered destroying the Sporemounds himself, but since his power was so great it risked irreparably damaging or even shattering Draenor and because he could not stand guard over the world forever, he instead decided to create a mighty servant in his own image to uproot the Sporemounds. Using a massive elemental storm, Aggramar caused a mountain to groan to life and named it &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;. Grond began marching across the world to conquer the Evergrowth. He confronted and defeated the nearest Sporemound before tearing it from the world's surface with ease. The other Sporemounds shivered in agony at the destruction of their kin. Mere roots would not topple Grond; instead, the Sporemounds would need to adapt.\nEach Sporemound drained the surrounding wilds of life essence, leaving behind only withered tracts of land. Infused with these energies, the Sporemounds arose to walk the world. There were three, each embodying a different region of the Evergrowth: &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;, whose hide was covered in swamps and mushroom thickets; &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, who was covered with primal forestlands; and &lt;a href=\"Naanu\"&gt;Naanu&lt;/a&gt;, who wore a fleece of dense jungles. As one the Sporemounds moved against Grond, and Draenor buckled under the weight of the warring giants. Aggramar watched the battle from the skies over Draenor. Zang, Botaan and Naanu were determined to protect the Evergrowth at any cost, and through their communal sentience they moved in perfect unison against Grond, nearly overwhelming him. However, like his creator, Grond possessed a will of steel and refused to give up. As the calamitous battle raged, the tide shifted between each side. The Sporemounds were resilient, but could not hold out forever against Grond's attacks. Zang, the smallest of the Sporemounds, suffered the most and was the first to fall. Grond took hold of it and tore it in half. Its rotting body would later transform into the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Grond pressed his attack against Naanu and crushed it between his hands. The creature collapsed to the ground, where its broken husk would slowly sink into the earth and become the region of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Only Botaan remained, but Grond was weakened and scarred by the battle. Botaan sensed its opponent's weakness, but would need more power to defeat the giant. It leeched the life essence from the bodies of Naanu and Zang, absorbing them and growing to a monstrous size. Still, Botaan remained cautious, evading Grond's direct assaults while entangling him in thousands of small vines that gradually burrowed into the cracks and wounds on his skin. Grond considered them a mere nuisance and ignored them until it was too late. The vines wrenched open his existing wounds and tore open new fissures across his body. Grond collapsed beneath his own weight and crumbled to pieces, the bulk of his corpse forming a mountain range at the edge of a region latter called &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBotaan's fall.\nDuring the battle between Grond and the Sporemounds, pieces of their bodies had fallen to the earth and given rise to new types of creatures. From the seeds and roots of Zang, Naanu and Botaan, many unique beings sprouted, the greatest of which were the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, while from the largest boulders that had toppled from Grond, the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s arose. Much of the stony debris that had fallen from the giant also contained the elements of fire, air, earth and water, leading to the birth of myriads of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. Aggramar was confident that the colossals would be able to destroy Botaan and bring balance to Draenor, and to aid them he crafted great discs inscribed with titan runes from the body of Grond and fused them to the colossals, creating armor that granted them strength and resilience. In the meantime, Botaan and the genesaur had begun to retake lands Grond had taken from the Evergrowth. As Aggramar unleashed the colossals against Botaan, he felt a &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; dying somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and left to investigate with the promise he would return one day. He never did.\nThe colossals would never know of Aggramar's fate at the hands of Sargeras and fully expected their master to return. They were determined to bring balance to Draenor before that happened, but it was an enormous task, for the Evergrowth had enveloped much of the world and Botaan now eclipsed Grond in size. It would have to be drawn away from the Evergrowth if the colossals had any chance of succeeding, and so they drew its ire by hacking way at the forests at the Evergrowth's edge. Botaan rallied the genesaur and they stormed toward the colossals, which retreated into barren ravines and hills that would give them the advantage. Botaan followed them as it saw the colossals as only pale imitations of Grond, and when it left the borders of the Evergrowth the colossals attacked with their full might. The ensuing war shook Draenor for thousands of years, with control of the world constantly moving back and forth between the two forces.\nThe battles over time took their toll on the colossals. Just as they had broken off from Grond, pieces of their bodies that broke off came to life as the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;. The colossals called on the magnaron to fight the Evergrowth, but they did not obey. Some did indeed battle the forces of Botaan, but not out of loyalty to the colossals, and others simply left the battlefield to seek out areas of volcanic activity. The colossals' numbers were dwindling and they had to take drastic action or they would fail. The titan discs that made their armor contained immense power, and that power would stop the Evergrowth. The colossals piled onto Botaan and unleashed the energy in unison, creating a massive explosion. It shattered the bodies of Botaan and the colossals and sent the pieces all across Draenor. Botaan's death rattle blazed through every root and leaf in the world, causing lush tracts of forests to wither and instantly killing hundreds of genesaur where they stood. For one brief moment, the entirety of the Evergrowth trembled with the shared agony of Botaan's death. Then there was silence. Botaan's demise had destroyed the communal sentience of Draenor's wilds. Unlike the fallen colossals, Botaan's body still contained potent life energies. Wherever fragments of the being fell to the earth, forests and jungles arose, while the bulk of its body formed a vibrant region later known as &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;.\nEchoes of the Sporemounds.\nThe magnaron would gradually give rise to lesser creatures \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The common ancestry of these so-called &lt;a href=\"breakers\"&gt;breakers&lt;/a&gt; did not make them allies, but it did infuse them with a shadow of Grond's influence, and all of them were opposed to the verdant wilds. The genesaur and other plant-based life were known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"primals\"&gt;primals&lt;/a&gt;, and they traced their lineage back to the Sporemounds; much like the breakers, many of them had arisen in the aftermath of Botaan's destruction, but while the numerous spores released from Botaan's corpse had weakened the creatures of stone, they had the opposite effect on plant life, granting existing plant species sentience and causing new beings to take shape in the jungles. Among these were the diminutive &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the intelligent and prolific &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;. Faint memories of the Evergrowth lingered in the botani's minds, but they did not know the full truth of the Sporemounds or their battles with Grond and the colossals. Even so, what little the botani knew of the Evergrowth had a profound impact on their culture, leading them to revere the genesaur as gods due to seeing the larger creatures as echoes of the Sporemounds.\nThe birth of Taala.\nMany years later, a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; wandered the dense forests of &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. From the genesaur, it learned of the Evergrowth, the Sporemounds, and the ancient past of Draenor. Over millennia, it used its magics to strengthen its fellow primals in their war against the breakers while also honing its own abilities to influence and control its kin. It found particular potential in the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and became their caretaker, teaching them the truth of the Sporemounds and unique ways to harness nature magic. Gnarlgar eventually became aware of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, which it saw as an immense affront to nature and an even greater threat than the breakers. Gnarlgar departed Talador in search of a weapon to use against the Apexis, and discovered a massive fossilized root - one of the last remaining intact pieces of Botaan's body. The treant returned to Talador and rallied the botani, telling them that they would use the root to craft a new Sporemound, greater than any that had come before it, to cast the Apexis from their lofty spire. Gnarlgar planted the root deep within Talador and began a great ritual to nourish it. Thousands of botani willingly sacrificed themselves, and Gnarlgar infused their spirits into the root. Gradually, leaves and branches sprouted from the earth and grew into a mound of thorny brambles and leathery fronds. Gnarlgar named the burgeoning Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the primals prepared for war, awakening new genesaur from their birthing pools while Gnarlgar channeled the Spirit of Life into the forest to gift thousands of trees with intelligence, naming them the &lt;a href=\"Gnarled\"&gt;Gnarled&lt;/a&gt;. Tens of thousands of primals gathered in Talador to await Taala's awakening.\nThe Apexis initially ignored the stirrings in Talador, believing them to be part of the war between the breakers and primals, but began to worry when the few scouts that returned described armies of living trees, botani and genesaur, as well as a monstrous creature that was already larger than a genesaur. The leaders of the Anhari and Skalaxi orders quickly mobilized the Apexis into an invasion force and struck at the heart of Talador, ignoring the other primals and focusing solely on destroying Taala. Brutal fighting erupted between the arakkoa and the primals, but despite the magic powers at their command, the Apexis could not break the primals. Gnarlgar entered a trance that allowed it to touch the minds of the primals and coordinate their movements, driving the arakkoa back into the skies. Nearly half of the Apexis forces had fallen, but the Anhar order proposed a solution. Its priests had devised an ingenious weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, that could channel the energies of the sun to devastating effect. As the Anhari began work on the device, Gnarlgar quickened Taala's maturation, ordering more botani to sacrifice themselves so that the Sporemound could be awakened before the arakkoa could regroup.\nFinally, Taala stirred, rising up from the ground as the forests trembled at its first step. Gnarlgar entered a trance once again to reach out its mind to Taala and the other primals to order them to march upon the Apexis. The Apexis realized they could not complete their weapon in time, but a small number of Skalaxi sorcerers volunteered to assassinate the primals' leader. They shrouded themselves in shadow and stalked through the forests until they found Gnarlgar, but the treant sensed their presence and quickly disposed of them, though not before the sorcerers had managed to cast a withering curse upon the treant. Gnarlgar's roots and boughs rotted and withered until it collapsed beside its assassins. Gnarlgar's death sent the primals into disarray, and for a time they halted at the edge of &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt; before resuming their march, but the delay had been enough for the arakkkoa to complete their work. Just as Taala reached the spire, the Anhari ignited the weapon. A violent tremor shook the spire as solar energies roared through it and a white-hot beam exploded from the mechanism to lance through Taala's chest, blowing it apart in a cloud of spores and ash. The Breath of Rukhmar sliced through the botani, genesaur, and Gnarled, incinerating thousands in an instant. The few that survived retreated to Talador in terror, but they were engulfed in flames by the Apexis's Anhari order. The forests that had crept into Arak were seared away. Once the attack was halted, blackened earth and smoldering roots stretched as far as the eye could see. The Evergrowth had been annihilated forever and would never return again."}

Freeing a bound elemental makes him an \"&lt;a href=\"unbound%20elemental\"&gt;unbound elemental&lt;/a&gt;\" as seen during &lt;a href=\"Unbinding\"&gt;Unbinding&lt;/a&gt;. There are other bound elementals in World of Warcraft not using the \"Bound elemental\" model. Some of them like the &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Bound Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s even share the same name.\nDesigning.\nWorld of Warcraft Art Director &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Robinson\"&gt;Chris Robinson&lt;/a&gt; explained that during the development of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" the art team was sick of seeing the old elemental models in the game, so they wanted people to look at new content. Throughout the process they also started working with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; art heavily keyed into the &lt;a href=\"Elementium\"&gt;Elementium&lt;/a&gt; vibe. Since the Twilight's Hammer needed to subjugate elementals, the art team wanted to integrate the elementium vibe to the new look of the elementals. The solution was that the Twilight's Hammer literaly cage them in a physical elementium structure around the elementals to control them, meaning that all the different new elemental models got the same cage holding them.\nThe purpose of the cages comes up in quests like &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Extermination\"&gt;Twilight Extermination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy%20for%20the%20Bound\"&gt;Mercy for the Bound&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unbinding\"&gt;Unbinding&lt;/a&gt;, but not all elementals that use these models are enslaved by the Twilight's Hammer.\nNote.\n\"Binding\" in the context of elementals can also mean imprisoning one, as in &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Stones of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, or summoning them into a coherent form from their element, as in &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20Our%20Troubles\"&gt;Core of Our Troubles&lt;/a&gt;."}

Several tables are located outside the main cities (&lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Exodar\"&gt;The Exodar&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;), and smaller groups of tables can be found at various other towns.\nHow the table works.\nEach Bountiful Table has 5 chairs around it, allowing up to 5 characters to sit at one table. Each seat is named for the Pilgrim's Bounty dish shown to the right of that location:\nThe chairs use the &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;vehicle mechanics&lt;/a&gt; in that you \"mount\" it, and while there are provided an action bar unique to that position. \nEach seat at the table is in easy reach of one dish. Initially, only two options are available: pass your dish, and \"eat (your dish)\".\nThe first option of each chair is \"pass your dish\", with the dish icon representing the dish you can reach on the table. Target one of the other chairs, and select this option, to pass your dish to that chair. If someone is sitting in that chair, AND already has that dish on their plate, you bounce the food off their head. (In the case of the chutney, 'theoretically', since chutney is not well known for bouncing...). Otherwise, it adds your dish to that plate, even if nobody is currently sitting there. \nThe other 5 options presented are to eat the food depicted (turkey, chutney, stuffing, sweet potato, or pie). As others pass their dish (to you), those options will become enabled.\nEating any of the food at the table gives you a short-lived (5 minute) buff, with the buff icon showing that food item. These buffs stack up to 5. If you get all 5 buffs up to 5, you lose those buffs and gain instead &lt;a href=\"The%20Spirit%20of%20Sharing\"&gt;The Spirit of Sharing&lt;/a&gt;, a 60 minute buff that increases your reputation gains by 10%.\nNotes.\n\"Bouncing food off another person's head\" is done by passing food while you have someone targeted and they already have a full stack of that food available. You can get the warning \"invalid target\" if you try passing food while having someone targeted who is not at the table.\nFood from other positions at the table are consumed, and may need to be passed again. You can also move to another chair.\nFood passed from another chair will last for up to 5 minutes at that position unless consumed first."}

Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Bovan and his tribe were located in a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; camp in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; when they were approached by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;.

Believing that the visions came from the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe made the decision to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to heading to the Dragon Isles, Bovan shared his vision with Baine and the other tauren at Thunder Bluff, gaining recruits along the way. However as the Windtotem traversed the plains, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; forces, who were convinced that the Windtotem were &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; seeking to aid the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile some Windtotem were able to escape the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, others were taken prisoner and brough to the &lt;a href=\"Shikaar%20Highlands\"&gt;Shikaar Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, with Bovan being amongst the later. Though revealing himself as the leader of the Windtotem, he was taken to &lt;a href=\"Nokhudon%20Hold\"&gt;Nokhudon Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his arrival he was personally interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Jamoku\"&gt;Jamoku&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately lost his life. His body was later discovered by Baine, who in his grief and rage attacked the centaur and personally avenged Bovan by killing Jamoku.\nIn the aftermath his body was recovered and taken to &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;, the Windtotem and &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; held a joint funeral for their shared fallen.

In her youth, Pathonia was caught three times for stealing, causing the guard of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to give her the choice of working for them or be hanged. She subsequently chose the kingdom, and when she carried out assassination missions she always made her to disguise them as anything other than what it was. She taught her daughter the trade and when she died, she taught her grandson Mathias. She always wore a grotesque amount of rings.\nIn the RPG.\nPathonia Shaw was the founder and leader of a guild of &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s called the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassins\"&gt;Stormwind Assassins&lt;/a&gt;. For over 30 years she led them through times of peace, and even during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wars\"&gt;Great Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Her grandson &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; would succeed her in leading the &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;'s guild. &lt;a href=\"Waltion%20Freemore\"&gt;Waltion Freemore&lt;/a&gt; was her lover, unbeknownst to everyone.\nBiography.\nLeader of the Stormwind Assassins.\nLong before any of the wars, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; felt it was unable to do everything it wanted to within the law. One of its leaders, &lt;a href=\"Erwill%20Youngton\"&gt;Erwill Youngton&lt;/a&gt;, secretly approached a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; in one of their prisons called Pathonia Shaw. She had been imprisoned repeatedly for theft, caught perhaps three times at most, and she was notorious for scores of high profile crimes. Youngton offered her clemency if she agreed to form a society to take care of Stormwind's dirty work quickly and cleanly. She agreed at once and added that she would find a way to do it with a sense of style as well. The &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassins\"&gt;Stormwind Assassins&lt;/a&gt; began that day, with Pathonia Shaw sneaking into a corrupt &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; mayor's room that night and killing him, making sure to keep the bedroom immaculate: not a drop of blood spilled nor a sheet rumpled. With the agreement of Erwill Youngton, she combed the prisons for her fellow thieves to bring into the family, as they were called and soon built a small force to serve the kingdom.\nAmong the first rogues, she recruited from the Stockade was &lt;a href=\"Waltion%20Freemore\"&gt;Waltion Freemore&lt;/a&gt;, a man who served as her right-hand and lover for 30 years, helping her build the guild into the powerhouse it would become. No one knew of the relationship he had with her, and he promised to keep that secret.\nShaw had been a thief for the thrills and was not necessarily evil. Once she was allowed to do her favorite thing in the world and still get paid for it, she became a loyal fighter to the crown. She made sure to hammer this home in her recruits: one does not steal from the hand that feeds. If the thrill of the stolen goods and the secret kill, along with a steady salary, was not good enough for her thieves, they were not initiated into the guild. She had one other requirement when she built the society: secrecy was a must. The king of Stormwind is the only one with a full list of the Stormwind Assassins, and when one was assigned to be part of a larger operation, her true purpose was not revealed to the other troops.\nPathonia and her assassins were there when the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s poured from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, taking out stray &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s, and eventually even &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leaders.\nAt some point, Waltion and Pathonia had a daughter (and later a grandson called &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias&lt;/a&gt;) who eventually also joined the guild, becoming a First Finger assassin, but she would die on the job when Pathonia's grandson was 4 years old.\nRetirement.\nAfter many years leading the Stormwind Assassins, Shaw retired 10 years ago and put her grandson Mathias in charge. She had groomed him for the job from when he was an infant, testing his speed and dexterity on a physical level and making sure he understood the difference between doing what was right and doing what was necessary, and how those two do not always mix. Pathonia had chosen to retire instead of die and leave things in disarray for him."}

This would be a play on the words Bat Masterson, another lawman of the American Old West, William Barclay \"Bat\" Masterson (1853\u20131921).\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Garrett\"&gt;Jonathan Garrett&lt;/a&gt;."}

In &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; armor penetration rating was removed from all items as part of Blizzard's effort to \"simplify statistics\" for \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". Armor penetration rating that was on items prior to Patch 4.0.1 was converted to &lt;a href=\"critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste rating&lt;/a&gt; depending on which stat was not previously present. Percentage-based armor penetration is still present in a few passive and active abilities.\nThe following passive and active abilities reduce or ignore a target's armor:\nNone of the 4% armor debuffs stack with one another.\nHistory.\nArmor penetration rating.\nArmor penetration is a rating system that affects a percentage of armor ignored. This means that upgrades scale more cleanly with all bosses but has a side effect of becoming less useful on low armor ones.\nThe conversion rate is about 7 ArP = 1 ArP rating. So if you had 1000 ArP, you now have 142.8 ArP rating. In the past, this would have been a 6% gain on a 15k armor foe and a 12.5% gain on an 8k armor foe; at level 80 it now gives a 9.2% gain to both targets.\nPercentage-based ArP.\nThis was Pre-WOTLK:\nSince some talents operate on percentages such as &lt;a href=\"Mace%20Specialization%20%28Warrior%20talent%29\"&gt;Mace Specialization&lt;/a&gt;, they operate onto the already existing modifiers. Instead of ignoring armor from the base value of the target immediately, it takes into account the effects of &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Expose%20Armor\"&gt;Expose Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;Curse of Weakness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sting\"&gt;Sting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Spit\"&gt;Acid Spit&lt;/a&gt; and then does a post operation of the value when it calculates mace specialization and piercing shots.\nIn addition, what this entails for percentage based ArP is that the higher the armor the greater the ArP raw value and the lesser the armor the less ArP raw value. That is to say, percentage based ArP suffers diminishing returns for heavily sundered units in terms of raw ArP value, especially for those with very low armor value.\nNow everything operates in percentages and stacks additively in two categories: Debuffs and personal Armor Penetration. The two categories stack multiplicatively with each other.\nArmor penetration benefits.\nArmor penetration will increase non-&lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; physical damage by a percentage significant for virtually every target, however, for lightly armored targets it is less effective in the damage it provides.\nFrom the perspective of a warrior, because armor penetration increases damage, he will get a moderate gain in &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; generation as a result of higher armor penetration. Also, armor penetration causes the warrior to increase &lt;a href=\"Execute\"&gt;Execute&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nOpportunistically, from a PvP point of view, a warrior may apply fewer stacks of &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;, assuming they have a higher armor pen than usual, because they have a head start on armor ignored. Or they may choose to boost the sustained damage further by a significant percentage by applying more stacks.\nCountering armor penetration.\nTo effectively neutralize or counter the effectiveness of armor penetration one could simply increase their armor value in combat time with drinking potions such as &lt;a href=\"Indestructible%20Potion\"&gt;Indestructible Potion&lt;/a&gt;, changing to &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt;, equipping a &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, dropping a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stoneskin Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, casting &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Fire\"&gt;Inner Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20Aura\"&gt;Devotion Aura&lt;/a&gt;, or speccing in &lt;a href=\"Thick%20Hide%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thick Hide (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. You can also enchant your gear with armor. For example: &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Cloak%20-%20Mighty%20Armor\"&gt;Enchant Cloak - Mighty Armor&lt;/a&gt; to counter armor pen. In short, armor penetration is really only countered by more armor.\nTechnical explanation from Ghostcrawler.\nQuote from: Ghostcrawler\n\"Okay, here is a fairly technical explanation we put together for how armor pen works.\"\n\"We didn\u2019t want Armor Penetration Rating to be too powerful against low armor targets, like it had been in BC. We also didn\u2019t want Armor Penetration Rating to be too powerful against high armor targets.\"\n\"So, we decided on a system where there is a cap on how much armor the Armor Penetration Rating can be applied to. So, the first X armor on the target is reduced by the percentage listed in the Armor Penetration Rating tooltip, and all armor past that X is unaffected. Another way of understanding that is we multiply the percentage in the tooltip times the minimum of the two values: the cap, and the amount of armor on the target after all other modifiers.\"\n\"Computing the cap is a little tricky unless you are already familiar with how World of Warcraft armor works. There is an armor constant we\u2019ll call C. C is derived as follows (in some pseudocode):\"\n If (level&lt;60)\n C=400+85*targetlevel\n Else\"\n C=400+85*targetlevel+4.5*85*(targetlevel-59);\n\"For a level 80 target, C=15232.5. For a level 83, C=16635.\"\n\"The cap for Armor Penetration then is: (armor + C)/3.\"\n\"A level 80 warrior creature has 9729 armor. C=15232.5. So, the cap is (9729+15232.5)/3=8320.5. Let\u2019s say a player has 30% armor penetration from armor penetration rating and no other modifiers that complicate the calculation (talents, Battle Stance, Sunder Armor, etc.). The game chooses the minimum of 8320.5 and 9729, so 8320.5. That is multiplied by 30% = 2496.15, and so that much armor is ignored. The effective armor on the target is 7232.85 (9729-2496.15). From a player point of view, the armor penetration rating didn\u2019t ignore the full 30%, but instead ignored 25.66%. (85.5% as effective as expected).\"\n\"These equations should help you be able to test and verify that Armor Penetration Rating is working correctly and as we designed. The tooltip is not actually inaccurate, as it states: \u201cEnemy armor reduced by up to 30.00%.\u201d That \"up to\" is key.\"\n\"Please be sure to test without any other effects which modify the armor calculation (Battle Stance, Sunder Armor, Mace Specialization, etc.) as they may involve other systems that add additional complexity to the calculation.\"\nThe formula for the Armor Penetration cap can be simplified to \"ArPcap = (935/6)*x + y/3 -44335/6\", where \"x\" is the target level and \"y\" the target armor. Then \"effArmor = targetArmor - ArP * min{ targetArmor, ArPcap}\" as explained above, with the Armor Penetration \"ArP\" of your character. \"ArP\" is given, lately changed in 3.1.2, by the formula \"ArP = min{ 1,(Sum ArPcontributions)%}\".\nCalculating.\nCalculating the ARP it's done in 2 parts:\nFirst up - the debuffs. These reduce your target's initial armor. For example, if your target has 10k armor and it gets 20% sunder, its armor would be 8k. The debuffs stack additively, so &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; will stack with sunder, totaling a 25% reduction on the target, taking it to 7.5k armor.\nSecond, comes the formula GC provided, you grab the armor after the debuff calculation and to that armor you apply the formula (armor + C)/3. Using the same example as before, lets say the target is level 80, so C=15232.5, now calculate (7500 + 15232.5)/3 = 7577.5. This makes the target's armor lower than the result, meaning that each 1% removes 75 armor and you are hitting a 0 armor target on the 100% ARP get. The ArP \"buffs\" (items, stances and such) stack additively too, meaning that 90% ARP on battle stance for a warrior would mean a 100% ARP final."}

Since the Armory pulls its data from the actual game &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;s, it is the most comprehensive database on the characters, arena teams, and guilds of \"World of Warcraft\" in existence.\nWhile the Armory data gets automatically updated, it is not a quite suitable replacement for traditional, non-\"life\" character databases. This is because it only saves a character's status after their last &lt;a href=\"logout\"&gt;logout&lt;/a&gt;, so there is no way to display multiple sets of gear (for instance healing, PvP, or resistance sets) or the effects of different &lt;a href=\"talent%20build\"&gt;talent build&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen the Armory first came up, many players were concerned that their items and stats were viewable for all to see. This was the core of &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard's &lt;a href=\"Tinfoil%20Hat\"&gt;Tinfoil Hat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"April%20Fool%27s%20joke\"&gt;April Fool's joke&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Character%20profile\"&gt;Character profile&lt;/a&gt;s below &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 10 or that have been inactive for a sufficiently long period of time are not displayed.\nBeta Status.\nBefore \"Cataclysm\", the Armory was in &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt;, and as such had quite a few problems with errors and the speed of the site in general.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, many mechanics of \"World of Warcraft\" were changed but are not yet reflected in the Armory. Missing mechanics include: &lt;a href=\"Reforging\"&gt;Reforging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; enchantments, and Prime &lt;a href=\"Glyph\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlayer vs. Player Leaderboards.\nEvery season, the Armory keeps track of the top point-five percent of teams from a region's &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; teams. These teams are commemorated in the Player vs. Player Leaderboards (previously know as Arena Hall of Fame). Individual members that play more than twenty percent of a team's games are given special rewards, such as exclusive &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s and specialized &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPatch changes.\nSee &lt;a href=\"armory%20updates\"&gt;armory updates&lt;/a&gt; for the list of updates to The Armory.\nExternal links.\nArmory alternatives.\nTo avoid network and interface lag sometimes found with the Armory, and to show some style differences and provide additional tools, a few alternatives have been created."}

He serves as the second boss of the dungeon.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The weapons of the Scarlet Crusade are many, and new initiates must be indoctrinated in the use of blade, hammer, arrow, and shield--effective tools against the undead. Armsmaster Harlan has dedicated his life to the art of wielding these indelicate instruments, and he is pleased to provide a demonstration for the Crusade's &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; enemies.\"\nStrategy.\nThe tank should, if possible, taunt and tank the boss upstairs, near the entrance to Harlan's room. The boss should be tanked standing sideways to the door, and the rest of the party should stand behind the boss because of his Dragon's Reach attack (80% weapon damage in front the caster).\nScarlet Defenders will join the fight on occasion and they'll come through the door. This is one of the reasons Harlan is best tanked upstairs. Let the tank get aggro, then quickly do 600 damage (60,000 damage on heroic) to them to break their armor, then finish them off, if possible. Remember that Scarlet Defenders take 90% less from area effect damage (AOEs).\nThe major part of this fight is Blades of Light. He will jump to the center of the room and wind up a six second cast before starting Blades of Light. Being upstairs will allow everyone to have time to jump back down and then run back up, while avoiding him. Harlan should finish Blades of Light right where he started. Everyone should resume starting positions and repeat until the boss is dead. Blades of Light is pretty much an insta-kill on heroic mode. If the tank or the healer gets sucked in you should just wipe, unless Harlan's life is near dead.\nDuring Blades of Light the tank should, if possible, taunt off the Scarlet Defenders off the healer or anyone else who might have them. Luckily the boss's attack also sucks the adds and makes quick work of them (it will kill them if they have no armor on)."}

She also drove the Horde\u2019s Army Supply Cart, a massive, rumbling behemoth of a wagon. While other factions of the Horde \u2014 not to mention the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had to fight on dried meat, cereals and whatever they could catch while traveling, Miss P. kept Thrall\u2019s troops fed very well.\nAlthough she let no one but Thrall on her cart (he insisted on seeing why she was the best goblin for the job), the Horde soon figured that she had more than food supplies on the cart. Her stews had chunks of fresh meat, and her underlings hunted only every week or so.\nMiss P. had outfitted the inside of her supply cart with a large refrigeration unit and a &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;-powered stove. Shelves line the walls of the cart, making ample room for supplies."}
