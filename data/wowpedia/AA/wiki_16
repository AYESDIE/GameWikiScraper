He hunted the remaining naga down to the last and none escaped his wrath, but as he killed the naga leader she cast a spell that cursed the souls of Kimbul's followers into unending torment. Until their souls were freed, Kimbul could not accept new followers for honor would not allow it. He took a powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"%3ARing%20of%20Tides\"&gt;:Ring of Tides&lt;/a&gt; as his trophy from the battle with Mepjila.\nTraveler.\nKimbul was summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; so they could sacrifice their prisoners - &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; - to him.

Seeking his help against the naga threat, the &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tortaka%20tribe\"&gt;Tortaka tribe&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Kimbul at his temple.

The trolls tamed the devilsaur, believing that he alone held an antidote for the savage disease devastating their people.\"\nTactics.\nThis is an easy tank and spank fight. The healer needs to be careful of Grievous Bite. Lay on Hands is an excellent way to remove the debuff. The armor debuff combined with heavy bleed damage can be stressful on the healer. Another important factor is to either pull the adds before King Dred or to dps them once they are called by Raptor Call.\nBellowing Roar is a 35 yard range which enables healers to out range the fear altogether. Shamans can use Tremor Totem, Priests can use Fear Ward to help the tank from moving. Warrior tanks can use Berserker Rage to break the fear, and Feral druids that have specced that far can use &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt;. Having the healer stand at maximum range from the tank (with the tank facing the mob towards the healer) will ensure the healer never gets feared.\nAn alternative tactic is to have a heavy-armor dpser taunt King Dred when he emotes \"King Dred raises his claws menacingly\", indicating that he is about to cast his three strikes in quick succession. Often a plate-wearer (or druid in bear form) can survive these attacks so long as the boss is quickly taunted back off of them. This will spread out the damage and greatly reduce the effect of the armor reduction debuff from Piercing Slash.\nObjective of.\nHe drops &lt;a href=\"King%20Dred%27s%20Tooth\"&gt;King Dred's Tooth&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"What%20the%20Scourge%20Dred\"&gt;What the Scourge Dred&lt;/a&gt;."}

To become king, you'll have to kill the king that's ruling over the ogres at that point, whoever it is. The Gordoks will respect you through that, and will shower you with gifts. The only disadvantage of being King Gordok is that you can never leave Dire Maul \u2014 the ogres will appoint another when you stroll away.\nTerrible whispers from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; plagued King Gordok's mind, urging him to madness and slaughter. He commanded his clan to indiscriminately murder anyone they could find. In Year 25, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; dispatched its forces to scour the Gordunni ogres from Dire Maul. They expected only to kill Gordok, but soon they found the manifestation of Emerald Nightmare's power that drove Gordok to insanity and they knew they needed to eradicate it.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"To rule the Gordok ogres, one must simply proclaim oneself king... and then destroy all who might disagree. King Gordok--then merely known as Ulrok--solidified his power by convincing a dozen of his people's strongest warriors to challenge the king at the same time. The wild melee left most of the contestants dead or wounded, and Ulrok's blade easily cut down the survivors and the battle-weary king. To this day, Gordok ogres speak in hushed tones about the \"Day of Da Blood.\"\"\nTraveler.\nAt some point, he paid &lt;a href=\"Chugara%20Razorflank\"&gt;Chugara Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; to build him a dome of thorns in Dire Maul. He sent raiders to get new slaves for his gladiatorial combats.\nKing Gordok, seated on his throne in a great stone temple dedicated to a long-forgotten or long-ignored god, received new prisoners from &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Gordok then watched the matches of slaves his clan had enslaved, including the boy &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. He was constantly slapping a young &lt;a href=\"ogre%20girl\"&gt;ogre girl&lt;/a&gt; to show dominance and threatening the gladiators to kill their opponents. When Aram refused to kill the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, Gordok ordered to summon the captured &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; Old &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; attacked Dire Maul and its leader, Captain &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; issued the &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; challenge to Gordok. The King initially refused, so Malus's companion the ogre &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; agreed to issue the duel, but Malus chose to fight as Throgg's champion. Malus killed the ogre leader and became the new King Gordok.\nWhether this Gordok and the Gordok encountered in the game were the same is unclear as the Gordok from the book is depicted slightly different: with blue-black beard, nose-ring, and piercings across his shoulders. This may imply that Ulrok had been killed (in original \"World of Warcraft\" or \"Cataclysm\") and succeeded by a new one later.\nTactics.\n&lt;a href=\"Cho%27Rush%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Cho'Rush the Observer&lt;/a&gt; backs up King Gordok when the party fights him, although he seems mostly limited to spellcasting instead of engaging in melee attacks. One member of the party should watch Cho'Rush and prevent him from casting beneficial spells on King Gordok or damaging spells on other party members. The rest should concentrate on &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;dps'ing&lt;/a&gt; King Gordok; as soon as the King falls, Cho'Rush will cease hostilities. When soloing, it is easier to take out Cho'Rush the Observer first."}

He left no clues where he was headed and over time his legend faded into history until the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vault\"&gt;Forgotten Vault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has a vision to return anyone of &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;flesh&lt;/a&gt; into more pure robotic parts and it will be up to &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to put a stop on his plans.

He established a new kingdom on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;, named eponymously after himself, and built a new gnomish society, the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt;, named for their mechanical forebears.\nStories related years later to the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; hint that even then, he was a ruler of questionable sanity. According to &lt;a href=\"Vera%20Lonelycog\"&gt;Vera Lonelycog&lt;/a&gt;, the seventh proclamation he made as king (as in, a law he made within days of being crowned) was to outlaw any non-mechanical creature smaller than an infant. He then had his soldiers arrest anything that fit that description, including rabbits, squirrels, and even fish, then put them on trial, having most of them mechanized, exiled, or executed.\nMechagon.\nWhen the elderly gnome explorer &lt;a href=\"Kervo\"&gt;Kervo&lt;/a&gt; crashlanded on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;, he was found by Mechagon and a group of mechagnomes. The mechagnomes were shocked at the sight of Kervo's wrinkly skin, with Mechagon explaining that it was what happened when mortals grew old. The king ordered his subjects to bring the outsider into Mechagon City. When Kervo woke up, Mechagon brought him on a tour of the city, explaining that the people of Mechagon were reverting the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; in order to become flawless like their &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; ancestors. The king showed Kervo how the mechanization process worked. When Kervo pointed out that the procedure looked and sounded like torture, the king replied that the pain of mechanization was only temporary compared to the constant, inescapable pain of aging and death.\nKervo was later approached by Mechagon's son &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Erazmin&lt;/a&gt;, who urged him to leave the city and warn his people about a device Mechagon planned to use to forcibly remove the Curse of Flesh from all organic life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kervo decided he couldn't leave the city empty-handed and went to the king to inform him of his son's treachery. As a reward, Mechagon brought Kervo to the device Erazmin had shown him earlier, explaining that its process would be instant as opposed to the years-long mechanization process normally used. While he had never used the device on his own people before, Mechagon argued that they hadn't earned it like Kervo had.\nWhen the device was activated, Kervo was instantly transformed into a mindless completely mechanical being, unable to do anything except repeat the words \"Found it\" over and over again. One of the technicians noted that there seemed to be some damage, and Mechagon told him to make adjustments to the device so it wouldn't malfunction when used on the entire world. As for Kervo, Mechagon was of the opinion that he had gotten what he wanted, and all the time in the world to enjoy it.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; manages to gain entry into the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vault\"&gt;Forgotten Vault&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Junkheap\"&gt;Abandoned Junkheap&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, activating an image projector with a message from King Mechagon, who promises to \"cure\" the Curse of Flesh and invites the listeners in the vault to his island, providing the &lt;a href=\"Tri-dimensional%20Coordinates\"&gt;the coordinates to get there&lt;/a&gt;. However, \"unworthy\" presences are detected within, and the non-gnomish members of Overspark's team are vaporized. As the beam scans Overspark's assistant, &lt;a href=\"Gila%20Crosswires\"&gt;Gila Crosswires&lt;/a&gt;, Overspark appears to spare her by breaking the machine, but in actuality, the beam stopped because it had identified Gila as being a gnome. Shortly after Overspark leaves to lead his expedition to Mechagon, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Greasemonkeys\"&gt;Greasemonkeys&lt;/a&gt; arrive, having followed Overspark; Gazlowe finds the same message, and loses several of his crew to the vault's defenses before he brings the lone &lt;a href=\"Archaeo-Tinkologist\"&gt;Archaeo-Tinkologist&lt;/a&gt; his crew spared into the beam. As with Gila, the detection of a gnome in the vault deactivates the defenses and gives them the coordinates as well.\nOverspark and Gazlowe both arrive in &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; and meet with Prince Erazmin, who leads the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; against his father's rule. Motivated by his hatred for all organic life, Mechagon's plan is to use his &lt;a href=\"mechoriginator\"&gt;mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt;, the device he used to \"decurse\" Kervo, to forcibly \"cure\" the Curse of Flesh and mechanize all life on Azeroth.\nAlternate timeline.\nIn a future &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;, King Mechagon won and activated the Mechoriginator, but it did not work the way he planned. It instead ignited a global firestorm and killed everyone without mechanical augmentations.\nDragonflight.\nAlternate version of Mechagon appears named Overlord Mechagon. "}

However, when a &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Claximus\"&gt;Claximus&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the Winterfin's home caverns and used his magic to take control of most of the tribe, the unaffected survivors retreated to across the strait and named the reluctant Mrgl-Mrgl as their new king. The disguised night elf offers several &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help them save the Winterfin tribe and defeat Claximus.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, King Mrgl-Mrgl enters the fray against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt;, still using his murloc costume.

Hemet, believing the night elf to not be quite right in the head, sends &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Nesingwary's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; to seek him out in the &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%20Cove\"&gt;Shipwreck Cove&lt;/a&gt;. Once they arrive, Mrgl-Mrgl tells them that the intends to save the ruthless &lt;a href=\"Swamprock%20tribe\"&gt;Swamprock&lt;/a&gt; murlocs \u2014 who enjoy intentionally causing shipwrecks along the shore \u2014 by raising a young murloc named &lt;a href=\"Murky\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader of the tribe, rather than simply sending the adventurer out to kill the adult Swamprocks. To this end, the adventurer helps Murky grow stronger, learn new abilities and recruit the Swamprock tadpoles to the cause.\nAfter the recruitment of the tadpoles, Mrgl-Mrgl decides that the nearby &lt;a href=\"Murkloc%20Cave\"&gt;Murkloc Cave&lt;/a&gt; would be the perfect hideout for Murky and his followers to train and muster their strength away from the adults, but first the &lt;a href=\"Cavemoss\"&gt;Cavemoss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting the area need to be shown \"what for\". Since Murky is inexperienced, Mrgl-Mrgl has the adventurer \"mindmeld\" with the young murloc in order to drive out the makrura and kill their leader, &lt;a href=\"Clawdayshus\"&gt;Clawdayshus&lt;/a&gt;. Upon Clawdayshus' death, King Mrgl-Mrgl charges into the cave with the Swamprock tadpoles in tow, proclaiming that the cave now belongs to the \"&lt;a href=\"Murkloc%20tribe\"&gt;Murkloc tribe&lt;/a&gt;\".

Most of his interactions with the player involve trying to restock the bar in order to keep the murlocs entertained and well-fed, something he acknowledges is difficult, due to the ferocity shown by this particular branch of the species. He even asks the player to hunt for &lt;a href=\"crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;s, admitting that doing so is contradictory to the overall goal of D.E.H.T.A., claiming it is necessary to prevent the patrons from preying on humans.\nQuotes.\nHighmountain.\nOn approach at &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%20Cove\"&gt;Shipwreck Cove&lt;/a&gt;:\nWhen spoken to at Shipwreck Cove:\nUpon leaving and then returning to him while accompanied by Murky:\nUpon accepting :\nUpon mindmelding with &lt;a href=\"Murky%27s%20Egg\"&gt;Murky's Egg&lt;/a&gt;:\nUpon killing &lt;a href=\"Clawdayshus\"&gt;Clawdayshus&lt;/a&gt;:\nWhen spoken to inside the &lt;a href=\"Murkloc%20Cave\"&gt;Murkloc Cave&lt;/a&gt;:\nAzsuna.\nGurglll... wait, oh!

Togwaggle urged one of his followers forward onto the bridge, but the kobold was so intimidated by Marin that he only managed to say the words \"Y-you. You adventurer...\" before forgetting his lines, squeaking \"You no take candle!\" and hurrying back to its fellows, much to Togwaggle's frustration. The Kobold King instead began shouting at Marin, telling him that the tunnels were his and that the adventurer should drop his treasures right now. Marin pointed out that he hadn't obtained any treasure yet and argued that Togwaggle should let him pass so that he could go acquire some, and then he and the kobolds could have a do-over on the Fox's way out. While several of the kobolds were enticed by the idea, Togwaggle wasn't as easily convinced and instead said that \"If you not be dropping, kobolds be taking!\" before ordering his followers to summon a golem.\nThe waxmancers obeyed and used their magic to create a giant candle golem, which stepped out onto the rope bridge to confront Marin. The adventurer, however, managed to blind the wax creature by blowing out the candle flames serving as its eyes and proceeded to make his way toward the end of the bridge, close to the kobolds. However, the confrontation was suddenly interrupted by the sound of an approaching pack of . Togwaggle quickly fled to the bridge, leaving his subjects behind without a second thought. The king's subjects followed after him, but as the other end of the bridge was still blocked by the blinded golem, the kobolds instead took cover behind Marin, forgetting their previous conflict in the face of a greater threat. Suddenly, the bridge gave way and collapsed, sending the adventurer, the golem, and the kobolds tumbling down into the chasm below."}

His people, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt;, are still fanatically loyal to him. Having proven himself to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he was converted to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and is the last boss of &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Utgarde Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Ymiron found the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; closed to him for his betrayal against &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; brought him into her service in the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt; instead. As &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; was stormed by &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; champions, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Battlelord&lt;/a&gt; of the Valarjar convinced Odyn to raise the Fallen King so he could be forced to serve the Keeper for eternity, a fitting punishment for dooming his own people.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nKing Ymiron was the leader of the vrykul before the Sundering, when they were still &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; iron. Under his leadership the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt; finally gained the upper hand against its foes and in a coordinated offensive, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; attacked and drove the &lt;a href=\"jalgar\"&gt;jalgar&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor's&lt;/a&gt; lush central forests. Yet on the heels of this victory, tragedy struck as the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt; took another turn.\nThe curse started turning his metal people to flesh and blood, he blamed the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, and then tried to purge the \u201cweakness\u201d from his own people. Later, Dragonflayer women began giving birth to small, malformed children - a development that spread fear and superstition among the vrykul clans. While some vrykul blamed Ymiron for this affliction, Ymiron himself believed that the mythical &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s were to blame. Ymiron convinced his people to renounce the silent and aloof keepers, who had not been seen or heard from in generations and promised to unite all vrykul clans to his banner.\nSome vrykul were disgusted by these \"aberrations\" and beseeched their ruler, Ymiron, to have them all killed, citing a need to keep the vrykul race pure; others pleaded with him to show them mercy, protesting that despite their weakness, these infants were still their children. Ymiron meditated on the issue for some time before reaching a dangerous conclusion: that because the titans had not come to aid them in their hour of need, and because the vrykul knew of no other beings with power on the same level as their gods, the curse must have been created by the titans. Although this was not the case, the vrykul believed it, and at Ymiron's bidding they forsook their gods and titan worship was outlawed. Ymiron then took the side of those calling for the death of their malformed infants, and decreed that all parents with so-afflicted children must kill their young or be taken to &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt; for execution. While many obeyed Ymiron's brutal orders, some could not and left the Dragonflayer with their children in tow. Thus King Ymiron was indirectly responsible for the creation of what is now the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;human race&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen that didn't work, he had his people go into magical sleep, to be awakened ages later. Ymiron himself was put into a magic sleep before he died, along with many elite vrykul warriors, to be awakened at some point in the future.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; uncovered an event of the distant past, where King Ymiron declared that the old gods - the titans - had abandoned them, and pledged to protect the vrykul race. His first act was to declare that aberrant children, evidently precursors to humans, be destroyed to preserve the vrykul racial purity. Earlier it was shown that some families had acted to preserve these children despite the proclamation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, vrykul fought each other in the pit of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;; the winners of these combats became one of the &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, the elite warrior caste created by King Ymiron in service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the loser became a &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creature.\nDuring the war, his wife, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Angerboda\"&gt;Queen Angerboda&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to awaken him under &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; started moving across &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, so they might serve the vrykul's new death god together. While the adventurers killed Angerboda before the awakening ritual was completed, the Lich King arrived and took Ymiron away to &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Utgarde Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. After proving himself, the Lich King made Ymiron &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and had him lead the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-allied vrykul against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, from his throne in &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. As adventurers stormed the keep, the vrykul king made his last stand at &lt;a href=\"Ymiron%27s%20Seat\"&gt;Ymiron's Seat&lt;/a&gt; where he was killed.\nAfter his death, Ymiron was dragged down to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAs a mighty warrior held in awe by his people, the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; awaited Ymiron in the afterlife. But the vrykul king's hunger for more power led him to striking a dark bargain with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, dooming his people to a cursed existence. And so, after his death, he found the eternal Halls to be closed to him. The damned king thus ended up on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, in service of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, when Odyn's mortal champion, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Battlelord&lt;/a&gt;, led an assault on the Maw of Souls, they struck Ymiron down. The warrior then convinced Odyn that forcing Ymiron into his service would be a perfectly suited punishment, and so he was brought to the Halls of Valor to serve him for the rest of time."}

He regained consciousness to find that his wife had been murdered, his lands besieged by enemies. He has cast off his mortality and demands vengeance, eager to show the terrible resolve of an awakened giant.\"\nAbilities.\nGift of the Fallen Kings.\nWhen King Ymiron reaches 66% and 33% health remaining, he calls upon a fallen vrykul king to grant him a new ability. He retains this ability until he chooses a new fallen king. In Heroic Difficulty, King Ymiron calls on a fallen king at 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% health remaining.\nTactics.\nThis fight requires little strategy but is still quite difficult, particularly in heroic. \nThe primary aspect of this fight is that he hits the tank VERY hard. His normal hits are for ~3k-5k and Dark Slash hits the tank for 50% of their health. \nOccasionally, King Ymiron will cast Bane which causes shadow damage when he is attacked. All DPS need to stop attacking when Bane is up. It needs to be dispelled or spell stolen immediately so dps can resume.\nHe will also occasionally cast Fetid Rot on a random party member, which needs to be removed as quickly as possible. \nEvery 33% HP on normal, and every 20% on heroic, King Ymiron will cast Screams of the Dead, which stuns the entire party for 8 seconds (mages can &lt;a href=\"blink\"&gt;blink&lt;/a&gt; out of this stun and humans can use &lt;a href=\"Will%20to%20Survive\"&gt;Will to Survive&lt;/a&gt;). He will then randomly run to one of the 4 longboats in the room and channel a spell from a &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt; ancestor there. This will give him an additional ability for the next 33 or 20% of his life. After reaching the next 33/20% mark, the previous longboat will burn and that ability will end. Thus, Ymiron will call on two ancestors' blessings during his normal battle, and all four during his heroic battle.\nWith respect to Ymiron's throne, these boats do:\nNear Left Boat &lt;a href=\"King%20Haldor\"&gt;Haldor&lt;/a&gt; - Gives the target the debuff Spirit Strike that increases damage taken. Will stack over time!\nNear Right Boat &lt;a href=\"King%20Bjorn\"&gt;Bjorn&lt;/a&gt; - Allows him to summon &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Fount\"&gt;Spirit Fount&lt;/a&gt;, an orb that does AoE shadow damage and moves around the room slowly. Ymiron needs to be kited away from the Fount and party members need to stay away from it. \nFar Left Boat &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranulf\"&gt;Ranulf&lt;/a&gt; - Give him the ability to cast spirit burst, an AoE shadow nova for ~2k (Heroic: ~4-5k)\nFar Right Boat &lt;a href=\"King%20Tor\"&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; - Allows King Ymiron to summon 4 &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Spirit\"&gt;Avenging Spirit&lt;/a&gt; adds that can be AoE'd down."}

The city was also additionally under effect of a no-fly zone, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Aerial%20Sentry\"&gt;Aerial Sentries&lt;/a&gt; shooting down any lawbreaker.\nAt the Gates of Orgrimmar.\nBefore the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of Thrall voicing his suspicions that he would die. When Sylvanas questioned why she should accept his challenge, Saurfang merely pointed out that she wanted him to suffer, causing Sylvanas to wordlessly agree. While Sylvanas armed herself, Saurfang was granted &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt; by Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; by Anduin. Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, however, when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas he claimed that she failed to kill hope at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other, he further declared that the Horde would endure, that Horde was strong and was able to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This turn caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that Horde was nothing, that they were all nothing. Sylvanas then killed Saurfang quickly with a blast of unknown magic, and abandoned the Horde altogether. Anduin, Zekhan, and Thrall, picked up Saurfang's body and headed to Orgrimmar.\nAftermath.\nSaurfang's funeral.\nWith Varok's death and Sylvanas gone, the Horde entered Orgrimmar while the Forsaken and other loyalists surrendered. A portion of Orgrimmar's population, the Horde leaders, as well as King Anduin and his retinue attended Saurfang's funeral in front of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Both Thrall and Anduin had a speech about Varok. When the funeral was done, the Alliance teleported out of Orgrimmar. Horde leaders &lt;a href=\"Old%20Soldier%20%28Horde%29%23Leader%20dialogue\"&gt;expressed their opinions on the situation&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrder in Orgrimmar.\n&lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Various Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; re-pledged their allegiance to the Horde, along with the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and the led by &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; who had sided with Sylvanas during the conflict. &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Those Horde members&lt;/a&gt; that maintained and expressed their loyalty were chained and transported by &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Grunt\"&gt;Horde Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s away. Despite the pledge, several Forsaken secretly remained loyal to Sylvanas. Since Orgrimmar became leaderless, various Horde leaders maintained order in the streets of Orgrimmar and quelled any turmoil.\nWhen a player approaches various leaders and citizens in Orgrimmar, special scripted events or unique gossip texts appear. \nAuction house.\n&lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20Ralinza\"&gt;Auctioneer Ralinza&lt;/a&gt; refuses to allow a &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Former Banshee Loyalist&lt;/a&gt; to use the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House%20%28Valley%20of%20Strength%29\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt; so &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; steps in.\nBank.\n&lt;a href=\"Rilgiz\"&gt;Rilgiz&lt;/a&gt; is distrustful against a &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Former Banshee Loyalist&lt;/a&gt; and refuses to grant them access to the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Bank of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; arrives to offer his wisdom.\nInn.\nThe patrons of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Tusk\"&gt;The Broken Tusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zazo\"&gt;Zazo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goma\"&gt;Goma&lt;/a&gt;, also have a few words about the current situation as well as about Saurfang's death.\nOrgrimmar Orphanage.\n&lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; is in front of the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Orphanage\"&gt;Orgrimmar Orphanage&lt;/a&gt; telling stories about Saurfang to &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Orphan\"&gt;Horde Orphan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPathfinder's Den.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; patrols the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and enters the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; when a &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Former Banshee Loyalist\u200e&lt;/a&gt; attempts to use a portal, but &lt;a href=\"Stoki%20Wonderwand\"&gt;Stoki Wonderwand&lt;/a&gt; stops them.\nForsaken refugees.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Refugee\"&gt;Forsaken Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt; are saddened by Sylvanas's actions.\nSome lament at Sylvaras while others still believe in her.\nForsaken refugees and Orgrimmar Grunts.\nThere are questions to be answered between Forsaken refugees and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Grunt\"&gt;Orgrimmar Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s. \nOrgrimmar Grunts.\nA pair of grunts is lamenting their choice of allegiance that caused a rift in the family.

Occasionally (approximately every 30-45 minutes), Geya'rah starts her patrol with &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Grunt\"&gt;Mag'har Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s near the western zeppelin tower and continues to the bridge with Thrall, passing by him.\nEitrigg.\n&lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; was one of the main characters in the final chapter of the Horde War Campaign and depending on which side the adventurer chose, Eitrigg says one of the following as a result of the actions done during the final chapter.\nEchoes on Kul Tiras.\nBoralus.\nKul Tirans and the 7th Legion.\nWith the war ended, festivities reached &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Marine\"&gt;7th Legion Marine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Proudmoore Guards&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Snug%20Harbor%20Inn\"&gt;Snug Harbor Inn&lt;/a&gt; celebrate the occasion.\nSome are more serious and discuss the future.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Dockworker\"&gt;Tradewinds Dockworker&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Citizen\"&gt;Boralus Citizen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt; fear the seas.\nSentinels.\nSimilarly, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Sentinel%20%28Boralus%29\"&gt;Night Elf Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; are also glad that the war has ended.\nHowever, other Sentinels are not so keen on forgiving.\nThe Sentinels are also concerned for &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the hunt for Sylvanas.\nEchoes in Stormwind City.\nStormwindians remain somewhat skeptical towards the ending of the war as well as Anduin.\nWizard's Sanctum.\nAlliance mages in the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; discuss Anduin and Saurfang.\nDwarven District.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Smith\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt; discuss Anduin.\nStormwind guards in the Trade District.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Stormwind City Guards&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20District\"&gt;Trade District&lt;/a&gt; discuss the remaining Horde.\nTwo guards outside the &lt;a href=\"Trader%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Trader's Hall&lt;/a&gt; discuss the state of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanals.\n&lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Refugee\"&gt;Darnassian Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Canals\"&gt;Canals&lt;/a&gt; are still lamenting.\nRemoved from PTR.\nAlliance.\nAnduin Wrynn: I set Saurfang on the path that led to his sacrifice. His actions may have been his own, but it would be a lie to say I played no part in all of this. Saurfang was wielding my father's sword when he fell to Sylvanas.\nHe was an honorable orc. A foe worthy of respect. An example I hope the rest of the Horde will follow.\nI do not know if I have always made the right decisions in this war. I only know that I did what I thought was right for the Alliance.\nAlleria Windrunner: This war has exacted such a deadly toll, for both the Alliance and the Horde. So many soldiers lie dead at our feet, so much blood stains our hands.\nAnd now, N'Zoth is poised to capitalize on all of it. To destroy or corrupt everything we hold dear.\nWe cannot continue to bleed each other dry while the Old God watches from the shadows. No matter what animosity lingers between us, we must face him with a united front.\nI only hope the Horde comes to the same conclusion.\nJaina Proudmoore: I don't make a habit of fighting alongside the Horde. But I must admit, when we were rescuing Baine... Saurfang was a good asset to have in play.\nMy agents have their work cut out for them. Sylvanas and Nathanos are not easy quarries to track. And we have no guarantees that they're even in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nBut rest assured, we will find them. And when we do, we will make them pay for all they've done.\nShandris Feathermoon: I thought that we would at last have justice for Teldrassil. That Sylvanas would be made to answer for her heinous crimes. Our people demand as much.\nThere is nothing I desire more than to hunt the Banshee Queen to the ends of Azeroth.\nBut... for me to do so would be a disservice to the kaldorei. The spirits of our loved ones cry out for retribution... but those who yet live need guidance and stability.\nI do not know if I can provide it for them.

Over the course of the battle both &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; send &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with the remaining Scourge forces. After defeating the Scourge leaders, the two &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; commanders enter a truce with one another; giving both the Horde and Alliance time to recover before they face one another. Some time afterwards, Alliance farmers, hungry from poverty, train in the art of combat and are equipped with armor by Alliance adventurers, so that they may defend themselves against the dangers of Andorhal as they farm food from &lt;a href=\"Felstone%20Field\"&gt;Felstone Field&lt;/a&gt;. Once the battle has officially resumed, the farmers planned to aid the Alliance in retaking Andorhal by sneak attacking Koltira's forces from the rear. The farmers had Alliance adventurers take out &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Outrider\"&gt;Forsaken Outrider&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Haunt\"&gt;Writhing Haunt&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for their strategy. &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Priestess%20Vandis\"&gt;Shadow Priestess Vandis&lt;/a&gt; tasked Horde adventurers to kill Alliance forces hunting for food and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Laborer\"&gt;Alliance Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s at Felstone Field in order to starve out their competition before the battle resumes. &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Ravensun\"&gt;Lindsay Ravensun&lt;/a&gt; saw the Alliance farmers at Felstone Field as a nuisance to her desired new training grounds and planted false orders from Forsaken high command in order to plague Felstone Field; afterwards she used the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise the dead farmers as new Forsaken recruits. The surviving Alliance farmers later form a militia and initiated their own sneak attack on Koltira's &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; forces without Thassarian's authorization. With his hand forced, Thassarian resumes the war with the Forsaken. After whittling each other's forces and killing some of the Alliance commanders in response to Alliance adventurers killing Forsaken commanders, Koltira sends agents of the Horde to speak with Lindsay Ravensun, whom he was told would be supporting him in the final battle.\nSkirmish.\nDuring a battle in the city, the forces of the Horde and the Alliance fought united (while still fighting with each other) under a common goal to kill &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;.\nForsaken counter-attack.\nUpon meeting Ravensun, it is revealed that she is in reality &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who is aware of the truce between Koltira and Thassarian, and also their friendship which dated back to their service as death knights of the Scourge. Using the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, she resurrects slain &lt;a href=\"Frightened%20Provincial%20Minuteman\"&gt;Provincial Minutemen&lt;/a&gt; from the farmers' militia to recoup their casualties before sending agents of the Horde to eliminate Thassarian. Many of the recently created &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Lesser Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 including the Val'kyr commander, &lt;a href=\"Aradne\"&gt;Aradne&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were slain by the Alliance adventurers. Despite their valiant efforts however, the Alliance were forced to retreat from Andorhal; as they were unable to stand against the Forsaken's overwhelming numbers and the onslaught provided by Sylvanas' Scourge-like tactics. As Horde forces enter the Alliance camp, all they find is the slain body of &lt;a href=\"Lurid\"&gt;Lurid&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian's skeletal minion, and discover that Thassarian and the remaining &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces have retreated from Andorhal. With Andorhal now controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas called Koltira to her. After Sylvanas berated Koltira about his \"weakness\" and criticized &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' failure to remove such weakness, a portal appears and a chain drags Koltira into the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas planned to eliminate Koltira's compassion for Thassarian and ensure his loyalty is to the Horde and more specifically the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the aftermath of the fall of Hellfire Citadel, the Mag'har pledged to one day repay Azeroth's heroes for aiding their cause. As war against the Alliance intensifies, the Horde must call upon the might of the Mag'har to seize victory.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nZandalari Trolls and Kul Tiran Humans.\nPrepare for War\nAt the heart of Battle for Azeroth lies the efforts of the Alliance and Horde to win the allegiance of the Kul Tiran and Zandalari people, respectively.

Both factions quickly sent a scouting force to what's left of the desert to gather samples of the material and start to realize its power.\nAfter the launch of \"Battle for Azeroth\", the portions of the quest chain involving Legion legendary weapons were removed, but the remainder of the storyline itself is still required.\nWar of the Thorns.\nOn the surface, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; realized that Azerite would shift the balance of power between the Alliance and Horde, and attempted to prevent Alliance forces from using Teldrassil's trading routes to ship Azerite to the Eastern Kingdoms. After skirmishes in Ashenvale and Darkshore escalated, Sylvanas ordered her forces to open fire on Teldrassil itself, which ends up burning down the tree.\nThis chapter was the pre-launch event and was only available in the two weeks prior to expansion launch.\nBattle for Lordaeron and Heart of Azeroth.\nAfter Teldrassil burned, the Alliance immediately launched a counterattack on the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to retake the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance. Anduin and Genn's forces routed the Horde defenders, captured &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, and confronted &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in the throne room, but fail to capture the city as Sylvanas detonated stored Blight canisters hidden in the ceiling, covering her escape. The Alliance leadership manage to escape as well, but the city was declared lost.\nUpon return from the battle, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker of Azeroth, reached out to the adventurer and requested some assistance in Silithus. The titanic &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had been badly wounded by the Sword of Sargeras and needs her champion's assistance to survive. She manifested the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Magni asks the adventurer to look past the Horde \u2013 Alliance conflict and focus on what really matters.\nAlas, more urgent matters arose back home, and the time had come to set out for new lands with new allies.\nKul Tiras and Zandalar.\nAfter acquiring the Heart of Azeroth, the adventurer set to the newly-accessible continents of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign's perspective split based on faction, with the Alliance focused on Kul Tiras and the Horde focused on Zandalar, each involving the traditional zone storylines. Much like in \"Legion\", the three level-up zones per faction could be completed in any order. Once the three zone storylines were completed, a finale campaign opened up to cap off the &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0\"&gt;patch 8.0&lt;/a&gt; portion of the story.\nWar Campaign.\nIn parallel to the level-up campaign and home-continent zone storylines, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; send members of their faction on excursions to the other continent, setting up camps and scouting out intel. Additional chapters were added over the course of the expansion, concluding in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.5\"&gt;patch 8.2.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nNazjatar.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; lured expedition fleets of the Alliance and Horde to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, then parted the sea and dashed the ships on the newly-exposed seabed. After gaining the trust of the locals, and completing the three chapters of the storyline, a raid group of adventurers took on Queen Azshara herself in her seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechagon.\nAlso added in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, a small island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; was discovered, inhabited by mechagnomes. After unlocking world quests in Nazjatar, adventurers were sent to explore the area and look for new weapons in the fight against Queen Azshara.\nBlack Empire Campaign.\nDefeating Queen Azshara in the Eternal Palace set events into motion that released the seal of the old god &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. N'Zoth desired to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; and take Azeroth over in its name. In addition to skirmishes in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers took the fight to N'Zoth directly at &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;."}

What's worse, the fleet of ships sent to recover them has mostly been lost, as only one returned. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; scries a recollection out of a &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; sailor, and comes to the conclusion that the Alliance cannot defend against the Zandalari navy without allies.\nThe Daughter of the Sea, along with the adventurer and an escort from &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, thus set off for &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter A Nation Divided, adventurers can choose to begin one of three zone storylines: &lt;a href=\"Drustvar%20storyline\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley%20storyline\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound%20storyline\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde.\nSylvanas has a high-priority objective imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;, so she tasks the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; to recover it. It turns out that the princess of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zul%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Zul the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; are the prisoners!\nIn fleeing, the party escapes from &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; by nearly burning down &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;! Talanji decides to head directly home, immediately thrusting the adventurer into some political intrigue with the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter We Need Each Other, adventurers can choose to begin one of three zone storylines: &lt;a href=\"Nazmir%20storyline\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun%20storyline\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar%20storyline\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;."}

The battle was lost, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to pour into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and start their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasions&lt;/a&gt;.\nPremise.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was there when &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; opened the portal inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to cross through into Azeroth. Much like &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he warned the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; of the Legion's return.\n&lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;High King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; immediately sent agents of , led by their leader, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to gather information regarding the Legion's numbers. Mere hours before the assault was to begin, the results were clear to Shaw: a frontal assault was absolutely not possible and doomed to failure, and he determined that the Alliance and Horde fleets had to be warned to turn back. However, the scouts were murdered by the forces of the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, who then impersonated Shaw. As Shaw, Detheroc told the High King that they had a chance.\nThe assault.\nThe heroes of Azeroth thus gathered their forces and rode to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in a joint faction fleet to combat the threat. The Legion unleashed armies of &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s upon the ships and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s rained destruction down. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;'s forces were decimated during the landfall, with the few survivors, including &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, taken captive by the Legion. The Alliance forces led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Warchief Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; held their tenuous foothold on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting to be relieved by reinforcements.\nAlliance reinforcements of the &lt;a href=\"third%20fleet\"&gt;third fleet&lt;/a&gt;, including the now renowned brave &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, landed on the left side of the Shore while the Horde reinforcements landed on the right side of the beaches. Both sides started claiming ground and piercing through the &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; to reach the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, they freed &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent&lt;/a&gt; prisoners and searched for Tirion. After defeating the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20City\"&gt;Black City&lt;/a&gt; the Legion had established, they found &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion&lt;/a&gt; in the hands of Gul'dan. But it was too late, and the warlock proceeded to apparently summarily execute Tirion with &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;, and run away.\nAfter dealing with Krosus, the Azerothian forces managed to finally reach the Tomb. There, the Alliance confronted Gul'dan while the Horde took the high ridge to cover the Alliance's flank. While the Alliance was battling many Legion commanders, a portal behind the high ridge summoned more demons than the Horde could handle. Varian ordered the famous &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;\"Skyfire\"&lt;/a&gt; to advance, and instructed &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to tell &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to have her forces clear the skies.\nThe fall.\nUnbeknownst to the Alliance, the Horde was overwhelmed by the attack from behind. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was blasted by four &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s simultaneously, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was mortally wounded by a &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;'s spear. Sylvanas rode to secure her &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, who urged her not to let the Horde die this day. Seeing the Horde forces crumbling and incoming &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements, Sylvanas blew her war horn signaling a retreat, while her &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; secured injured Horde soldiers.\nVarian watched in shock and disappointment as he witnessed the Horde forces quit the battlefield, leaving the Alliance vulnerable. The High King was thus forced to order a retreat via gunship but, as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;\"Skyfire\"&lt;/a&gt; took off, Gul'dan called down an immense &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; which grabbed onto the airship, causing it to tip and send many Alliance soldiers plummeting to their deaths. Varian, dangling from a rope ladder on the side, passed the letter he had written during the travel to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to Genn, asking him to deliver it to his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;. Varian then dived down and impaled the head of the reaver with &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;, taking down the creature by himself.\nAs the gunship flew away, Varian was left to make a final stand against the demons, killing several and making his way to Gul'dan, before being impaled thrice from behind. Gul'dan gloated to the dying king that he would be remembered \"as the king who sacrificed his life for nothing\". Varian defiantly looked the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; in the eyes and replied \"For the Alliance!\". A sore Gul'dan channeled his vile energy into his palm, and flooded Varian's body with overwhelming &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, utterly executing him.\nAftermath.\nThe battle was followed by funerals for both Varian and Vol'jin, during which assassinations were attempted by demons. They were fortunately exposed in time by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; demon hunters. The &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion invasions&lt;/a&gt; were then launched all over the world.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Although Tyrande and Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; were able to temporarily drive away &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and slay &lt;a href=\"Brynja\"&gt;Brynja&lt;/a&gt;, several night elves, including &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; (despite her efforts to follow and slay the Horde adventurer) were raised as &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, embittered and disillusioned by Tyrande and Elune's apparent abandonment of them when they needed them most. Malfurion Stormrage personally intercepted and ambushed several Horde convoys bringing supplies to the warfront, killing most of the party, with the lone surviving troll left traumatized by his close encounter with death and reporting the experience shortly afterwards to the commanders of the Horde base in Darkshore. Tyrande and Malfurion along with &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande's owl companion, and other night elf forces, then confronted Nathanos and his forces yet again, although Nathanos would survive the encounter and the battle would continue elsewhere.\nWith most of Darkshore still seemingly controlled by Horde forces, the Alliance forces under Maiev Shadowsong's leadership (including adventurers from &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;) launched a full-scale coastal attack from the \"&lt;a href=\"Moonspray\"&gt;Moonspray&lt;/a&gt;\", assaulting and capturing the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; and killing the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathguard%20Captain%20Vandel\"&gt;Deathguard Captain Vandel&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the Forsaken's Blight Throwers in the process. After rescuing several &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Protector%20%28Darkshore%29\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance forces, largely consisting of night elves and Gilneans (the latter personally led by Princess &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt;), fought beside Maiev and cleared a path towards &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, where they slew &lt;a href=\"Blightguard%20Captain%20Thedric\"&gt;Blightguard Captain Thedric&lt;/a&gt; and reclaimed the ancient &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; settlement for their main base of operations against the Horde.

Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Lornesta%20Mine\"&gt;Lornesta Mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cinderfall%20Grove\"&gt;Cinderfall Grove&lt;/a&gt; were also captured, their iron and wood benefiting the Alliance soldiers and reinforcing their buildings respectively.\nAfter successfully constructing an Altar of Elders (enhancing individual player strengths with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Priestess%20Lasara\"&gt;Moon Priestess Lasara&lt;/a&gt;), the Hunter's Lodge (allowing the upgrade and armor of units by &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt;), and the Glaiveworks (from which &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt; vehicles were built by &lt;a href=\"Erion%20Shadewhisper\"&gt;Erion Shadewhisper&lt;/a&gt;), the Alliance forces were able to capture &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Crossing\"&gt;Forlorn Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gloomtide%20Strand\"&gt;Gloomtide Strand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ashwood%20Depot\"&gt;Ashwood Depot&lt;/a&gt; in quick succession, further substantially bolstering their strategic assets and resources. After Ashwood was captured, &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fidelio%20Featherleaf\"&gt;Fidelio Featherleaf&lt;/a&gt; managed to effectively open a flight path network throughout the region, with the aid of the kaldorei's &lt;a href=\"hippogryph%20rider\"&gt;hippogryph rider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Dagda\"&gt;Keeper Dagda&lt;/a&gt; inspired the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s at Cinderfall Grove to gather necessary wood resources; and Gloomtide Strand considerably empowered the night elves' &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic forces as well, enabling them to heal and restore their allies. They then moved northwards and routed the remaining Horde forces, including &lt;a href=\"Magmaster%20Blastcrank\"&gt;Magmaster Blastcrank&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"AzerMEK%20Mk.%20II\"&gt;azerite-fueled shredder&lt;/a&gt;, at the ruins of the destroyed and blighted night elf town &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, reclaiming what remained of the settlement for the kaldorei and securing &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel%20Landing\"&gt;Lor'danel Landing&lt;/a&gt;.

Following the events of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance Forces must fight to control and repel Horde invaders from the rebuilding and war tattered nation of Gilneas, while the Horde invades by ship, with the goal to crush the Alliance in the area, and regain a foothold in Gilneas, all former Forsaken footholds in Gilneas having been destroyed.\nDescription.\n\"When &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Greymane&lt;/a&gt; severed ties with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; became independent from all other nations and opposing forces. Although the massive &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; protected Gilneas from outside threats, a virulent &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; curse and &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; crippled the kingdom from within. As the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; strikes and the Greymane Wall's gates are destroyed, the people of Gilneas must come to terms with their dark curse and learn to persevere through catastrophic earthquakes and an unrelenting &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; invasion. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; recognizes this land as a strategic location with key resources to fuel the faction's war effort against the Alliance, and Horde forces will not stop their siege until the city and its surrounding territories are under their control. To protect its lands from the Horde, the once-isolated nation of Gilneas must now work with the Alliance.\"\n\"As the Greymane wall collapses, the inevitable conflict between the Forsaken and Worgen reaches a new climax. The Battle for Gilneas is a 10 vs 10 domination battleground, where each side attempts to control the Mine, Lighthouse, and Waterworks for as long as possible.\"\nOverview.\nControlling resources.\nThe Battle for Gilneas is a 10 vs. 10 Battleground for level-85 players. Much like they do in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, teams must control strategic capture points on the map to accumulate resources. The first team to gather 2000 resources wins.\nThe battle.\nTeams will start at opposite ends of the map with default graveyards nearby. Once the match begins, teams will race toward each other to vie for control of three strategic points; each point will allow your team to gain resources and additional graveyards. Adding to the intensity of the battle are many obstacles that block line of sight, as well as chokepoints for fending off enemy advances.\n&lt;a href=\"Overlook%20%28Battle%20for%20Gilneas%29\"&gt;The Overlook&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the center of the map is an area known as the Overlook. Hills on either side of the map create chokepoints, while narrow paths through the hills provide teams with alternate routes. A river dividing the map will also lead opponents toward a single bridge. In some cases, dominating the Overlook might be the key to controlling the capture points.\nCapture points.\nIn the Battle for Gilneas, three distinct resource points are available for the taking by either the Horde or the Alliance: the &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Battle%20for%20Gilneas%29\"&gt;Mines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lighthouse%20%28Battle%20for%20Gilneas%29\"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Waterworks\"&gt;Waterworks&lt;/a&gt;. Once any of these points is held by a team, access to nearby graveyards will be granted. In addition, workers from the controlling faction will show up to collect the resources necessary to win the battle.\nChaos will be unleashed upon Azeroth when Deathwing returns, but many steadfast leaders will see the Cataclysm as an opportunity to further the cause of their people... or simply attain more power. The situation in Gilneas is no different. Will the embattled Gilneans be able to defend their land after realigning with the Alliance? Or will the Forsaken, reinforced by Garrosh's Horde, seize this near-forgotten territory as a new stronghold in the Eastern Kingdoms?\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

A tower was erected at the crossroads halfway between the two to symbolize their bond, and rivalry between the towns was considered unthinkable.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nArch Lord &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; had sent his agents to spy on the humans of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; for some time. When the time was right, Varimathras had &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Darthalia\"&gt;High Executor Darthalia&lt;/a&gt; wage war on the humans of Hillsbrad so that they could quell humanity and buy their &lt;a href=\"Apothecary\"&gt;apothecaries&lt;/a&gt; enough time to develop the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt;. Darthalia began her offensive by targeting the northernmost farms of Hillsbrad Fields, especially the farmers, farmhands, and landowners. After the attack shook up the humans, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; began murdering the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Peasant\"&gt;Hillsbrad peasant&lt;/a&gt;s. With the Hillsbrad humans reeling from these assaults, the Hillsbrad townspeople began to organize themselves into a militia. Darthalia had Horde agents slay the Hillsbrad blacksmiths, and steal their &lt;a href=\"Shipment%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Shipment of Iron&lt;/a&gt; to hinder their proliferation of weapons. She also put a bounty on prominent Hillsbrad humans who have proven themselves formidable enemies of the Forsaken. Afterwards, the Horde began to attack the Hillsbrad leadership and their mining operations in &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt;. With Hillsbrad crippled, the Horde then purged &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Garok\"&gt;Dun Garok&lt;/a&gt; of their dwarven forces.\nThe Battle for Hillsbrad eventually escalated into a battleground between Southshore and Tarren Mill. Alliance adventurers from Southshore and Horde adventurers from Tarren Mill frequently clashed in full-blown skirmishes in this notorious conflict. This can be seen with who directs adventurers to resurrect , who proceeds to battle the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; before either being driven off or fleeing from the town.\nCataclysm.\nThe Forsaken forces later marched onto the town of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and annihilated most Alliance life with in the region by deploying a potent strain of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; led the ones who managed to escape Southshore and fled to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt; is left inhospitable, and will be so for several decades. The ramifications of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; forced the high echelons of the Horde to reconsider the free use of such a potent weapon. Instead, the Horde has issued a diluted version of the Forsaken Blight for the Forsaken to use. Some Hillsbrad humans fled either to the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in which they ended up slaughtered before reaching &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 or north into the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 where they found sanctuary in Fenris Keep and eventually joined up with the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; was later finally destroyed by the Forsaken, concluding the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; campaign initiated by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; years ago. A few Hillsbrad residents and &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Burnside\"&gt;Magistrate Burnside&lt;/a&gt; stayed behind and led a resistance but were eventually defeated and imprisoned by the Forsaken war machine. Those who stayed to defend Hillsbrad eventually became prisoners in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken prison where the mad &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; cruelly experiments on his prisoners and even fellow Forsaken.\nAfter years of battle, ranging from player-guerilla warfare, to all-out raids, to simply individual murders, the Tarren Mill-Southshore conflict finally reached its conclusion. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; would see Southsore drenched in blight and rendered annihilated - for all intents and purposes, uninhabitable for a long while to come. With that, the legendary battles in Hillsbrad came to a complete end.\nSeveral of Southshore's inhabitants were able to flee, including its leader , though many were killed. All that remains of Southshore is a blighted wreck; himself stands victorious near its ruins.\nTarren Mill itself has been fortified, and the presence of the powerful serves as a deterrent for the hit-and-run killings once witnessed in the region.\nDespite the Forsaken eliminating the human presence in the region and claiming former Alliance towns, there is frequent guerrilla warfare with the of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; and .\nPvP.\nIt is unique in that, while legendary by player standards, the two towns had minimal interaction with each other outside of mutual &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; shenanigans. It was the source of server-wide battles, and heroes of the Horde and the Alliance would often throw themselves into the fray on behalf of their faction and town. It was also one of the most common causes of server crashes.\nThe conflict was perhaps one of the most notable examples of world PvP, and was the primary &lt;a href=\"honor\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; income for many players prior to the addition of &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nPrior to the introduction of &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;, players were forced to be creative in how to gain &lt;a href=\"honor\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; points via &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; combat. Raid groups assaulting either &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were thus commonplace, and this long-standing conflict would become perhaps the most trademark reference to world PvP. The heroes of the noble &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the mighty &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would find no peace in the fields of Hillsbrad, as the conflict would often envelop the entire zone in a brutal war.\nAside from the hostile takeover of either Tarren Mill or Southshore, the war would be fought from the shadows - &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s often sneaking into the towns and taking out unsuspecting victims via their assassination abilities from the relative safety of stealth. With high player traffic at almost all times, the hills of Hillsbrad were a dangerous place to be at best, and a suicidal one at worst.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe battles raged on for a long while; heroes of both factions earning fame, honor and fear among the ranks of their enemy. Ultimately, with &lt;a href=\"patch%201.5.0\"&gt;patch 1.5.0&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; were added - &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. This did not put an end to the Tarren Mill-Southshore conflict, however, and the fighting would also be taken to the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormpike\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; base camps in the region. Though the war had been regulated to a less efficient method of grinding honor points than playing the battlegrounds, the battle between Hillsbrad's players raged on.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWith the coming of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, specifically, the world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to explore, the fierce battles in Hillsbrad began to calm. Though still not a particularly advisable place to &lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;idle from your keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for too long within, at the very least, the conflict was a shadow of its former self. Rarely now would the mountains of player &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; be seen piling around Tarren Mill and Southshore. &lt;a href=\"Flying%20mounts\"&gt;Flying mounts&lt;/a&gt; for easy travel around Outland, and an &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;extra battleground&lt;/a&gt; further contributed to the decline of the Hillsbrad war. \nWrath of the Lich King.\nLike the previous expansion, \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" introduced another new continent to explore - &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The addition of &lt;a href=\"heirlooms\"&gt;heirlooms&lt;/a&gt; for quick leveling began to ensure that many players would not be forced to spend too long toiling in Hillsbrad's fields, and the once-bloody setting of Hillsbrad continued to quiet down.\nSimilar conflicts were witnessed in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, though generally not of the scale nostalgic &lt;a href=\"vanilla\"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt; Warcraft players associate with the battles of Hillsbrad.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe experience is turned into a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; for 40 vs 40 players: &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill%20vs%20Southshore\"&gt;Tarren Mill vs Southshore&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is not stated what K'tanth is or was.\nSpeculation.\nXal'atath makes several other remarks regarding the Broken Shore and its connection to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. The dagger claims that the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; pales in comparison to the grandeur of what stood there long ago. It explains that Thal'dranath was always a place of power, and that &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; was drawn there, as were the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and something else before them, likely the Old Gods. Furthermore, Xal'atath claims that the land had not seen \"such carnage\" since the Battle for K'tanth, which occurred \"long ago\", and that it was \"here\" in ages past that &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; lost a great battle to &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, though the defeat ultimately worked in N'Zoth's favor. Thus, it can be speculated that the battle between N'Zoth and Y'Shaarj was fought over this place of power and the great edifice that stood there long ago might've been named K'tanth, or alternatively, \"K'tanth\" what was situated beneath it."}

The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, summoning additional forces from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, sent his &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; to lead the assault, with their greatest objective being to draw out the noble &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;; by destroying this legendary figure, the Lich King hoped to erode the resolve of the Argent Dawn and the defenders of Azeroth before the next stage of his campaigns. Ten thousand Scourge troops were assembled for this task, led by the death knights &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, wielding the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, leads &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;. Their foes were a comparatively few three hundred &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;defenders of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and what remained of the Argent Dawn's leadership, assembled at the Chapel.\nThe Scourge proved successful in their initial objective, annihilating a third of the Argent Dawn's defenders before Tirion emerged to confront Mograine directly. Assisted by paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Fordring's unmatched command of the Light slew untold numbers of the Lich King's servants and broke the assault. Mograine, defeated, ordered his remaining forces to stand down as Fordring berated him for the monster he had become, a servant of rot and pestilence rather than the noble knight that Tirion had once known.\nSuddenly The Ashbringer, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, appeared. Darion, shocked at his father's arrival, became a shade of his past and relived the conversation he had with Alexandros when he decided to join the war against the Lich King. As Alexandros says that one day Darion will wield the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King appears and banishes Alexandros to the abyss. When Darion comes back to himself, the Lich King revealed that the attack on Light's Hope Chapel was merely a ploy to strike at Tirion. Realizing the depths of his betrayal, Darion was enraged that he had been used as fodder, and he lashed out at his master with his wrath. However, the Lich King easily cast him aside, and incapacitated Darion and the other death knights.\nFordring, also surprised at the turn of events, comes forward in preparation to attack the Lich King. However, Fordring revealing himself is exactly what the Lich King had planned as he incapacitates Tirion and began to drain his soul with Frostmourne. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; calls in the order to attack and the remaining Defenders of the Light all charge in, followed shortly by the Argent Dawn leadership, all of whom are batted away and stunned in the process.\nAs the Lich King taunts his nigh-inevitable victory, Darion resisted his master's control just enough to give Tirion Fordring the corrupted Ashbringer. The paladin drew upon the power of the Light and cleansed the blade in a blinding flash of energy. With the restored Ashbringer at his command, Tirion charges toward the Lich King to fight him. Aware that even he stands little chance against the Ashbringer near the Chapel, the Lich King retreats, promising that the next time he meets Fordring, it will not be on holy ground.\nThe battle concluded, Fordring walks over to where Darion is lying and brings him back to consciousness. The paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; had a new champion to rally behind, and while he laments the loss of souls on both sides of the conflict, Tirion calls for a merger of the Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand into a single faction named the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The Highlord then vowed to use their combined force to attack and destroy the Lich King.\nAt the same time, most of the death knights on the field that day had been liberated from the Lich King's control. Darion Mograine rallied these free-willed death knights and bestowed upon them a new name, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThe Battle for Light's Hope Chapel is also the name for the battle in which the Scourge attacked the Chapel when Darion Mograine sacrificed himself. His body and weapon were then collected by the Scourge."}

The result of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, it marks the beginning of ', similarly to ''s &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPremise.\nSince the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, tensions kept rising between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The discovery of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; ignited the flames of war, with the Horde taking the opportunity to preemptively strike at the Alliance. After the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, was burned down on &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s orders. The Alliance gathered their forces, aiming to strike back, and marched onwards to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the battle, Undercity's population had already been moved to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; through mage portals.\nThe battle.\nThe battle began with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; arriving with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; from the north, and coming all the way to the south to raze &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; evacuated the civilians of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and dealt with the infiltrating and &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;, although not before &lt;a href=\"Renzik%20%22The%20Shiv%22\"&gt;Renzik \"The Shiv\"&lt;/a&gt; escaped with the intel he needed. The defense above was led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance forces managed to corner the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, which they began to besiege. The battle was turning in the Alliance's favor until &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Sylvanas launched a devastating counter-attack on an Alliance &lt;a href=\"siege%20tower\"&gt;siege tower&lt;/a&gt;, which rallied the Horde in driving back the Alliance. Anduin ordered his forces to push forward and personally killed several Horde warriors until he was knocked down by a blow from &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, whom Genn swatted aside before trying to help Anduin and being incapacitated by a troll shaman. After fending off a troll warrior who tried to attack him while he was down, Anduin looked around himself and saw his army wavering. Dropping his father's sword, King Wrynn then conjured a massive dome of light to heal his forces and to keep the Horde at bay. After the dome ceased, he rallied his reinvigorated forces and told his men to stand united for the Alliance, with both Horde and Alliance forces charging toward each other and resuming the battle.\nAfter the Alliance pushed the Horde back out of the battlefield in front of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas called out an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20war%20machine\"&gt;Azerite war machine&lt;/a&gt; which proceeded to destroy the siege towers. After the war machine was brought down by Alliance forces, Sylvanas reacted by &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;blighting&lt;/a&gt; the battlefield, killing both Alliance and Horde soldiers, and then she raised the casualties as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Although it managed to break the Alliance ranks, this honorless tactic has distressed Saurfang.\nAs the Alliance fell back, the battle seemed lost until &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived on a magical flying &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina neutralized the blight and the undead with her frost magic, then destroyed a section of the Keep's walls with the ship's cannons. The Alliance regrouped inside the city, with Jaina holding back Horde reinforcements with a magical ice barrier and Genn guarding the rear flank. Once in formation, Anduin led the Alliance to fight their way through the Ruins of Lordaeron, killing troll defenders until they faced against &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, who had the Alliance outnumbered and outmaneuvered with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; covering them with &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20catapult\"&gt;Forsaken catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spider%20tank\"&gt;spider tank&lt;/a&gt;s, teleported inside Lordaeron just in time to aid Anduin and his forces. The bolstered Alliance turned the tide of battle forcing the Horde to retreat once more using blight to cover them. Anduin ordered Gelbin to take the army back to Brill before Anduin and his squadron proceeded to fly over the blighted landscape using the remaining &lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;gnomish flying machines&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaurfang confronted Sylvanas at the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;Imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; and rebuked her for her honorless tactics. Sylvanas told Saurfang that honor means nothing to a corpse, and she will take whatever pragmatic measures she sees fit to save Horde lives no matter how cruel. Those that disagree with how she has conducted the war does not deserve to stand with the Horde and thus she leaves Saurfang outside the Imperial chamber to die his honorable death; all the while threatening to raise the orc as an undead to serve her when the battle is over. The Alliance then confronted &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance of the Keep, and upon his defeat he was taken prisoner. &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; accused Sylvanas of leaving Saurfang to die, but Sylvanas retorts that it was the death he wanted and that Baine is free to join him. Sylvanas then gives her bow to her champion Nathanos and tells him to prepare the final phase of their plan.\nAnduin, Genn, Alleria, and Jaina went to confront Sylvanas in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;, giving her the chance to surrender. Sylvanas however, proclaimed the Alliance has won nothing as she flew out of the throne room while massive amounts of explosive Blight stored inside of Lordaeron Keep were detonated \u2014 flooding the throne room and surrounding city. Jaina Proudmoore teleported the Alliance leaders out of the collapsing throne room after the doorway was blocked, as the Horde leaders made their escape on a &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Battle for Lordaeron, both Capital City and Brill laid in ruins, and mindless undead roamed the region. With Lordaeron Keep blighted, it was seemingly impossible to claim the city and some of the surrounding lands. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Roderick%20Brewston\"&gt;Captain Roderick Brewston&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance continues to occupy most of Lordaeron, and their fighting to reclaim Arathi is largely to ensure that they are able to continue to hold Lordaeron. \nEvent.\n\"Experience the struggle for control as the Alliance storm the shores of Lordaeron Keep! For victory, for glory -- for Lordaeron!\"\nIn-game, the Battle is depicted during the quest and scenario &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;The Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, an up-to-20-player faction-specific scenario. See the quest article for more information and a walkthrough.\nAfter the Battle for Lordaeron, the map of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; is updated. &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; are no longer accessible, and the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Wake\"&gt;same scorched area&lt;/a&gt; as in the Battle for Lordaeron scenario map will stretch from the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"North%20Coast\"&gt;North Coast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; will appear on the eastern edge of the scorched area (to the west of &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;), and will offer to take the player characters back to the time before the battle, the same way as in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.

If a player attempts to enter the Ruins of Lordaeron or the Undercity, they will start taking massive damage from the blight, even if they are flying above the ruins. If they somehow make it to the elevators, the lower ground in front of them is safe from the blight but there is an invisible wall preventing access to the elevator, which is still operational. If players manage to get inside they will be automatically teleported back to Zidormi upon entering the central chamber.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

Prior to Patch 2.4 completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Vials%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Vials of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was needed in order to enter the instance. The quest is still in the game, the only substantial reward being the (now obsolete) &lt;a href=\"Band%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Band of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; set of rings. Prior to patch 3.0.2 completion of the quest chain also rewarded the \"&lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20A%27dal\"&gt;Hand of A'dal&lt;/a&gt;\", which now is no longer available.\nOverview.\nBehind the instance portal is an anteroom which sports another three instance portals (two of them blocked initially), a reagent vendor and the &lt;a href=\"Tier%206\"&gt;Tier 6&lt;/a&gt; item vendor (who can also repair). The three portals lead to three bases (&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Base\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Encampment\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Village\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;) at which all encounters take place. The bases are also connected to each other by a long road within the instance itself. After defeating the two bosses in the human base, the second portal opens up and permits direct access to the Horde camp. After killing two more bosses there, the third gate opens, which leads to the night elves. Wipe recovery is usually possible in place, so the portals are used rather infrequently, save the last one - due to his long aggro range, wipes at &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; usually require a corpse run.\nThe first four bosses are preceded by eight waves of &lt;a href=\"trash%20mob\"&gt;trash mob&lt;/a&gt;s each. Each wave spawns once the previous one is defeated, or after a maximum of two minutes; bosses spawn at most three minutes after the final trash wave spawns, and is followed by a longer delay. During trash waves, two counters appear in the &lt;a href=\"UI\"&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt;: one displays the number of remaining mobs in the current wave, and a second for the current wave number. &lt;a href=\"Wipe\"&gt;Wiping&lt;/a&gt; during any boss or trash wave will require re-clearing all 8 trash waves for that boss.\nEnemies can be engaged as soon as they spawn, but fights typically take place close to the entrance inside the friendly bases so that the NPCs can be used in an easy but controllable way. The waves (and bosses) spawn at the enemy camp about 20 seconds away from the friendly base, so drinking and resurrecting is usually possible between waves. At the Horde location, some waves include flying enemies that will attack NPCs from within the base.\nThe final boss, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; is not preceded by any trash waves. He can be attacked as soon as the raid arrives.\nTalking to base leaders.\nAs was common at the time of this raid's release, the events of the raid are controlled by talking to NPCs. The first four boss events are each started by talking to the current base's leader (&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;). Just clicking on the NPC suffices \u2014 it's not possible to abort the event after starting the conversation. Raiders completing the instance at its intended level should be careful not to do so until their entire raid is ready.\nAfter the second boss in each camp is defeated, talking a third time to the base leader activates the next base, spawns Ancient Crystal Mines (where epic gems can be mined) on the path to the next base, and causes the current base to be destroyed by unstoppable waves of trash mobs. It's a good idea to first distribute the loot from the second boss, then move the raid to the next base, place miners along the road, and have only one player talk to the base leader and quickly follow the others.\nGeneral strategies.\nAll trash and bosses can be handled by two or three tanks; no special composition is needed. Due to the number of mobs attacking in many trash waves, good &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; tanking is required. Consequently a paladin tank was often preferred during the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, but this is no longer a great concern due to changes in tanking class balance.\nTrash waves.\nOn most trash waves, it's a good idea to set up an AoE kill zone, particularly for &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;ghouls&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the incoming mobs can be &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d by hunters to be killed by the &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;s. Melee players can attack the airborn &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrms&lt;/a&gt; by standing within their hit box directly underneath, but &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; must either be silenced while casting a gargoyle strike or kited by ranged DPS until they descend to the ground, where they can be reached by melee. Make good use of the NPCs, as they can add significantly to the overall raid DPS.\nBosses.\nThree rogues rotating usage of &lt;a href=\"Distract\"&gt;Distract&lt;/a&gt; once a boss has spawned can give the raid an indefinite amount of time out of combat to resurrect the dead and eat and drink. Anecdotal evidence suggests that staying at the side of the boss and also placing the distracts at his side decreases the chance for resists.\nMost bosses have AoE abilities for which the the raid must spread out. It's good standard practice to put all ranged damage dealers and healers well distributed in a wide circle around the main tank position.\nRaid Denizens.\nTrash Waves.\nThe following table shows the composition of each wave of trash mobs. Note that during waves 2 and 4 before Kaz'rogal, the gargoyles spawn towards the back of the Horde camp and must be dragged to the front by ranged DPS.\nLoot.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20loot\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal loot&lt;/a&gt;\nInfinite dragonflight.\nThe \"Burning Crusade\" flash site said that sinister agents have infiltrated the timeways and the bronze dragonflight has enlisted heroes to protect history in three key historical events; one of which is the Battle of Mount Hyjal.\nDuring the quest to become attuned to the Caverns of Time, &lt;a href=\"Custodian%20of%20Time\"&gt;Custodians of Time&lt;/a&gt; mention that the Battle of Mount Hyjal is a timeway that is being deeply disrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who are working tirelessly to keep it a secret from the Bronze dragons. This interference is alluded to later during the &lt;a href=\"Band%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Band of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; quests where adventurers are charged with protecting history. However, there is not a single Infinite dragonflight member in the instance; unlike the other three Caverns of Time instances.\nIt was later clarified by Blizzard that the instance takes place in a \"time pocket\" unconnected to our timeline's history."}

The battle took place as part of the larger &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; and saw the Burning Legion attempt to secure control of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; in order to usher forth the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattered Sun Offensive was formed in response to the demonic threat, and consisted of a coalition between the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, supplemented by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The battle saw the mortal coalition gradually gain ground against the Burning Legion, who were greatly aided by the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. As further bases were established on the isle proper, the Shattered Sun forces began to target the nearby &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; itself, where the minions of Kil'jaeden worked furiously to summon their master through the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe conclusion of the campaign eventually saw the failure of the Legion's plans for invasion. In addition, Kil'jaeden's defeat was quickly followed by a monumental event when the once-corrupted &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; allowed its own heart to be used to reignite the Sunwell. With this sacrifice, the ancient font of power was restored to its full glory, signaling a new future for the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; race and a victory for all followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe battle for Quel'Danas served as the final conflict of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, cementing it as a decisive victory for the mortal races of Azeroth. The Burning Legion would never again return to Azeroth in such force until the advent of their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, years later.\nHistory.\nThe fallen prince.\nThe defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; subsequently marked an important blow against the plans of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Kael'thas had made an alliance with before his demise. The &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, however, soon intervened. The Deceiver dispatched a trusted &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt; minion known as &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt; to Netherstorm, where she successfully revived the defeated &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; prince. Filled with a new determination, Kael'thas returned to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; through a portal at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; with the objective of reinvigorating the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;; not for the sake of his people, but instead as a means to summon his demonic master, Kil'jaeden, to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael'thas now went to work with the aid of his &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; allies, as well as &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;a force&lt;/a&gt; of loyal &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; troops. The prince eventually succeeded in kidnapping the &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, the mortal embodiment of the Sunwell's energies, who was being kept in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; for protection. In addition to this, Kael'thas also personally led an attack on &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; itself with &lt;a href=\"felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of seizing the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas's outright assault on his old homeland, coupled with his seizure of M'uru, proved too much for many blood elves. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, having witnessed this event herself, was outraged. She immediately renounced all her allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Sunstrider\"&gt;House of Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, traveling to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to warn the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; of Kael'thas's plot and offer her aid in defeating the prince.\nWhen news of these events reached those in Shattrath, the city's two principal factions\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;\u2014chose to put aside their differences and unite together to form the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. The principal aim of the new faction became the defeat of Prince Kael'thas and ending the threat posed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe offensive begins.\nThe newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; quickly mobilized its members, landing a large force via boat onto the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. This force established &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Staging%20Area\"&gt;a staging area&lt;/a&gt; on the island, and immediately went about engaging the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s had already entrenched themselves at several key parts of the isle, and the Shattered Sun forces began to work tirelessly to reclaim sections of the area from the Legion. In particular, the offensive's efforts were focused in and around the large village of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, which could act as a springboard for further assaults on other parts of Quel'Danas.\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;'s occupation was a key objective of the Shattered Sun Offensive, who launched operations to capture the building. Though lacking the numbers to outright seize the sanctum, the Shattered Sun made use of the malfunctioning &lt;a href=\"Erratic%20Sentry\"&gt;arcane sentries&lt;/a&gt; located in the vicinity. Having fashioned new crystal cores for the golems, they were thus brought under Shattered Sun control and used against foes at the sanctum. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ward%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;dormant wards&lt;/a&gt; guarding the sanctum were reactivated when their power source was reclaimed from the nearby &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Sun's Reach Sanctum was secured by the Shattered Sun, granting the offensive new access to reinforcements directly from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe next major target for the offensive took the form of the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;Sun's Reach Armory&lt;/a&gt;, situated near the sanctum. The armory was held by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic forces who, despite having suffered heavy losses thus far, remained resolute in holding the position. Shattered Sun operations soon began to focus on the demons' morale, which was largely maintained through fear of the notorious &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20of%20Hate\"&gt;emissaries of hate&lt;/a&gt;. Targeting these demons in particular, and sending a message by impaling their bodies with Shattered Sun banners, greatly undermined the Legion's position. After a deal of fighting, the armory too was secured as demonic forces were pushed from the immediate area. Despite the victory, the armory remained constantly threatened by the Legion presence at &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Square\"&gt;Dawning Square&lt;/a&gt; to the south. To counter this, the Shattered Sun maintained their efforts against the demons there and their morale.\nFall of Sun's Reach.\nWhile much of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s attention was focused on the Shattered Sun advance from the north, the demons also remained preoccupied with the continued presence of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; to the south. As such, a great deal of their army had to be focused against the undead, which presented the Shattered Sun Offensive with an advantage. In an attempt to prevent the Legion from annihilating their Scourge adversaries (and thus free up much-needed forces) &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; bombing runs using &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Charges%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;arcane charges&lt;/a&gt; were launched to hit the demonic forces at the Dead Scar.\nWith most of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; secured, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; now turned its attention towards &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The harbor, like the nearby &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Village\"&gt;Dawnstar Village&lt;/a&gt;, still remained fully under the control of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; army, who had these areas garrisoned with troops. Shattered Sun forces clashed with those of the Dawnblade throughout the harbor, with the former eventually gaining the upper hand. Three Dawnblade &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s were dispatched to reinforce the harbor against the onslaught, but were soon waylaid by Shattered Sun &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; strikes. The ships' sails were targeted and ignited, causing great damage and stopping them from preventing the harbor's fall, or from making an effort to retake it.\nThe capture of Sun's Reach Harbor completed the conquest of the village and thus cemented the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;'s position on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. With the harbor came the capture of the destroyer known as \"&lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Silvermoon's Pride&lt;/a&gt;\", docked along the quay. The &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Armory\"&gt;Sun's Reach Armory&lt;/a&gt; was also soon made fully operational and began producing armaments for the Shattered Sun troops.\nMeanwhile, on the &lt;a href=\"Greengill%20Coast\"&gt;Greengill Coast&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspine\"&gt;Darkspine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; tribe had enslaved the local &lt;a href=\"Greengill%20tribe\"&gt;Greengill tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. The naga had recently forged an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and busied themselves using their slaves to dig up &lt;a href=\"Darkspine%20Iron%20Ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; for the war effort. With &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; secured, the Shattered Sun Offensive now increased their efforts against these naga. In particular, the Shattered Sun were interested in the excavated ore, which they continued to collect and put to their own use in the Armory. This came with the establishment of an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28object%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt; for the offensive also. During and after the capture of Sun's Reach, &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Kael'thas' forces&lt;/a&gt; continued to launch &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; attacks on the Shattered Sun forces.\nNow fully secured on the island, the Shattered Sun Offensive began the construction of a &lt;a href=\"Monument%20to%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Monument to the Fallen&lt;/a&gt; in Sun's Reach. Using private donations, the monument was eventually completed, offering a testament to all those who gave their lives in the village's capture. Following the fall of Sun's Reach, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27iru\"&gt;K'iru&lt;/a&gt; also arrived on the isle to offer &lt;a href=\"K%27iru%27s%20Song%20of%20Victory\"&gt;its song of victory&lt;/a&gt; to bolster the troops' resolve and further aid in the battle.\nThe Magisters' Terrace.\nWith a foothold on the isle secured, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; continued to pursue its primary target: &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic masters. To this end, a small strike team of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; was assembled to assault Kael'thas's base at the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, located near the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe assault force succeeded in cutting a path through the prince's remaining retainers, who attempted to hold the terrace at all costs. Both &lt;a href=\"Selin%20Fireheart\"&gt;Selin Fireheart&lt;/a&gt; (one of Kael'thas's chief lieutenants) and &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Delrissa\"&gt;Priestess Delrissa&lt;/a&gt; (the one who had revived Prince Kael'thas) were subsequently defeated by the Shattered Sun champions, who pressed forward to confront the terrace's master. After a heated battle \u2014 during which Prince Kael'thas brought to bear all the power at his disposal \u2014 the Shattered Sun prevailed. Just before succumbing to death, the prince gave out a final, maniacal rant \u2014 reveling in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s coming destruction at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Magisters' Terrace, the party also met with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, once the protector of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the mortal embodiment of the Sunwell's energies. Despite his best efforts, Anveena had been captured by Kael'thas upon his return to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and now remained a captive within the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Eclipse\"&gt;Shrine of the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, which was at the heart of the Sunwell Plateau. It was there that Aveena was being used to further the Legion's plans.\nKael'thas Sunstrider's death marked the elimination of the final obstacle to liberating the Sunwell Plateau itself, which the Shattered Sun Offensive was now prepared to accomplish.\nReclaiming the Sunwell.\nHaving curbed the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s influence on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; proper, and with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his forces neutralized, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; now began to prepare for a final all-out assault to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to the plans of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter establishing a small foothold within the plateau, a strike team of champions was once more employed to clear the way farther in towards the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; itself. This group once more encountered the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who had fallen under the sway of the a powerful &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of the Shattered Sun champions, Kalec was able to free himself of the demon's possession, while Sathrovarr himself was slain. The dragon and the champions pressed forward to locate Kalecgos's ally, the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Madrigosa\"&gt;Madrigosa&lt;/a&gt;, who was discovered in the midst of a battle with another potent demon in the form of &lt;a href=\"Brutallus\"&gt;Brutallus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Madrigosa briefly gained the upper hand over the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; and even attempted to interrogate him for information, the champions watched as the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; was eventually overwhelmed and killed. Brutallus now turned his attention on the Shattered Sun champions and engaged them in battle. Eventually however, Brutallus was vanquished. As his body fell to the ground, the demon's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; blood seeped into the corpse of the now-deceased Madrigosa, which subsequently revived the dragon in &lt;a href=\"Felmyst\"&gt;a corrupted, skeletal form&lt;/a&gt;. Turning on her former allies, the dragon was ultimately slain for a second time.\nThe determined group now forced its way past more of the Legion defenders, overcoming several of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s key lieutenants in the process. As this force finally approached the Sunwell, they were confronted by a corrupted &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. Before dying in the ensuing fight, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; completed its transformation into a &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Entropius\"&gt;Entropius&lt;/a&gt;, which the adventurers were forced to put down.\nThe final confrontation began as the Shattered Sun entered the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Eclipse\"&gt;Shrine of the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; stood. Before the eyes of those gathered, Kil'jaeden's portal reached completion. Kil'jaeden the Deceiver emerged from the Sunwell portal by pulling himself partially through it and personally attacked Azeroth's champions. With the aid of Kalecgos, the champions fully engaged the demon lord, and desperately fought to force him back. During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt; was suspended above the Sunwell to power the portal, but she intentionally sacrificed her own life to close the portal and prevent &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival. As the energies of the Sunwell began to work against the Deceiver, the mortal champions were able to successfully banish Kil'jaeden back through the portal and into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;; thus shutting close the Legion's gateway into Azeroth.\nFollowing the victory over Kil'jaeden, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by a large force of Shattered Sun troops, portalled into the chamber to take in the scene. Although the Legion had been defeated, the Sunwell was once more left depleted and diminished. Velen, to the astonishment of Liadrin and others, took the spark of the fallen M'uru and used it to fully reignite the ancient font of power. The Prophet then departed, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; to bask in the Sunwell's renewed radiance.\nAftermath.\nThe battle for the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; marked the decisive conclusion to the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; and led to the complete failure of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s plans for conquering &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the near future. It would not be until the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, that the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s would again assault the world in such force.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; race in particular, the battle possessed great significance. In the period to come, the blood elves of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; would once more occupy Quel'Danas, protecting the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and their newly-restored source of power.\nFreed from the influence of the insane &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, and with the soul of their nation restored in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the sin'dorei now turned their attention to freeing themselves of their magical addiction and restoring their civilization to its former greatness. The &lt;a href=\"Monument%20to%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Monument to the Fallen&lt;/a&gt; would remain in &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; as a testament to all those who gave their lives to defeat the Legion, and save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from certain destruction.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

However, many enemies impede them on their way to meet with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the others at Shattrath Harbor. United, the allies turned their attention to destroying the Iron Horde barring their way and to that end, Khadgar prepared to use a spell to clear their way. However, Khadgar warned that the spell takes time, necessitating his allies to defend the Archmage until he was ultimately able to neutralize the harbor.\nWith the way clear, the allied forces rushed to clash with only to discover him clashing with .

The task done, the commander is quick to join the fight against Blackhand. \nDuring the fight, Doomhammer and Maraad are ultimately killed by Blackhand and the ship they were battling on destroyed by the Iron Star at the command of Khadgar.\nAftermath.\nBlackhand was able to survive being blasted into the sea, but is forced to flee from &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, even as Durotan vows to kill him when the opportunity presents itself. Meanwhile, Yrel vows that Maraad's sacrifice would not be for nothing.\nWith Shattrath saved and the Iron Horde beaten, the commander is directed to save and drive off the from its sacred halls. In their stead, a coalition force maintained control of until they were pushed back by the Shadow Council's forces under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nEngineer and shipwright &lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt; would later reveal that Blackhand commissioned the iron star cannon (which Roark was likely responsible for) and Roark then built the battleship that carried it."}

Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; threat still looms over the continent and holding Stromgarde will be key if the Alliance hopes to keep the Horde's aggression at bay. According to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Roderick%20Brewston\"&gt;Captain Roderick Brewston&lt;/a&gt; in Stromgarde Keep, the Alliance fighting to reclaim Arathi is largely to ensure that they are able to continue to occupy neighboring &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. \nFor the Horde, securing Stromgarde would set the stage for an assault on the heart of the Eastern Kingdoms and serve as a launching point for a campaign against the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.

As stages are completed, more &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas%20NPCs\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; appear and more &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas%20quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; are available.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; have combined the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; forces to form the Shattered Sun Offensive to combat the growing threat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. Their first objective is to take the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt; port town of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Sun's Reach&lt;/a&gt; by force. Adventurers sympathetic with the Shattered Sun Offensive's goals will be recruited to take Sun's Reach in stages with the goal of re-establishing a foothold against the Legion there.\nEach stage has multiple objectives completed primarily by adventurers repeatedly completing related &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s to reach the objective. Shattered Sun Offensive representatives will also give status on the progress toward each objective. The Battle will come closer and closer to an end as the server population and the Shattered Sun Offensive have gained an entire quarter of the Isle.\nStage 1 primary: Taking Sun\u2019s Reach Sanctum.\nThe first arriving adventurers on the Isle of Quel'Danas will find the Shattered Sun Offensive's advance forces have already taken a small building on the north end of Sun's Reach and named it the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Staging%20Area\"&gt;Shattered Sun Staging Area&lt;/a&gt;. The first step of the battle is to take the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; to the south. To do this a realm's adventurers must complete the following two lead-in daily quests to start the recurring dailies:\nStage 2 primary: Taking Sun\u2019s Reach Armory.\nAfter controlling the Sun's Reach Sanctum, the Shattered Sun Offensive next target the Sun's Reach Armory for takeover. The armory is a vital target that will house the many of the Sun's Reach item vendors (primarily Exotic Gear Purveyors). To take the armory adventurers must complete these two dailies many times:\nStage 2 secondary: Activating the Portal from Shattrath.\nOnce the Sanctum gains significant energy, it may be used to focus a magical portal. However, the portal itself must first be constructed and supplied. Speak with in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; to begin daily quests to build the new gateway.\nThe portal only functions one-way taking players from Shattrath City to the Isle of Quel'Danas. To return players may use &lt;a href=\"Darnarian%27s%20Scroll%20of%20Teleportation\"&gt;Darnarian's Scroll of Teleportation&lt;/a&gt; rewarded from the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Know%20Your%20Ley%20Lines\"&gt;Know Your Ley Lines&lt;/a&gt;. Because it is a daily you may only receive one scroll per day, so make sure to use it wisely.\nStage 3 primary: Taking Sun\u2019s Reach Harbor.\nThe final area of Sun's Reach to reclaim is Sun's Reach Harbor and prevent further reinforcements from landing. It includes the large, three-story building on the east side of Sun's Reach as well as the Blood Elf ship, the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Silvermoon's Pride&lt;/a&gt;, that is docked in the harbor. Once taken the harbor will provide the remaining amenities of a town such as an &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mailbox\"&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stable%20master\"&gt;stable master&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"poison%20supplier\"&gt;poison supplier&lt;/a&gt;, and additional reputation vendors. Here is the set of daily quests required to complete this stage:\nStage 3 secondary: Constructing the Anvil.\nSmith Hauthaa at the Sun's Reach Armory will be able to &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt; weapons and armor as well as sell the new &lt;a href=\"Badge%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Badge of Justice&lt;/a&gt; rewards, but to do these she will need a proper forge and anvil. Speak with her to accept her daily quest that will allow you to gather materials for the new anvil.\nStage 4 primary: Restocking the Alchemist.\nWith Sun's Reach under complete control of the Shattered Sun Offensive, there are only a few remaining tasks to establish the town. Inside the harbor building are an &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; vendor that are currently closed for business. offers a daily quest to restock her supplies.\nStage 4 secondary: Building the Memorial.\n in the center of Sun's Reach would like to build a &lt;a href=\"Monument%20to%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;war memorial&lt;/a&gt; honoring those who lost their lives in the battle. To build her memorial she offers a daily quest to accept donations from the server."}

Hamuul also wrote that a couple of orcs wearing the Horde tabard were the aggressors, although, unbeknownst to Hamuul, these orcs were agents of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne rushed into &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he proceeded to have a long and insulting argument with Garrosh, culminating in Cairne challenging Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; for the next morning. When the duel arrived, Garrosh chose Magatha as his shaman due to her previous words, and instead of blessing &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; as asked, she poisoned it. While Cairne was the one with the upper hand and would have won, Magatha's trick blinded Cairne and led him to his death. His dying thought was: \"And so, I, who have lived my whole life with honor, die betrayed.\"\nStart of the conflict.\nWith Cairne dead, Magatha knew that the only one standing in her way was Baine. Knowing that the tauren would conduct a ritual funeral for Cairne including carrying his body from Orgrimmar to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; so that everyone could pay their respects before the body's cremation, Magatha took the opportunity by sending &lt;a href=\"Cor%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Cor Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorm%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Gorm Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; to Thunder Bluff to begin their attack and for Magatha not to arouse suspensions. The Grimtotem then managed to capture the entirety of Thunder Bluff while the tauren there slept, killing the strongest tauren and defeating anyone who tried to rise against them.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan&lt;/a&gt; was leading the attack on &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;. Before attacking, he ordered his second in command, &lt;a href=\"Tarakor\"&gt;Tarakor&lt;/a&gt;, to wait, confusing Tarakor greatly; in reality, Jevan did this to give himself time to warn Baine about all that had happened. At first, Baine didn't believe him until he took out a partial containing the remained of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Runespear\"&gt;Bloodhoof Runespear&lt;/a&gt;. With two dozen Grimtotems rushing on Bloodhoof Village and taking it, they didn't realized of Jevan's betrayal until they didn't find Baine in the Village. Tarakor realized that they passed through &lt;a href=\"Stonebull%20Lake\"&gt;Stonebull Lake&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; riding tauren to go trough it. However, the kod's didn't want cooperate and the tauren were forced to swim, leading most of them to sink under the lake because of their heavy armor. Baine and Jevan managed to escape to &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Thunder Bluff, Bloodhoof Village, &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; in Grimtotem hands.\nUpon arriving, they were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Jorn%20Skyseer\"&gt;Jorn Skyseer&lt;/a&gt;. They went to the back of a lodge to discuss all that had happened, with those present including four braves from Thunder Bluff, the recent recovered Hamuul Runetotem, and their now ally Jevan, better known as Stormsong. Jorn revealed that Sun Rock Retreat was repelled. Seeing their options, Baine said that their enemies are more trustworthy then their friends and decided to travel to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina Proudmoore welcomed Baine and began to discuss. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; used Jaina's &lt;a href=\"%3Ahearthstone\"&gt;:hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; to escape from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and popped up in her tower where he found the tauren. When Jaina calmed them down, they continued their discussion. On one meeting night, Anduin gave Baine &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; to assist him in his war against Magatha.\nDenial from the Warchief.\nWhen Magatha proclaimed herself Chieftain of Thunder Bluff, she knew that Baine would try to take it back. She sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that Garrosh would send troops to repay her loyalty to him. Very soon a runner returned with a message from Orgrimmar. Feeling that Garrosh refused to send aid, the enraged Magatha killed the courier.\nPreparations.\nJevan traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; had agreed to aid the tauren against the Grimtotem for a price. Gazlowe read their request and was surprised by the number of bombs that were required. Jevan gave double the payment for the job due to this, but Gazlow refused, claiming that he supported Baine's cause. Before leaving, Gazlowe told Jevan that he'd always liked his father.\nBattle for Thunder Bluff.\nBefore the battle began, Baine learned that &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; hadn't fallen but the fighting was ongoing, he didn't ask for help from Garrosh for he still didn't know whose side he was on. Magatha recalled her warriors from Bloodhoof Village and Camp Majache to defend Thunder Bluff. Under Jevan thunder cloud, three &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s approached the city. When the ropes were lowered, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and tauren rushed in. Magatha began to fight using her totems, fired lightning Bolts from her fingers to take down the Zeppelins. She hit one and it caught on fire. As it went down it's pilot crashed it into the flight tower, to kill the &lt;a href=\"wyverns\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; so they were not to be used by the Grimtotem. While this was bad for Magatha, another matter caught her attestation. High Rise was being bombarded heavily with another zeppelin on top of it. The Rogues who landed began to cut the ropes to the rises to give Magatha a taste of her own medicine. The troll mercenaries defused the lifts before the Grimtotem blew them. The Grimtotem hunters and druids climbed on the remaining wyverns, but they were shot down by arrows and guns. The druids survived by taking &lt;a href=\"flight%20form\"&gt;flight form&lt;/a&gt;, but hunters met a cruel fate. Magatha was on the run, she order the detonation of the lifts and tried to get to the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt; but bridge leading to &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rise\"&gt;Spirit Rise&lt;/a&gt; was cut. She looked back to see that one of the lifts was destroyed, but the second one didn't. The lift carried Baine to the city and he rushed to Magatha. He was so fast that &lt;a href=\"Rahauro\"&gt;Rahauro&lt;/a&gt; couldn't stop him. Magatha quickly reached for her totems but Baine was already upon her. He swung Fearbreaker and hit her on the side, send her flying. She was in pain and too much in pain to react, Baine was already crouching over her. He ordered her to yield and Magatha agree when she realized she was exposed.\nAfter the battle, Baine ordered that the surviving Grimtotems are be treated for their wounds. When all the Grimtotem were rounded up Baine spoke of how his father was generous enough to let them stay in Thunder Bluff and they repaid him with his blood. He spoke to Magatha about how she wanted power and what it takes to be a leader, she feared his words. Then Baine grabbed her totem pouch and destroyed it before her. Baine exiled her to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and gave the rest of her tribe a choice: become permanent members of the Horde with him as their chieftain or follow Magatha in exile. The first to join were &lt;a href=\"Tarakor\"&gt;Tarakor&lt;/a&gt; and his family. Afterword, many more Grimtotem began to rise. Those who remained loyal to Magatha were escorted to Stonetalon by two dozen &lt;a href=\"Bluffwatcher\"&gt;Bluffwatcher&lt;/a&gt;s. Baine swore that even if &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; was guiding him, he would not stay his hand if they meet again.\nAfter the battle, Baine traveled to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with Garrosh, along with Jevan and Hamuul. After much talk of what had happen, Baine renewed his loyalty for the Horde.\nAftermath.\nAfter all the commotion, Baine returns to Mulgore to give his father a proper farewell. Baine burned his father's corpse and his &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Cairne\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; is released, then the elders accept him as one of their own.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can witness the burial during the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;."}

Rather than be waged explicitly through their factions, the conflict was mostly between the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; that had ancestrally watched over the isles, and &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Hellscream's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, an elite invasion force formed to take the island for its strategic positioning and value.\nThough Kul Tiras was not a part of the Alliance at the time, the Wardens worked with and joined the Alliance in order to ensure their home could be reclaimed, while Hellscream's elite operated entirely for the purpose of claiming the area in the name of the Horde. A myriad of other issues, such as undead, pirates, insanity, escaped prisoners and even demons plagued the isles during the period of this conflict.\nHaving lost the majority of their holdings as well as control of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Baradin's Wardens and the Hellscream's Reach were on equal footing as they did battle throughout the main isle. Utilizing abandoned siege vehicles and regional towers, the two factions warred for control over the isle by trying to claim the three outposts of &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Warden's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slagworks\"&gt;Slagworks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Garrison\"&gt;Ironclad Garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nTol Barad was left in ruins not only from the conflict but because of the prisoners that had escaped. The &lt;a href=\"Hole\"&gt;Hole&lt;/a&gt; has fallen to a prisoner revolt headed by the traitor &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Silva\"&gt;Warden Silva&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"D-Block\"&gt;D-Block&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s all broke free and overran their cells. The ominously named &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Depths\"&gt;Cursed Depths&lt;/a&gt; fell, with undead running rampant through the block. Finally, the main cells within Baradin Hold were damaged by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, which was what had allowed the most powerful demons to escape their cells. Adventurers delved into the depths of the Hold, purging the remaining demons within, while a clean up crew began to restore the prison.\nAftermath.\nBefore the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde scored critical victories off the coast of Tol Barad.\nAt some point after adventurers raided Baradin Hold, a clean up crew was attempting to restore Baradin Hold when &lt;a href=\"Occul%27tharon\"&gt;Occul'tharon&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the same cell as &lt;a href=\"Occu%27thar\"&gt;Occu'thar&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike with its predecessor, its guards were able to contain it with wards for a time. Unfortunately, their efforts were thwarted when the island was overrun by demonic prisoners; forcing the Wardens to once more fall back and leave the hold in ruins.\nFollowing this, warlocks under the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; would eventually make their way to the isles to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, which was embedded into Occul'tharon. By this time both the Horde and Alliance were noted to have abandoned pursuit over Baradin Hold."}

Battles for survival tend to be grueling encounters with long enrage timers (or even none at all). Such fights typically require all raid members evade avoidable damage, force the healers to keep the whole raid up through unavoidable damage, and may also feature random or hard to control aggro. Sometimes designated players will be required to perform extra duties, such as &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt; for instance. Even small mistakes can result in deaths, and even single deaths can result in wipes.\nDue to their unforgiving nature, battles for survival are the most difficult type of encounter. They can even remain a challenge even for well-geared groups, although good gear usually allows for a larger margin of error.\nSome players consider battles for survival to be the most interesting type of fight, others hate them because they are inherently more frustrating for groups. Usually, they are found near the end of instances, and most, if not all, end bosses tend to be battles for survival."}

Although the attack was eventually repelled due to the combined efforts of the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and the champions of Azeroth, the Legion was able to successfully destroy &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLight's Heart.\nAlthough initially believed to be driven by a desire for revenge against the exiled draenei, it was eventually revealed that the motive behind the incursion was to kill the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, who resided in the \"Exodar\". As the last in the line of the Naaru Prime, Xe'ra, O'ros remained the only being capable of deciphering the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, which had recently arrived on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the Felstorm above the Tomb of Sargeras. To ensure the naaru would not be able to succeed in this, &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt; was sent, along with a powerful force of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, to lay waste to the home of the draenei.\nBattle for the \"Exodar\".\nInitially overwhelmed by the sudden attack, many of the \"Exodar\"'s residents retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt; where they remained under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the draenei leader &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, who created a powerful shield of light to hold back the invaders. With the arrival of Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Exodar\"'s defenders began to make gains against the demons and cut them off from reinforcements by destroying their fel portals. &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; allies were charged with evacuating the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Hall\"&gt;Crystal Hall&lt;/a&gt;, but they were separated from the main force and cornered when the hall collapsed. &lt;a href=\"Order%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; champions found the Broken survivors and aided them in fending off a Legion attack led by &lt;a href=\"Karzak%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Karzak the Impaler&lt;/a&gt; before regrouping with Velen's forces at the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually Velen, having deduced the true purpose of the Legion's assault, ventured with the heroes to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Seat of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Rakeesh from slaying O'ros.

The losses on all sides were great, and for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, it was the presumed death of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after, it was revealed that Putress had betrayed &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; rather than acting under her orders, and with several members of the Royal Apothecary Society they sided with &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who had secretly remained loyal to his &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; brothers and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; while serving under Sylvanas. Together, the two had orchestrated a coup d'\u00e9tat and forcefully taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, nearly killing the Dark Lady in the process.\nBattle for the Undercity.\nHorde.\nDetermined not to allow the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s a foothold in Horde territory, Thrall and Sylvanas planned an immediate counter-attack. In the midst of their planning, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived bearing terrible news: in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was preparing for a possible war with the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; assured Jaina that the Horde had no official interest in war unless provoked and that he would ensure that justice would be done.\nAfter informing the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; diplomats that the Horde was not responsible for Grand Apothecary Putress' treachery and that only the Lich King would gain if the Horde and Alliance were to fight one another, Thrall along with Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; led the assault into Undercity itself to reclaim it for the Horde. After fighting the Forsaken rebels and the demons within, the combined might of the Horde defeated the enemies, with Sylvanas slaying the traitorous demon &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance.\nAfter receiving word of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was overwhelmed with anger and sorrow, having considered Bolvar a brother ruling his kingdom and raising his son for years. He sent &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to discover the reason for the Horde's betrayal, which he deemed an act of treason and demanded retribution for his friend's death. Jaina returned and informed Varian that &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; had betrayed them all and the Horde no longer controlled &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Having already ordered an assault on Undercity while Jaina was away, King Varian deemed that not only was it the perfect time to bring Bolvar's murderer, Grand Apothecary Putress, to justice, but to also retake &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance as well.\nVarian and Jaina gathered the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army and attacked &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to reclaim it as Lordaeron for the Alliance and bring Putress to justice. When entering Undercity, Varian becomes disgusted by the condition of the once great city, which he knew since childhood. Tracking Putress to the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt;, Varian and Jaina defeated him. But, to Varian's horror, they also discovered dozens of mutilated and defiled human corpses, on which the Apothecary Society experimented to create the New Plague; realizing that although the Alliance and Horde agreed to a small truce over the years, the Forsaken had been secretly creating a means to kill them all.\nAftermath.\nUltimately, both &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; were killed, and Varian confronted Thrall and Sylvanas in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Battle ensued, though Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; intervened by freezing the combatants solid and teleporting all Alliance forces out, or both faction would have destroyed each other.\nThe Battle for the Undercity ended the cold-war between the Alliance and the Horde, with King Varian's declaration of war.\nMeanwhile, in order to ensure that no more &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;-aligned abominations crawled out of the Apothecarium, Thrall sent a legion of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; led by to occupy the Undercity, guarding it from threats outside, and from any that may remain within following The Battle for the Undercity.\nYears later, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; would attack &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the Undercity once again in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\n\"It's kind of a bang for the buck thing. Like say we redid Battle for the Undercity - we could do it now with much better tech, right? That's a lot of work, and who would want to go back and play the Battle for the Undercity - we'd almost have to create a heroic so you'd revisit it again. Maybe if we could make a really cool compelling gameplay scenario it might be worth it, to do it as a fun little &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; thing, but I'd rather spend that time - it's the same resources - doing a current, modern-day scenario that tells you what happened with Sylvanas. I think that's probably more exciting than revisiting old content. We're committed to having these patches come out faster, so we have to be really picky and choosy about where we spend our time, so we can get content to people as fast as possible.\""}

The conflict was one of the largest in the war, and ultimately saw a tremendous loss of life for the Alliance-Horde army.\nThe battle's massive casualties mainly result from the actions of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; and his allies, who betrayed the Horde and all present by unleashing the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; on the gathered forces. Though the Scourge suffered equally from the plague (and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself almost perished) the true damage was done to the mortal factions present, both in terms of physical losses and the shattering of trust that resulted from the subsequent events.\nTactically, the battle achieved little in the overall campaign, though the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; was likely delayed, and another route to the region had to be used. The result also deprived the Alliance and Horde of key leaders, most notably in the form of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; would lead on directly from the events at the Wrathgate, and introduced a new, tense, dimension to the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations between the Alliance and the Horde all but collapsed as a result of this event, contributing to massive tensions between the two factions for the next several years and fueling the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, and many, including King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, believed the Horde, or at least the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, had intentionally planned the attack beforehand. Many of the Horde themselves also became increasingly wary and suspicious of both Sylvanas and her followers, with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself ordering the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; to help safeguard and keep an eye on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by stationing them to serve as guards within the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOpening.\nSince the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had launched massive, separate invasions of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. With the ultimate goal of ending the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge threat, both factions subsequently succeeded in establishing footholds on either end of Northrend, in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, before gradually pushing further inland. Although neither faction fully trusted the other, both agreed to a general truce when their respective armies gathered in northern &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; before the imposing fortress of &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe planned assault would represent the first major attempt to gain entry to the Scourge's main base in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, with the Wrathgate acting as the main gateway to the region. Each faction established a major base near the Wrathgate itself in preparation for the attack, the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;Fordragon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;. In command of both sides' armies were two of their greatest heroes in the campaign: &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Warlord Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; each took charge of the gathering Alliance and Horde armies respectively.\nAfter cutting of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and when all necessary arrangements had been made, the mortal armies opened the attack, and began investing the fortress proper.\nBattle for the Wrathgate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces initiated the assault and engaged the mixed &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces guarding the gateway to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; himself personally joined the attack, and began cutting through the undead ranks. In response, the Wrathgate itself opened to reveal a large force of &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and other undead, who immediately charged the Alliance forces issuing a battlecry in their own tongue. Bolvar and his forces responded in kind, though they began to become slightly overwhelmed by the sheer force of the attack.\nAt this point, &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; committed the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces mounted on &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; to the fight, who reinforced Fordragon's troops and stabilized the front. Together, the combined army succeeded in wiping out the Scourge present and reformed before the Wrathgate fortress. Bolvar Fordragon then issued a challenge to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; out loud, calling for &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to come forth and face justice for his many crimes. In response, the Wrathgate slowly opened and the Lich King stepped forth to confront the mortals.\nRaising more undead from the ground, the Lich King rebuked his enemies' accusations and vowed to make them all suffer himself. Enraged, Dranosh Saurfang charged the Lord of the Scourge, who quickly shattered the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;'s weapon and killed him, before absorbing his soul into the blade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Before Bolvar could strike, the confrontation was interrupted by the voice of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; from a cliff near the battle. The Grand Apothecary chastised the gathered forces, Alliance, Horde, and Scourge alike, telling them they would now suffer the revenge of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20catapult\"&gt;Catapults&lt;/a&gt; stationed on the cliff subsequently unleashed numerous explosive barrels of &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; on the gathered masses, rupturing and immediately killing dozens of soldiers and Scourge present.\nAs the plague spread through the battlefield, many Horde and Alliance attempted to flee, though Bolvar Fordragon was cut off and trapped. The Lich King, believing it to be the work of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, was also in serious danger of succumbing to the plague, and only barely managed to escape back through the Wrathgate. As the remnants of the mortal army had either escaped or perished, Bolvar lay dying on the battlefield. Gazing into the distance towards &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the Highlord could see a party of &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s flying to the battlefield.\nUpon arriving, the dragons breathed flames over the battlefield itself, cleansing it of the deadly plague, and destroyed the remaining catapults and forces loyal to Putress nearby. Following this, they once again departed and returned to the temple some distance away.\nAftermath.\nImmediately after the battle's end, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; arrived in front of the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with some of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; who survived the engagement. Alliance survivors would recover Bolvar Fordragon's shield (though his remains were absent) at the behest of Alexstrasza and return it to &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Though the two &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s were aware of the true fate of the Highlord, they chose not to share this information with the mortals at this time.\nThe Battle of the Wrathgate had major repercussions for all parties involved. In the aftermath of the conflict, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt; had in fact been acting under the orders of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who had betrayed &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the majority of the &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; with a faction of supporters. The Horde would ultimately gather a force to retake the city, led by &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, from Varimathras and his allies. Seeing not just the actions of Putress, but also the actions of the Horde as a whole, as an outright betrayal, the Alliance led by King Varian, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; launched their own assault on the Undercity, seeking to take back the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The outcome of what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, though it would see Varimathras and his faction defeated, led to an official declaration of war between the Alliance and Horde, seriously hampering &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;the ongoing war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wrath Gate broke a tenuous trust that had only just begun to form, and nearly ended the war against the Lich King before it had truly been joined. It was then the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; that took over the push for the Lich King's head, and kept both factions from forgetting entirely who the true enemy was.\nDoused by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; and then exposed to the red dragons' flames, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon was not truly killed at the battle before the Wrathgate. Incapacitated on the battlefield, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; was quickly recovered by the Scourge on the orders of the Lich King himself, and was taken deep into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to be tortured by the Lord of the Scourge. None of the mortal races were aware of Bolvar's real fate until the eventual assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the war.\nThe remains of &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; too were recovered by the Scourge. Saurfang would be reanimated by the Lich King as &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;the Deathbringer&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge's most powerful &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. As with Bolvar, Dranosh's fate would also be confirmed during the final assault on Icecrown Citadel, where he defended the fortress's upper reaches from the invaders.\nHaving failed to take the fortress and suffered a massive loss of life (the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces alone had lost almost 5,000), the mortal campaign against the Lich King had been dealt a heavy blow. The Alliance in particular was known to have lost more troops to the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; attack than to the actual fighting against the Scourge. Alliance and Horde forces in the nearby area were left in total disarray and panic, with chaos reigning in &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;Fordragon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn alternate land route via the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; ultimately had to be forged, though the invasion of Icecrown nevertheless followed before long. The damage done to relations between the Horde and Alliance by the events of the Wrathgate would lead to further clashes and disasters in the campaigns to come, and make long-term cooperation between the two impossible. King Varian would directly cite the perceived betrayal at the Wrathgate in his refusal to work with the Horde when the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; returned. The lingering tensions also later contributed to the night elves closing all trade routes with the Horde after the defeat of the Lich King, leading to widespread resentment against the Alliance in the wake of elemental unrest and shortage of natural resources and food, and a surge of support for the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. It would also contribute directly to the eruption and global escalation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; which would spread across the two major continents during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as eventually to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrengths.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;\nVarimathras's &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;\nTranscript.\nUpon the completion of the quest &lt;a href=\"Return%20To%20Angrathar\"&gt;Return To Angrathar&lt;/a&gt;, a cutscene plays showing the battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate.

It led to the liberation of the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; half-breeds from their brutal Bladespire masters.\nBackground.\nFor a number of months, tensions increased between the orc clans of Frostfire Ridge and the local Bladespire ogres. In the south, &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; never recovered from the battles with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;s, leading the ogres' hold on &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; to be shattered forever and ogre influence across Draenor to be waning. The Bladespire leader, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Kelgrok\"&gt;Imperator Kelgrok&lt;/a&gt;, was greatly troubled by these events and determined to keep his hold on Frostfire Ridge. To make up for the low ogre population, Bladespire sorcerers had conducted cruel experiments to create new creatures for labor, and the most promising results came from the mok'nathal \u2014 the result of selective breeding between ogres and orcs. To maintain loyalty from the half-breeds, the ogres threatened to kill entire families if even one of their members rebelled. Kelgrok unshackled many of the half-breeds and ordered them to make war on the orcs as the bulk of the Bladespire army. The Bladespire forces rampaged across Frostfire, seizing large tracts of resource-rich land from the orcs.\nChieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; of the Frostwolf clan called upon the nearby Whiteclaw and &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;s to unite with the Frostwolves, but the Thunderlords \u2014 led by Garad's estranged son &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 rejected the offer, choosing to instead raid Bladespire settlements at night. The Whiteclaw clan did unite with the Frostwolves, for whom they felt an affinity due to the two clans' many shared customs and traditions. Garad was declared leader of the Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army, and named his sons &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; as his lieutenants. The chieftain struck at the Bladespire, and though they didn't win any decisive victories, they did capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;. Garad was surprised to learn that Leoroxx and the other mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves. Garad and Leoroxx came to an agreement to help each other destroy the Bladespire clan forever.\nBattle and aftermath.\nLeoroxx returned to Bladespire Hold and incited open rebellion among the mok'nathal. They rose up against their oppressors and set fire to the stronghold as Garad and his army smashed into Bladespire's outer defenses. The Battle of Bladespire dragged on for a full bloody day before the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out. In the heart of the burning stronghold, Leoroxx strangled Imperator Kelgrok with the chains he had worn for so much of his life.\nThe orcs had won, but at great cost. Hundreds of Frostwolves and Whiteclaws had died in the battle, including Ga'nar, who had sacrificed his life while helping many young mok'nathal escape the besieged fortress. Ga'nar's death broke his father's heart, and although Durotan remained to carry on the family line, Garad never recovered from losing his second son.\nAfter the battle, the Frostwolf chieftain offered Leoroxx and his people land in Frostfire to make a new home, but the elder mok'nathal declined, knowing that the orcs would never truly accept half-breeds. Instead, the mok'nathal settled in a remote, resource-scarce corner of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; where they could live in peace, only taking up arms to defend their meager lands from threats."}
{"id": "530102", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=530102", "title": "Battle of Crestfall", "text": "The Battle of Crestfall was a major naval engagement that took place between forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and those of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring around seven years after the original opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Battle of Crestfall served as one of the largest naval conflicts of the war. The Horde armada found itself overtaken, outmaneuvered, and ultimately blown to pieces by the fleet under &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' once-decisive &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s were rendered much less effective during the course of the battle by the presence of Alliance &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlthough the Horde had been in full retreat since the failed Siege of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the battle was critical in firmly reestablishing Alliance maritime supremacy over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s seas.\nHistory.\nBuild-up.\nHaving raged for over a year, the brutal &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; finally began to move toward a conclusion as the tide shifted in favor of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The Horde's failure to seize &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; set into motion a retreat back the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' southern holdings. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; halted his armies at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and began to gather all available forces in preparation for a final stand.\nAt the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; remained at sea, continuing their own voyage back to Horde territory. They had been tasked with pursuing and killing the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, whose abandonment of the Horde had led to its failure in Lordaeron. Under &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, the clan succeeded in this endeavor. They now received word of Doomhammer's orders to gather in the Burning Steppes, and set a course for Horde-occupied &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven as these events unfolded, the Alliance navy under &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was in hot pursuit of this orc fleet. Proudmoore's seasoned maritime fleet was able to easily outmaneuver the less sea experienced orc navy at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and blew many of their ships to pieces. However, following the orcs from behind were enslaved &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; that had bathed several of the Alliance vessels in fire. Though the dragons were few in number, Proudmoore had no means to combat them at the time and was forced to call a retreat. He and his forces were now eager for retribution. They eventually overtook the clumsier Horde ships near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, close to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nEngagement.\nAdmiral Proudmoore's ships were able to easily outflank the lumbering and crude orc vessels, wracking them with &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire and inflicting casualties. The Battle of Crestfall thus began largely similar to the Battle of Zul'Dare earlier in the war, in which the Horde was able to secure victory using their potent &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; riders. The Horde ships here, too, were guarded by a group of these winged beings. This time, however, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleet was accompanied by a force of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battles across the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, these gryphon riders had found themselves at a severe disadvantage when faced with the terrifying might of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Though they were defeated at the time, the dwarves had since learned much from these experiences. Employing new tactics, they now used their mobility against their larger adversaries.\nAs the dragon riders bore down on the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; fleet and prepared to burn it to cinders, the dwarves struck. Taking advantage of their superior speed, they attacked the dragons in a flurry of movement, drawing their attention away from the ships below. Their lightning-infused &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s were wielded with deadly efficiency, and were pitted against the formidable flames of their scaled enemies. \nApart from the carnage taking place above, the two fleets continued to battle among the waves. Alone, however, the Horde stood little chance, and continued to suffer disastrous losses at the hands of the Alliance navy. The sea itself was painted red with the blood of the countless individuals drowning or being killed outright in the struggle. &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the son of the Alliance commander, was slain when his ship was incinerated by a gout of dragonfire.\nEventually, the majority of the Horde fleet was left in ruins. Only a handful of vessels escaped being sunk, &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s among them. Above, the dwarves' fearless efforts were enough to ultimately drive the dragon riders to flight, and they subsequently scattered in all directions.\nAftermath.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; traitors were taken prisoners after the battle. They had been serving as guides on the orcish ships. &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; hoped that their testimonies could be used to have &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; hanged for his treason.\nThe Battle of Crestfall ended as a decisive victory for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, particularly its navy that had not been able to counter the red dragons up to this point. The few Horde survivors managed to make their way back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and on to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, though not quickly enough to take part in the decisive battle there.\nDespite the victory achieved, the Alliance navy also sustained heavy losses, primarily at the hands of the dragons (though they could not devote their full attention to the fleet). The death of his son, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;, weighed extremely heavily upon the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s' commander, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The event would have a long-lived effect on the admiral, who would subsequently develop a deep hatred of the orcish race."}

As it became further threatened by the arrival of Scourge forces, a unified defense force was established to protect the settlement and its inhabitants. This force was a combination of Lordaeron troops, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and a thrown-together group of militia led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Darrowshire's defenders were successful in repelling major undead attacks, and even slaying one of their leaders in the form of the &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Horgus\"&gt;Horgus&lt;/a&gt;, the tables turned on them when, during the battle, Captain Redpath's &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; was torn loose from his body by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt;. Having had his spirit twisted and corrupted by the death knight's black magics, Redpath spread his taint to the other humans. The defenders, now under the sway of the Scourge, turned on Darrowshire and promptly slaughtered all of its residents.\nIn the wake of the battle, the remaining Scourge forces and the corrupted defenders left the ruined village behind and pressed on to continue to ravage the once-mighty kingdom, adding to the Scourge's assault on the living.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; began, many citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were infected with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, transforming them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minions of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. As this army of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began to grow, it started to threaten many of the Kingdom's major settlements. The breaking point, however, proved to be the return of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, at which point he slew &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; the king, and unleashed the waves of restless undead on the remainder of the realm.\nAs Scourge armies swept across Lordaeron, numerous villages and settlements were overwhelmed. Eventually, the town of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, located in the east of the kingdom, was cut off from the rest of the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Although now isolated, the village was not defenceless. A company of troops from Lordaeron's standing army arrived to bolster the town and this, along with the formation of a militia of Darrowshire's residents led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, led to the settlement becoming a bastion of regional resistance against the undead onslaught.\nUndead assault.\nAs Darrowshire's defenders prepared to protect the town and its inhabitants for as long as required, the Scourge launched its first attacks. These initial attacks proved to mainly consist only of dispersed groups of shambling &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and corpses, which were quickly repelled. Soon, however, the undead began to launch more determined assaults. A large second wave, mainly consisting of powerful &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and led by the ghoul lord &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt;, emerged in large numbers from the hills and charged into the forces protecting the town.\nAs Darrowshire's defender began to become overwhelmed, they were relieved by a contingent of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, who set out for the town upon hearing of the imminent attack. Led by &lt;a href=\"Davil%20Crokford\"&gt;Davil Crokford&lt;/a&gt; (a native of Darrowshire) the paladins' efforts succeeded in steadying the line and holding back the undead. Soon, responding to this turn of events, Horgus himself entered the fray and clashed with Crokford on the battlefield. After a heated and lengthy engagement, the paladin managed to slay the ghoul lord, but suffered mortal wounds in return and perished soon afterwards.\nTurning point.\nDespite the deaths of Horgus and Crokford, the battle continued to rage on, with Captain Redpath taking over the role of leader as he led his militia bravely. At this point, however, the undead leader in the form of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt; approached Redpath in the midst of the fray and proceeded to magically tear the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit from his body. Using his dark powers, Marduk then twisted and corrupted his spirit into a monstrous shadow of the former captain.\nThe corrupted captain then spread the taint to most of the other defenders, transforming them too into minions of the Scourge. Their will no longer their own, the troops who had fought so hard to preserve Darrowshire now fell upon it in a twisted frenzy. They proceeded to slaughter all of the village's inhabitants, many of whom sought refuge inside their homes.\nOnce the fighting and massacre had concluded, Marduk and his army left the ruined village, taking Horgus's head with him. The victorious forces tore into the rest of Lordaeron, continuing the Lich King's war on all who lived.\nAftermath.\nIn the wake of the battle, Darrowshire was left utterly in ruins; only ghosts and rot remained. Those who had fallen in defense of the village were raised as ghouls and spread across what would become the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, their spirits trapped in the rotted forms.\n&lt;a href=\"Redpath%20the%20Corrupted\"&gt;Redpath the Corrupted&lt;/a&gt; was eventually defeated at &lt;a href=\"Gahrron%27s%20Withering\"&gt;Gahrron's Withering&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, his shield discarded at the barn there. Marduk survived, though his blade was shattered in combat with a &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; captain near &lt;a href=\"Corin%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Corin's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. Today, he resides in the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, deep beneath the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;, a bronze dragon disguised as a gnome named Chromie eventually traveled to Andorhal, where the Scourge began conducting experiments that tampered with time. Seeking to potentially save Joseph Redpath, Chromie dispatched &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to gather relics of the battle and somehow recreate it, but to have it end in a somewhat different fashion that would allow Redpath to be redeemed."}

Having diverted both the Zandalari and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces away from the capital into the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance unleashed its forces upon the royal pyramid of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on Dazar'alor. Once they were within range, the Alliance planned to detonate the hidden explosives they planted on the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;'s ships. The Golden Fleet, however, began harrying the Alliance navy with their &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt;s and one of them collapsed the deck by &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;'s position just as he was about to detonate the explosives, causing him and his remote detonator machine to fall through to the deck below. Unsure if he was dead or not, Jaina began using her magic to shield her ship from missiles; just long enough for Mekkatorque to pull himself from the debris, get the detonator upright and blow up the entire Golden Fleet defending the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. With the Golden Fleet in ruins, the Alliance navy invaded Dazar'alor with little resistance.\nThe destruction of the Golden Fleet alerted Princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde forces in Nazmir that they have been deceived, and thus they rushed back to defend Dazar'alor. While the Alliance forces fought their way to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Throne\"&gt;Golden Throne&lt;/a&gt; from the port, the Horde forces fended off the invading Alliance forces as they entered the city.\nThe siege and retreat.\nDuring the battle, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; urged &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; to aid his forces. Bwonsamdi created a blood moon and raised the dead to fend off the Alliance. This included &lt;a href=\"Grong\"&gt;Grong&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt; ally of the Alliance who fell to the Horde during the battle and was raised as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"revenant\"&gt;revenant&lt;/a&gt; by Bwonsamdi's magic. Having been turned against the Alliance, the Alliance grimly put Grong down to put him to rest.\nDespite the Horde and the Zandalari's combined defenses, the Alliance breached Dazar'alor and faced Rastakhan. Rastakhan refused the Alliance's offer of surrender and declared that the Zandalari would endure long after the Alliance had crumbled to dust. Determined to protect his empire and people, Rastakhan fought against the Alliance forces until he was mortally wounded, now regretting his pact with Bwonsamdi and how he had cursed his daughter through it as well.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance starts to retreat, with the Horde following them closely. Gelbin can be seen dueling &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; and ends up winning right before the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s arrive. While fighting the adventurers Gelbin ends up being severely wounded and escapes using an escape pod.\nThe Horde continues forward and destroys the &lt;a href=\"Stormwall%20Blockade\"&gt;Stormwall Blockade&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; which was buying time for the retreating Alliance, when &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zadari\"&gt;Captain Zadari&lt;/a&gt; conveniently arrives with a Zandalari &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; so the Horde can continue following the Alliance even at sea. Somewhere on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; the Horde caught up to Jaina who had stayed behind with a handful of Kul Tiran vessels which ended with a naval battle. Jaina boarded the Zandalari vessel and fought the Horde while her ships attacked the vessel simultaneously, although the Horde held on and shot down multiple Kul Tiran &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s. After a bit of fighting, Jaina froze the sea, locking all the ships in place while bringing the fighting upon the waters where the Horde badly wounded her, forcing her to escape using a spell.\nAftermath.\nJaina would spend the journey back to Boralus on a stretcher among the injured, laid out on deck of the ship carrying the other leaders while being treated by priests. Gelbin's escape pod was tended to by his assistant &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Clickspring\"&gt;Elgin Clickspring&lt;/a&gt; and another gnomish engineer, while &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; kept guard. However the escape pod placed him in suspended animation, and neither Jaina nor &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind's&lt;/a&gt; priests know what to do about it, while &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; refer to him as being dead.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s orders, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; ventured into Dazar'alor to bring his corpses of the slain Alliance and Horde soldiers, avoiding the &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;loa of graves&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

Rhonin and his companions, aided by dwarven resistance fighters, succeeded in destroying the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; artifact and freeing &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonqueen from the orcs' control. The vengeful &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; incinerated the Dragonmaw clan and effectively put an end to the last bastion of orcish power in the world.\nPrelude.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; was deeply concerned when &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; disappeared. As the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;'s consort, he vowed to do whatever he could to find her, and eventually discovered that she was being held captive by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonmaw &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s had enslaved Alexstrasza with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that could destroy any &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince Korialstrasz could not free her, he pleaded for help from the Dragon Aspects &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, but they were wary of intervening. Like Korialstrasz, they feared that the orcs would use the Demon Soul to destroy them, or even Alexstrasza. Soon it became clear that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; planned to steal some of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s unhatched eggs for himself.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; stumbled upon the Dragonmaw, Korialstrasz used this opportunity; he took on the form of a powerful &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; mage named &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and promised the human all the aid he could muster to free the red dragonflight.\nConflict.\nStunned to find that an orc clan still had this much power after the Second War, Rhonin was determined to break its strength. He rallied a small group of friends including the high elf ranger &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the dwarf gryphon rider &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and rushed to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; to free the red dragons. When they arrived, the battle was already under way.\nThe moment the Dragonmaw had left Grim Batol and set out for &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing attacked and slaughtered countless orcs. He had no desire to keep them or the adult dragons alive. Only the red dragonflight's eggs were of use to him. Unfortunately for Deathwing, his brazen assault had unintended consequences. As the battle unfolded, Alexstrasza broke free of her chains, and before &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; could kill her with the Demon Soul, she devoured him whole, taking vengeance for the horrors inflicted upon her. Then she turned her wrath upon Deathwing.\nThe Dragonqueen was not alone. Ysera, Nozdormu, and Malygos soon joined her in the fight against their corrupted brother. Though they had rebuffed Korialstrasz's calls to help Alexstrasza, the Dragon Aspects had not ignored him. They had decided to keep a close watch on Grim Batol in case an opening presented itself. Deathwing's attack against the orcs gave them one. As the five Dragon Aspects grappled in the sky, Rhonin and his mortal allies focused their attention on the orcs and the Demon Soul. Rhonin found a flaw in the ancient artifact and destroyed it. In that moment, the power trapped within the relic escaped, returning to the Dragon Aspects. Deathwing could not stand against the newly empowered dragons. He suffered terrible wounds and was forced to flee. He would not be seen again for many years to come.\nThe red dragonflight was free again. Many of the Dragonmaw orcs had died in the battle, and the terrified survivors had scattered into the wilds. They would remain a threat on Azeroth, but they would never truly regain their former power.\nLegacy.\nWhen Deathwing retreated, Lord Daval Prestor suddenly vanished from Lordaeron's royal court. His daughter, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, was left behind to carry on his work, and she relished it. As the relationships between &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; nations were continuing to deteriorate, she decided to spread her influence to the southern &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; as Lady Katrana Prestor. She worked to tangle up &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s rebuilding efforts, and meddled in local politics to keep the kingdom isolated from Lordaeron and the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;. Her brother, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, chose to work from the shadows. He manipulated the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; into allowing the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to use &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; as their new base, and established a hidden laboratory there, hoping to achieve his father's dream of rebuilding their flight.\nFollowing the battle, many of the dwarven veterans of the battle were affected by the evil inside Grim Batol. Over the years, they had aged quicker than they were supposed to, and a good many had died before their time.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; offered &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Hatchling\"&gt;Gryphon Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;s descending of the same &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s ridden by Falstad and his entourage into Grim Batol to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "428478", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=428478", "title": "Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills", "text": "The Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills or the Assault on Hillsbrad was one of the earliest battles of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and was the first major battle between the Orcish Horde and the Alliance of Lordaeron. The fighting lasted for hours and took place in the Hillsbrad Foothills near Lordaeron's southern coast.\nPreparations.\nAlliance Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; had stationed his army in the Hillsbrad Foothills near Southshore, believing this location was centralized enough for his forces to quickly deploy anywhere in continental Lordaeron. This was vital because Lothar and the Alliance leadership did not know where the Horde would invade, or even whether they would invade by land or by sea. While waiting among the foothills, Lothar planned strategies with the Alliance kings and his four chosen lieutenants: his second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo days prior to the battle, the armies of the human kingdoms were joined by an elven battle group led by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Quel'Thalas had sent this expedition to honor the debt that Silvermoon had to Lothar, the last of the Arathi bloodline.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, warchief of the orcish Horde, had recently led his forces in a lightning-fast invasion of Khaz Modan. Using iron and wood resources taken from the dwarves' territory, he ordered the construction of a transport fleet. These large rowing ships carried thousands of orcs across the Great Sea to land in southern Lordaeron, where Doomhammer did not believe the humans would expect an attack. It is not clear which Horde clans or leaders participated in the Assault on Hillsbrad, but it is known that &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; (of the Bleeding Hollow) and &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; (of the Dragonmaw) were in different parts of Khaz Modan at the time, and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin's&lt;/a&gt; Forest Trolls had not yet linked with the Horde.\nAlleria's rangers and Proudmoore's scout ships each reported these movements, and Lothar rushed his army west to meet the Horde as they landed.\nBattle.\nBefore the Horde fleet made landfall, it was intercepted by Alliance warships. Proudmoore's navy sank several of the orc transports, killing thousands of orcs that were onboard\u2014decimating the Horde's initial fighting force (tens of thousands) before the main battle began.\nDespite these losses, the Horde's large number of transports allowed them to reach Lordaeron's coast with warriors that still outnumbered those of the Alliance., and orcs continued to land throughout most of the battle. To meet them, Lothar had spread the Alliance army across the last line of Hillsbrad's rolling foothills, facing toward Southshore and the Great Sea. The Alliance defenders advanced toward the shoreline as the Horde landed, hoping to attack the orcs as they disembarked.\nLothar charged from his line and attacked the orcs himself, soon followed by Turalyon and Uther. Alliance forces cheered as the three leaders struck down several orcs, crushing them left and right. As thousands more of the Horde landed, however, the three fell back to the Alliance front line to avoid being overwhelmed\u2014and at least one arrow from Alleria saved Turalyon from this fate.\nReturning to the line safely, Lothar ordered his soldiers to raise spears and link shields to repel the oncoming orcs. The Horde crashed into this shield wall three times, taking heavy casualties with each assault. The human defenders likewise fell in several places, but Alliance leaders formed them into new lines behind the existing line of troops.\nThe orcs held back after the third failed assault, allowing a handful of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; to take the field. The death knights proceeded to point their truncheons forward, killing the defenders directly in front of them as blood poured from the humans' mouths, noses, and ears. Shocked at this dark magic, Uther bathed the remaining Alliance soldiers in Holy Light to protect them, and then he led his three paladins (&lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt;) out of the Alliance line to attack the death knights directly. The death knights and paladins were evenly matched, neither able to gain advantage over the other, and they continued to occupy each other for the duration of the battle.\nAfter one more orcish assault failed to break the Alliance line, the Horde brought several giant &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s forward. The ogres, armed with uprooted trees as clubs, crushed entire sections of the Alliance's wall of soldiers. As the Horde poured through these gaps, Turalyon and other Alliance leaders gave the order to fall back and regroup. The Alliance managed to form another shield wall at the base of the foothills, as archers harassed the oncoming orcs and ogres.\nKhadgar called forth the powers of a storm, shooting three lightning bolts from his fingers toward different clusters of orcs and incinerating them. Turalyon used this distraction to reinforce the new shield wall and to order brush fires set in the orcs' path to the west. This was meant to prevent the Horde from flanking the Alliance from the west and surrounding them. The fires did hinder a number of orcs, who were shot by elven archers when they attempted to put the flames out, but it did little to slow the advancing ogres. The Alliance focused on these ogres with &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e, arrows, and full units of soldiers. Khadgar likewise killed the lead ogre with a final lightning bolt. Regardless, the ogres took down many Alliance warriors, and it appeared that the Horde was massing for another series of assaults.\nWith the possibility that the Alliance shield wall could break with another attack, Lothar ordered a cavalry charge into the Horde's front lines. Lothar, Turalyon, and other mounted warriors crashed into enemy lines and carved a path through the orcs two times, with Alliance archers providing them cover as they fell back between charges. Before they could launch a third charge, the Horde sounded a drumbeat for retreat.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was raided by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; himself in order to free &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his war party from imprisonment.\nThe Horde regrouped and retreated to the east, toward the Hinterlands. There they would divide into two groups: one to attack the Hinterlands and distract the pursuing Alliance, and another to begin the main invasion of Quel'Thalas. The &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;Horde navy&lt;/a&gt; was also left anchored in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the Alliance couldn't fully expel out the orcish invaders from the region.\nThe Alliance viewed Hillsbrad as a major victory, having shown that their men could stand against the Horde and win. They had also prevented the Horde from marching north to attack &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's primary capital. Turalyon was eager to pursue the orcs and finish them off, but Lothar reminded him that the battle had left their own forces exhausted and short on mat\u00e9riel. After resting and resupplying, the Alliance would follow the Horde to the east."}

{"id": "438473", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=438473", "title": "Battle of Mount Hyjal", "text": "The Battle of Mount Hyjal (or the Battle for Mount Hyjal) was the final bloody conflict that concluded the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was the culmination of years of fighting between the various mortal forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; armies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and saw the demons' invasion end in decisive failure.\nSpecifically, the event took place as part of the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; phase of the war, where &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; struck directly at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; as part of his endgame. The battle began when a mortal coalition of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; elements arrayed themselves before the World Tree to halt Archimonde's advance. Though they were unable to stand against the Legion indefinitely, they aimed to buy time for &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to prepare a proper defense.\nAfter terrible fighting, the conflict would end dramatically when Archimonde himself finally did reach Nordrassil. An army of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, called by Malfurion, was successful in igniting the World Tree's enchantments in a large explosion, vaporizing the demon commander. In addition to closing the Third War, this victory also marked the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Age of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and the Legion's greatest defeat since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. For many years, relations between the mortal races would be defined by their cooperation at Mount Hyjal, which saved Azeroth from certain destruction.\nHistory.\nPrelude: the Third War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; cultivated a peaceful, naturalistic existence along the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and its nearby areas under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, protected by the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. For many long years, Tyrande oversaw night elven governance, ever vigilant for signs of further &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic incursions.\nThe Battle of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; itself was preceded by many months of conflict and suffering. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had finally launched its &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, sparking what became the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; as it rampaged across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and, eventually, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to vast &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic armies, the Legion also fielded the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; which it had created to weaken the world's defenses. By the time the demons reached Mount Hyjal, they had already defeated all major nations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s of Kalimdor (including &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;), and any other opposition it had encountered. Their main objective was the power of the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler commanded the invasion, and he hoped to complete Azeroth's conquest by ushering forth the Dark Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself. Although the refugees from the Eastern Kingdoms also came to Hyjal, they did not work with the night elves, as Tyrande believed that they brought the Legion to Kalimdor. As such, Archimonde was certain about victory. However, he did not sense the presence of the former &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Legion's invasion unfolded, another force worked in secret to undermine its victory. Medivh, brought back to life following his death in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, had been freed from all demonic influence and now took steps to unite Azeroth's races against the Legion. He would subtly manipulate the various mortal factions into coming face-to-face with one another on Kalimdor. Their leaders would meet one day before the attack on Mount Hyjal and agree on a unified approach. The brokers of this agreement, in addition to Medivh, were &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; of the night elves, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these factions readied themselves for a battle to preserve their very world.\nThe Legion would suffer several additional defeats at the hands of mortal forces in the lead-up to the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Included in this was the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, and the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, two of Archimonde's most powerful lieutenants. Nevertheless, the invasion continued unhindered, with &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt; simply taking the places of the fallen commanders.\nSoon, the deciding moment of the war would arrive. As the Legion began its ascent of Mount Hyjal, thousands of night elf &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s gathered near Hyjal Summit. Despite the druids' best efforts, the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s were still reeling from the death of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and did not join in Hyjal's defense. The elves were joined by many &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"keepers%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchimonde's ascent.\nIn preparation for the inevitable assault, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; devised a plan to defeat &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. With the other leaders' agreement, he planned to ignite the enchantments placed within &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s at just the right moment, triggering a massive detonation. This, however, would require time to put into place, and the mortal armies were tasked with delaying the Legion's advance long enough to buy time. The Horde, Alliance, and night elves quickly built up defensive bases along the path leading to the World Tree, where they were joined by additional allies in the form of the &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth%20clan\"&gt;Shadowtooth clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barkskin%20Furbolgs\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. Both Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; initially scouted Archimonde's army.\nDriving the demonic and undead army up Hyjal's slopes, Archimonde and the Legion first encountered the Alliance base consisting of human refugees from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; survivors from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and members of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Led by Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, these units acted as the first line of defense in the battle and fought desperately to hold the invaders at bay. Ultimately, after some time and a stubborn defense, this position would fall to Archimonde, with Jaina herself teleporting to safety after meeting the demon commander in person.\nThe Horde's base further up the slope now became the front line, and Warchief Thrall prepared to defend the position for as long as possible. Owing a blood-debt to the orcs for their assistance, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; joined this force on Mount Hyjal; also among the orcs and tauren were the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt;. As the demons crashed against Horde lines, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; was stirred by the dedication of the night elven &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and was inspired by them. During the fighting, Thrall would order the orc &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; and a group of warriors to hold a vital pass in the area. The Legion soon assaulted the path mercilessly, and only Brox himself would survive, earning him legendary status.\nLike the humans, the Horde put up a stalwart defense of the mountain. Their base was protected by &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; land mines, and they succeeded in holding out for some time against the onslaught. Eventually, however, they too would be overwhelmed by the sheer force of the demonic assault. Like Jaina, Thrall also came face-to-face with Archimonde and was teleported to safety just in time. Though Archimonde was angered by the resistance, each mortal base that fell allowed the undead army to expand, and the attack to gain more momentum. Only the night elves themselves now stood between the Defiler and the ancient World Tree.\nThe night elf druid &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt; would play a notable role in the battle as fighting continued to rage. At one moment, Broll's command was to cut off from the main force. Drawn by his hidden core of druidic power, a group of demons led by &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; attacked him. He called the trees to aid him, giving his group time to regroup with the main army. Already fighting for hours and tired, the remaining elves were overwhelmed by Azgalor. Some &lt;a href=\"mystic\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;s then reported that the pit lord stuck the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; with his weapon, &lt;a href=\"Spite\"&gt;Spite&lt;/a&gt;, and corrupted it with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, blasting and killing Anessa. Despite Broll's loss, his sacrifice saved many other lives and contributed greatly to the victory.\nEternity's end.\nEventually, the Legion would march on the night elven base near Hyjal's summit. All of the remaining defenders congregated there in a last-ditch attempt to hold back the tide. As with the Alliance and Horde, the night elves were ultimately forced to give ground to Archimonde. Thousands of defenders died to hold back the relentless tide of undead and demons, and were inevitably overcome once again. In shattering the final obstacle blocking the path to Nordrassil, Archimonde now believed he had won the day. Unbeknownst to the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt;, the defenders of Mount Hyjal had secured enough time for &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; to enact his plan.\nBy this time, countless &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s had assembled in and around the mighty boughs of the World Tree, though Archimonde paid them little mind. The demonic commander began to scale the tree, preparing to draw its energies into himself. The wisps did not attack the Defiler but instead waited for Malfurion to use the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. When the druid raised the horn and its call echoed through the region, the mass of wisps channeled their energy into Nordrassil as one, igniting its ancient enchantments and power. A devastating explosion erupted from the World Tree, shaking the continent to its core. Archimonde and the majority of his forces were instantly vaporized in the shockwave, along with much of the surrounding forest, leaving only his skeleton.\nIn mere moments, the Legion's second invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was shattered, and its hopes of harnessing the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; crushed. The mortal armies responded immediately to the reversal, furiously assaulting what remained of the demon and undead forces. By the time the final fighting had ceased, most invading forces on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; had been eradicated. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; himself quietly observed the victory celebrations from afar, satisfied that Azeroth had been saved from destruction. He was confident that the victory achieved in the Battle of Mount Hyjal\u2014and the cooperation of the various mortal races\u2014proved the world needed no more Guardians; Azeroth's people were now capable of defending themselves. As his power was waning, he knew that his time on the physical plane was ending and vanished.\nAftermath.\nThe Battle of Mount Hyjal marked the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the likes of which had been unseen since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; over 10,000 years before. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had been decisively defeated, and its plans to take &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; dealt a severe (if temporary) blow. As the world began to recover from the devastation wrought in the conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Age of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; would be concluded, while the &lt;a href=\"New%20Age\"&gt;New Age&lt;/a&gt; began.\nThough preserved, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; had been greatly weakened by the explosion that ended the battle; the World Tree's roots would survive and begin growing again shortly after the event, though the process was slow. The loss of Nordrassil's enchantments would have another major consequence. Without these gifts, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; people no longer possessed their immortality, a terrifying concept after millennia free from disease and aging. They had, however, acknowledged this necessity when formulating the plan, and accepted it as a sacrifice needed to preserve the world. &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and other druids would later attempt to make up for this loss by growing the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Though they were successful, Teldrassil did not possess the Aspects' blessings, and so did not provide any gifts of immortality.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; found themselves with an open future at the conclusion of the battle and the war. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would return to the central &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and settle on the eastern coast, establishing &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and its capital city, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; continued to serve Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, though he was left with guilt at not dying with his warrior brothers on Mount Hyjal. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who had taken part in the battle returned to their new home in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by what he witnessed during the battle, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; would seek out &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and eventually receive the &lt;a href=\"touch%20of%20nature\"&gt;touch of nature&lt;/a&gt; as his student. Hamuul soon mastered the druidic arts, and would become an Archdruid in his own right.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; too would lead her &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; remnants of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; away from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in the south. There, they established the port city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became a major influence in Kalimdor. &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt;, assigned by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to guard Jaina during the battle, remained with Lady Proudmoore, having never been officially released from that duty, though Jaina told her she was free to go. In light of what they had achieved together, a non-aggression pact was signed between the Horde and Alliance on Kalimdor. Much hatred remained between the two factions, and tensions stayed high, but they also collaborated on several occasions, such as when the proud veterans of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; would later participate in the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt; as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the battle at Mount Hyjal, a &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; would take the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt; in Ashenvale. Tyrande and Malfurion remained in Hyjal and began rebuilding. Most of the surrounding woodlands were in ruins, with Nordrassil's roots also being damaged and withered. Though it would heal in time, the enchantments from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s were gone, and the night elves were now mortal. Druids also began to find it more difficult to enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and they considered this period a dark time. The night elves would later move back into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and begin healing that region as well. For years to come, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; remained unable to deal with Malfurion's decision.\nThe events at Mount Hyjal continued to affect the legendary &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; for many years. As a result, he would succumb to his own anger, lose his connection to the druidic spirits, and leave his people. Eventually, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;, and later accompanied &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; to Theramore in order to meet Lady Proudmoore. The sorceress felt that Broll has since reconciled himself with the events at Hyjal, and is now at peace.\nWhen Hyjal was invaded for a second time during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, this time by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult and their masters, the Shadowtooth clan was wiped out. The fate of the Barkskin furbolgs is unclear.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s forces on Azeroth were completely routed following the conflict at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, with the vast majority destroyed either in Nordrassil's detonation or in the ensuing fighting. Despite the totality of the defeat, a number of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s on Azeroth did survive, while the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; remained active far to the north in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurviving demons gathered into small groups scattered around Azeroth. These elements were able to communicate with one another through some means, and they occasionally acted in a coordinated manner. Some demons continued to spread &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; corruption in the world, or chose to guard sites of power; while others were assembling in specific locations to further some unknown design. &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; were two such figures that eluded defeat. Some of the remaining demons went on to serve Kil'jaeden as his agents, spying on Azeroth's nations.\nAs Legion power on the planet crumbled, the mighty demonic weapon known as the &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Glaive of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; was shattered and the glaive shards were hidden away for safekeeping. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; was forced to withdraw and eventually led the remaining demons to &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, before leaving for &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Kazzak commanded &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; to find its shattered fragments, a deed he eventually succeeded in.\nThe Undead Scourge had fought alongside the Legion during the Battle of Mount Hyjal, but its loyalty was fickle. The Lich King secretly waited for an opportunity to break free from his demon masters, and their defeat on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; served as the perfect chance. Having subtly been sabotaging the invasion for some time, the Lich King now broke all contact with the Legion, firmly ignoring their attempts to control the Scourge. The &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, narrowly escaping the events at Hyjal, answered the Lich King's call by rallying all remaining Scourge on Kalimdor and returning to the Eastern Kingdoms. The loss of the undead marked the final failed attempt by the Legion to salvage the invasion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hederine\"&gt;Hederine&lt;/a&gt; demons were seemingly the last remnants of demonic forces directly from the battle, and resided in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. They would eventually be wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Not all demons defeated at Mount Hyjal would perish. The &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrus%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Tyrus Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, was notably imprisoned at the mountain's summit following the Defiler's end.\n11 years after the battle, the Burning Legion invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third time&lt;/a&gt;. As a smaller part of this, the demons once more targetted Nordrassil. The assault was led by &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed much of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The druids from the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Alliance and Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s halted the demons.\nKnown named combatants.\n\"* Killed physically but not permanently destroyed.\"\nIn the RPG.\nDuring the Third War, Felwood was the point to which the demons summoned their infernals to lay siege to Mount Hyjal. When the night elves gathered in Hyjal, the village &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; was almost completely abandoned. Following Archimonde's death, the &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; became leaderless, becoming mercenaries.\nDragons of the red, blue, and bronze dragonflight arrived here to guard the recovering World Tree.\nThe blue dragons discovered that the waters of the Well of Eternity were draining: The demons have created an underground tunnel system below the well, and drain the powerful waters into their tunnels to use for their own purposes. The dragons in humanoid forms inside the tunnels along with their companions discovered that the demons are led by an eredar warlock who plans to consume the water in a ritual in an attempt to gain enough power to resurrect Archimonde."}

It would go down as one of the greatest instances of self-sacrifice in draenei history.\nHistory.\nWhen the draenei first arrived on Shar'gel, they believed that it would be a safe haven where they could settle and start over. However, their eternal foe, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, had lain in wait for them. As the draenei set foot on the world, demonic portals opened all around them, spewing out horrid demons and cutting off their retreat to their vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". All seemed lost until the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Askara\"&gt;Askara&lt;/a&gt; planted herself between her people and the demons. Realizing that she was destined to sacrifice herself to give her people a chance to find a true sanctuary, Askara volunteered along with seventy other draenei to distract the Legion and buy the rest of their kin enough time to escape from Shar'gel.\nHundreds of demons, including &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s smashed into the seventy-one, but the defenders never gave any ground. Every time a draenei teetered on the brink of death, Askara charged through the battle lines and mended their wounds with her staff, &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;. She also used it to blind the Legion's minions and shield her kin from their blades. Because of her, the seventy-one fought with the courage and strength of a thousand and saved the rest of their race from annihilation. As the draenei battled their way to the \"Genedar\", T'uure grew brighter and brighter until it shone \"like a second sun on Shar'gel\".\nAfter the battle, T'uure fell into the Burning Legion's hands. The demons squabbled over control of the artifact until &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; decided that it would go to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Calindris\"&gt;Lady Calindris&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; priestess with an intimate knowledge of T'uure and the holy magics of the draenei."}

Helya wondered if Magnar's spirit would be strong enough to make the journey in spite of her curse upon the Halls. Magnar had his sights focused on the vrykul's ancestral home, the city of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, which had become occupied by &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Magnar's vrykul believed that reclaiming Stormheim would clear the path for a glorious afterlife with Odyn, and Helya and her followers knew that this was their best opportunity to strike at Magnar. With luck, the king's soul would be dragged down to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; rather than the Halls of Valor.\nBattle.\nMagnar's warriors launched a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the Highborne with their ferocity. Magnar led the charge, his shield protecting him from the elves' &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. The vrykul scored immediate victories and built enough momentum to push the Highborne out of the city entirely. The Highborne's last chance to reclaim the city happened at Nightborne Pass. They rallied their forces for a final counterattack and clashed with the vrykul in a brutal, confined brawl, but the vrykul eventually achieved victory. The Highborne fled for their lives and never made a claim upon Stormheim again.\nHowever, mere moments after the vrykul's victory, Helya's servants struck. Traitors arose within Magnar's ranks, murdering the king's closest confidants and his son, &lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt;. In the chaos, more of Helya's &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; followers arrived to ensure Magnar's death. Upon seeing his son being butchered, Magnar was filled with rage and became a whirlwind of death, killing countless &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; and traitorous vrykul before they were able to bring him down. Magnar's people managed to rally and prevent the Helarjar from claiming Stormheim, but they were too late to save their king.\nAftermath.\nMagnar's body was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, but his spirit lingered. His rage prevented him from ascending to the Halls of Valor but also kept him out of Helya's grasp. For thousands upon thousands of years, Magnar's spirit hovered between life and the afterlife, raging at Helya and her cowardly followers. Magnar's son Hruthnir, on the other hand, entered the Halls of Valor and became a Valarjar. Millennia later, Hruthnir worked with a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve Magnar's spirit and bring it to the Halls of Valor, as well as allow the warrior to claim the king's shield, the Scale of the Earth-Warder.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Kingsfall%20Pass\"&gt;Kingsfall Pass&lt;/a&gt; is likely the location where the battle took place, based on its name and the fact that it is the only known pass between &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and Stormheim. This would make \"Suramar Pass\" and \"Nightborne Pass\" alternate names for Kingsfall Pass."}

The demons can be banished, the humanoids can be sheeped/feared.\nWave 2: Two \"Beholders\", called Illidari mind-breakers. The mind-breakers have two spells: A &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt; that causes 4000 damage, and a drain spell that does 500 damage per second.\nWave 3: Four Illidari highlords (more blood elves). They use Flamestrike and a debuff that increases Fire damage you take by 50%. It is recommended that the tank move these around in a circle to avoid the Flamestrikes.\nWave 4: The boss, &lt;a href=\"Torloth%20the%20Magnificent\"&gt;Torloth the Magnificent&lt;/a&gt;. He has an AoE Shadowfury that does 1500 damage and knocks players back. Beyond that, he can be simply tanked down. If a player is casting a heal and is knocked back by his Shadowfury, the heal will heal about 50% of his health, so have your healer move away when he casts Shadowfury."}

These events are chronicled in the &lt;a href=\"goblin%20starting%20experience\"&gt;goblin starting experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nThe goblins of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; were all going about their daily lives, having recently created a new drink called &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27Cola\"&gt;Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to boost their intelligence. Suddenly, the former Earth-wader, had made an appearance at &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; claiming the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; had drawn close, the goblins not very concerned with the threats continued with their day. Eventually, it was discovered that &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; had begun to erupt and some goblins tried to cash in on the event. Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; requested 1 billion &lt;a href=\"Stack%20of%20Macaroons\"&gt;macaroon&lt;/a&gt;s in order to save the members of his cartel and lead them to safety, however Gallywix was not true to his word and instead took the money only to make all of his cartel slaves. Gallywix then looked to start a new trade empire in the distant lands of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; with him being the most powerful goblin on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival on the Lost Isles.\nGallywix and his goblins were discovered by Alliance ships attempting to capture the orcish &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. The humans then fired at &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Yacht\"&gt;Gallywix's Yacht&lt;/a&gt; to prevent any witnesses and they crashed onto the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where they used the remnants of their vessel to build a &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%20Shore\"&gt;small base camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nCooperation with the Horde.\nEventually, the goblins discovered an orcish journal speaking of their base camp and how there were orc survivors and they looked to them for help. The goblins then sent a representative to ask for help from the orcs who agreed to help if the relationship was mutual. The adventurer had slain all the plants in the orc's way and impressed with the goblins technology the leader of the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; had agreed to assist the goblins to find their way off the isles. Much later is was discovered the humans too had found their way onto the island eventually they defeated the Alliance of the smaller isle and saved the \"precious cargo\", &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pygmy threat.\nThe goblins later decided to go to the larger of the two isles and deployed a &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box\"&gt;Town-In-A-Box&lt;/a&gt; so they could have a &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box%20%28Lost%20Isles%29\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; to rest themselves. The goblins were eventually met with &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt; troubles but were able to fight them back. Eventually, the goblins looked to slay the pygmies' turtle \"god\", &lt;a href=\"Volcanoth\"&gt;Volcanoth&lt;/a&gt; which turns out to make the entire island begin to erupt.\nDefeat of the Trade Prince.\nThe goblins met up with the orcs once more to beat back the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for good; and being impressed with the goblins' cunning and strength, the orcs agreed to take the fight too against &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; who enslaved the majority of the members of the Bilgewater Cartel through mind control of some type. When the Gallywix was finally beaten, he was told by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; that he could live if the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Gallywix bitterly accepted and the goblins and orcs parted ways, with Thrall going to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; to heal the world and the goblins going to live in their new home &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the orcs."}

He and his &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; harnessed and twisted &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;'s energies, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; to wield the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; once more.\nBiography.\nThird War.\nAstalor accompanied Prince Kael'thas home to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; after the brutal &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion. Along with &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, he served as one of the prince's closest advisors. Astalor assisted Kael and Rommath in the binding of the tainted Sunwell, defended by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and other volunteers. He was safely away when the well was destroyed. Astalor identified the mooncrystals used to seal the Sunwell as having become &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Sphere\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; by the blast, but believed there was still value in the prince keeping them. Rommath was more hesitant, but also agreed. \nFounding of the Blood Knights.\nAfter the capture of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru guardian of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elven scion &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had the naaru shipped back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, as a gift for his people to feed upon. Astalor, however, was not content with this notion.\nInstead, Magister Astalor and several of the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; worked tirelessly to harness and twist the naaru's energies, and ultimately succeeded in manipulating them. The end result of this was a free method by which the sin'dorei could now wield the Light again, as many of them had renounced their vows in contempt following the brutal &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion that sundered their homeland and people.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"priestess\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt;, was the first blood elf to offer herself to test the powers, thus becoming the first &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;. Astalor assisted the former priestess in first communicating with M'uru, and remained close to the Blood Knights after their formation, his magi working tirelessly to keep M'uru bound in spite of the naaru's apparent recalcitrance. \nAfter conspicuous items at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered by the Blood Knights, the contents were sent back to Silvermoon. Astalor deciphered them and learned that a new enemy in Quel'Thalas (calling himself \"&lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Thadirr&lt;/a&gt;\") had plans for the stones of Light, Fire, and what remained of the stone of Spark. However, this was a ruse; Thadirr (a risen Dar'Khan Drathir, they soon realized) had no intention of using the stones, and had only used them as bait to entrap a number of Blood Knights. Astalor, the Royal Guard, and the regent lord rushed to their aid, and confronted the treacherous magister at Dawnstar.\nUsing the stones' power, Astalor was able to ward off the gathered undead and immobilize Dar'Khan, rendering the traitor defenseless and unable to avoid Lor'themar's killing blow.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAstalor resided in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt; with the Blood Knights' leader, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, proudly sporting the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20Tabard\"&gt;Blood Knight Tabard&lt;/a&gt;. He and his magi kept M'uru in check over the years, occasionally requiring Blood Knight assistance to keep them supplied with Light energy. He remained there with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Lord Solanar Bloodwrath&lt;/a&gt; after the betrayal of Kael'thas to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a chain of events that resulted in the prince briefly attacking the Blood Knights' headquarters with the &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; and spiriting M'uru away to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nAstalor maintained that it would take more than Kael's treachery to break the Blood Knights, and assured players that even now Lady Liadrin was seeking a new source of power for the order.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAstalor, now without his Magister title, appears during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, along with Lady Liadrin and other Blood Knights as part of the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt;. He is in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20golem\"&gt;animus golems&lt;/a&gt;, magically empowering them with &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; and sending them to supplement the blood elf and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; soldiers battling the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces. He accompanies Liadrin throughout &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Exarch's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn%20Camp\"&gt;Sunsworn Camp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Point\"&gt;Retribution Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nAstalor brought an apprentice with him named &lt;a href=\"Kaelynara%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Kaelynara Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt;, though an unspecified incident caused him to &lt;a href=\"Tear-stained%20Letter\"&gt;deem her&lt;/a&gt; incompetent, suspend her as his apprentice and send her back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeritage of the blood elves.\nA vision of Magister Astalor can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falon\"&gt;Falon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solanar\"&gt;Solanar&lt;/a&gt; in visions from the past during the Heritage of the Sin'dorei questline.\nQuotes.\nKael'thas and his felbloods be damned!

He might have been separate from the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; and thus exempt from their exile. \nSince Khadgar refers to him as a good friend it is possible he was allowed to the tower because of the Archmage himself, much in the same way that the player is allowed there - with Khadgar blatantly scoffing at &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina's&lt;/a&gt; ban of Horde in Zangarra.\nHe might simply be a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; with no particular factional grudge, though he uses a blood elf voice and was even given green eyes (his eyes were blue throughout most of the beta), presumably to emphasize him being a blood elf.\nThis may also be a relic of when he was intended to be Conjurer Luminrath, a Kirin'var veteran. Luminrath was a long-standing member of the Kirin Tor and a high elf. This ultimately leads to another issue of why he would work for the Horde is unknown, though it is possible he could have sided primarily with his kindred in Silvermoon, made the transition to being a blood elf, or simply could have been aiding them as a favor to Khadgar."}

Previously a &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Umbric and his followers were exiled for refusing to stop their studies of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Free to conduct their researches, his group of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were transformed during an encounter with &lt;a href=\"Void%20ethereal\"&gt;Void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s. Umbric and his people settled in &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt; adapting to their new way of life, and decided to follow &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; as their leader and teacher in the ways of the Void.\nBiography.\nExile from Silvermoon.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, Umbric was a &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and a dedicated &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt; with a tenacious interest in the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. He believed the void to be a force that could be harnessed for the protection of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; people. His research was opposed by Quel'Thalas's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, who clashed with Umbric and his followers over their research. Rommath eventually succeeded in demanding they be exiled, reasoning that those who treat with the void pose a direct threat to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their banishment, Umbric and his followers persisted in their research, viewing the Grand Magister's admonitions as small-minded. Umbric would guide his group south, out of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to prove the validity of their beliefs regarding the void. There, Umbric and the Silvermoon exiles would make a breakthrough upon discovering the long-buried research of the infamous &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; from many years ago. They would learn that Drathir had attempted to personally enter a void-corrupted world and seize an object of incredible power from within, ultimately meeting failure. Umbric, building upon Drathir's findings, was able succeed where the necromancer had not, and opened the way to the fragmented world known as the &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;. The magister then led his followers into the rift to hunt down the powerful item in question, believing it to be the key to controlling the shadows.\nAt the same time, the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had become aware of the existence of Umbric and his group during her recent disastrous pilgrimage to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, set out to locate her similarly-exiled kin, hoping both to aid them in their journey and add their strength to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Umbric himself had learned of, and was deeply intrigued by, Alleria's own link to the void and the &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;darkened naaru&lt;/a&gt; she had absorbed during the campaign on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransformation.\nHaving successfully reached the &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, Umbric and his fellow exiles quickly discovered an ancient and powerful cube on the ruined planet, and they began attempts to try to open it. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance hero&lt;/a&gt; also arrived in the rift, having followed Umbric's trail, and made contact with the magister. Grateful for the aid, Umbric showed the new arrivals the ancient object his followers had been working on. At that moment, the cube opened with an explosion, and subsequently opened a path for the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt; to access Telogrus Rift. \nDurzaan and his forces immediately overwhelmed Umbric and his allies, and began a process to transform them into creatures of the void itself. Alleria, her champion, and some of Umbric's followers battled their way through the ethereals, reaching Durzaan himself and interrupting his ritual. After engaging him in combat, they were able to slay the Nether-Prince, driving his influence from the Telogrus Rift. In the aftermath, it became apparent that although the ethereal's ritual had not been fully completed, Umbric and the other &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; had been permanently changed; they had now become ren'dorei, or &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria quickly offered her aid in training Umbric and the other void elves in accepting and understanding their new forms, as well as a place in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. \nUmbric, on behalf of his people, accepted Alleria's proposal, pledging the strength of the ren'dorei, and deciding to establish their base on the Telogrus Rift under the leadership and teaching of Alleria, more like-minded &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; began to arrive in Telogrus in response to the recent events.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUmbric accompanied the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; to establish &lt;a href=\"Shatterstone%20Harbor\"&gt;Shatterstone Harbor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. However, he found that there was nothing of interest for him there and that the heat was sweltering. He asked the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to get him out of there so he could go back to doing actually important work.\nAlleria sent her void elf forces after &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; in the war effort against the Horde. Umbric was also eager to show Anduin that his trust in the void elves was well-placed. To battle the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; forces at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Umbric provided a &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric%27s%20Void%20Shard\"&gt;void shard&lt;/a&gt; to cast their mechs into the Void. Umbric and the adventurer confronted Gallywix at &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, where he was looting the sacred tombs of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; kings. He fled through a teleporter to &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;his palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and was swiftly followed. Umbric heavily disapproved of Gallywix's spending and depravity, and was adamant that with his wealth he could do good for the world. They battled Gallywix at the palace only for it to turn out to be an &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Impersonator\"&gt;impostor&lt;/a&gt; as the real Gallywix flew off. Umbric blamed himself for the Trade Prince getting away, but &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; assured him that he performed admirably.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, the forces led by &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; began an operation to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; harbor's defenses. Umbric and Shandris assaulted &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt; to plant bombs on the ships there, and Umbric had known many who had been affected by the Zandalari's barbarism before. Umbric performed a ritual to disguise the adventurer as a &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;, so that the Horde would think it was an attack from &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; and not from the Alliance, and provided a &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Orb\"&gt;Portal Orb&lt;/a&gt; to pull the Horde's emissaries to the Zandalari into the Void before they could share intel on the Alliance with the trolls. When the ship \"&lt;a href=\"Gral%27s%20Call\"&gt;Gral's Call&lt;/a&gt;\" discovered the Alliance at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;, Umbric opened a Void portal to transport Alliance forces aboard the ship to kill the crew. He also assisted \nFrom Xibala, Umbric later assisted Kelsey and opened a portal for &lt;a href=\"Grong\"&gt;Grong&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, he and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; opened a &lt;a href=\"Entrance%20Portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Treasury\"&gt;Zandalari Treasury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor%20%28pyramid%29\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on Zuldazar, Umbric used the Void to raise the corpses of &lt;a href=\"ravasaur\"&gt;ravasaur&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Xonac\"&gt;Great Xonac&lt;/a&gt;, to inflict psychological damage on the Zandalari, since they revere dinosaurs and revile the undead. He can be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Feeding%20Grounds\"&gt;Feeding Grounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seekers%27%20Expedition\"&gt;Seekers' Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nUmbric was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nA &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;corrupted version of Umbric&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nMy people have been training.

I was certain I could master any force we encountered.\nI was so wrong...\nI led us right into the ethereals' trap.

It will answer our call, and will allow itself to be guided for a time.\nI am told the Zandalari hold their dead in special regard, a rather primitive approach for such a grand civilization. One might consider it... poetic for them to be undone by one of their own, hmm?\nSpeculation.\nWhen exactly Umbric and his followers were exiled is unclear, but it could have happened at any point after the events of the &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;battle for Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and the restoration of the Sunwell based on the fact that his research threatened the Sunwell."}

{"id": "120127", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=120127", "title": "Magisters", "text": "The Magisters are a prominent group of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and are one of three major factions in the government of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. They are led by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful archmage who succeeded &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion&lt;/a&gt;. They are a politically powerful group, its leaders having strong historic ties to the upper echelons of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nThe Magisters' exact origin and time of ascension to authority are unknown, but it is presumed that they existed maybe before or during the founding of Quel'Thalas. They have been Silvermoon's top authority on all things pertaining to magic, and have been in possession of a vast reservoir of knowledge on all things arcane, for many years. Like the Farstriders, the Magisters have been a cornerstone of Thalassian society for many years, and a common career choice for studious and ambitious elves.\nFor many years, the Magisters' leadership has been an elected position. The grand magister also appoints a Seeker of Wisdom, who travels across Azeroth in search of further magical knowledge on the Magisters' behalf.\nHistory.\nFall and rise of Quel'Thalas.\nAt the crux of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the high elven magi of Quel'Thalas were mostly stationed within the illustrious elven capital of Silvermoon, and on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; (possibly the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt;). The magi were largely unaware of the initial stages of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack, residing on Quel'Danas with and the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; under sent out numerous messengers to Quel'Danas, though these proved to be vain attempts of getting the word to them in time. Sylvanas herself held out hope that the magisters could turn the battle around if word reached them in time, though the Scourge had already reached Silvermoon by the time the bewildered elves became aware of the threat.\nThe Magisters were rallied by after Sylvanas' downfall. Magisters Yisanan, Senithir, Ainetu, and Cillias fought to defend Silvermoon. The grand magister took over the defense of Silvermoon in the fallen general's stead, organizing the combined efforts of the magi and rangers. However, despite 's best efforts and strategies, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; overcame all obstacles. Belo'vir was slain on Quel'Danas, along with the entire &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch of this destruction came about due to the Magisters having been betrayed by one of their own - an ambitious, slighted, and vain mage called &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; sold out the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to in return for power, and personally murdered many &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; members and other magisters near the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, which he then bound and cut off from the elves. Several deceased magisters were raised into &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;s and left at the defiled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe surviving magisters rallied behind when the prince returned to take his &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;murdered father's&lt;/a&gt; place. They accompanied him to Quel'Danas, now overrun with the undead, and confirmed that the Sunwell was fouled and corrupted by the Scourge's necromantic energies. A raid of Farstriders, warriors, and priests accompanied the magisters back to the isle to destroy the tainted Sunwell and avert further calamity, and undead magisters were spotted among the Scourge's ranks. hoped that they lacked in death the great powers they had wielded in life.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the culling of the high elves, as well as the loss of the Sunwell, the surviving high elves cast off their name and rose to become \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen brethren. At the behest of Prince Kael'thas, rightful monarch of Quel'Thalas, many powerful magi traveled with him to serve the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance remnants&lt;/a&gt; and later in Outland in order to secure a new homeland for their people and to find a relief for their race's &lt;a href=\"magical%20addiction\"&gt;magical addiction&lt;/a&gt;. The magi were among the first to dabble in the volatile new powers advocated by the powerful half-demon, and Prince Kael'thas sent back a number of magi along with to share these new teachings with the elves back in Quel'Thalas.\nThe elven homeland, shattered by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack, remained infested with the Scourge in spite of the blood elves' (led by Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;) attempts to reclaim it for their people. However, this was to little avail, until Rommath and the magisters returned - bringing with them the radical teachings advocated by Illidan - smoothly attributed to Kael'thas - which involved forcibly taking arcane energy from various external sources, such as arcane crystals and mana-bearing creatures. Coming under the total leadership of Rommath, the new Grand Magister, the magisters rejoined with the blood elves within Quel'Thalas and stormed the undead-infested areas of northern &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, eradicating the undead still lingering within.\nRevitalized by this turn of events, the blood elves generally took well to this efficient new method, and Rommath and the magisters went about reclaiming and rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; -- \"almost overnight\". Once complete, the magisters quickly re-established themselves as one of the most respected political groups within Quel'Thalas. The towering spires of Silvermoon stood standing skyward once again, powered by the magisters' volatile magics. With their homeland back under sin'dorei control, the blood elves hailed Kael'thas as their savior and hero, emboldened by the notion that the Prince would someday return to lead his people to power and glory.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nUnder the leadership of Grand Magister Rommath, the magisters have re-established themselves as one of the most (if not the most) influential and authoritative groups within Quel'Thalas, more so than the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and the newly-emerged &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, a group the magisters had a hand in creating. The Magisters were supporters of Silvermoon's alliance with the Horde, and had any dissidents speaking out against it magically silenced. Using the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20golem\"&gt;Arcane Guardians&lt;/a&gt; patrolling the city, they also spread positive propaganda regarding the blood elves' looming destiny and their prince.\nThe Magisters have taken a more direct approach to gaining power within Silvermoon's political climate. Their authority on magic has led to them having an easily establishable sense of power over the addicted masses of Silvermoon and thus, won them the favor and allowed them to control many citizens with ease. They are true to the Jingoist philosophy that elves have always practiced, although after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, they have begun to enforce it rigorously. The Magisters' successes in retaking and rebuilding Quel'Thalas was not seen as a good thing by all of the blood elves, however. One &lt;a href=\"Lyria%20Skystrider\"&gt;notable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Priest%20Ennas\"&gt;pair&lt;/a&gt; held a rally against the state, claiming that the Magisters' work had been excessive, at too high a cost, and too reliant on the magic they felt had damned them all in the first place, going so far as to call them traitors.\nAlthough even the regent lord of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; did not condone all of their methods, Grand Magister Rommath spoke with Prince Kael'thas's full approval.\nWhile the Magisters and the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; rarely see eye-to-eye, the two sin'dorei organizations found some very common ground against &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, one of Quel'Thalas' greatest traitors. Military might alone would not suffice against the undead forces streaming from &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, yet with their guile and unmatched knowledge of the arcane, some of the most powerful Magisters rebuilt and made the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Sanctum of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; operational to stand defiant against the Scourge invaders. &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Kaendris\"&gt;Magister Kaendris&lt;/a&gt; and his magi coordinated the final strikes against Dar'Khan, ending with the traitor's head sent back to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Silvermoon's regency&lt;/a&gt;. The Magisters also took an interest in the Scourge-infested &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find ways to reverse its taint.\nPost-Quel'Danas.\nWith the threat that the crazed aspect &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; posed to the world of magic on the horizon, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; turned to those who had always been allies of Dalaran, friends from the past - the Magisters of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nRommath, still with fresh memories of how the Kirin Tor had turned a blind eye to the blood elves' slated execution at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, decreed that none of his magisters would be assisting if it would be for the benefit of the Kirin Tor. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, though in agreement with Rommath's reasoning, overruled this.\nSeveral blood elven magisters were thus seen supporting the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, though most of which were affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Magister%20Keldonus\"&gt;Magister Keldonus&lt;/a&gt; apparently betrayed the Magisters becoming a &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFollowing the expulsion of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, their strength is added to that of the Magisters. Rommath and his magi later assisted the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nIn the past, many Magisters studied together with the Kirin Tor in Dalaran, and some now wonder if it is time to put their recent conflicts behind them and fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; together. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Magister Rommath named the magistrix &lt;a href=\"Esara%20Verrinde\"&gt;Esara Verrinde&lt;/a&gt; to be the Magisters' Seeker of Wisdom, who traveled from &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt; and find anything of use. She meets the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and was then invited to join the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; reformed by &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; and the Conjuror in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, several Magisters also joined their ranks, as Esara states that she will ensure that they will support the reformed order to fight the Burning Legion.\nRommath led several Magisters to Suramar to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebellion. The grand magister believes that only his Magisters and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;'s Blood Knights are capable of achieving victory against the city's Burning Legion-aligned masters.\nOrganization and power.\nThe Magisters are foremost a political group, and have little presence outside &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the Sunreavers, who while mostly blood elves also have a number of other races within their ranks, the Magisters are comprised entirely of sin'dorei. Magisters commonly take on apprentices, and sometimes run magical schools. Others are seen to rule towns and villages in &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;. The Magisters have long been renowned for their vast magical knowledge; according to Grand Magister Rommath, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was known to frequently ask for their aid when in over their heads.\nOfficially, the Magisters are non-military personnel, but higher-ranked Magisters have commanded and overseen military operations in the past. During the Scourge invasion, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt; took over overall command of the battle when &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; fell, and &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; was placed in charge of evacuating the non-combatants from Silvermoon. &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Kaendris\"&gt;Magister Kaendris&lt;/a&gt; and his magi played an active part in assisting the Farstriders in defeating &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; and invading the traitor's citadel.\nTo become a magister is to have achieved a high status in blood elf society. The station of Grand Magister is one of the most powerful positions to hold in the kingdom. A mage falling out of favor with the Magisters usually results in them being reassigned to &lt;a href=\"Lorrin%20Foxfire\"&gt;less&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Elosai\"&gt;pleasant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Faila\"&gt;duties&lt;/a&gt; outside of Quel'Thalas.\nThe Magisters enforced a regime which heavily emphasized the importance of unity in Quel'Thalas, at its harshest to the point of totalitarianism. Their more vocal critics and dissenters were even mind-controlled into singing the state praises. The Magisters were also behind other less savory ideas, such as the exploitation of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. Their power was not uncontested - in fact, Rommath frequently argued with both Lor'themar and Halduron over many matters - but the grand magister ultimately spoke with Prince Kael'thas's full authority, even if the regent lord did not condone the action. With Kael's death and Lor'themar now the sole head of state, this is no longer the case.\nExperiments and creations.\nThe Magisters are responsible for several ambitious magical projects in Quel'Thalas.\n&lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;, the great magical shield that once protected Silvermoon, was also able to be upheld by the magi themselves even without access to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s power; &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt; made use of this during the Scourge invasion, when the Sunwell was bound and unable to passively empower the shield. Through the &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestones&lt;/a&gt;, the magi also maintained a dampening field within Quel'Thalas, restricting the magical power of all non-elves, although this was dwarfed by Ban'dinoriel's seemingly impenetrable strength.\nIt is strongly implied that the magi were the ones who created the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Wyrm\"&gt;mana wyrms&lt;/a&gt;, small mana-bearing creatures who were once used to defend elven crystals. They were maddened by the Scourge invasion, and have even begun attacking their creators. The magi of the Sunreavers have deployed more powerful, friendly mana wyrms in recent times.\nThe Magisters were the ones who originally devised the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; order. After months of extensive research into &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru shipped back to Silvermoon for the elves to \"feed\" upon, they discovered a more pragmatic way to use the gift and were able to manipulate his energies to grant the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to elves who had no interest in following its teachings or tenets. Rommath and the magister &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; were key figures in this experiment, the latter of whom went on to become a recurring figure within the Blood Knight order.\nThey repurposed the large, green crystals (known as &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s) found around Silvermoon, using the power stored within them (demonic magic) to empower the city, which had begun to deteriorate without the Sunwell's energies to hold it together. It is implied that living in proximity to this is the reason so many blood elves acquired their fel-eye glint despite the use of fel being largely hidden from the general public. Some &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf%20Magister\"&gt;bolder magisters&lt;/a&gt; siphoned these crystals directly and also used them to empower the various extravagances that blood elves enjoy indulging in. The need for these has become apparent as many of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctum\"&gt;Arcane Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;s in the land have either begun to weaken or malfunction due to the various problems caused by sabotage and remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. When the Sunwell was restored at the end of the conflict on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the crystals were removed, though the blood elves have continued to employ standard &lt;a href=\"Mana%20crystal\"&gt;arcane crystals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe magi of Quel'Thalas were also responsible for bathing their kingdom in perpetual springtime, leading to Quel'Thalas becoming known as the \"Land of Eternal Spring\".\nStance on magical addiction.\nThe Magisters, who spread &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;teachings&lt;/a&gt; within Quel'Thalas, encouraged the addicted masses to sate their magical cravings carefully and with good judgment. Their belief was that finding the key balance between deficiency\u2013arcane withdrawal was weakening many elves, growing worse, and even killing some of them\u2013and overindulgence\u2013\"over\"using the mana siphoning was also hazardous, giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;\u2013would allow the blood elves to maintain their health and allow them to thrive.\nCurrent activities.\nFollowing the betrayal of Kael'thas and the revitalization of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the future of the Magisters is unclear. It is known that despite this turn of events, some blood elves have found difficulty in adapting to the more positive path the Sunwell has given them (and others even prefer the old ways), though it appears the Magisters have remained one of the most powerful groups within Quel'Thalas.\nRanking system.\nThere are several ranks within the Magisters, each one a title that showcases their mastery of the arcane, as well as their importance within the order.\nOther ranks.\nA number of blood elven casters are seen with other ranks, though their affiliation to the Magisters is unclear. Such titles include \"Astromancer\", \"High Astromancer\", \"Summoner\", \"Star Scryer\", &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Antheol\"&gt;Instructor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nThe Magisters are centralized in their leadership: The &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas serves as their supreme leader and highest figure of authority, holding more influence than even the highest sin'dorei archmages, Today, the Grand Magister is &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, who acquired the title after his return from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; with several of the Magisters.\nThe grand magister is an elected position. Rommath and Belo'vir are the only known grand magisters, the latter of whom was elected as such several years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagisters and arcanists.\nThe divide between a magister and an &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt; is unclear in blood elven society. It might be that an arcanist is simply another rank of magister, such as &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Torseldori\"&gt;Arcanist Torseldori&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"bloodmage\"&gt;bloodmages&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagister relations.\nThe Magisters seem to be somewhat above the political divide within Silvermoon City, and the majority of the friction stems from and between the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. The Magisters were essentially the creators of the Blood Knights, and seem to be supportive of their mindset, though reference has been given to several disagreements between Grand Magister Rommath and the Farstriders' leader, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Their relations have mostly improved since Kael'thas's betrayal.\nOnce, it was not uncommon for mages of Quel'Thalas to study in Dalaran (Kael'thas and Rommath both did so), but this ceased after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunreavers, whose ranks include many who bear the title of magister, later rejoined the Kirin Tor, but were banished during the Horde-Alliance war. The Magisters' most bitter grudge is reserved for the Kirin Tor, whom they believe to have enabled the great injustice Kael'thas and his troops suffered in the Dungeons of Dalaran. Rommath completely denied the Kirin Tor the aid of any of his magisters, but was overruled in the matter by the regent lord. Some of the Sunreavers feel similarly betrayed by the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;."}

Kael'thas stands poised to desecrate the ancient lands of his people with an incomparable evil.

He was buried on Quel'Danas.\nThe blood elves continue to care for the terrace. &lt;a href=\"Swift%20White%20Hawkstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas' hawkstrider&lt;/a&gt; is looked after here, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Hatchling\"&gt;rare phoenix hatchling&lt;/a&gt;. The terrace has become something of a museum since the war on Outland: items and artifacts reclaimed from the Sunwell have found their way here, others having been donated anonymously. &lt;a href=\"Apolyon%2C%20the%20Soul-Render\"&gt;Apolyon, the Soul-Render&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thori%27dal%2C%20the%20Stars%27%20Fury\"&gt;Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury&lt;/a&gt; are two notable items in the blood elves' keeping. The possessions and artifacts of the fallen Sunstrider dynasty are given places of honor in the terrace.\nMagisters' Terrace is where the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Style\"&gt;Trial of Style&lt;/a&gt; is held. &lt;a href=\"Shadreen\"&gt;Shadreen&lt;/a&gt; made a brief appearance here, collecting some information.\nReputation.\nNormal mode.\nA full Magisters' Terrace clear will yield around 1640 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; up to &lt;a href=\"revered\"&gt;revered&lt;/a&gt;, while after revered with the faction you will only get 1230 reputation.

Most elite trash yield 15 reputation. &lt;a href=\"Sunblade%20Sentinel\"&gt;Sunblade Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s yield 30 reputation. The Wretched &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Bruiser\"&gt;Bruisers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Husk\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Skulker\"&gt;Skulkers&lt;/a&gt; yield 11.25 reputation. All the bosses yield 250 reputation each. &lt;a href=\"Brightscale%20Wyrm\"&gt;Brightscale Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s yield 2 reputation.\nMost of the boss fights are the same as in normal mode. The Kael'thas fight is a little different in that he casts a Pyroblast one minute into the fight (won't cast it if he enters gravity lapse mode before that). During the cast time he puts up a shield (Shock Barrier, absorbs 10K damage) which makes him immune to all interrupts. The shield is vulnerable to normal attacks and MUST be taken down before the Pyroblast casts. Once the shield is down, normal spell interrupts (counterspell, shield bash, kick etc.) will stop the casting. If the Pyroblast is not interrupted it will deal upwards of 40,000 damage to the tank. Pally tanks can bubble out of the first pyroblast, and it is suggested that if dps isn't able to burn through the Shock Barrier that a warrior tank pop shield wall and last stand, it is possible that this might enable him to live through 1 pyroblast but should a 2nd come he has no recourse. If you fail to stop the Pyroblast and your tank goes down, you can still easily finish. For at this point there is no aggro, Kael just spams the gravity effect\nAt Level 85.\nFor those solo farming Shattered Sun reputation or for the mount or pet drops, Magisters' Terrace is fairly easy at level 85, but not a total walk in the park. Carelessness can result in dying to the mob groups after , as they have an assortment of close-in and ranged abilities that can prove dangerous if not accounted for properly, depending on one's class. As for the bosses, and are rather easy DPS races at this level, as is (though unless one has exceptional DPS, he will cast his gravity lapse, which is little more than an annoyance). The encounter, however, does require a little planning, as the assortment of stuns available to her group (depending on which ones are present) can make this encounter a challenge for cloth-wearing characters if one is not careful. As for gold farming, the mobs usually drop between 50 silver and one gold each, though sometimes (considerably) less. With the gold from selling the drops off the bosses and mobs, one can usually realize between 100-200 gold for a full heroic run, minus repair costs.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

When his mentor was exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; for defending the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, Barthilas replaced Tirion at the head of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; for a time, before becoming the Magistrate of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. He was killed along with his people by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarthilas was later brought back from death as a &lt;a href=\"wight\"&gt;wight&lt;/a&gt;, in order to guard the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; side of Stratholme in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, until he was finally killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s years later.\nBackground.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nBarthilas was an ambitious young &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; who served under &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; as his second. He was ordained a paladin just as the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; ended, a war which claimed his parents' lives, and left the young man a deep hatred for all &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. When Tirion was found injured and unconscious, Barthilas spent the entire night healing his mentor, mending his broken bones until he was exhausted. Once rested, he immediately assumed that Tirion had been attacked by an orc, and began to scour the countryside for a force of them. He called for help from &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;. Barthilas, Tirion, Saidan, and his men found the orc named &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to capture him. Tirion tried to defend Eitrigg but was arrested for treason.\nAfter Tirion was arrested, Barthilas personally oversaw the paladin's prosecution and served as a witness during Tirion's trial, which led the paladin to his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; and his exile. Barthilas also made plans for the torture and execution of Eitrigg only to see the orc escape from Stratholme with Tirion when &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city. During the raid, one of the orcs jabbed a spear into Barthilas's chest. Despite the grievous wound, Barthilas survived and eagerly assumed his new position as Lord of Mardenholde after Tirion went into exile. His title eventually passed to Tirion's son &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagistracy of Stratholme.\nAt some point after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Of%20Blood%20and%20Honor\"&gt;Of Blood and Honor&lt;/a&gt;\", having survived his impalement earlier on, Barthilas became Magistrate of Stratholme, where he remained until the time the Stratholme was purged by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. He then had an assistant called &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20O%27Reilly\"&gt;Patricia O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;, and evidently fell during this period, becoming the creature seen in Stratholme today.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Barthilas is located in Stratholme's &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28Stratholme%29\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, trying to assuage the fears of his petitioners, who are concerned over rumors of the plagued grain, in fact, the shipment from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; tainted by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Crypt of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, in the , &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; if they would be interested in taking Barthilas's position as Stratholme's mayor, confirming that the latter was indeed killed a few years before.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Barthilas was among those innocents purged by Arthas and his forces during the Culling of Stratholme. The Lich King eventually raised the former magistrate from the grave and commanded the hulking undead monstrosity to guard his ruined home.\"\nLocation.\nThe Magistrate could be found in two locations in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. If the party entered through the eastern gate (typically referred to as the back door, the dead side or Strat Baron side), the Magistrate sounds an alarm and runs from just inside the instance to the gates just before the Baron. If the party enters through the western gates (typically referred to as the front door, Strat Scarlet Side or the living side), he remains near the eastern entrance in front of &lt;a href=\"Aurius\"&gt;Aurius&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwar.net/wiki/Stratholme_Map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; at Worldofwar.net for a layout of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. The location marked as 6 is where he is located when entering through the Scarlet Side gates. The location for the Baron side is unmarked, but it is between 10 and 12 (&lt;a href=\"Maleki%20the%20Pallid\"&gt;Maleki the Pallid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Ramstein the Gorger&lt;/a&gt;).\nThis was only important if you were trying to farm the Magistrate for drops. In particular, the druid idol (&lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Brutality\"&gt;Idol of Brutality&lt;/a&gt;) that drops from the Magistrate was excellent for bear druids and the quickest way to get to him would by entering through the Scarlet Side gates.\nIn \"Cataclysm\", the Scarlet side and Scourge sides were separated, using the main entrance and the &lt;a href=\"Eastwall%20Gate\"&gt;Eastwall Gate&lt;/a&gt; as their own entrances. Just as before, entering the Scourge side causes the Magistrate to sound an alarm and run from just inside the instance to the gates outside of &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20Square\"&gt;Slaughter Square&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThis fight is fairly straightforward, with one caveat. When tanking the Magistrate, it is best to have the tank back up against a wall, as this mob will punt the player with aggro a fairly good distance. In addition, if mobs were skipped near the gate, it is possible to be punted into them. \nThe punt effect is either a complete threat wipe or a large threat reduction that will hit the character currently tanking the Magistrate. It is important that dps run towards the tank rather than away from the tank if the Magistrate targets them following a punt. He is tauntable so it's easy to establish threat after the punt if the tank can reach him."}

Darius and Ivar also made their blood offering to hundreds of other &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Refugee\"&gt;human survivors&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron, substantially bolstering the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Worgen\"&gt;Hillsbrad Worgen&lt;/a&gt;.

Favored among &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros's&lt;/a&gt; pets, Magmadar is protected by the flamewaker &lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt; and surrounded by vicious packs of ravenous hounds. It is said that while Ragnaros was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, the Firelord would feed the remains of his captured enemies to the eagerly awaiting twin maws of Magmadar. As a result, the hound grew strong and loyal, and even now Magmadar's savage ferocity remains uncontested. Magmadar is the alpha male of all core hounds.\nHe lives within Magmadar Cavern guarding the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Kress\"&gt;Rune of Kress&lt;/a&gt;. He is found directly behind &lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s heroes, recruited by the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, stormed the Molten Core, they had to overcome vicious corehounds and their monstrous father, Magmadar.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Lava Bomb is used much more frequently. In addition, two &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20%28Molten%20Core%29\"&gt;Core Hounds&lt;/a&gt; will spawn 20-30 seconds into the fight. Like with the Core Hound packs preceding Magmadar, they will revive if not killed within a few seconds of each other. Two additional Core Hounds will continue to spawn approximately once a minute thereafter.\nStrategies.\nThe main tank should pull Magmadar so that he is facing towards the main group of healers, hunters, etc. Healers need to stand at max range behind the main tank. To find max range get to where you are too far away to heal the main tank and then slowly get closer until you are in range. If you are at max range you will be able to heal the tank, but too far away to be affected by the AOE fear. Priests should keep Fear Ward on the main tank. Hunters must use Tranquilizing Shot (a learned skill that comes from a tome with a 100% drop rate from Lucifron) when he frenzies, they must pay attention to the order they use it in and whether it is a hit or a miss. Melee DPS should come in on the sides and behind Magmadar. They need to be sure to avoid the Conflagrate and will be responsible for removing themselves from battle and bandaging since they will be out of range of the healers. If Fear Ward is not available, the warrior can \"stance dance\" in and out of berserker stance in order to use Berserker's Rage about every 30 seconds to avoid being feared. It is important that the main tank doesn't get feared \u2014 otherwise, while aggro will no longer be lost, Magmadar will follow the fleeing tank and the healers will suddenly be in range of him, and it is unlikely that the raid group will recover.\nLoot.\nMagmadar also can be skinned for &lt;a href=\"Core%20Leather\"&gt;Core Leather&lt;/a&gt;."}

The tank spends the majority of his time kiting parasites.\nThe Constructs also need to be tanked. You can either use a fourth tank for this, or the currently-inactive (debuffed) tank, but of course that hurts a bit more.\nThere is also a final \"burn phase\" that starts at 30% health.

During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Suramar%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Suramar Pass&lt;/a&gt;, he and his son &lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt; were betrayed and murdered by servants of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, and while Hruthnir was taken into the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, Magnar's &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; languished alongside his body where it was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIcebreaker.\nMagnar was among the countless &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who sought to prove themselves worthy to join the ranks of &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Keeper Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; army when the keeper first created the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, but Magnar was perhaps the one who went to the greatest lengths. His victories in battle were beyond measure, and the strength of his deeds inspired others to seek their own heroic legacy. He was given the name \"Icebreaker\" by his comrades after his successful campaign against the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where he discovered that cracks in glacier walls could be turned into tunnels that allowed him to dig deep into enemy strongholds and launch surprise assaults on them from within.\nScale of the Earth-Warder.\nDuring his travels across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, no creature enraptured Magnar so much as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of Earth and leader of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Vrykul and dragons rarely interacted, but Magnar always watched in awe when Neltharion's flew overhead, and over time he began to wonder what wonders he could find in Neltharion's &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, located close to the vrykul home of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. His curiosity grew into an obsession, and he eventually convinced a vrykul raiding party to accompany him into the lair. They waited until they saw the Dragon Aspect leave his mountain, and then carefully crept inside, only to find that many of Neltharion's kin remained in the lair. A colossal battle erupted in the smaller side caverns beneath Highmountain, forcing Magnar to lead his party in a frantic run for an exit. Before they could escape, Neltharion returned to the mountain. Enraged at the trespassers, the dragon unleashed a single lethal breath of fire at the vrykul, who had nowhere to run or hide. In desperation, Magnar grabbed a piece of debris from the ground. The debris was actually one of Neltharion's cast off scales, and it saved Magnar's life as the blast of flame parted around it. The sheer force of the breath carried Magnar out of the lair, sending him tumbling down the slopes of Highmountain and leaving him badly wounded, but alive.\nIt took years for Magnar to recover from his injuries, but in the meantime he examined the dragon scale he had acquired. He was awed by its resilience, for it had saved him from a fiery death without being so much as scratched or singed. Magnar wished to forge the scale into a lasting armament, but no vrykul blacksmith knew how to sculpt something so unusual. Thus, as Magnar recuperated, he began to study the art of &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; himself. Few vrykul understood his motivations, as most sought entry into the Halls of Valor through glory on the battlefield, not by working a blacksmith's forge. Nevertheless, Magnar would become known as a respectable smith in his own right, and his blades were often sharper and more precise than those of his peers, for he knew that he would only have one opportunity to craft Neltharion's scale into a worthy shield. When the time came, he retreated to his forge and set to work. Days later, he emerged with two armaments unlike any the vrykul had ever seen: a &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Earth-Warder\"&gt;shield of unimaginable endurance&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Scaleshard\"&gt;sword polished to a fine edge&lt;/a&gt;. It was the last time Magnar crafted a weapon, for he would never need another.\nWith the sword and shield in his hands, the already respected Magnar became a legend. Having learned from his disastrous venture into Neltharion's lair, he instead approached his campaigns with discipline and thoughtfulness, and the enemies of the vrykul stood little chance against him. Other vrykul flocked to his side with each victory he won, believing that they would all be ushered into the Halls of Valor by Magnar's feats. Only a few years after forging his new armaments, Magnar Icebreaker lead a sizeable portion of the vrykul people and had become a king.\nMagnar eventually set his sights on the region where he had earned his surname. In Northrend, remnants of the nerubian armies were once again emerging from their caves, seeking to seize &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; machinery within it. The king led his people against the nerubians, pushing them back to the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; itself, defeating them so thoroughly that they ceased all aggression for millennia.\nBattle of Suramar Pass.\nDuring this time, the fallen &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; queen &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, took an interest in Magnar and began to wonder if his spirit would be strong enough to ascend into the Halls of Valor despite the fact that she had used her magic to seal away the Valarjar in the halls. After defeating the nerubians, Magnar focused his sights on the ancestral home of the vrykul: the city of Stormheim, at the time occupied by &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. The vrykul believed that their path to a glorious afterlife with Odyn would be cleared if they once again held their ancestral home, and Helya and her followers knew that this was their best opportunity to strike at Magnar. With luck, the king's soul would be dragged down to Helheim rather than the Halls of Valor.\nUnware of Helya's plot, the vrykul launched a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the Highborne with their ferocity. For weeks the elves and vrykul skirmished, with Magnar leading the charge, his shield protecting him from the Highborne's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. The vrykul's assault scored immediate victories and gave them enough momentum to push the Highborne out of the city entirely. The elves' last chance to reclaim Stormheim happened at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Suramar%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Suramar Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end the vrykul stood victorious. The Highborne were forced to flee, and never made a claim upon Stormheim again.\nHowever, mere moments after Magnar's greatest triumph had been secured, traitors loyal to Helya arose within the vrykul's ranks to butcher Magnar's closest confidants, including his son, &lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt;. Amid the chaos, more of Helya's &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; followers arrived to ensure Magnar's death. Upon seeing his son being killed, the king was consumed with rage and became a whirlwind of death, killing every enemy within reach and slaughtering countless &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; and traitorous vrykul before he was finally struck down. His people were able to rally and prevent the Helarjar from claiming Stormheim, but they were too late to save their king.\nMagnar's body was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt;, on the island of &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt; northeast of Stormheim, but his spirit lingered in death. His rage stopped his soul from ascending into the Halls of Valor, but it also kept him from Helya's grasp. For thousands of years, he would remain between life and the afterlife, burning with fury.\nLegion.\nSeveral millennia later, Odyn sent his new champion, a mortal warrior &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, to Shield's Rest along with Hruthnir, now a member of the Valarjar, both to retrieve the Blackwyrm Armaments and to bring Magnar's spirit to the Halls of Valor. After fighting their way through a group of undead and a minor &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; incursion led by &lt;a href=\"Pillik\"&gt;Pillik&lt;/a&gt;, Hruthnir and the adventurer entered the Tomb of the Old Kings to find that Magnar's ghostly servants were hostile to them and did not recognize their king's son, causing Hruthnir to comment that they were \"infected\" by his father's madness. In the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Tomb of the Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;, Hruthnir and the champion found Magnar, still raging at Helya and her \"cowardly followers\". Initially, Magnar did not recognize his son, but after a long battle Hruthnir managed to convince his father to come with him to the Halls of Valor. Magnar granted his shield and sword to the adventurer before going with his son to become a Valarjar.\nHe can be found in the Great Mead Hall alongside his son following this, donning golden armor.\nObjective of.\nMagnar needs to be defeated for the fifth and penultimate stage of &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Legacy of the Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt;."}

From Grond came the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, while from the Sporemounds many unique beings arose, the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; greatest among them. After Grond's death at the hands of the Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, the colossals continued their war against the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and Botaan's minions for thousands of years, but over the millennia these battles took their toll on the stone giants. Just as the colossals had risen from pieces of Grond, new creatures called the magnaron emerged from the remains of fallen colossals. The colossals called on their smaller relatives to fight the Evergrowth, but the magnaron did not obey. Though naturally opposed to the Evergrowth, they felt no loyalty toward their progenitors, and while some did battle genesaur they crossed paths with, most magnaron wandered off into the barren tracts of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to seek out areas of volcanic activity.\nAfter the colossals sacrificed themselves to kill Botaan in a massive explosion, spores from the plant creature's body, teeming with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, drifted back to Draenor's surface and clung to the hides of the magnaron, weakening their bodies. Some of the magnaron devolved into lesser giants called &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, a small number of which continued to degenerate into &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and finally &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The magnaron, gronn and ogron were known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, and though different in many ways, their common ancestry united them against the plant-like &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of the Sporemounds. For many long ages, the two factions engaged in sporadic battles with one another, neither side ever managing to destroy the other.\nThousands of years later, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched across Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; tasked the orcish &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt;s with wiping out Draenor's gronn, ogron and magnaron, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Chieftain Fenris&lt;/a&gt; and his Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the magnaron are still prevalent in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 mainly the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Blackrock clans&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 has begun enslaving their gronn and &lt;a href=\"gronnling\"&gt;gronnling&lt;/a&gt; descendants for use as mounts and living siege engines, seemingly even managing to enslave a few magnaron such as &lt;a href=\"Okk\"&gt;Okk&lt;/a&gt;. The magnaron &lt;a href=\"Kromog\"&gt;Kromog&lt;/a&gt; willingly began to assist the Blackrock orcs in their &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;massive foundry&lt;/a&gt; after his chamber was unearthed by Iron Horde miners, though his reasons for doing so are unknown.\nIn Gorgrond, the Iron Horde unearthed an ancient artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Magnaron\"&gt;Heart of the Magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, a device capable of subjugating even a magnaron. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; states that legends speak of such artifacts being crafted by the \"worldbuilders\" to keep such creatures in check. Determined to not let such a power fall into the Iron Horde's hands, Rexxar and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; retrieved the Heart before using it against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gar\"&gt;Commander Gar&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed the device with an artillery attack before he himself was killed.\n&lt;a href=\"Kormrok\"&gt;Kormrok&lt;/a&gt;, a magnaron as ancient as Draenor itself, once ruled over Gorgrond until he was trapped by the Iron Horde and brought to their fortress of . The Iron Horde were entirely unsuccessful in their attempts to break the magnaron's will until the rise of and the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power that Kormrok found irresistible.\nDescription and culture.\nThe magnaron are not as large or intelligent as their colossal progenitors, but they command great power, with veins of fire and raw elemental energies coursing over their jagged skin. Both magnaron and &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; grow rocky plates on their hides that have magical properties.\nThe magnaron are mysterious in their ways, ancient and inscrutable. There are few living today who can communicate with these enigmatic giants, and fewer still who understand their seemingly chaotic motivations. Part of an ancient breed, the magnaron practice dark, primal magics, and act according to an agenda they have never shared with anyone. Some claim that if the magnaron win, all of Draenor will be cast into a frozen wasteland like &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Among the roiling lava spouts of Frostfire Ridge, the magnaron carve fiery sigils into the earth and shape entire mountains to their needs. They have been known to both enslave and befriend elemental &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt;, and they are seldom alone. &lt;a href=\"Kron\"&gt;Kron&lt;/a&gt; refers to the enslavement of furies as \"the Great Work\" and claims that it is vital to the world. He also states that the Work \"is the way of things\" and that mortals cannot understand nor stop it."}

{"id": "16027", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16027", "title": "Magnataur", "text": "Magnataur are massive creatures that live in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. They have the torso of a &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; attached to the body of a &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;; like the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, they are relatives of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. They are notoriously long-lived, though lacking in patience, and are rumored to engage in &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt; when food is scarce. They are vicious, brutal, and uncaring; only the strongest and meanest survive. Despite their hostility towards all other races, they have become strangely tolerant of the &lt;a href=\"snobold\"&gt;arctic kobolds&lt;/a&gt;, who follow the magnataurs for safety and mutual benefit during hunts.\nMagnataur live in prides, much like &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s: one or two dominant males and several females along with their offspring. Single males are known to control giant herds and produce sizable litters. However, magnataur are hideously violent creatures and rarely put aside their aggressive natures to cooperate with each other, which is the main reason they are rarely seen coming together in any real numbers without killing each other. \nThe enormous magnataur have little to no magical affinity. Magnataur casters are very rare, and tend to follow a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic route if they practice at all. However, they won't go down without a fight, and their thick hides can withstand several of the most powerful frostbolts. Magnataur &lt;a href=\"runemaster\"&gt;runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Dregmar%20Runebrand\"&gt;Dregmar Runebrand&lt;/a&gt;, are a rare breed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dens%20of%20Dying\"&gt;Dens of Dying&lt;/a&gt; are a sacred place to the magnataur, where they go in their old age to die.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the magnataur hunt at the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wastes\"&gt;Dragon Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to fill their stomach.\nIn the RPG.\nThe overwhelming majority of magnataur are powerful melee fighters, charging into combat and using fear and massive clubs as their only weapons. Still, a few more specialized magnataur exist, including the shamans that often dominate small groups of their kind, and a few rare hunters, scouts and rogues. Regardless of their specialty, magnataur are among the deadliest creatures of Northrend, if not the world in general. They are a dying breed, but their recent desperation leads them to levels of cooperation never before seen, and this could prove disastrous for the other mortal races living on the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;glacial continent&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGenerally speaking, magnataur are raiders, and they spend most of their lives pillaging caravans, small &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s, and even full-sized &lt;a href=\"cities\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; on the rare occasions that they work together as a group. Magnataur are one of few races that rarely even get along with other members of their own species, and these disagreements usually lead to bloodshed. For this reason, there are few magnataur left in the world. Due to their large size, magnataur are constantly hungry, and they eat almost anything. When raiding a &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;, they eat the humans, pack animals, and whatever else they can find that won\u2019t break their teeth.\nMagnataur are intelligent enough to know that humanoid creatures can provide food for them, and a few historical mentions have even been found of magnataur setting up &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s and making humans into slave labor to provide them with nourishment. Such kingdoms don\u2019t last long, however, as magnataur are universally too impatient to deal with such situations for long. Those magnataur who tire of a lifestyle of raiding often take up fishing or whaling. Whales are considered a delicacy among magnataur, and those who are able to catch them frequently are highly respected.\nThe only places where large numbers of magnataur dwell are the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, they inhabited a larger portion of Northrend, but they have suffered as many losses to the Scourge as any other race.\nHistory.\nThe history of the magnataur race is largely shrouded in mystery, but it is known that at one point in time, they were a dominant race. The shattered remnants of a few magnataur kingdoms have been found, but they were all extremely crude and underdeveloped by modern standards, having never progressed beyond the point of making simple tools and structures. A few early writings exist from cultures of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who were kept as slaves by magnataur, but not many.\nAppearance.\nThis creature has the upper torso, head, and arms of a giant with massive tusks and the body of a great woolly &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, similar to a &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; that is half &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;. They wear little clothing, although the shamans often adorn themselves with stolen jewelry. It is fearsome to behold as it strides forward, its mighty hooves making the ground quake with each step. They weigh 15-20 tons and stand 20\u201330 feet tall. The origins of magnataur are a mystery, though speculation abounds. What is clear is that their numbers are few. This fact is somewhat of a blessing, given the pleasure these creatures take in destruction and torment. Survivors of caravans speak of wagons and horses smashed into the snow. Some paused in their flight long enough to see a massive figure carefully placing screaming people into a huge sack, destined certainly to unknown horrors. Such a creature requires a great deal of food to feed, so magnataur eat people and animals once they have their fun. In several places, they have set up crude kingdoms, sparing people from terror so long as food is provided. Eventually, either the populace fails to provide or the magnataur gets bored and another rampage begins. Others have some skill at fishing for &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt;s and many take to the water. Magnataur do not trust or like one another any more than they like other creatures. Magnataur will occasionally fight one another, but typically avoid these situations.\nMagnataurs come in an assortment of colors from lighter brown (warriors), to dark brown (reavers), to blue/white (destroyers). Magnataurs in Wrath range in color from brown to blueish-white.\nCulture.\nMost magnataur never learn to read or write, including many of the shamans, and thus there is little written culture left behind from the rare instances where they have set up small civilizations. Their buildings are simple wooden structures at best, and while a few cave paintings have been found, they create little art. Generally, abandoned weapons, dishes for eating, and simple beds are the most intricate works left behind in their settlements. Perhaps the most unique creations of magnataur are their sacrificial chambers, where a number of crude wooden or metal cages hold prisoners as they are burned alive in a central ring of fire. The easiest way to distinguish a magnataur ruin from any other is the sheer number of objects that have been crushed by massive force; when magnataur leave a city, they intentionally destroy anything they consider valuable that they cannot take with them, and they can be amazingly thorough. It is suspected that this is because they use the destruction of their own cities as a way of alleviating the frustration of having to move to another home.\nTypically, the size of a magnataur is directly related to its place in society; the largest and strongest are almost always dominant, and this is true even of spellcasters. Magnataur appear to continue growing throughout their lives, and thus the oldest are also the largest, strongest and most powerful.\nStrength means everything to magnataur, and they listen only to those who they feel are strong enough to threaten them or can somehow feed their gluttonous appetites. A given magnataur largely considers other creatures, including other magnataur, inferior. For the most part, a magnataur lacks long-term goals, save to grow more powerful and find ideal supplies of food. Outsiders are viewed as food, threats, or providers of food. There are few exceptions: Magnataur are wise enough to give dragons a wide berth and know that invading the territory of a dragon can be deadly. Likewise, they avoid the Scourge, knowing that the undead are dangerous and taste unpleasant. Magnataur attack adventurers on sight, holding back only if they feel the adventurers would potentially have something to offer them \u2014 which is a rarity.\nSociety.\nMost magnataur live much of their lives alone, and as such, no formal society exists among the majority of them. A small number of tribal groups exist, and in these cases, they are held together by their mutual fear of their shaman leader. In most cases, these small tribal groups end with the assassination of their leader, but a few shamans have been strong enough to hold a tribe together for a number of years. The only system of rank that magnataur understand is dictated by power, and thus, a larger or more combat-worthy magnataur is always considered superior. The race as a whole is not formal enough to have an elite group of warriors, though small groups of powerful shamans do exist; these shamans are considered the leaders of the magnataur as a whole, although they lack any formal institution of this leadership.\nMale and female magnataur differ only in that females have a slightly greater obligation to care for their children for a few years after childbirth. There is no mating season for magnataur; they simply mate when they feel like it. They breed when food is plentiful and chance brings a potential mate into close proximity. Once the act is complete, the pair separates, often never to see each other again. Mothers teach basic hunting, weapon making, basic language skills, and how to craft needed tools. Humans and other animals are brought back to the lair for the child to play with. When young are old enough, they accompany the mother on raids. Once reaching adolescence, children are abandoned and fend for themselves, and to hunt on their own. Magnataur will occasionally fight one another, but typically avoid these situations. Mating, however can pit males against each other. These fights are usually all display. The two shout and smash the ground until one looses his nerve and flees.\nExperienced magnataur tend to advance as &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s. A few rare and powerful magnataur also learn the path of &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt;, or advance far enough as warriors to become &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;s. There have been a few &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"runemaster\"&gt;runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"inscriber\"&gt;inscriber&lt;/a&gt;s in the history of magnataur, but they are rare. &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are not unheard of among their number, but they are looked down upon for favoring ranged weapons over melee. Due to their size, it is difficult for magnataur to become &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, but a rare few exist; they are incapable of the kind of stealth most rogues enjoy, but specialize instead in setting traps and ambushes. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s do not exist among the magnataur.\nFaith.\nThey do not worship the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, or any gods at all, and nobody has yet to find any writings that detail their creation, even through legends or hearsay. Magnataur never played a major role in the history of humanoid societies, but there is a potential for that to change in the coming years.\nMost magnataur have no specific religious beliefs, although many have superstitions that are passed on within a specific family. There are a few &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s among the magnataur race, but their perverted concept of shamanism is most comparable to that of the forest trolls. For example, magnataur shamans often sacrifice large numbers of humanoids in their barbaric rituals \u2014 of course, they still eat the remains afterward. Overall, most magnataur distrust &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, although they fear only the most powerful spellcasters, such as dragons.\nCombat.\nMagnataur employ two basic strategies. The first is simply to charge a victim or settlement and start laying waste with his club. Fleeing victims are trampled. The other approach is to lie in wait or behind cover for passing caravans. Magnataur sometimes follow caravans, looking for an opportunity to surprise them. This desire for surprise is not out of caution or fear, but rather to limit the chance that any victims escape the encounter. Given the lack of any appropriate weapons for their size, magnataur have some skill at shaping trees into serviceable clubs. These huge clubs weigh between 200 and 600 pounds and can be wielded one-handed by a magnataur. Gargantuan magnataur have even larger clubs.\nLanguage.\nMagnataur speak Low Common. They do not interact with any other cultures enough to learn other languages.\nRelations.\nSince there is no formal magnataur society, they never go to war as a whole, and thus they largely try to avoid the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and anything else they cannot handle individually. Magnataur routinely attack &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;, pillaging their villages for food and supplies. Generally, tuskarr defend themselves well against such attacks, and the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; simply take their losses. Occasionally, a troll leader grows infuriated at the magnataur raids and sends out a massive group to hunt the creatures, but such an expedition usually ends up with so many troll casualties that future generations remember that retaliation is not worth the cost. \n&lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s often try to serve magnataur in an effort to save their own lives, and it occasionally works for a while. Most of the time, though, magnataur can\u2019t resist the taste of murloc and end up eating their slaves. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s know to hide from magnataur attacks, and magnataur find them irritating to hunt, and thus only the most desperate or skilled of magnataur try to hunt a furbolg. Magnataur have few allies, even with other Magnataur, but they seem to tolerate the &lt;a href=\"snobold\"&gt;arctic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kobolds\"&gt;kobolds&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagnataur adventurers are rare, but a few have given up their life of raiding or whaling for a more fulfilling existence. With the growing threat of the Scourge, many magnataur are forced into a new way of thinking, and the wisest among their number realize that they may not be able to stand against the undead alone. It is also possible for a magnataur to be taught the value of more peaceful forms of shamanism or other faiths, much like Thrall taught the Darkspear trolls to curb their cannibalistic practices. Magnataur have a difficult time getting along with other races, but given time and effort, they could learn to adapt and teach others that they are different from the other creatures of their race. A magnataur adventurer is an exceptional individual, but adventurers are exceptions by default."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; he defended Ironforge from the orcs and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He was a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; led by his brother &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; and forged the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; hoping it would avenge his brother &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;, who was believed to have been killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. Magni was turned to diamond during a ritual in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself to save &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. He was succeeded by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. After years spent immobilized in Old Ironforge, Magni returned as \"the Speaker\", the ritual having attuned him to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth itself, and now works with the world's heroes to heal the world's wounds.\nBiography.\nThe eldest of the three Bronzebeard brothers, Magni was destined to be the king under the mountain. Strong of arm and keen of mind, Magni loved his two brothers above all else in the world. From the time of his youth, Magni the prince was keenly aware of what would be expected of him in the future. This apparently intimidated him and he questioned if he could be the kind of leader &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; needed. He even privately wished that his father and brothers would outlive him, and thus their people would have a good king. To look upon the tower of strength and effective leader that King Magni is today, one can scarcely imagine that he was ever a prince full of doubt.\nWhen Magni's daughter &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; was born, he had wanted a son but loved and raised her nonetheless. But after his wife &lt;a href=\"Eimear\"&gt;Eimear&lt;/a&gt; was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane troll&lt;/a&gt;s, Magni - acting on Eimear's last wish to always be there for Moira - began training Moira in the ways of the warrior to prepare her for anything. This formed a rift between the two of them, as he forced her to be something she was not. At one point when she was older, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; confronted him on the issue in private at least once, but it was apparently to no avail.\nKing Magni led the defense of his capital during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Siege of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the liberation of Ironforge by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; he pledged his kingdom's support, his two brothers accompanying the Alliance host. Following the Second War, the rebuilding of Stormwind began. It was evident that travel to and from the north was difficult, as such Magni Bronzebeard had requested &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;'s aid in constructing a faster and easier method of transportation. Mekkatorque began his work on what would become the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stoic dwarves of Ironforge spent countless generations mining treasures from deep within the earth. Recently, the dwarves unearthed a series of ruins that held the key to secrets to their ancient heritage. Driven to discover the truth about his people's fabled origins, the great King Magni Bronzebeard ordered that the dwarves shift their industry from mining and engineering to that of archaeology. Magni helped to create the famed &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge, a group utterly devoted to plumbing the secrets of the ancient world and delving out the truth of the dwarves' fabled existence.\nThe Third War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it was believed that Muradin died in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and Magni learned the truth about Muradin that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; himself was responsible. Magni was overcome with grief at the news of Muradin's demise, but he and the youngest brother, , remained steadfast in their desire to continue serving the dwarven people.\nAfter Muradin's apparent death &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; visited King Magni with a unique crystal of pure light, gave their condolences on Muradin's fate, and asked him to have a weapon forged from it. To avenge Muradin, Magni personally took on the task and forged the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to oppose &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas, and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. While Magni never took much stock in the belief that Master dwarven &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s could impart emotions into the weapons they create, standing before &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Anvil\"&gt;The Great Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, he found himself thinking of how he would not see Muradin again. He thus harnessed all of his rage, fury, the desire for vengeance, and willed them into being with each strike of his hammer. It is said he worked for three days straight. When he was finished, he gave Mograine the finest blade that had ever been crafted by his hand. He also delivered terrible news to the humans; while finishing the sword, he was informed via &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; that Arthas had murdered his father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas%20II\"&gt;King Terenas II&lt;/a&gt;, and gave his condolences.\nFor at least part of the Third War, Magni fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and declared him to be a friend of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Even years later, Chen would leave a lasting impression on the dwarven king.\nGathering storm.\nThe dwarves of Ironforge allowed the gnomes led by &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; to remain in Ironforge, and they were granted a part of the city. Magni also asked Gelbin to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; festival. It is implied that Magni was distrustful of warlocks in his city. At some point, Magni tried to make contact with the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrann, Magni's brother and an explorer of some renown, went missing for months and King Magni had lost hope that he still lived. Though he remained a wise and strong leader, his pain and sorrow weighed heavily upon him. Many dwarves wondered whether the kingdom would ever see another Bronzebeard sitting on the throne of Ironforge. Though Brann eventually reappeared, having survived his venture into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, he managed to misplace himself again within &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;--much to Magni's dismay and a series of agonized groans from the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the death of &lt;a href=\"Sully%20Balloo\"&gt;Sully Balloo&lt;/a&gt;, his wife &lt;a href=\"Sara%20Balloo\"&gt;Sara Balloo&lt;/a&gt; pleaded the king to honor her late husband. Magni had a memorial built for the deceased warrior. King Magni also authorized &lt;a href=\"Grelin%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Grelin Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the troll problem in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgainst the Dark Irons.\nWhen Moira went missing, he sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance to find her escort, &lt;a href=\"Kharan%20Mighthammer\"&gt;Kharan Mighthammer&lt;/a&gt;. When Magni learned that Moira had been captured by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and was being held under a magical spell, he sent a team to assassinate the Dark Iron Emperor &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and rescue Moira. After dispatching the emperor, though, the adventurers were shocked to discover that Moira refused to return to Ironforge, having fallen in love with Emperor Thaurissan and conceived a child by him. Moira told her would-be rescuers to inform her father that her child would be both a dark iron dwarf and heir to the Kingdom of Ironforge; Magni was stunned by the revelation, remarking that even in death Thaurissan had won. The dwarf &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt; later swore an oath to Magni himself, pledging to investigate the dark unrest in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter all of this happened, &lt;a href=\"Aerin\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt; and a few other qualified women were promoted to become a part of Magni's elite guard. Aerin believed this was a result of him finally realizing that his sexist attitude had not been very fair to Moira.\nAfter the Outland campaign, Magni sent &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to meet a ship and its passengers from &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; and to deliver them to Ironforge. Magni had diplomatically approached Stormwind for assistance against the ever-increasing Dark Iron threat, citing their destruction and control of &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. Much to his frustration, his pleas fell on deaf ears. While &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; concurred with the dwarven king, Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;--adviser to the recently returned King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;--accused Magni of trying to involve &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the dwarves' personal war and refused to send reinforcements. Luckily, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had already informed Magni of the appearance of Lo'Gosh, who was also thought to be the real King Varian Wrynn.\nLo'Gosh and his companions attacked the Dark Iron dwarves, with Magni and his team later joining the attack. Together they defeated the Dark Iron that had controlled Thandol Span. Magni then brought Lo'Gosh and his companions to Ironforge and told them about the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt;. He revealed that he had been in contact with Bolvar through a Scrying Glass and discussed the matter of Windsor and the Black Dragons. He was present when Lo'Gosh decided to go to the Blackrock Depths in search of the missing Windsor. Magni promised them to watch over the fel-tainted &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; and granted her a sanctuary in Ironforge.\nWar against the Lich King.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he sent his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into all corners of Azeroth. During the Scourge invasion on the capital cities, Magni sent troops of fliers to Stormwind. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and necropolises, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and created an artifact of the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s Light. Adventurers of the Alliance delivered it to Magni to defend Ironforge. Taking up the artifact, Magni swore that he would find Muradin. When word reached him that Muradin had survived, he immediately traveled to the &lt;a href=\"frost%20dwarf\"&gt;frost dwarf&lt;/a&gt; stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; where he was overjoyed to find that their new king, &lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;Yorg Stormheart&lt;/a&gt;, was, in fact, an amnesiac Muradin. Along with Brann, the pair helped their brother recover his lost memories. Magni returned to Ironforge while Muradin remained to battle against the Lich King.\nWhen Chen Stormstout's niece &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt; and his old friend &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Ironforge during &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, Magni recalled his earlier battles alongside Chen and declared the pair as friends of the kingdom, as well as providing them a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; invaded the mortal realm in the form of a magical mist and trapped Azeroth's sleeping denizens in their nightmares, Magni became one of its victims. Magni dreamed that he led a team through &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Moira and slay &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. While he accepted that Moira's child would be born, he would not allow a son of &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; to inherit the throne of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and would instead banish him forever from the kingdom. Upon hearing this, Moira stabbed Magni to death. Moira revealed that her half dark iron son was only meant to watch over the throne until her new baby is born: a child of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nThe Cataclysm.\nDuring the exploration of Ulduar, the dwarves found a set of mystical &lt;a href=\"Tablets%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt; created by the Titans. Brann informed King Magni about it. Magni called for a &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind City and informed the other Alliance leaders about the tablets, believing they could help. During the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Magni protected &lt;a href=\"the%20Commons\"&gt;the Commons&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge from the elementals. He also assisted Alliance adventurers against &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Crown Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ambassador%20Flamelash\"&gt;Grand Ambassador Flamelash&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen freak natural disasters began rocking much of Azeroth just prior to the Cataclysm, the dwarven lands were not spared from the calamitous upheavals. A series of violent quakes tore through areas surrounding Ironforge, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent dwarves in the process. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was under the guardianship of Magni at the time. Magni instructed a female dwarf &lt;a href=\"Aerin\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt; to be Anduin's guard and trainer. Aerin explained to Anduin that Magni never wanted a daughter, but Moira was a female and when she was kidnapped, Magni took it very hard. Ever since, Magni changed his beliefs about the capabilities of the female sex and because of this, Aerin and some other qualified women were promoted into the Elite Guard. After Aerin's death, Magni called Anduin to his chamber, where he gave him the mace &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; which \"liked\" Anduin. Magni knew and liked Anduin since he was little and he allowed him to call him uncle.\nThe next day, with the tablet in Ironforge brought earlier by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, King Magni sought answers to the troubling state of the elementals and of the world, he selflessly underwent a mystic titan ritual to commune with the earth by activating the Ulduar tablet. Magni, Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muninn%20Magellas\"&gt;Muninn Magellas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reyna%20Stonebranch\"&gt;Reyna Stonebranch&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the heart of the earth, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, where the ritual would be taking place. First, Belgrum read out the majority of the tablet's words, which had been transcribed on a scroll, then Magni drank a potion and spoke the words to activate the ritual in the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;'s language:\nSubsequently, he heard hundreds of voices. Though he initially thought his plan was working, the tablet turned out to be far more literal than any of the translators had realized. The ritual was actually a process for earthen (and thus dwarves, descended from earthen) to once again become part of the very material they had been crafted from by the titans: the very crust of Azeroth. Magni was instead turned into a diamond, his statue-like form fused into the diamond heart of Ironforge itself before the stunned onlookers. Magni's funeral service was held shortly thereafter, attended by leaders and representatives of the Alliance, goblins, and even the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; who were known to be moderate individuals) as a token of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s respect.\nCompounding this tragedy, Magni's estranged daughter Moira returned to claim her father's throne for herself and for her &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;infant dark iron son&lt;/a&gt; with her Dark Iron forces and held the city hostage. In an effort to prevent further political turmoil, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; called for the founding of a council that included the three main dwarven clans, and so the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; was established to succeed Magni.\nOne with the earth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s essence raced headlong through the leagues and leagues of earth that unfurled around him during his meditation he moved beneath the Eastern Kingdoms. There a presence stirred in the mountains of Khaz Modan. The spirit there was strong, but it was not an elemental. It was, strangely, like Thrall: a mortal who had transcended the bounds of flesh. The unknown being patrolled the ancient earth of the region as if it was keeping a silent vigil over the land. It spoke in a dwarven accent that echoed across Azeroth. \"For behold, we are earthen, o' the land, and its soul is ours, its pain is ours, its heartbeat is ours...\"\nFour years after his petrification, Moira was asked by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and some of the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s to talk to Magni, as she often did when times were trying, in the hopes that it would wake him up. She, however, felt that it was a fool's errand, still believing that Magni would still not have approved of her ruling, but did so to keep up appearances. However, to the vast surprise of Moira and &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt;, Magni awoke with a mighty crash as a living statue made of diamond. With a voice like a mountainslide, he told Moira and Belgrum that he now spoke for the land and was a part of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself. Muradin and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; also came down to see him.\nWhile the Council of Three Hammers waited for Magni and discussed what the king's return would mean for the political stability of Ironforge upstairs at the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt;, Magni was taking the time to walk once again through his city, including stopping at &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Anvil\"&gt;The Great Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, seeing the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s at the gryphon roost, and kneeling in the pool of the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Ward\"&gt;Mystic Ward&lt;/a&gt;. By all laws under the mountain, as long as the rightful ruler was alive, the city belonged to him, but Moira and Falstad knew that the Dark Irons and the Wildhammers would never kneel to a Bronzebeard king. However, Magni, having just returned to the throne room, replied that he had not come to reclaim his crown. No longer a king but a servant of Azeroth, he delivered a dire warning about the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return to the three, and that they had to prepare their people\u2014\"all\" their people\u2014for what was coming. He also proclaimed that he had to leave immediately to warn the rest of the Alliance.\nAs he prepared to depart Ironforge, Magni requested a moment to speak with Moira outside the gates and was a little surprised when Moira agreed to it. He explained that he had actually watched her over the past four years grow into a leader he couldn't be prouder of and that he had failed her as a father. He reflected how he had come back to life and the clans were living together once again, then perhaps the two of them could also be a family again. He hoped she would give him another chance, but wanted to give her time to think about it before she gave him an answer. Belgrum would later send word to Brann about Magni's awakening.\nLegion.\nMagni journeyed north to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Within the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Planetarium\"&gt;Celestial Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;, he revealed to Brann and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; the truth about Azeroth: that the planet itself was a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;, and she had named him her speaker. Magni revealed that when the world was young, after the imprisonment of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to shape the world. Eventually, the Pillars of Creation found their way into mortal hands, and now they were needed to close the Legion's portal at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Knowledge of the Pillars was entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Khadgar to go investigate the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;Guardian's Library&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Brann asked Magni what he was going to do next, wondering if he would return to Ironforge. Magni replied that Azeroth has other duties for him, but he'd be happy to talk with Brann for a while.\nLegionfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; contacted Magni and told him about a lost titan vault near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, though as Magni would explain to Brann she did not do so in words but rather in \"feelings\". Magni felt that this mission from Azeroth had something to do with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, so he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to contact them. Magni, Brann, the High Priest, and &lt;a href=\"Betild%20Deepanvil\"&gt;Betild Deepanvil&lt;/a&gt; took a &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; to an area of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; northeast of the Maelstrom, where they discovered the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Observatory\"&gt;Primordial Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. After identifying Magni as the Speaker, &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20WH12-B4NG\"&gt;Caretaker WH12-B4NG&lt;/a&gt; revealed to the four of them that the vault held three &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s: creatures that were long ago infused with the Light by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to help the &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watchers&lt;/a&gt; by speeding them to sites of corruption. Magni realized that finding the seekers was the reason Azeroth directed him to the vault.\nOne of the three seekers had been affected by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, prompting WH12-B4NG to initiate the vault's sanitation protocol. After the guardians of the vault were fought off and WH12-B4NG powered down. Magni realized that Azeroth knew the High Priest would protect the seekers from the Void that would have overtaken the vault before long, and that was why she had contacted him. Magni, Brann, Betild, and the High Priest returned to Netherlight Temple with the seekers.\nWhen Azeroth tried to send Magni a message, something wasn't right and some force was interfering. Magni requested aid in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where he revealed the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Communion\"&gt;Hall of Communion&lt;/a&gt; accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Makers%27%20Overlook\"&gt;Makers' Overlook&lt;/a&gt;. The Hall of Communion had been built by the titans to watch over the world-soul, and from within it Magni could hear her clear as diamond. They discovered that what was wrong was that Azeroth was afraid. After fighting off phantoms of Azeroth's nightmares made manifest, which took the form of minions of the Burning Legion and Old Gods, and reactivating &lt;a href=\"Damaged%20Construct\"&gt;Damaged Construct&lt;/a&gt;s, Azeroth revealed that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was on his way to Azeroth and that their destiny lay on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus.\nMagni traveled to Argus aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", a new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt;, he revealed he could hear &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;a voice&lt;/a&gt; on Argus that reminded him of Azeroth but was not her. Magni became convinced that Argus also contained a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; that was trying to reach out to the people of Azeroth. He compared Azeroth's voice to something like a song even when unclear, while Argus's was tormented and broken, with pain liable to overwhelm those listening. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; survivors on Argus held a relic in the hovel from which they heard whispers, which Magni believed may be a link to Argus itself. Interacting with the relic, Magni received a vision of &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; who had been raised by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; as his servant.\nLater Magni heard Argus call out to him again, frantic, desperate, and so sad it broke Magni's heart. Interacting with the Krokul's stone once again, Magni discovered that Sargeras was attempting to bring back all of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; under his command. He resolved to find &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; before Aggramar could. As the forces of Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; prepared to assault &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Magni heard a new voice call out to him: Eonar. She informed Magni that if she was not found, everything would end.\nHeeding Eonar's voice, Magni fought his way inside Antorus' &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Boundless%20Reach\"&gt;Halls of the Boundless Reach&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Army of the Light. When the heroes of Azeroth arrived, Eonar asked them to help defend &lt;a href=\"Elarian%20Sanctuary\"&gt;her sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; against the Legion. Magni promised to stay behind and watch the champions' backs while they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Elunaria\"&gt;Elunaria&lt;/a&gt;. Later, after the heroes defended Eonar and returned to Antorus, Magni transported them to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; for the final confrontation with Argus's world-soul.\nReturn to Azeroth.\nSargeras was imprisoned by the Pantheon with Illidan as his jailer, but not before he managed to mortally wound Azeroth in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Her blood began to appear across the world in the form of a mineral known as &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance and Horde taking up arms against each other to fight over it. Since returning from Argus, Azeroth's pained cries had been overwhelming for Magni. At the base of Sargeras's sword, a desperate Magni begged Azeroth to tell him how he could help her. Azeroth's response was to show him visions of years ago, of Moira's childhood and his dying wife's last words to him: \"Ye're all she has now. Whatever happens, however hard it gets, just promise ye'll always be there fer her. Help her or else ye'll lose her.\" When the memories were over, Magni assured Azeroth that he was with her and he wouldn't leave her.\nMagni didn't know how to fix the damage but knew he had to keep trying. If they didn't find a way to heal Azeroth, nothing else would matter. Realizing that the leaders of the Alliance and Horde didn't even know what Azerite truly was, Magni asked adventurers to deliver his message to the factions' leaders, telling them to heal the wound and not exploit it for power, for Azeroth was the only home they had and they could not allow her to die. Magni and Khadgar came up with the plan of using the &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons to drain the power from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nMagni interrupted a celebration in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to spread word of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s dire state to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders and also to recruit healers in the mission to restore Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' destruction. He later set up a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to do the same thing with &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leaders and also to request the removal of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;'s mining operations from &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to inform the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and continue his mission to recruit other Azeroth races.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMagni established &lt;a href=\"Magni%27s%20Encampment\"&gt;a camp&lt;/a&gt; in Silithus, where he was joined by the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; to help find a way to heal the world.\nAs Azeroth continued to bleed out from the wound Sargeras inflicted on her, she bid Magni to call for a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; who could lend her help; in turn, she offered to lend help to them. Magni brought the hero to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the world, where they were given the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to gather &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and save the world. Magni told the hero to keep the necklace close to them at all times while he would continue to search for ways to undo the damage done to Azeroth. He would be able to contact the hero through the necklace if need be.\nSome time later, Magni called the adventurer back into the Chamber of Heart to empower the Heart of Azeroth. During the process, a &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt; attempted to break into the chamber and claim the Heart, but the Heart's power fought the creature off. However, Magni knew that wouldn't be the last attack from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagni and Brann later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; to bring &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt; to the Chamber of Heart so that she could analyze Azeroth and find a way to heal her. However, it would take \"77 cycles\" for MOTHER's analysis to finish and so Magni told the adventurer he'd contact them then.\nRise of Azshara.\nWhen MOTHER finally finished her calculations, Magni called once again for heroes to journey to the Chamber of Heart in order to make the Heart of Azeroth stronger. After heroes completed MOTHER's mission and worked with &lt;a href=\"Ebonhorn\"&gt;Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;, they obtained the &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Ebony%20Scale\"&gt;Petrified Ebony Scale&lt;/a&gt; which they used to empower the Heart of Azeroth. Magni welcomed Ebonhorn to the Chamber and employed heroes to discover more essences to further strengthen the Heart of Azeroth.\nAfter sensing an Azerite wound forming in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Magni rushed towards &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the World Tree. To that end, he instructed heroes to quiet the restless elementals and use their Heart of Azeroth to mend the wounds in order to prevent Hyjal from becoming another gaping scar like Silithus. Once this was accomplished, Magni remarked that Azeroth's pain was diminishing and that Heart of Azeroth was now brimming with power from the World Tree. Finding it incredible that the wound was stopped from spreading, Magni declared that Nordrassil once again safe and it was a sign that they could reverse all the damage done to Azeroth. He then returned to the Chamber.\nSome time later, he sensed another Azerite wound at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and headed there to aid the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving at the Maelstrom, Magni was surprised to discover that the wound was worse than he imagined. He directed champions to quell the rampaging elements, liberate the shaman trapped by the elements, and use the Heart of Azeroth to seal up the wounds. With the Maelstrom secured, an overjoyed Magni revealed that the damage was stopped before it could become worse. He further remarked that the Maelstrom would always be a place of great history and pain for Azeroth but that any healing done in the area made things better. With his spirits high, Magni wondered if one day they would be able to heal Silithus. He then returned to the Chamber.\nMagni later witnessed &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; empower the Heart of Azeroth wielded by the champions, who he personally believed to be Azeroth's hope.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed, Ebonhorn nearly succumbed to its whispers and would have been killed by MOTHER without Magni's intervention. Seeking to save Ebonhorn, Magni called on heroes to venture to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Under the advice of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, the hero sought out &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; in order save Ebonhorn. Though unable to meet with Wrathion, the hero did acquire a potion of his creation that they used to save Ebonhorn. While recognizing that Wrathion didn't want to be found, Magni knew that knowledge he acquired could be critical in the fight against N'Zoth. Thus knowing that there weren't many places to hide from Azeroth's own speaker, Magni was confident that he would be able to track down the Black Prince.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nMagni, with Wrathion in tow, traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to impart information to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. However, an outraged Anduin struck Wrathion having come to blame the dragon for his father's death. Despite this, Magni was able to convince Anduin to accept Wrathion's aid. Before he departed back to the Chamber of Heart, Magni requested and received &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; back from Anduin. While ignorant of N'Zoth's location, Magni was confident that the Old God would strike against the titan forges in order to corrupt Azeroth. However, while diagnosing the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, MOTHER discovered it was inactive. Though unable to determine the root cause of deactivation, Magni and Wrathion concluded it had to be N'Zoth.\nKnowing that Azeroth would be vulnerable to N'Zoth's corruption without the Forge of Origination, Magni and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Azeroth's Champion&lt;/a&gt; headed off towards the forge only to be surprised to see it in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to save Azeroth, Magni and his allies wrested control of the Forge of Origination from the Amathet and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Prophet%20Tenhamen\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; of N'Zoth. However, to Magni's dismay, he discovered that the forge was only operating at thirty-seven percent efficiency. While MOTHER worked out how to better empower the Forge of Origination, Magni suggested that his allies seek out &lt;a href=\"King%20Phaoris\"&gt;King Phaoris&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; in order to secure their help in keeping the forge safe. With their goals aligned, Magni's allies came to aid the &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter MOTHER determined the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; could be used to restore the power of the Forge of Origination, Magni called upon his ally to join him in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Having heard that the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; were still abandoned, Magni thought the task would be rather easy only to discover that the mogu and mantid were fighting at the vaults. The dying mogu warrior &lt;a href=\"Tsuo\"&gt;Tsuo&lt;/a&gt; implored the Speaker and Azeroth's champion in seeking out his &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; who they discovered to be mogu who answered to &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;. After restoring Ra-den's hopes that the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; could be beaten, Ra revealed that the Engine of Nalak'sha could be reached through the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the champions to reactivate the structure. Thus, Magni and his ally ventured into the vaults only to be caught off guard by the presence of the mantid. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Yox%27ith\"&gt;Yox'ith&lt;/a&gt;, a Manifestation of N'Zoth, Magni was able to have MOTHER use the Engine of Nalak'sha to successfully re-power the Forge of Origination. Magni, Ra, and the Champion then journeyed together to the Chamber of Heart where Magni revealed that they could end the threat of N'Zoth with the Forge of Origination.\nSoon after Magni discovers that an anomaly exists within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; and set off to investigate, discovering that &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was seeking to gain control of the forge. In order to help better combat N'Zoth, Wrathion and the champion sought an object of pure corruption, a task that ended with Azeroth's champion acquiring &lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;. After a &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth%23Horrific%20Visions\"&gt;Horrific Vision&lt;/a&gt; was defeated per Wrathion's request, Magni was stunned to hear N'Zoth's within the Chamber of Heart. Subsequently, the Old God attacked the chamber, opening a portal to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; and releasing its forces into the facility. Magni fought against the Old God's minions alongside the other defenders of the chamber, but once it became clear that N'Zoth was about to overtake the facility, Ra turned to the adventurer and told them to save Azeroth, no matter the cost. The Highkeeper then charged at the portal to Ny'alotha and used a lightning attack to destroy it but was pulled into the realm in the process. According to Magni, the Chamber of Heart and all of Azeroth would've been N'Zoth's for the taking had it not been for Ra's sacrifice.\nDetermined to save Ra and end of the threat of N'Zoth, Magni called for Azeroth's Champions to venture into &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;. Upon encountering Ra, Magni was horrified to discover that the titanic keeper had been twisted into N'Zoth's service. To Magni's sorrow, Ra was ultimately &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20the%20Despoiled\"&gt;confronted and killed&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Desolation\"&gt;Terrace of Desolation&lt;/a&gt; by the champions of Azeroth. Following N'Zoth's death, Magni remarked that ever since being wounded by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth had been crying out in pain. However, now that she had been made free of the grasp of the Old Gods, her song now rang clearly and strongly throughout the Chamber of Heart. Thus, Magni told his allies to hold their head high for they were more than a champion of their people, they were a champion of Azeroth herself.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; tried to pull the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, her screams of agony nearly split his head in two. According to him, since Azeroth's spirit was restored after the death of the Jailer, it's like she's started to sing a new song, a melody of hope and healing, and it feels as though a new age is dawning.\nExploring Northrend.\nMagni and his brothers made the trip to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to check on the state of the land and their old allies.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nMagni and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception they spoke with &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nCut Ashbringer dialogue.\nWell if ain't the Highlord &lt;himself/herself&gt;! I reckon' it's good for even the hardiest of us to take a moment and reflect now and again. I'm right fond of this spot.\nTake a seat with me for a moment, won't ye?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; is a truly wondrous blade, ain't it? I remember forging it many years ago back in Ironforge - my finest work.\nIf ye don't mind an old dwarf talkin' yer ear off, I'd like to share a piece of advice with ye that I've carried with me since I was a lad.\nWe all come from the same earth and stone around us; Alliance and Horde, dwarf and gnome - as a leader, ye've got to see past the differences and unite yer people against the Legion. Azeroth depends on it.\nI'll give ye some time alone. Just somethin' to think about in the days ahead.\nSilithus.\nI can hear the cries o' the world beneath my feet. Azeroth trembles in pain! We must find a way tae ease her sufferin'...\nBattle for Azeroth.\nI can hear the cries o' the world beneath my feet. Azeroth trembles in pain!

They think it ain't befitting a king. Hah! Ye don't forge legendary weapons like mine while sitting on a \"throne\". The lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; are \"mine\", and when I bring the pain, lads, it's HAMMER TIME!\"\nIn World of Warcraft.\nKing Magni Bronzebeard was originally a level ?? (Boss) quest giver located in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagni was removed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1.0\"&gt;Patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; was opened and contained Magni's petrified form. &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Guard%20Dunstad\"&gt;Honor Guard Dunstad&lt;/a&gt; stood near him:\nDuring Children's Week, &lt;a href=\"Randis\"&gt;Randis&lt;/a&gt; wanted to see the petrified Magni. As of Legion, the statue is no longer there and this event has been slightly updated to reflect the story progression.\nIn Hearthstone.\nMagni appears as (player character) for the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; class in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". He was the first alternate hero to be revealed. His flavor text reads: \"\"Lord of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Grand Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;'s Dad. Most Huggable Leader.\"\"\nPurchasing Magni also unlocks the Magni . The flavor text reads: \"As the eldest of the three Bronzebeard brothers, Magni always got the coolest toys. He always shared, though!\"\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; has a skin called \"Magni Muradin\".\nIn the RPG.\nHe was one of the heroes during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, often directly leading his people into battle.\nDuring the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, his middle brother, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;, was reportedly slain in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; sent a &lt;a href=\"Arthas%23Arthas%20to%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Magni stating that Muradin was slain by undead, but thanks to his sacrifice Arthas was able to obtain &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and would be returning to Lordaeron shortly. The letter also indicated that Muradin's body would be returned, though this never happened.\nHis titles are Rightful Sovereign of Ironforge and Dun Morogh, and &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Grand Explorer of the Explorer's Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nMagni could possibly be considered an &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; instead of a dwarf now, since the ritual that made him \"one with the earth\" and transformed him was of earthen origin. Magni also calls the earthen his brethren. Moreover, two dwarves point out the similarities between him and earthen in \"Fault Lines\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "194994", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=194994", "title": "Glyph of Moonfire", "text": "The Glyph of Moonfire shifts the damage of a druid's &lt;a href=\"moonfire\"&gt;moonfire&lt;/a&gt; spell so that the initial damage is inconsiderable but the damage over time is much higher. It results in an increase to the spell's total damage, but removes the instant burst damage. Because the damage over time component is more powerful, it pairs well with a &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Starfire\"&gt;Glyph of Starfire&lt;/a&gt; which increases the duration of Moonfire's damage over time by three seconds when Starfire hits. \nSource.\nThis item is created with &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; (130).\nCalculations.\nThese numbers are here to help you choose whether or not to use this glyph. They are based on max ranks for a level 80 (WotLK) Balance Druid.\nYour moonfire spell deals instant damage of [ 435 + 15% spellpower ] and applies a dot of [ 200 + 13% spellpower ] per tick.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Splendor%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Nature's Splendor (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; talent is active, you deal, without the glyph, a total [ 1435 + 80% spellpower ].\nWith the glyph, you deal a total [1750 + 112% spellpower]. The DPS increase from this glyph is thus about [ 21 + 2.1% of spellpower] per second.\nFor someone with 3000 spellpower, this would mean around a 84 dps increase (discounted from all damage buffs, debuffs and talents).\nFor comparison, &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Insect%20Swarm\"&gt;Glyph of Insect Swarm&lt;/a&gt; grants a damage increase of about [ 30 + 3% spellpower] per second.\nNotes.\nThis glyph is very strong for any &lt;a href=\"Balance\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt; Druid. It combines well with Glyph of Insect Swarm to empower the Druid's &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s. It also has good synergy with Glyph of Starfire, which increases the length of the DoT.\nA major drawback, however, is that it greatly reduces instant damage possibilities for a Druid. Therefore, many Arena PvP Druids prefer not to use this Glyph, in order to more easily finish off low health foes with Moonfire blasts. (Preferably using slightly downranked spells to avoid cutting the DoT.)"}

Flying machines are by definition mechanical devices capable of flight, but the term is mostly used for the \"heavier-than-air\" flying machines of the Alliance, which employ wing surfaces and movement to produce lift, either using a fixed wing, or a spinning rotor. The goblins are also able to build similar machines although they usually focus on \"lighter-than-air\" designs.\nThe backbone of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; air force is comprised predominantly of gnomish flying machines due to their maneuverability and speed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of flying machines called the &lt;a href=\"aerial%20unit\"&gt;aerial unit&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt;, was discovered on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nFirst War.\nThe first flying machines built by the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s were the &lt;a href=\"whirligig\"&gt;whirligig&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"sky-engine\"&gt;sky-engine&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; started, lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; did regret &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;his army&lt;/a&gt; didn't had flying units to scout out the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; swamp.\nSecond War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; had long offset their lack of physical strength with ingenuity and daring. As members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, they had continued to display their talents by inventing and piloting the unbelievable flying machine. Although having no armaments, these awkward contraptions could be used to survey vast areas of terrain, and detecting the otherwise hidden movements of underwater units, making them invaluable for discovering the movements of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThe ingenious &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s, taking a nod from their inventive &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; cousins, created and constructed their own &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s. During the events of \"\", dwarves replaced their gyrocopters with upgraded flying machines.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; continued to develop their flying machines, giving some of them a grappling hook and a variety of weapons. While the gnomes have emerged from their isolation and are now living amongst the dwarves as neighbors, the dwarves continue to use their homegrown design extensively. The gnomes themselves developed &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; aircrafts with fixed wings.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3.0\"&gt;patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;-only flying machines were released. They come in both epic and non-epic versions. They have the tiltable wing turbine/propeller rotors of the &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s, and a retractable lift rotor for higher altitudes which invokes gnomish designs. They are respectively called the &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turbo-Charged%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Turbo-Charged Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Playful &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can also create &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Paper Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNowadays the flying machines introduced in \"\" which were previously engineer-only are now being used extensively by both &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, and they are often also identified as &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s, while sometimes the &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; model is also used for plain flying machines.\nGnomes are particularly smitten with flying machines. They are also partly responsible for the creation of the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s, although the influence of dwarven aesthetics is quite evident.\nAs the story progressed, flying machines were used more and more in a modern way, with the creation of aerial military units such as the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20127th%20Paratroopers\"&gt;Ironforge 127th Paratroopers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Elite%20Aerial%20Rangers\"&gt;Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwarven craft still exist, endlessly launching from the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Arms\"&gt;Hall of Arms&lt;/a&gt;. One could be seen flying at the end of . They are also the &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlight paths.\nIn addition, several &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;s provide some kind of aircraft instead of the usual &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;:\nAirfields.\nExamples of airfields or flying machine launching pads can be found at the Ironforge &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Arms\"&gt;Hall of Arms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Bay\"&gt;Gnomeregan Launch Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Airfield\"&gt;Toxic Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strongarm%20Airstrip\"&gt;Strongarm Airstrip&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.%20Copter%20Pad\"&gt;Venture Co. Copter Pad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Carrier\"&gt;Carrier&lt;/a&gt;s are a type of ship that has an airfield on them.\nIn the RPG.\nA dwarven improvement on helicopters built by their gnomish cousins, and their own dwarven &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s, the flying machine is a heavily armed, flying gun platform. Thick armor protects the daredevil pilots who pilot the flying machines, but the armor also slows the vehicle considerably.\nPerhaps the most unusual \u2014 or insane \u2014 warrior in the entire Alliance is the dwarven flying machine pilot. This captain of the skies performs everything from reconnaissance to bombing missions, fearing nothing (except perhaps a passing &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;). Elegantly clad in studded leather, the flying machine pilot strides confidently as he enters his craft. Young and alert, ignoring those who deride technology with a slight sneer, his positive manner might inspire those who don't realize just how crazy he is. The flying machine pilot performs reconnaissance missions, and uses the weapons of his vehicle to attack aerial targets or perform strafing runs (the latter being a particularly tricky business). His vehicle also serves quite handily as a distraction, especially to those members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; who are not used to the sight of such craft. An experimented flying machine pilot can also be called an &lt;a href=\"Ace%20%28class%29\"&gt;Ace&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Lighter-than-air\" flying machines.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s also created their own flying contraptions, although they opted to use \"lighter-than-air\" designs, with their machines employing bags filled with gas to make them buoyant in the air.\nThe goblin &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; consists of a gondola of varying size suspended beneath one or more bags of lightweight gas that serve to keep the craft aloft. In keeping with the goblin fixation upon profit, these large craft tend to be packed with cargo or paying passengers.\nThe goblins also worked on creating the Horde &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s, employing a similar technology as the zeppelins.\nIn the RPG.\nFinally, there are &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;gnomish airship&lt;/a&gt;s which are \"fabulous flying machines\". &lt;a href=\"Scout%20balloon\"&gt;Scout balloon&lt;/a&gt;s have also been employed by the Alliance to explore &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, although when this occurred and who can be credited for their construction is unknown."}

A former &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, he now serves the interests of Kul Tiras as long as he gets paid. He is the captain of the \"&lt;a href=\"Middenwake\"&gt;Middenwake&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Bold%20Arva\"&gt;Bold Arva&lt;/a&gt;\". Flynn styles himself as a charismatic and dashing &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, with seedy contacts throughout &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and a talent for improvising to turn a bad situation around. However, he has a habit of being captured or humiliated and needing to be bailed out by his friends, typically the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Flynn remains a loyal and honest friend, as well as an asset to the Alliance. \nFlynn serves as the Alliance manager for &lt;a href=\"island%20expedition\"&gt;island expedition&lt;/a&gt;s, and a major character in the &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound%20storyline\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound storyline&lt;/a&gt;, where he helps the Alliance ambassador uncover the connection between &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; and the recent pirate attacks in Kul Tiras. Flynn also personally aided &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20Rising\"&gt;Shadows Rising&lt;/a&gt;\". \nBiography.\nEarly life.\nThough his mother always insisted that she was a barmaid, a young Flynn discovered that she was really a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;. He was initially angry and sad that she didn't trust him with the truth but came to the conclusion that any mother willing to risk life and liberty for her son must be full of love. However, his mother was eventually caught and Flynn made himself go and watch her execution by hanging. Sometime afterward, he was taken advantage of by the local gangs, who had him picking pockets and distracting guards for them.\nFlynn eventually came to be the captain of his own &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; crew, with &lt;a href=\"Harlan%20Sweete\"&gt;Harlan Sweete&lt;/a&gt; as his first mate. He witnessed Harlan commit acts that he didn't like, leading Flynn to consider him a maniac. The apparent last straw was when the two had a falling out after a messy job and this, plus his disgust over Harlan's behavior, caused Flynn to lose all taste for freebooting, so he just disappeared from &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; one day. &lt;a href=\"Venrik\"&gt;Venrik&lt;/a&gt; even came to believe that he had died. Meanwhile, Harlan took the nastiest of the crew and formed the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlynn met or came to know of &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; while he was still a pirate and developed a crush on her. Even though he would go on about her all the time, he appears to have not have mentioned her by name to his compatriots like Venrik, describing her as having \"hair like raven's down.\"\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFlynn was encountered by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; as a prisoner in &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;, the island prison owned by &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. He had intentionally gotten arrested because &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; hired him to break the adventurer out of Tol Dagor. Flynn staged a prison break and met with Taelia, who was waiting with an escape boat to take them back to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlynn later worked with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, a stolen &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; artifact, from the Zandalari treasury. The serious spymaster didn't get along with Flynn at first, not appreciating his quips, but seemed to warm up to him by the end of the scenario. Once the real scepter was taken and swapped out with a fake one, they made an escape from &lt;a href=\"Opulence\"&gt;Opulence&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe can also appear drunk in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Rising.\nAfter winning the \"&lt;a href=\"Bold%20Arva\"&gt;Bold Arva&lt;/a&gt;\" in dice, Flynn and his assembled crew were tasked with aiding &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; in his mission to further intelligence on the possibility that &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were within &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. In light of the storm brewing, Flynn directed Shaw below deck, declaring that Shaw didn't have the sea legs for it and that he was too drunk. While below deck, Shaw received messages from &lt;a href=\"Swailes\"&gt;Swailes&lt;/a&gt; from his agents &lt;a href=\"Narsilla%20Keensight\"&gt;Narsilla Keensight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krazzet\"&gt;Krazzet&lt;/a&gt;. When Flynn learned who the messages were from, he declared it very paranoid of Shaw. While acknowledging that they signed an armistice with the Horde, Shaw pointed out that it doesn't mean that they weren't watching them. He then stated his belief that only a fool mistakes peacetime for complacency.\nFlynn then asked what was happening within the Horde, and Shaw revealed that an assassination attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting. While Shaw was pleased to have had eyes on the assassination, Flynn wondered if the storm around Zandalar was caused by Talanji as a way to keep the whole island on lockdown, with nobody going in or out until they found the assassins. Unbeknownst to them, the storm had been created by &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; who was behind the assassination attempt on Talanji, as a means to isolate her.\nAs the mission progressed, Shaw found himself bonding with Flynn and greatly sympathized with the other man when he learned that Flynn witnessed his mother's death by hanging for thievery. After landing on Zandalar to avoid the storm, Flynn suggested making their way to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Victory\"&gt;Fort Victory&lt;/a&gt;. However, Shaw revealed that after the armistice with the Horde was signed, they ceded control of those encampments and that any sign of them on Zandalar shall be taken as an act of aggression. In light of this knowledge, Flynn's first order of business was to hide their ship. Though Shaw privately thought it was wiser to stay abroad the ship, he consented to the group going on land, understanding that morale was low and a brief stint on land always did a sailor good.\nAfter disembarking the ship, Shaw spied a Widow's Bite camp and upon investigating it, he discovered evidence suggesting that the group was in working with the Banshee loyalists. He then ordered Flynn to get the ship ready to sail, while he gathered more evidence only to end up captured by the Zandalari. While a distressed Flynn and the crew made it with all haste to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of getting rescue for Shaw, the spymaster was thrown into a cell within &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, Flynn subsequently barged into &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s dining hall to reveal that the Zandalari had taken Shaw prisoner. While &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sought to respond with war against the Zandalari, convinced that they were working with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; called upon them to not add fuel on an already kindly fire and risk the treaty. Jaina then stated she would use the treaty itself before turning to the blade.\nFlynn was in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; when Shaw was released from Horde custody and returned home. He was so overjoyed to see Shaw freed nearly shoved &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; out of way to wrap him in a tight warm hug, that Mathias returned. Shaw then revealed that there was something that he wanted to talk about with Flynn and asked him to meet at the &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Rose\"&gt;Gilded Rose&lt;/a&gt; that night, causing the other man to blush which said all that Shaw needed to know.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nAfter they returned from Zandalar, Flynn and Mathias barely interacted with each other until one day when Flynn won a treasure map of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; in a card game and convinced Shaw to come with him for an adventure and a bit of fun. Near the &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Gardens%20Cemetery\"&gt;Tranquil Gardens Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, the two came across the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; commander &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; suffering from a mysterious rotting illness and brought her back to &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, where she revealed that she had been attacked while investigating a report that the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an artifact used to keep the undead of Duskwood at bay\u2014had gone missing from where it had been placed on &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Forlorn Rowe&lt;/a&gt;. During the conversation, more injured Night Watchers arrived and revealed that an army of undead was heading from &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; to Darkshire.\nFlynn and Mathias set out for Raven Hill on &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;back. Along the way they passed over the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; and agreed that they would head to a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; for their next, more peaceful adventure. Upon reaching Forlorn Rowe, the two rogues quickly discovered the culprit responsible for stealing the torch, a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;human necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, and (after Mathias offered some encouraging words to his companion) followed her down into the &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Wood%20Catacombs\"&gt;Dawning Wood Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; while avoiding detection by her undead minions. In the deepest level of the crypt, they found the necromancer attempting to corrupt the torch within a ritual circle. Mathias revealed himself and began talking with the necromancer to distract her while Flynn used rum from one of his bottles to wash away the bone powder making up the circle. While Mathias attacked the necromancer, Flynn grabbed the torch and realized that it could be cleansed of corruption in a moonwell. The necromancer managed to curse Mathias with the same rotting disease that had afflicted Ladimore, but the two rogues used their blades and the torch to fight their way out of the catacomb and used one of the Night Watch's left-behind gryphons to escape to the Twilight Grove. The necromancer pursued them on her winged undead horse and blasted them off their gryphon as it came down to land in the grove. Although his skin was now covered in sores, Mathias declared he'd keep the necromancer busy. As Shaw and his opponent fought, Flynn plunged the torch into the moonwell, reigniting it and allowing him to use it to set the necromancer aflame and kill her.\nWith the necromancer's death, the illness affecting Shaw and Ladimore vanished. The Torch of Holy Flame was returned to Forlorn Rowe, and Ladimore commended the two rogues for saving Duskwood. As they didn't get to complete their treasure hunt, Mathias gave Flynn's map to the Night Watch, and the watchers returned with the treasure as a gift to the rogues: a hand mirror. Afterward, Mathias told Flynn that there were many powerful artifacts like the torch scattered across the world and that King Anduin frequently sent him to check up on them. With &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; relatively quiet for the time being, it was time for Shaw to go on an inspection trip\u2014and he wanted Flynn to come with him on the journey. When Flynn asked why, Mathias simply responded \"Because I trust you\". Flynn agreed, and the two kissed.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWhen Shaw was granted a temporary leave by &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to travel through the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; in order to write up reports on its people, on its places, to inventory some powerful artifacts and ensure that they are safe, but also to meet contacts of the Spymaster to collect as much information as possible on the situation of the continent, Flynn joined him, claiming to want to \"prove my worth by assisting the Spymaster and his right Royal Majesty King Anduin.\"\nFor the sake of their mission and relations between the two factions, the duo obtained permission from the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, signed by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, to pass through Horde territories without being attacked.\nFollowing their mission, Shaw and Flynn managed to find the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;lost crown&lt;/a&gt; of the late &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, buried in a secret memorial behind the Stormwind lighthouse. The duo believes it was done by Lordaeron refugees who buried it there, so the survivors of Lordaeron would have a place to mourn their king, and that neither Arthas nor anyone can ever find the crown. After verifying and confirming the presence of the crown, they buried it once more and agreed to continue keeping the secret, without telling Anduin anything about it.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nFlynn accompanied by Shaw was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the reception, he spoke with &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, where he discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; didn't attend the wedding due to the kingdom experiencing pirate troubles. He subsequently inquired as to their flags, in order to see if they were old mates of his and thus could provide aid in handling them.\nDragonflight.\nFlynn bought a pet from &lt;a href=\"Wilder%20Seabraid\"&gt;Wilder Seabraid&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"T%26amp%3BW%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;T&amp;W Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; as a surprise for Shaw. Later, he can be found at .\nQuotes.\nGossip.\n&lt;a href=\"Cagney\"&gt;Cagney&lt;/a&gt; fished this &lt;a href=\"Olive\"&gt;girl&lt;/a&gt; out of the water with his ferry - said she was trying to escape the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoesn't surprise me one bit that the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt; is putting kids to work. I was barely older than her when the gangs in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; had me picking pockets and distracting guards for them.\nIn this world, the weaker you are, the more people take advantage of you.\nFortunately the workers don't seem to mind us snooping around... just the company goons.\nYou get what we need?\nLet's split up.\nYou investigate the docks, I'll see about getting us into town.\nGood news: I think they're gonna let us in.\nBad news: We technically have to become pirates to get in.\nWhat, were you worried? Haha!\n&lt;cough&gt;\nAh... still a bit sore. But I'll be fine.\nBesides, my job's done, mate.\nYou and Taelia go on back to Boralus and do the hero thing.\nOh, I don't know, maybe find me someone nice, settle down on a little farm somewhere...\nWhat do you THINK I'm gonna do, mate?!\nI'm gonna get my money from Cyrus, buy everyone a round at &lt;a href=\"Snug%20Harbor%20Inn\"&gt;The Snug Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and look for the next adventure.\nOnly way to live, my friend.\nYes? We've got our orders, the Azerite's waiting, just take a look at the table and you let me know when you're ready to ship out.\nI'm know, I'm hard not to look at, I get that a lot, but we've got to focus here.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNice to see you &lt;name&gt;! Hope you are enjoying yourself in SI:7, I keep telling Mathias he needs to spruce the place up."}
