Inside is a chasm crisscrossed with wooden bridges, a good number of them broken and hanging limp. Mine entrances dot the canyon walls. The wind that whistles through the gulch brings sibilant whispers to the ear.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deranged%20Explorer\"&gt;Deranged Explorer&lt;/a&gt;s here are indicative of an unknown force where they have been working. They appear to be suffering the same affliction as the prisoners in the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Mines\"&gt;Saronite Mines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; came here. The ones who stayed to explore were driven mad by the ore they found here\u2014&lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, the crystallized black blood of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and the source of whispering\u2014and the sound of their raving echoes ceaselessly.\nThe dwarves took most of our mules and equipment with them, and &lt;a href=\"Explorer%20Abigail\"&gt;Explorer Abigail&lt;/a&gt; wanted them back, so she sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to get them. &lt;a href=\"Sapper%20Steelring\"&gt;Sapper Steelring&lt;/a&gt; was interested in ore and gems from the gulch, but as soon as adventurers brought him the ore and warned him, he only accepted the gems. The &lt;a href=\"Deranged%20Explorer\"&gt;maddened explorers&lt;/a&gt; in the gulch were led by &lt;a href=\"Squeeg%20Idolhunter\"&gt;Squeeg Idolhunter&lt;/a&gt; who unfortunately became a target of Westguard Keep. \nA &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; passed through the area, and the mad dwarves attacked it. &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Malthus\"&gt;Apothecary Malthus&lt;/a&gt; suspected their beer contributed to their insanity, and had it brought to him. The Forsaken also sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the dwarves in the gulch and collect their brains.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers Bronzebeards came here, and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; recognized some of the gibbering madmen as former members of the League, which upset him deeply."}

When Nurakkir crashed, Vyn and Xennir were the only members of the group who survived, though Xennir was traumatized by the event.\nVyn and Xennir remained at the ruined necropolis as it began being scavenged by members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, until the Eyes' baroness &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; allies returned to ask for the Eyes' help in stealing a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Vyn trusted Vashj but insisted that carrying out the baroness' plan would require a well-coordinated crew. She asked the Maw Walkers to find her sister Xennir and guide her through her grief so she could once again serve as a navigator. Once the Maw Walkers had assembled a full crew, Vyn and the other Eyes took control of Nurakkir by killing &lt;a href=\"Gorgantus%20the%20Gutter\"&gt;Gorgantus the Gutter&lt;/a&gt;. Vyn then told the Maw Walkers to report back to &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; at the Seat of the Primus while she remained at Nurakkir to coordinate the Eyes' efforts.\nShortly after, the Maw Walkers and Eyes put Vashj's plan into action by infiltrating the House of Constructs' &lt;a href=\"Ossein%20Foundry\"&gt;Ossein Foundry&lt;/a&gt; to steal the Constructs' own necropolis, the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;. The Constructs were prepared for the Eyes' arrival, but despite some complications, the infiltrators managed to rendezvous and capture a mooring platform from which the Maw Walkers could travel to the necropolis' apex and use a keystone to take command of it. Vyn and the other Eyes quickly steered the Zerekriss away from the House of Constructs to instead have it patrol around Maldraxxus. Aboard, the Maw Walkers also discovered the &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20Fleshcrafting\"&gt;:Bindings of Fleshcrafting&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the armor pieces that once belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; himself\u2014and brought them back to the Seat of the Primus.\nVyn accompanied the covenant forces who invaded the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;. She and another Maldraxxi spy observed the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;'s movements near the &lt;a href=\"Scholar%27s%20Den\"&gt;Scholar's Den&lt;/a&gt;, but her partner was found and killed and Vyn had to send Maw Walkers to obtain her partner's report from her killer.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Assault\"&gt;Necrolord Assault&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Vyn moves to the portal room of the Seat of the Primus to inform Maw Walkers that she has attuned the Zerekriss portal to connect it to the necropolis' position above &lt;a href=\"Perdition%20Hold\"&gt;Perdition Hold&lt;/a&gt;."}

To the north is the lake &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. Next to the lake is a chair and some fishing gear and bait.

A cloud of mist hovers over the circle, and the circle sits, glowing and otherwise unremarkable for hours on end. But every now and again, the &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s - &lt;a href=\"Fey-Drunk%20Darter\"&gt;Fey-Drunk Darter&lt;/a&gt;s - begin to appear, one by one, and fly erratically in the general area of the mushroom ring. Over time seven of them will fade in, and at some point all seven darters seem to come to some forgone conclusion and they converge on the ring. The Fey-Drunk Darters begin to sing. As they sing, beams of light shine from each darter, converging on the center of the mushroom ring. The other animals of the glen come to watch, curious about the lights and sounds no doubt, and just as suddenly as the mysterious ritual starts, it stops. The darters slowly fly away and fade out to wherever they happened to come from, and the stags, does, and fawns wander off. The event lasts around three minutes, and occurs four times per hour.\nWild creatures.\nAll of the above creatures are found nowhere in the world except in the Whispering Forest.\nAs of \"\" a small camp with cultists is present:\nLegion.\nBeneath the lake within the Whispering Forest lies a terrible, long-forgotten secret.

Forging inland, the high elves founded a settlement within the tranquil Tirisfal Glades. After a few years, many of them began to go mad. It was theorized that something evil slept beneath that particular part of the world, but the rumors were never proven to be true. The high elves packed up their encampment and moved northward towards another land rich with ley energies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fey-Drunk%20Darter\"&gt;Fey-Drunk Darter&lt;/a&gt;s may be trying to heal the forest from Zakajz's corruption.\nThe Whispering Forest is implied to have some link towards the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has also been suggested as the location of &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Chamber\"&gt;the chamber occupied by Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\", possibly created by the Highborne, building off the speculation that this was their landing spot."}

Along with her brethren, she rejected the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and turned to the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s instead, becoming an incarnation of storm. She was the youngest of the four. As the incarnate of wind and lightning, Raszageth was wild and untamable, rebelling against the titan's gifts and those who accepted them, but she was also cruel, arrogant, and sadistic, wanting her former clutchmates, the &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, to suffer and lose everything before killing them. She is described as especially overconfident by her older brother, &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually lead to her downfall at the hand of the Aspects' allies. \nAs the first of the Incarnates to escape confinement, Raszageth was the main antagonist of the first part of . She is first seen in the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20starting%20experience\"&gt;Dracthyr starting experience&lt;/a&gt; and is encountered by players numerous times throughout the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; storyline before finally meeting her end as the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nAncient past.\nWhile the proto-dragons who would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; accepted the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the proto-dragons who would become the Primal Incarnates rejected it. Tensions rose between the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; who wished to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\" and the dragonflights, breaking out into open rebellion about 20,000 years ago when Raszageth struck first by leading an assault on &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; army on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle, she destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, the titan relic which Neltharion was using to control the dracthyr. This caused Neltharion to give in to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time and use their power to seal her away within the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nA cataclysmic conflict ensued between Primalists and dragonflights known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Scaleborn\"&gt;War of the Scaleborn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; were ever loyal to the Incarnate's ideals, but &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, but Alexstrasza, having failed to restore peace between the two groups, still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years later, a modern incarnation of the Primalists was led by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; to free Raszageth from the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Once free, she announced that the elements were singing the arrival of a new era for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, then asked Kurog where the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were imprisoned and declared that they would soon all be free from their shackles. Facing &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and the newly released dracthyr, she let them go so Wrathion could carry a message for &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, that the Primalists were back and that they would make sure to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\". With the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, Raszageth and the Primalists retreated.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;, Raszageth and her Primalists attempted to infuse their own powers into the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Ruby Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;. She battled Alexstrasza, but &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; intervened before Razageth could deal the finishing blow. Raszageth left because she wanted Alexstrasza to suffer by losing everything before she died.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, Raszageth led the Primalists' efforts to destroy &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ley%20lines\"&gt;ley lines&lt;/a&gt; connected to it, which would destroy the Span. She expressed disgust at the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; for using the \"unnatural\" &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic of the titans. As Raszageth was about to kill &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, the rest of the blue dragons arrived, saving him and driving her off. Even after she fled, Raszageth's storm remained around the tower at Vakthros, and the Aspects questioned what she wanted there since it had nothing to do with the other Incarnates' imprisonment.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, she gloated over Alexstrasza's failed attempt to use the Mother Oathstone to renew the Aspects' powers, before breaching the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; and attempting to free the other Primal Incarnates. Though Raszageth was killed, she succeeded in freeing &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;. Though Fyrakk wanted to devour the hearts of her murderers, Iridikron reprimanded him to not underestimate the mortals, as Raszageth did which led to her downfall due to her overconfidence.\nFollowing Raszageth's defeat, her spell over the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; began to wain, allowing not only the dracthyr to return but also her fellow Incarnates who ventured there, both to mourn her death and to proceed with plans in uncovering the secrets of Neltharion.\nWhile adventurers were exploring the hidden vaults, they found letters written by &lt;a href=\"Adamanthia\"&gt;Adamanthia&lt;/a&gt; and addressed to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;; one of them mentioned that while Raszageth's prison remained strong, electrical disturbances around her vault led her to believe that not only was she conscious but may have been once attempting to send out a signal to her kin.\nSpeculations.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;, there is no indication as to Raszageth's constraints, although she was imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. It can be assumed that her prison was not the same as that of her other Incarnates.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

One example is the so-called &lt;a href=\"%3Aratstallion\"&gt;:ratstallion&lt;/a&gt;, who has grown large, agile and shadow resistant from years of chain-chugging potions in Dalaran's sewer system.\nRats are oddly edible. &lt;a href=\"Nipsy\"&gt;Nipsy&lt;/a&gt; (who cooks them) and &lt;a href=\"Monty\"&gt;Monty&lt;/a&gt; (who captures them) of the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; operate a business in which they make &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Rat%20Kabobs\"&gt;Deeprun Rat Kabobs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dig%20Rat\"&gt;Dig Rat&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and can be made into tasty &lt;a href=\"Dig%20Rat%20Stew\"&gt;Dig Rat Stew&lt;/a&gt;.

It was begun by smugglers and became populated mainly by not only their foul ilk, but also all those others whom various societies had cast out.\nCycle of Hatred.\nBecause of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;'s manipulations, several minor shipping incidents near Ratchet led to increased tensions between Orgrimmar and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Life for the local &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s became much harder as orc and human traders and sailors were now at risk of fighting together in the streets. The arrest of captains &lt;a href=\"Klatt\"&gt;Klatt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joq\"&gt;Joq&lt;/a&gt; by the bruiser &lt;a href=\"Muzzlecrank\"&gt;Muzzlecrank&lt;/a&gt; flared up tensions even further, with &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; forces requesting reinforcements against what they perceived as orcish preparations for war.\nRatchet later served as a staging area for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; army against the forces of Northwatch Hold, but when the truth of the incidents being the result of the Burning Blade playing the two sides against each other came to light, the battle was declared over by Thrall.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWarlock coven.\nRatchet is home to a medium-sized coven of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s that offered a high number of the now-removed &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20quests%23Removed%20Quests\"&gt;warlock quests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Strahad%20Farsan\"&gt;Strahad Farsan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menara%20Voidrender\"&gt;Menara Voidrender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Babagaya%20Shadowcleft\"&gt;Babagaya Shadowcleft&lt;/a&gt; are members of this coven, along with their acolytes, residing in a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt; above the city.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, rumors spread across Ratchet that something was amiss with the grain shipment in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDespite being close to the ocean, Ratchet did not receive any major damage from the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, however, it did see a slight increase in Alliance and Horde presence.\nTides of War.\nThe Horde fleet landed their &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; armies in Ratchet during the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Invasion of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, Theramore feared to sent refugees to Ratchet and instead sent them to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Burning Legion's invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the town was assaulted by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. It was defended by &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; aboard his custom &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ratchet%20Bruiser\"&gt;Ratchet Bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, but some of them were controlled by a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; and had to be rescued by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;defenders&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Alliance reported that during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Ratchet served the Horde. Alliance champions were sent to investigate the intentions of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; in the town. The cartel did provide a vital stream of supplies and Horde champions were tasked with preventing the Alliance from discovering these smuggling operations.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe threw his full support behind the Horde by becoming the new Trade Prince of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, taking over from &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; who had abandoned the Horde. With Gazlowe becoming the Trade Prince of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown if he is still Ratchet's leader.\nReputation.\nMost of the quests to raise reputation with Ratchet and the Steamwheedle Cartel are located in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Having a friendly or higher reputation will make the guards help you in case of initiated violence against you.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nThe City of Ratchet, on Kalimdor\u2019s central east coast, is run by goblins and shows it. Built from equal parts of industry and decadence, the goblin port city of Ratchet sprawls along nearly a mile of coastline where the eastern Barrens poke between &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to the sea. Ratchet is the pride of the goblins, a trade city where you can find almost anything your heart desires. Ratchet also has regular ferries that traverse the safe though roundabout route to the island stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Its streets sprawl in every direction, and the architecture shows no consistency or common vision. It is a city of entertainment and trade, where anything that anyone would ever want to buy \u2014 and plenty of things that no one ever wants to bu y \u2014 is on sale. Casinos, playhouses, brothels, fine restaurants, taverns, tearooms, gladiatorial arenas\u2026 Ratchet has it all. From the grungiest sailor to the wealthiest royalty, all can sate their tastes in Ratchet. Ratchet is Kalimdor\u2019s largest port, and ships commonly stop here on their way elsewhere. Pirate vessels receive amnesty in Ratchet\u2019s waters, bringing an influx of the disreputable and violent. Indeed, Ratchet is a hotspot, as races of all types and members of all social economic strata rub shoulders in the bazaars. Goblin watchmen are quick to put down conflict and make sure the inhabitants all play nice with each other. The city never stops. Its lights are on, its shops open and its services available at any time of day or night. One can also hire transport in Ratchet, traveling via caravan, ship, zeppelin or more exotic means. Everything in Ratchet has a price, of course.\nRatchet is currently run by &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, the Overseer of Ratchet, of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; under the watchful eye of the &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s, who give him considerably free reign. Ratchet also serves as a base of operations for many members of a corporate group called the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of greedy entrepreneurs, which is infamous for its massive numbers of goblin shredders. They also run the city, and always keep their beady eyes on the bottom line at all times.\nThe city uses &lt;a href=\"truth%20detector\"&gt;truth detector&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nRatchet is a city where creatures who were once the butt of jokes now reign supreme. Its streets wander without rhyme or reason through neighborhoods dedicated to one activity: commerce. Ramshackle warehouses stand next to stately stone homes. Fine shops press cheek to jowl with rude huts. Wares of every type imaginable \u2014 and some beyond the imagination \u2014 are on display in markets and in exclusive boutiques.\nThe goblins run their operations around the clock, and boats are always pulling in and out of harbor carrying loads of precious goods and cargo. Goblin guardsmen patrol the streets, making sure that the various Horde and Alliance visitors play nice with each other.\nGoblins welcome anyone with gold or items of value and a willingness to trade them for their wares and services. Merchants throng the marketplaces each day, selling everything from silks to slaves, and even at night the stores lining the twisting streets and alleys remain open for business. Those with the money can listen to skilled musicians while drinking fine ales and eating food prepared by expert chefs. For those with earthier tastes, the streets along the wharf teem with whorehouses, taprooms, and casinos. Since goblins are essentially neutral to everyone, Ratchet entertains members of each race who come for the nightlife. All in all, Ratchet is a wild place, offering great bars, fight clubs, girls (and guys), and fast boats.\nIn addition to commerce, Ratchet hosts a series of arenas that sponsor gladiatorial tournaments. These enormously popular tourneys are open to all comers, and winners can reap enormous prizes. The princes of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Circle\"&gt;Golden Circle&lt;/a&gt; often hire those who distinguish themselves in the arenas, either as bodyguards or as caravan escorts.\nRatchet is the largest port on Kalimdor, with as many ships bringing cargo in as there are ships heading out for other sites around Kalimdor. In addition to legitimate trade vessels, pirate craft receive amnesty while in the port of Ratchet as long as they can pay the stiff docking fees. This situation makes many merchant captains furious, but they cannot hope to stay in business if they boycott Ratchet. Moreover, the &lt;a href=\"Lawkeepers\"&gt;Lawkeepers&lt;/a&gt; and hired mercenaries prowling the waterfront are eager to deal with anyone looking to cause trouble. More than one drunken hooligan has laughed at being told to calm down by a pair of tiny goblin guardsmen...only to wake up in jail with bruises and singed clothing.\nThe skies above Ratchet are almost as busy as the harbor, full of goblin zeppelins, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s, and other aerial contraptions. The aircraft provide merchants and travelers with quick airborne transport to anywhere in Kalimdor \u2014 though when the regular cargoes of the trade princes need to be bumped, stiff premiums are charged well above the normally high cost of such a service."}

However, the consequences for ratings are perhaps a more important motivation for success in these battles, providing not only personal glory but also a shot at rating-restricted titles, mounts and achievements. As with arena, the top rated teams in each region can be viewed on the official site.\nWhile broadly similar to regular battlegrounds, rated battlegrounds tend to feature far more organized play, with teams customized to provide the ideal combination of classes and roles. Players are usually in voice communication, and may have prearranged tactics and plays in mind.

Rathan promised that he and Emeni would build the Necrolords an army of constructs far greater than Gharmal's if the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; helped them reclaim Emeni's body and rescue the other souls trapped in the vault.\nThe trio traveled to the Body Banks and, after gathering the necessary tools from the nearby Construct forces, used the assembly equipment to build a new abomination for Emeni's soul to inhabit. The Maw Walker then worked with the reborn Emeni to rescue the souls trapped in the Etheric Vault. Rathan took these freed souls to &lt;a href=\"Butchers%20Block\"&gt;Butchers Block&lt;/a&gt; outside the Seat of the Primus, declaring that the spot could serve as a new home where they could create a force of new construct warriors to fight for the Necrolords."}

Boneweavers do \"not\" have an aggro radius, so feel free to walk around the room in peace. On aggro, the boneweaver will summon non-elite boneguards to harass the party. Make sure the Boneweaver is facing away from the rest of the party, as they cast a frontal cone. After each Boneweaver's death, the remaining Boneweavers summon additional s with each cast. Be careful with the last weaver, as she summons six boneguards at a time! Make sure the boneguards attacking Voss are dead before the boneweaver dies.\nAs soon as the last boneweaver dies, run quickly run to a corner, as Rattlegore will spawn in the middle of the room after Voss and Gandling exit. Note the location of the six Bone Piles in the room. They can be interacted with to pick up a \"debuff\" lasting five minutes that absorbs the next Bone Spike cast by Rattlegore. The piles respawn after 10\u201315 seconds, so have a shield up before the fight starts.\nDuring the fight, the tank will need to kite Rattlegore around the room until the Rusting debuff drops. However, be aware of the bone piles. They will occasionally flare up with bright flames, denying access to the bone pile objects within them and blocking off a portion of the room for a few seconds. All players need to keep track of their bone shield debuff and drop whatever they are doing to refresh the buff if it gets used.\nThis is a one phase fight, so the same abilities are in play from full health to zero.\nIn Hearthstone.\nRattlegore appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His effect resurrects him with -1/-1 stats each time he dies, and his flavor text reads: \"He looks bad now, but he was pretty handsome in his 20/20s.\""}

Have a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; ready to &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt; just in case. While you possibly do not need to clear the whole room to fight Rattlegore, doing so is strongly advised, particularly if an attempt is being made to solo him at level 70 or below.\nUnless you're a Paladin or a Warrior, Rattlegore probably should not be soloed in less than &lt;a href=\"tier%204\"&gt;tier 4&lt;/a&gt; (level 70) equivalent gear, because in terms of scaling, at less than that mitigation/stamina level, he hits like a truck.\nSpeculation.\nHe may be the leader or first \"creation\" of the &lt;a href=\"Rattlecage%20Skeleton\"&gt;Rattlecage Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, who are situated in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, due to his name being similar to the word \"rattlecage\" and because he drops a shield called &lt;a href=\"Rattlecage%20Buckler\"&gt;Rattlecage Buckler&lt;/a&gt;."}

They first arrived on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s dimensional fortress, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBackground.\nRavagers were one of the creatures most heavily mutated by &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction and the ones on Outland today barely resemble their original form. Draenor's ravagers were built similarly to &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nRavager eggs are small, pulsing and purple in color. Although covered in spikes, they seem to be rather fragile. Each egg is swarming with multiple larvae. Ravagers hatch as &lt;a href=\"ravager%20larva\"&gt;harmless grub&lt;/a&gt;, but soon disappear into pupae, only to emerge as &lt;a href=\"ravager%20wasp\"&gt;slender wasps&lt;/a&gt; with a swarm mentality and a ferocious sting. This process only takes a few days. Wasps quickly set out to gorge themselves until their wings can no longer support their body weight, after which they undergo a third and final metamorphosis into a vicious four-legged insect, whose distinctive, gurgling click-hiss instills fear in orc and draenei alike. Heroes should beware the fully-grown ravager's serrated mandibles (capable of shredding armor) and the lacerating spikes ravagers eject from their armored carapaces.\nThe orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; orcs of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; tame and breed ravagers, even employing them as mounts in battle.\nFollowing Draenor's destruction, ravagers can now be found in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, often lurking behind cliffs and waiting to pounce on any prey foolish enough to wander within range of their blindingly fast, razor-sharp claws. They come in two distinct models, one with more spikes and glowing eyes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"rock%20flayer\"&gt;rock flayer&lt;/a&gt;s seem to contain a gland that allows them to control ravagers at least allow them to work together. It's possible the rock flayers could see them as pets, or share some kind of other relationship with them.\nThough ravagers are not normally native to Azeroth, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" carried some native Outland creatures with it to Azeroth, including ravagers. When the \"Exodar\" crashed, it resulted in the unfortunate escape of these fierce beasts into &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, causing a disruption of the native flora and fauna there.\nAs a mount.\n&lt;a href=\"Grinning%20Reaver\"&gt;Grinning Reaver&lt;/a&gt; was purchasable from the &lt;a href=\"In-Game%20Store\"&gt;In-Game Store&lt;/a&gt;, but is now unobtainable.\nAs a hunter pet.\nRavagers are a family of &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20pets\"&gt;Cunning pets&lt;/a&gt; and are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 10. They can through the use of &lt;a href=\"Ravage\"&gt;Ravage&lt;/a&gt;, violently attack an enemy, causing the enemy target to take 4% increased physical damage for 25 sec. This takes the place of abilities such as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Combat\"&gt;Savage Combat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 14 different skins available for ravager pets. Some from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; have sharper spikes, such as the . Ravagers are sometimes picked up as an &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; starting pet or an &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; novelty.

As they questioned Cecilia about the amulet, the attendants overheard the question and quickly attacked the champion, but they were defeated.

It held a &lt;a href=\"Mortician\"&gt;mortuary&lt;/a&gt; school that graduated the finest embalmers in Azeroth. Then the undead rose up and murdered most of the inhabitants. After struggling to combat what had once been their loved ones, most townspeople gave up and fled east to &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; tried to set up camp in the town in the aftermath of the exodus, but even they could not take the constant attacks by the undead. Some citizens remained, including a master embalmer known as , who lived near Raven Hill cemetery until recently. A serious man, he worked both to stay alive and to stop the undead - or so he claimed. Raven Hill is possibly the origin of the massive &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Black Riders&lt;/a&gt;, huge beings that suddenly appear with &lt;a href=\"Hell%20hound\"&gt;hellhounds&lt;/a&gt; at their feet to run down frantic travelers. Some nights they skirt the perimeter of Darkshire, howling loudly.\nSpeculation.\nIn ', there was a town named &lt;a href=\"Sunnyglade\"&gt;Sunnyglade&lt;/a&gt; which was situated where Raven Hill is located in \"World of Warcraft\". They might be one and the same, as is the case with &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; having once been &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was the final battle between the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by King Arthas, and Kil'jaeden's agents led by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoading screen.\n\"Moments later, at the Scourge stronghold, King Arthas and Anub'arak make their final plans to defend the Lich King's Throne Chamber.\"\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nThe Frozen Throne.\n\"The key to Ner'zhul's tomb is controlling the four ancient Obelisks surrounding Icecrown Glacier. Illidan's forces already vie for their control. Destroy the forces guarding the Obelisks, and bring Arthas to the nearby Obelisk Circles to capture them.\"\nPrelude.\nAfter forcing their way past the horrors of the dark catacombs of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; rendezvoused with their army at the peak of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, with the intention of claiming the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; in the name of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. They were dismayed to find that &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s forces had already arrived, were well entrenched around the pinnacle of ice which contained the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and were poised to claim the four &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Obelisk\"&gt;Icecrown Obelisk&lt;/a&gt;s which when activated would open the prison.\nThe battle.\nArthas and his army quickly wiped out a small &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; outpost to the south west of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and used the resources gathered from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; to establish their own base. From there Arthas and Anub'arak launched their attack against &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. The battle raged back and forth across the glacier, with both sides taking and re-taking each of the obelisks. Although the undead were outnumbered, the biting cold and &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' considerable military prowess eventually turned the tide against &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; were routed, and Arthas claimed all four obelisks, allowing him to approach the Frozen Throne. In a last desperate effort to stop him, Illidan confronted the death knight at the entrance; after a short fight Arthas cut the betrayer down, leaving him badly wounded in the snow. The Scourge had triumphed.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and merged with &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to become the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. From his Icecrown fortress, the Lich King made plans to rebuild his forces and conquer the rest of the world. &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; was apparently driven mad by the encounter; he crawled back to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt;, who retreated with their remaining forces back to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. He brooded in his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; until a brave band of adventurers, assisted by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, finally killed him, ending his reign over Outland. Later, in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King was finally slain by another band of adventurers assisted by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, ending Arthas's reign and the Scourge once and for all. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; eventually became the new Lich King and now commands the \"new Scourge\" from the Frozen Throne."}

Unwary natives are captured and seeded in an agonizing process that alters their physical makeup and takes complete control over their bodies, turning them into mindless walking saplings. The entire process is poorly understood, but these grisly infested can be seen guarding botani enclaves or shambling ahead of the botani host as gruesome cannon fodder whose corpses eventually seed new terrain.\nThe infested appear to be mere husks animated by plant life. They are slow but very strong. Slaying even one is a strong demonstration of skill.\nDue to the risk of having corpses be raised and infested by the botani, the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull Orcs&lt;/a&gt; burn their dead.\nSpeculation.\nSome infested orcs are much larger and more heavily mutated than others, as such they may actually be some form of plant &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt;s as they have similar traits."}

He is found corrupting a bronze &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, leaving upon success. He'll only drop &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Bronze%20Drake\"&gt;Reins of the Bronze Drake&lt;/a&gt; besides the badges. This is a guaranteed drop.\nPlayers seeking to battle him only have 25 minutes from the first Scourge wave to kill him; merely engaging him does not stop the timer. He is located in the Market Row which is located just past the gate leading to the Mal'Ganis encounter. He's at the far end of the left side of the junction past the gate, while Mal'Ganis is on the right.\nHe is only present in heroic mode.\nStrategies.\nFor all intents and purposes, the Infinite Corruptor is a &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; boss.\nGetting to him within the time constraints will require a fast clear. In the first few months after the release of \"\", this was a very difficult feat, though reaching the Infinite Corruptor is now considered to be automatic, with better runs reaching him with 10 minutes or more left on the timer.\nThe most vital strategy is to be aggressive in going after the waves on the first and third legs of the instance. This is especially true on the third leg, as several of the elites can be picked up at the same time, and waiting for Arthas to engage the mobs will slow the group down considerably.\nNotes.\nTo be successful in getting the loot from the mob, he must die before he reaches the portal. A viable tactic is to kite the boss away from the portal if your time is low. That way, when he flees he can still take damage before reaching the portal and despawning.\nLore implications.\nThe presence of this npc in the Culling of Stratholme, as well as the activity he is undertaking, would seem to suggest that the Infinite Dragonflight is in fact made up of Bronze Dragons who have been subverted.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are corrupted &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s; who have been led to subvert the timelines by the belief system of a corrupted version of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; blessed the wise &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and his brood with the ability to time travel and mastery of temporal magic, though the infinites seek to abuse this power to disrupt the timeways to shape a future that is to their ideals. Their nemeses are the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, their former kindred, and their ultimate goal is to corrupt the main timeline version of Nozdormu into Murozond to bring about their 'perfected' timeline.\nFollowing the death of Murozond in the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, the infinites decided to aid &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, a charismatic bronze dragon disillusioned with protecting time, who wished to use &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;s to gain infinite power. Following the foiling of this plan, the infinites were silent until the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt;, they once again set out on their mission to corrupt Nozdormu into his darkest self; seeking to create a 'perfected timeline', where they ruled supreme. Deios was eventually stopped, and Nozdormu freed from this dark fate; leading many infinites to scatter. During this time, the infinite &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt;, was invited to speak to Nozdormu and explain her reason as to why she subverted into an infinite from the bronze flight. While Nozdormu could not agree with all of her reasons, he did agree that sometimes the timeline may be malleable and that a \"strict view\" may have not been the proper way. With this in mind, Eternus pledged herself back to Nozdormu, and stated she would sway any other infinites that would listen to rejoin the Bronze dragonflight; though some would continue to resist and seek Murozond.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nInfinite dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nUnlike other dragons, the infinite dragons have an almost unstable look to them. Their scales are pitch black, echoing out a strange white-blue energy that almost seems to be crackling through, or even breaking, their skin.\nSeveral of these dragons also take unorthodox forms to those traditionally found; such as the &lt;a href=\"wylderdrake\"&gt;wylderdrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"velocidrake\"&gt;velocidrake&lt;/a&gt;. As these are specified as drakes, it is unknown what their 'dragon' forms or whelp forms would look like; though they are presumably just smaller and larger variations of these appearances. With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s being discovered; some &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found among the infinites.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s showed &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; his own death, a tormented Nozdormu from the future was tricked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; into trying to subvert his mortality. The Old Gods' motivation in doing so was an attempt to erase &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from history, so that he would not be able to stop the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Nozdormu (known then as &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, a creature out of time) shattered the timeways and created the infinite dragonflight, jeopardizing the very future of Azeroth by trying to change past events.\nIt is established by dragons such as &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; that the infinites genuinely believed they were doing the right thing. They sought to subvert the timelines to avoid certain fates from befalling the world, uncaring of how this may drastically alter other issues within the timeline. When presented with the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;infinite version of the timeline&lt;/a&gt;, they did not bring about the Hour of Twilight as they were previously speculated to desire. Instead; they brought about a version where the world was 'perfected' with them as the supreme rulers, and having subjugated core allies such as &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; to their ways.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight under the command of Murozond appeared in two of &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; instances, attempting to prevent crucial events in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history from occurring. In &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, they interrupted Thrall's escape by kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;. If Thrall had never escaped from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, he would never have been able to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, free his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; from the internment camps and lead them in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Azeroth would have been destroyed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the infinites attempted to prevent &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from opening the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and allowing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; to invade Azeroth. While this would have prevented many deaths, it would also have caused the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations to never band together to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and thus there would be no one to oppose the Burning Legion years later.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight could be seen fighting the bronze dragons \"through time\" for control of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to the shrine in order to identify the leader of the infinites using a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Hourglass of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of their mission, the hourglass finished its search, revealing the long-lost &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Chronormu stated that this made no sense, then brushed it off and said that she was glad that the Bronze Aspect was alive and well, as he had left without telling the rest of the flight \"where or when\" he was going.\nThe infinites also appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; dungeon, attempting to disrupt the timeline by preventing &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; from purging the city.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Occulus\"&gt;Occulus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the bronze drakes guarding the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, became corrupted and turned into an infinite drake.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Wyrmrest Temple, Nozdormu finally revealed himself to be the creator and leader of the infinite dragonflight to Thrall and the entire bronze dragonflight. He went on to state that in a branching future, he becomes the \"Master\" spoken of by many infinite agents. His absence for a considerable amount of time was due to the investigation of his transformation causing him to become lost in the timelines and unable to return to the present moment due to the manipulations of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. During the Cataclysm, the infinite dragonflight sent to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the only thing capable of stopping &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 from the distant past, Nozdormu and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, a vision of what Azeroth in a distant future if Deathwing wasn't stopped. There, the anomaly preventing Nozdormu from accessing the past is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Nozdormu's corrupted future self. After Murozond was killed by the adventurers, Nozdormu told his mortal allies:\nWar Crimes.\nThe infinite dragonflight made a surprising return during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, provided to &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. They attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; in order to free Garrosh from captivity. After Zaela confirmed that Hellscream and Kairoz escaped, the infinites and their allies pulled back. Despite providing aid in this endeavor and ensuring that Garrosh could escape to , the infinite dragonflight played no role within &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;subsequent events&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Drakeling\"&gt;Infinite Drakeling&lt;/a&gt;s appeared during the fight against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Timecap%27n%20Hooktail\"&gt;Timecap'n Hooktail&lt;/a&gt; appeared within &lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh, the Veiled Market&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the prize of her heist, a relic of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, being stolen by &lt;a href=\"So%27leah\"&gt;So'leah&lt;/a&gt;, Captain Caulle Whiphook turned from her human form into her dragon form. She was then attacked and killed by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; sought to find a disc containing the memories of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; within , as they hoped it could help them reclaim their powers. However before adventurers could retrieve it, the infinite dragon &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; sent the disc into another time. Deios intended to usher in the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;one true aspect&lt;/a&gt;, whose dominion shall be infinite.\n&lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; later attacked the bronze dragons in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of turning Nozdormu into Murozond. Though she failed, Nozdormu sensed that his fate was drawing near.\nAt some point, the infinite dragonflight made a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for taking him to the time of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s demise, and he would act as a distraction to any allies of the bronze dragonflight that sought to stop them. Their plan finally came to pass, as while &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers were focused on stopping Iridikron from acquiring Galakrond's essence, Chrono-Lord Deios did battle with the Proto-Aspects and seemingly corrupted the proto-dragon version of Nozdormu into Murozond. With this single time alteration, the infinite dragonflight changed the history of Azeroth and created a new timeline - where Tyr never died and became a &lt;a href=\"Tyr%2C%20the%20Infinite%20Keeper\"&gt;infinite-corrupt version of himself&lt;/a&gt; that guarded the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Citadel\"&gt;Infinite Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. In order to restore Azeroth's timeline, Chromie, and her allies made their way back into the past and aided the Proto-Aspects in stopping Deios, while Iridikron was able to successfully claim Galakrond's essence.\nIn the aftermath, Nozdormu thanked adventurers for saving him from the fate that he thought was all but inevitable, showing his belief that his transformation into Murozond is no longer an inevitability. However, it is unclear if the rise of Murozond has been completely averted.\nAfter an understanding was reached between Eternus and Nozdormu, Eternus decided to follow Nozdormu as he was and promised that she would speak with the other infinites."}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt;, the infinites allied with the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;primal incarnate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;, for a chance to corrupt the main timeline version of Nozdormu within the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;. While initially successful, heroes alongside &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; managed to undo Deios' victory and return Nozdormu back to his original form; giving the aspect hope that his fate as Murozond can be circumvented and is not pre-destined. While Deios was defeated, some infinites still cling to the hope of Murozond. Others, such as &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt;, have begun to return to their original affiliations with the bronze flight after speaking with Nozdormu.\nCulture.\nWhere bronze dragons exist to keep the time stream inviolate and the order of events progressing as the fates intended, the infinite dragonflight stands against this notion. Believing that the timeways can and should be altered; the infinites pursue a \"perfect\" future, where they rule over all. As the infinites are former bronze dragons, they display great cunning in all things. They differ by stooping to deception and guile, changing the timeways without the mortals ever knowing they were present, as seen with their interference in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Other times, the infinites are more hands on, as seen when they assaulted &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nInversely to the bronze dragonflight, which used many mortal helpers and few lesser dragonkin, the infinite dragonflight uses no mortals in its schemes and has legions of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;. While the bronze dragonflight would begin to make more liberal use of these dragonkin on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the infinites were introduced using legions of them and continue to number high amounts of lesser dragonkin in their ranks. Unlike the bronze flight, they also appear to have some proto-dragons, as seen in the Dawn of the Infinite dungeon.\nThe bronze dragonflight's control over time is a power many would like to abuse; the infinite dragonflight has fought them often for this reason, while the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; tried to take control of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, though they were stopped before.\nNomenclature.\nMembers of the infinite dragonflight sometimes are anagrams of their original names as bronze dragons, such as &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morchie\"&gt;Morchie&lt;/a&gt;. Others seem to either keep their original name and drop the \"dormu/dormi\" and add \"us\" or \"os\".\nMembership.\nThe bronze dragonflight is primarily made up of, as the name implies, bronze dragonkin. These include the bronze dragons themselves, but also bronze-scaled variants of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;. Dracthyr were ultimately recruited into the flight as well from &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt;, with some also joining the Timewalkers.\nMortals serve extensively as part of the bronze dragonflight, almost more than any other. Many dragonsworn have been seen, such as the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28bronze%20dragonflight%29\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, after losing their aspectral powers, one of the main arms of the dragonflight, the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;, reformed into the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;. This group is extensively made up of both dragonkin and mortals, patrolling the timeways to keep them safe.\nThe infinite dragonflight is far more diverse than most denizens of Azeroth know. All castes of this dragonflight, from &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; to fully grown &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; and, oddly, even some juvenile &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt;s have been encountered. The flight tempted many &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; with promises of power, but most found only servitude and despair. The color range of infinite dragons varies from black to dark grey/gunmetal, with an oddly cracked and deteriorating appearance. They are covered with tiny black residual particles and a strange blue light glows through the cracks. Their breath is composed of black sand.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s showed &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; his own death, a tormented Nozdormu from the future was tricked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; into trying to subvert his mortality. The Old Gods' motivation in doing so was an attempt to erase &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from history, so that he would not be able to stop the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Nozdormu (known then as &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, a creature out of time) shattered the timeways and created the infinite dragonflight, jeopardizing the very future of Azeroth by trying to change past events.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight under the command of Murozond appeared in two of &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; instances, attempting to prevent crucial events in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history from occurring. In &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, they interrupted Thrall's escape by kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;. If Thrall had never escaped from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, he would never have been able to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, free his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; from the internment camps and lead them in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Azeroth would have been destroyed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the infinites attempted to prevent &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from opening the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and allowing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; to invade Azeroth. While this would have prevented many deaths, it would also have caused the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations to never band together to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and thus there would be no one to oppose the Burning Legion years later.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight could be seen fighting the bronze dragons \"through time\" for control of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to the shrine in order to identify the leader of the infinites using a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Hourglass of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of their mission, the hourglass finished its search, revealing the long-lost &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Chronormu stated that this made no sense, then brushed it off and said that she was glad that the Bronze Aspect is alive and well, as he had left without telling the rest of the flight \"where or when\" he was going.\nThe infinites also appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; dungeon, attempting to disrupt the timeline by preventing &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; from purging the city.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Occulus\"&gt;Occulus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the bronze drakes guarding the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, became corrupted and turned into an infinite drake.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Wyrmrest Temple, Nozdormu finally revealed himself to be the creator and leader of the infinite dragonflight to Thrall and the entire bronze dragonflight. He went on to state that in a branching future, he becomes the \"Master\" spoken of by many infinite agents. His absence for a considerable amount of time was due to the investigation of his transformation causing him to become lost in the timelines and unable to return to the present moment due to the manipulations of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. During the Cataclysm, the infinite dragonflight sent to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the only thing capable of stopping &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 from the distant past, Nozdormu and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, a vision of Azeroth in a distant future if Deathwing wasn't stopped. There, the anomaly preventing Nozdormu from accessing the past is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Nozdormu's corrupted future self. After Murozond was killed by the adventurers, Nozdormu told his mortal allies:\nWar Crimes.\nThe infinite dragonflight made a surprising return during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, provided to &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. They attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; in order to free Garrosh from captivity. After Zaela confirmed that Hellscream and Kairoz escaped, the infinites and their allies pulled back. Despite providing aid in this endeavor and ensuring that Garrosh could escape to , the infinite dragonflight played no role within &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;subsequent events&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Drakeling\"&gt;Infinite Drakeling&lt;/a&gt;s appeared during the fight against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Timecap%27n%20Hooktail\"&gt;Timecap'n Hooktail&lt;/a&gt; appeared within &lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh, the Veiled Market&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the prize of her heist, a relic of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, being stolen by &lt;a href=\"So%27leah\"&gt;So'leah&lt;/a&gt;, Captain Caulle Whiphook turned from her human form into her dragon form. She was then attacked and killed by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; sought to find a disc containing the memories of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; within , as they hoped it could help them reclaim their powers. However, before adventurers could retrieve it, the infinite dragon &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; sent the disc into another time. Deios intended to usher in the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;one true aspect&lt;/a&gt;, whose dominion shall be infinite.\n&lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; later attacked the bronze dragons in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of turning Nozdormu into Murozond. Though she failed, Nozdormu sensed that his fate was drawing near.\nAt some point, the infinite dragonflight made a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;; in exchange for taking him to the time of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s demise, he would act as a distraction to any allies of the bronze dragonflight that sought to stop them. Their plan finally came to pass, as while &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers were focused on stopping Iridikron from acquiring Galakrond's essence, Chrono-Lord Deios did battle with the Proto-Aspects and seemingly corrupted the proto-dragon version of Nozdormu into Murozond. With this single time alteration, the infinite dragonflight changed the history of Azeroth and created a new timeline - where Tyr never died and became a &lt;a href=\"Tyr%2C%20the%20Infinite%20Keeper\"&gt;infinite-corrupt version of himself&lt;/a&gt; that guarded the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Citadel\"&gt;Infinite Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. In order to restore Azeroth's timeline, Chromie, and her allies made their way back into the past and aided the Proto-Aspects in stopping Deios, while Iridikron was able to successfully claim Galakrond's essence.\nIn the aftermath, Nozdormu thanked adventurers for saving him from the fate that he thought was all but inevitable, showing his belief that his transformation into Murozond is no longer an inevitability. Though it is unclear if the rise of Murozond has been completely averted.\nAfter an understanding was reached between Eternus and Nozdormu, Eternus decided to follow Nozdormu as he was, and promised that she would speak with the other infinites.\nWarlords of Draenor beta.\nVery late in the \"\" beta, an infinite &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Vanguard\"&gt;Infinite Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; was found outside the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Pesterwing\"&gt;Infinite Pesterwing&lt;/a&gt;s could also be found inside and around the caverns. Meanwhile, a time rift like those the infinites have been known to use appeared above the sands of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; between the Caverns of Time and the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Chasm\"&gt;Gaping Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. They were all removed before the final version of the game."}

In this method, the tank picks up all snakes early and does not kill them, so that the switches can be activated in peace.\nDetail:\nBefore the fight begins, the tank will run around in the switch-area picking up all snakes. The tank runs down the stairs, past one switch, behind Anhuur, and back past the other switch. Some method of keeping the tank alive must be devised - without a healer following the tank. (A healer would simply draw aggro and be in too much danger.) A tough tank may be selected, who should be pre-shielded if possible, and use tanking cooldowns while gathering the snakes.\nAfter passing the second switch, the tank should rejoin the group as quickly as possible. Whatever abilities that can help with this should be used, such as: Life Grip (allowing the tank to skip the stairs), Heroic Leap, Intervene, and Darkflight.\nThe tank then goes to Anhuur, aggroing him. The healer may wish to stand on the far side of the tank at this time (opposite the approaching snakes). When the snakes arrive, the tank should perform an AOE attack to reinforce aggro on them. Thereafter, nobody should perform any AOE attacks of any kind, except possibly the tank if aggro on any snakes is lost.\nWhen Anhuur begins his hymn, one DPS will drop down to either side to activate the switches. As soon as it is possible, a player who remained up by Anhuur should interrupt his song.\nIt will be necessary to interrupt Anhuur twice. The snakes should survive the entire time so that the switches can be activated quickly. The healer should use aggro-reduction abilities as needed so that the snakes don't attack; however, it is likely that some snakes will attack the healer anyway - simply heal through these attacks."}

The dash will end once you reach Daryl Riknussun, or the buff is removed, or if time runs out.\nIf you are a level 42 mage and have bought your Portal: Ironforge spell from a portal trainer, simply set up a portal in front of &lt;a href=\"Grady%20Bannson\"&gt;Grady Bannson&lt;/a&gt;'s pet cages and aim yourself at it before clicking on the cask.\nAttacking something or shapeshifting will dispell the buff. As long as you don't make a drastic detour, you should easily get back in time. If you are not familiar with the way back to the city or the layout of Ironforge, it would be best to review your path first. If you wish to experiment with the buff, use Kharanos's buildings or the immediate vicinity to stay close to the cask.\nThe Drugan mentioned in the quest is most likely &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Drugan\"&gt;Prospector Drugan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt;."}

A video of his question subsequently went viral.

Although he did not wish to make his character's name known, he stated that his guild is Carpe Imperium on . He has since moved to . His main character is a &lt;a href=\"gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe posts as \"Insane Guy of Doom\" on &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Scrolls of Lore&lt;/a&gt;, where the administrator created a special rank for him - 'Time-Lost Proto Nerd'. The rank is in reference to a joke link on Cracked.com. On August 15, 2013 he became a writer for &lt;a href=\"BlizzPlanet\"&gt;BlizzPlanet&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzCon 2010.\nBackground.\nThere are some lore issues regarding &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Metzen implied that in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\", Falstad was supposed to be killed, but the book has it so that he survived. This survival was reflected in his inclusion in WoW as an NPC at Aerie Peak.\nFalstad was originally in the \"Cataclysm\" beta as a member of the Council of Three Hammers according to reports, but was replaced by Kurdran in a later build.\nIn \"The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm\", Varian Wrynn suggests (or decrees) that Falstad be the Wildhammer representative on the Council of Three Hammers.\nTranscript.\nThe Red Shirt Guy: Hello. I have- I just finished reading \"The Shattering\" yesterday... and I noticed something. It said that Falstad Wildhammer was going to be on the Council of Three Hammers, but in the beta it's Kurdran Wildhammer, and Falstad is not in the game at all. What happened to him?\nChris Metzen: Isn't Falstad dead? ...from, uh, \"Day of the Dragon\"? ...No?\nThe Red Shirt Guy: No, he survived, and, in fact, he is- was the leader of Aerie Peak in vanilla WoW and through Wrath of the Lich King.\nChris Metzen: Right, of course. Uh. Yeah, Alex, what's up with that?\nAlex Afrasiabi: *Dismissive noise* Thanks, thanks for pointing that out. We're gonna get that fixed.\nThe Red Shirt Guy: Thank you!\nAlex Afrasiabi: You bet.\nBlizzard response.\nOn 30 October, 2010, a screenshot was brought to light featuring Falstad in place of Kurdran on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt;, and standing next to him was a dwarf NPC with a red &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; named \"&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Fact%20Checker\"&gt;Wildhammer Fact Checker&lt;/a&gt;\". At that time, neither NPC could be found in the High Seat in the &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, leading to speculation that the screenshot was fake. Afrasiabi stated that it was \"real\" but some still felt it was an elaborate hoax. The \"Cataclysm\" beta build released on November 3rd contained the two NPCs, confirming the screenshot as legitimate; in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; they both appeared on live servers, removing any doubt.\nOn April 15, 2011, the Council of Three Hammers faction leader story, \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20and%20Iron\"&gt;Fire and Iron&lt;/a&gt;\", was released on the official site. Written from the perspective of Kurdran Wildhammer, the story features a cameo appearance from the Wildhammer Fact Checker and also gave lore-based reasons behind why Kurdran was replaced with Falstad.\nIn 2018, Chris Metzen explained that he did actually know at the time that Falstad was alive, but while on-stage he mixed up Falstad and &lt;a href=\"Molok\"&gt;Molok&lt;/a&gt;\u2014another dwarf character from \"Day of the Dragon\"\u2014in his head.\nBlizzCon 2011.\nBackground.\nThe Red Shirt Guy re-appeared during BlizzCon 2011, deliberately made the first in line at the lore Q&amp;A. Before the Q&amp;A, Metzen hopped off the stage to give him a friendly hug. The Red Shirt Guy thanked them for adding him to the game as the Wildhammer Fact Checker. He asked about the future of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. The Gilneas/worgen storyline has been highly criticized since the release of \"Cataclysm\" due to the sudden stop of the storyline's progression following the starting zone, despite being told many times over that the player would return to Gilneas eventually. The &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; are scarcely seen in \"Cataclysm\", unlike their goblin counterparts who are seen frequently as well as possessing a \"mini-city\" in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of worgen development &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; side continued to be an issue, especially since the story is progressed for Horde only (including the retaking of Gilneas at the end of the Silverpine quest-chain). With all these issues being lamented, the cliffhanger story of Gilneas was commonly asked about.\nTranscript.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Shirt%20Guy\"&gt;Red Shirt Guy&lt;/a&gt;: In Gilneas, the questlines end with the strong feeling of to be continued and that we're going back, and the only other zone in the game that had that same type of ending was &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and we did go back to Hyjal two patches later, so does that mean we're also going back to Gilneas?\n&lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt;: Two patches later, maybe? ...Maybe, back to Gilneas? I don't know. You know, the- the, uh, Gilneans have such cool architecture and such a cool vibe to it, and it's really hard just because of the nature of their story, we can't really incorporate that outside in the rest of the world, it's hard to do. So it'd be fun to go back to Gilneas and really kind of reclaim that. I don't think it's on the cards right away, but its a really, we just love the feel of that area and everything that they're about.\nThe Red Shirt Guy went on to suggest what he thought would be the best use for Gilneas.\nResponses.\nWhile the story's continuation was not shot down, the response has caused mixed reactions, from praise and hope for a continued story, to negative responses claiming delaying or discontinuing a race's storyline is unfair.\nDespite saying that Gilneas would not be revisited anytime soon, patch 4.3 gave players a brief glimpse of the status of the zone during the legendary dagger quest line. The Gilneans shown here are not shown to be Alliance friendly, however this may be due to the fact that the rogues were seen as assassins. The &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt; seemed unaware of their manipulation by a black dragon, and are speculated to have been working with the Alliance in order for Creed to maintain his ruse for both the Gilneans he was making into servants and the Alliance until his army was built up enough and forced into loyalty."}

They ruled from &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;Bladespire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and had numerous villages and settlements.\nThe Bladespire were once part of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and during that time forcefully bred ogres with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to create &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; servants. The mok'nathal rebelled, and working with the Frostwolf and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw clan&lt;/a&gt;s, destroyed Bladespire power in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt;. Since the empire's collapse, they are now ruled by the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"the%20Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;the Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; abandoned their &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; to join the other &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. After that the Bladespire ogres inhabited the Thunderlord Stronghold until the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Doom Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; pushed them out. They are the strongest clan of ogres in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, having the favor of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt;, and his seven sons.\nThe Mok'nathal have managed to push the Bladespire back so that they now hold only a tenuous grip at &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Outpost\"&gt;Bladespire Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, but have other fortifications far from &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20Village\"&gt;Mok'Nathal Village&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Hold\"&gt;Bladespire Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby areas. &lt;a href=\"Gnosh%20Brognat\"&gt;Gnosh Brognat&lt;/a&gt; is leading the outpost.

These ogre clans fight against each other, vying for the dominance that comes with having the favor of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt;. The Bladespire clan is crushing the Bloodmaul, so they needed a new weapon. For that reason &lt;a href=\"T%27chali%20the%20Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;T'chali the Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; tried to make the perfect brew, one that strengthens the Bloodmaul and weakens the Bladespire. &lt;a href=\"Korgaah\"&gt;Korgaah&lt;/a&gt; kicked T'chali in the head so he wants revenge, for that reason he wants vengeance over the whole clan.\nNotes and trivia.\nOnce you are friendly or above with &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;, you can do many emotes while targeting the ogres for amusing results:\nIn addition, if you attack and kill the clan's ogres after becoming king/queen, they will say various phrases upon death.\nThere used to be a Bladespire camp located in western &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "76414", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=76414", "title": "Bladewind clan", "text": "The Bladewind clan was a small &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; that resided in the area between &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Their largest village was located just south of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, later &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nConflict with the draenei.\n99 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the year after the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; repelled an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; attack on their city of Shattrath, the orcish &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival was marked by arguments on how the orcs would respond to the draenei. Some clans wanted to avoid them, others saw them as enemies and some chieftains speculated that the draenei hated fighting and would shrink away from a worthy opponent; the fact that the draenei had taken care to minimize ogre casualties was seen as a weakness. The Kosh'harg ended without a consensus and most clans were content to simply keep their distance. The Bladewind clan took a different approach. Due to inhabiting the area between Terokkar and Nagrand, they knew of the draenei's favorite trade routes and caravan schedules. When a number of caravans went missing on a single day, the draenei leader &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"exarch\"&gt;exarch&lt;/a&gt;s took notice. Among the burning remains of the dead traders were orc corpses wearing Bladewind clan tattoos, and most distressingly, several traders had gone missing, meaning that the orcs had taken prisoners.\nMany draenei wanted to forcefully retaliate, but Velen forbade it. He allowed the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; order to launch covert missions to rescue prisoners, but an offensive campaign would only lead to disaster. The clan was not large and would be relatively easy to defeat, but the orcs were not known to surrender and the conflict would only end once nearly all of the Bladewinds were dead, and it was uncertain how the other orc clans would react. Velen did, however, know that the orcs respected bravery in combat, and future caravans were well guarded by squads of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s openly displaying weapons glimmering with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Any orc raiders who attacked the traders were usually defeated, but sometimes caravans fell and more prisoners were taken. The Rangari managed to save several, but not all of the draenei prisoners. The ones who were not rescued remained in slavery for the rest of their lives, and some bore &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-breed&lt;/a&gt; offspring for their masters. The Bladewinds soon developed a respect for the draenei, and raids only took place on lightly guarded caravans or when the clan was led by a particularly bold or foolish chieftain.\nMassacre of the Bladewind.\nAround 8 years before the First War, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; turned to the Bladewinds to incite conflict between the orcs and the draenei. For decades, tensions had simmered between the largest of the Bladewind villages and their draenei neighbors. When the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits were thrown out of balance, the Bladewinds suffered greatly as their water sources went dry and their wild game died off. Nearly seventy percent of the Bladewinds succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;. The clan was desperate, which made them vulnerable. Gul'dan approached the largest Bladewind village as a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them that the draenei were responsible for the current hardships, assuring the orcs that spilling draenei blood would appease the elements.\nThe orcs all respected the Shadowmoon and the Bladewinds had no reason to question Gul'dan. Eager to change their fortunes, they gathered lightly armed raiding parties and began attacking draenei caravans in greater numbers than ever before, murdering dozens of innocents and taking just as many prisoners. One of these prisoners was &lt;a href=\"Leran\"&gt;Leran&lt;/a&gt;, the sister of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning of this, Maraad and many of the other Vindicators urged the draenei leadership for action, saying that it was time to eliminate the Bladewinds once and for all. Velen, who had received strange visions of a great shadow looming over the orcs and guiding their actions, appealed for calm. He and the exarchs sent Rangari to report on the orcs' activities, and the scouts returned with horrific stories: the Bladewinds were sacrificing their prisoners in gruesome rituals to appease the elements, and only a few prisoners \u2014 among them Leran \u2014 had not yet suffered this fate.\nAt Maraad's urging, the draenei leadership reluctantly agreed to launch an offensive against the orcs. Maraad led a small force of Vindicators and Rangari to storm the Bladewind village, but by the time they arrived Leran and the other captives were already dead. The sight of his sister's body sent Maraad into a rage and he rampaged through the village. The orcs were so desperate to appease the elements that they fought until nearly every single one was dead. Gul'dan watched from a distance as violence engulfed the village and murdered the few survivors before they could flee east towards &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly his version of events would survive: he claimed the draenei had attacked unprovoked and killed men, women, young, and old. Word of the bloodshed spread throughout the clans, and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; appeared to the Shadowmoon leader &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; in his dreams, disguised as his deceased mate &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt;, and told him that the draenei were planning to destroy the orcs. Ner'zhul called for a clan meeting at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, where he told the orcs that the slaughter of the Bladewind was a precursor of the draenei's plans to completely annihilate the orcish race. Shaman from other clans had received similar visions from the ancestors, and at dawn nearly all of the orcs agreed to unite into the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe half-breed &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; hailed from the Bladewind clan, the daughter of a great orc warrior and a female draenei prisoner. After the destruction of the main Bladewind village, she fled into the wilds of Terokkar, traveling east until she came across the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, who recruited her.\nOriginal lore.\nThe Bladewind clan first appeared in \"Rise of the Horde\" where Ner'zhul mentions to Kil'jaeden that some notable voices in the Bladewinds sympathized with Durotan and the Frostwolf clan in his opposition to the war against the draenei. However, when the clan reappeared in \"\", their history was &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ed so the clan regularly attacked the draenei; the survivors of these attacks being kept as slaves and Garona being the product of one of these assaults. The clan is also presented as one of the first orcish clans to take part in the draenei genocide under Gul'dan in contrast to their opposition to it in \"Rise of the Horde.\" The combined result of these changes seems to make the Bladewind clan less sympathetic.\nAs the Bladewind clan was never wiped out here, they were still active during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, where they the fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"Redwalker%20clan\"&gt;Redwalker clan&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; in small skirmishes. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul attempted to rally the clans with the promise of new &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s to escape to and the Bladewinds fell in line with the reforged &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; out of sheer desperation."}

The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; afflicted him with undeath, murdered his family, and destroyed his country. Blarus studied &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;ry to gain personal power, all the while concocting plans to defeat the Scourge. Finally, he realized that only one force ever held control over the Lich King: the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Blarus knew that trafficking with demons was exceedingly dangerous, but could think of no better solution. So, he carefully studied &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magic. Blarus planned to use the Legion to destroy the Lich King \u2014 or at least decimate the Scourge to the point where the forsaken could overcome it.\nEventually, he realized he would need help, so he spread a few rumors that drew a handful of &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s to his side. Unfortunately, these rumors also attracted the attentions of &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; protector. Varimathras' forces raided Blarus' lab, and the warlock and his surviving apprentices fled the city. Blarus and his coven wandered for a time, avoiding forsaken patrols and searching for a new base. During this time, Blarus came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Mael%20Shelub\"&gt;Mael Shelub&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who seemed interested in defeating the Scourge. Mael offered his services to Blarus, who readily accepted. The group settled in &lt;a href=\"Gaval%20Moch\"&gt;Gaval Moch&lt;/a&gt;, a ruined castle in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlarus' continued experiments again drew a dreadlord's attention. This creature was &lt;a href=\"Ganthrifal\"&gt;Ganthrifal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had been skulking about Silverpine since the forsaken took Undercity. Ganthrifal spied on Blarus and concluded that this silly warlock could be useful. The dreadlord pretended to be called by one of Blarus' spells and assisted the forsaken in his studies. With Ganthrifal's help, Blarus called a few other demons, and his acolytes made great strides in their magical studies. Ganthrifal fed Blarus' delusions, and the warlock believed he controlled the demon. Things were going well, until some &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the castle and were driven off to village of &lt;a href=\"Deadhollow\"&gt;Deadhollow&lt;/a&gt;. The ogres wanted to use the village as a base, since Blarus' forces denied them Gaval Moch.\nGanthrifal's disobedience also made Blarus doubt the loyalties of the demons the dreadlord helped him summon, and he kept a wary eye on those beings. Blarus always has a few anti-demon spells (protection from evil, hooks of binding and the like) prepared just in case.\nA group of adventurers invaded Gavel Moch, after the ogres attacked Deadhollow, in order to stop Blarus and his allies plans. After they made it to his room, Blarus was nervous and edgy. He did not think to parley with strangers, though when they initiated a discussion he willingly took part. Blarus is not evil \u2014 he is simply trying to do what he thinks best to destroy a powerful enemy. The heroes were able to draw out his entire story. What the heroes decided to do with this information is unknown. However, combat occurred, and during the battle he was injured, Blarus uses his scroll of greater teleport to escape. Apparently the heroes convinced Blarus of his error, and later he asked them to assist him in overthrowing the Lich King by other means."}

Conjuring dark spells of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; horror upon their terrified foes, these death knights sought to unleash their wrath upon any foolish enough to stand in their way.\nIn the RPG.\nThere are also several &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s named blasphemy used by various &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s and individuals:"}

The lands around the former Dark Portal are burnt and dead, forever warped by the powers that followed its destruction. Lightning strikes are constant, and the inhospitable land is home to groups of especially vicious and powerful creatures. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was built after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 following the destruction of the first Dark Portal \u2014 at the behest of Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that there would be no further invasions from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn uneasy peace followed for two years, until the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; reopened the Dark Portal and invaded Azeroth again. They besieged Nethergarde Keep. The Alliance eventually managed to send &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;an expedition&lt;/a&gt; through the Dark Portal, but even after that, battles still raged for the control of the Azerothian side of the Portal for months, with the two sides repeatedly winning and losing control of it.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the colossal &lt;a href=\"Ered%27ruin\"&gt;Ered'ruin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; led many of the remaining Legion forces on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, and ordered his most fearsome lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; to secure the land.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAs if the orcish Horde weren't enough, &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; also came through the Dark Portal but unlike the orcs, they remained in the Blasted Lands.

The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; built a small camp not far from the Tainted Forest in search of demonic artifacts hidden in the region.\nThe conflict between the Alliance and Horde raged in the northern part of the region for a time, focused mainly on the Nethergarde's supply base located between &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The Burning Legion forces were thrown into disarray after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Loramus%20Thalipedes\"&gt;Loramus Thalipedes&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;brave soul&lt;/a&gt; who accompanied him.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe next years have brought yet another danger towards Azeroth's very doorstep when the history itself came full circle. Kairozdormu brought Garrosh to the past in of an where the deposed Warchief instigated the transformation of the Orcish Horde into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Now he's used their own to bridge the parallel Draenor with Azeroth-prime, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; vanguard force of the Iron Horde to come through the Dark Portal and occupy the land along with the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres. By bridging between the two realities, the Dark portal turned into red. The Iron horde captured &lt;a href=\"Okril%27lon%20Hold\"&gt;Okril'lon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;initial stages&lt;/a&gt; of their invasion.\nGeography.\nThis desolate and barren land has very little in the way of flora and fauna (the only exception is the Tainted Forest) barring the demons which now wander the plains. The region is particularly notable as of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; that leads to , (formerly leading to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe wretched land hosts few inhabitants and some important small settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Surwich\"&gt;Surwich&lt;/a&gt;. Magic that leaked through the Dark Portal warped the Blasted Lands, leaving an infertile desert landscape. Hardy desert species like basilisks, scorpions and hyenas have since colonized the area. The red rocks of the region do not come by their color naturally. The original tan color was transmuted into the unearthly crimson by searing heat and chaotic energies when the Dark Portal was destroyed. \nThere is but one usable road in the Blasted Lands, guarded at the north by Nethergarde Keep\u2019s grim mages. They have the unenviable task of watching the Dark Portal, guarding the rest of the continent against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the south and protecting themselves from the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; tribes that roam the desert.\nThe weather here is dry and hot during the day and bitterly cold at night. Mountains block any moisture that may come from the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and the only signs of life can be found within the Tainted Forest on the southwest, but it was corrupted by demonic powers that have taken hold over the mastermind behind the revitalization of the scorched scar, the Gilnean druid &lt;a href=\"Marl%20Wormthorn\"&gt;Marl Wormthorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in this zone.\nMaps and subregions.\nNote: Some of the subzones in the Blasted Lands were changed during the pre-patch for '. For players wishing to see the Blasted Lands as it was after ' but before the WoD pre-patch, you can visit an NPC called &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; next to the road at the border between the Blasted Lands and the Swamp of Sorrows.\nDig sites.\nBlasted Lands has two &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.\nAccording to the name, description, and tileset of a PvP map, there is a part of the Barrens that is also called \"Blasted Lands\", maybe by relation with &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, similarly to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; area.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Blasted Lands bear that name for a reason: they were twisted by the magic that brought the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; into being, spewing the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the wretched land hosts few inhabitants and no significant settlements. There is but one usable road in the Blasted Lands, guarded at the north by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and its grim &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. They have the unenviable task of watching the Dark Portal, guarding the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the south and protecting themselves from the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; tribes that roam the desert.\nHistory.\nThis foul desert was once a fen of marshlands called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; built the Dark Portal to connect Azeroth to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs poured through and began the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wars\"&gt;great wars&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs' &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was so strong it consumed the swampland and left dry red clay. When the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Dark Portal, the spread of the taint stopped, but the Blasted Lands still cannot heal themselves.\nAs if the Horde was not enough at that time, &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s also came through the Dark Portal. Unlike the orcs, they remained in the Blasted Lands. The mages of Nethergarde believe the ogres serve the demon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;. Whoever their master is, he orders them to attack the Alliance's keep on an uncomfortably regular basis.\nAt some point the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt, and it yet resonates with an evil thrum. Now it connects to the remains of Draenor, the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day the whole of Nethergarde Keep was struck by a mysterious illness, and the Dreadmaul ogres took the opportunity to attack. With sickness inside and a siege outside, the mages and warriors send messengers to retrieve anyone capable of wielding a sword or healing sickness.\nGeography.\nMagic that leaked through the Dark Portal warped the Blasted Lands, leaving an infertile desert landscape. This region does not welcome life of any form. The weather here is dry and hot during the day and bitterly cold at night. Mountains block any moisture that may come from the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and no rivers grace this land. The eastern coast will occasionally get storms from the sea, but these downpours come so quickly the water merely runs off the packed earth and back into the sea.\nThe Blasted Lands have the Alliance powers guarding the north, the demon infestation in the south, and ogre tribes in the middle."}

The eastern coast will occasionally get storms from the sea, but these downpours come so quickly the water merely runs off the packed earth and back into the sea.\nThe keepers of Nethergarde have an uptight and uncheerful disposition that seems appropriate in light of the danger they face daily. The &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; fight every day with the ogre magi and demons that threaten either to destroy the keep or take over the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. This tightly knit community experiences little crime, however. Those found breaking the agreements they take on when accepting a post at the Keep are sent for a time to the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. These mages cannot afford any dissension in the ranks. If you must visit the Blasted Lands, remember that the Nethergarde mages are the only hospitable people in the entire region for Alliance. And they\u2019re not even that hospitable.\nHistory.\nThis foul desert was once a dark fen of marshlands called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;; a sort of sub-region of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. This is the area where the &lt;a href=\"orcish\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; first entered Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, followed soon by their attack on the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; lands to the northwest. The lands around the former Dark Portal are burnt and dead, forever warped by the powers that followed its destruction. Lightning strikes are constant, and the inhospitable land is home to groups of especially vicious and powerful creatures. A sizable remnant of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has taken refuge within the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;. It is still watched over by the wizards of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; within the Fortress of Nethergarde, established by the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; after the second war. The unique and dangerous opportunities presented in such a harsh landscape has also attracted the notice of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs if the Horde weren\u2019t enough, &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; also came through the Dark Portal. Unlike the orcs, they remained in the Blasted Lands. Nethergarde\u2019s mages tell that the ogres serve Lord &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;. Whoever their master is, he orders them to attack the Alliance\u2019s keep on an uncomfortably regular basis.\nThe Blasted Lands were once littered with gold mines, and heavily populated with &lt;a href=\"centaur%20%28Eastern%20Kingdoms%29\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThis desolate and barren land has very little in the way of flora and fauna, barring the demons which now wander the plains. The region is particularly notable because the Dark Portal leading into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nThere are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in this zone, though several &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nNotable characters.\nThe Blasted Lands are home to several characters of note. At &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thadius%20Grimshade\"&gt;Thadius Grimshade&lt;/a&gt; aids adventurers in locating a special gryphon. Further west, near Dreadmaul Hold, &lt;a href=\"Bloodmage%20Drazial\"&gt;Bloodmage Drazial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmage%20Lynnore\"&gt;Bloodmage Lynnore&lt;/a&gt; attempt to capture the essence of strength, power and wisdom from the local beasts and turn them into special elixirs. And deep inside the Tainted Scar, &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio the Decrepit&lt;/a&gt; sends highly seasoned warlocks into the darkest, most demonic parts of the world in search of mystical items.\nQuests.\nThere are three main quest \"chains\" in the Blasted Lands: The potions quests, the Kum'isha quests, and the &lt;a href=\"You%20Are%20Rakh%27likh%2C%20Demon%20quest%20chain\"&gt;You Are Rakh'likh, Demon quest chain&lt;/a&gt;.\nKum'isha quests.\nThese quests are obtained from Kum'Isha The Collector, level 60 in the Middle of Blasted Lands. He has two quests, one that requires you to find a random Green Item called &lt;a href=\"Imperfect%20Draenethyst%20Fragment\"&gt;Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment&lt;/a&gt; and one that requires you to find a random Blue Item called &lt;a href=\"Flawless%20Draenethyst%20Sphere\"&gt;Flawless Draenethyst Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, which is even rarer, and has about 0.2% chance to drop. Any mob in the Blasted Lands can drop both of these items, but the best source for the sphere is &lt;a href=\"Teremus\"&gt;Teremus The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, a dragon that can be 5 manned. It drops it 75% chance and usually about 2-3 spheres. Each of these spheres give a Level 40-50 Superior/Rare Item, or if you are very lucky, an Epic Item. The Imperfect Fragments only give random Level 40-50 Uncommon Items.\nWarcraft III.\nThese barrens are littered with &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s and populated by &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s. The tileset is called \"Barrens\"."}
