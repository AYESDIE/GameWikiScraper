Its power and ferocity embody the uncontrollable fury of the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;. Those who undergo the transformation thus tend to lose their minds to the form's feral animal instincts. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself had experimented with the form long ago and, consumed by its rage, went as far as blindly attacking his mentor, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The demigod had to put him to sleep within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt;, where he regained his senses. Due to its uncontrollable nature, Malfurion thereafter prohibited the use of this form.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; were druids who disobeyed Malfurion's edict, as they initially sought to tame the wolf form with the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually lost themselves to the wolf form. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; would become their leader and through his efforts to control and master this untameable form, created the first &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; by the Scythe. Despite their good intentions, the worgen were still unable to control the form's unbridled fury and turned against the night elves. Malfurion was forced to banish the worgen to sleep eternally within Daral'nir in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, mourning the loss of his fellow druids.\nSpeculation.\nPack form might still be used, but still banned by Malfurion, and thus only used outside the Cenarion Circle. \nThere may be druids trapped in Pack Form to this day. In \"Curse of the Worgen issue 1\", Malfurion says the kaldorei have lost druids to the Pack Form, never to be seen again. In issue 2, he says some druids have been trapped in the Pack Form, and not even the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; has been able to pacify them. For example, druids that left for the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Wilds\"&gt;Verdant Wilds&lt;/a&gt; lost themselves to their animal forms, and drop &lt;a href=\"Druidic%20Fur%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Druidic Fur&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although clever and willing to form alliances with others, he doesn't hesitate to use violence, brutality, and desperate measures to get what he wants. When he witnessed &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to retreat from Silverpine, he was no longer impressed with him, but he still assisted the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. He considers the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; his blood enemies.\nBiography.\nPrior to the outbreak of the worgen in Silverpine Forest, Ivar worked with &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; to an unknown capacity. He blamed Crowley and Greymane for abandoning and leaving his people to die beyond the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. He also blamed Greymane for, what he perceived, as making Crowley soft. On the outside of the battles in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; witnessed Ivar make an alliance with Lord &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, he and Crowley launched a mass of sneak attacks and ambushes on the forces of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, at one point even killing part of her elite guard and almost killing the Horde character along with them. He also came with Darius to Fenris Isle to convert the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%20Leadership\"&gt;Refugee Leadership&lt;/a&gt; to worgen. When Sylvanas captured &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and used her as a bargaining chip with Darius, Ivar was shocked at his immediate retreat and surrender, going so far as to call him a miserable bastard before leading his pack back into the contested &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Following the retreat, he was very close to being a feral worgen.\nHe was later seen working with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike forces&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Apocalypse\"&gt;Stormpike Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; Ivar was also encountered in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; where he directed his Bloodfang pack and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers in hunting the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champions defeated &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Hayward\"&gt;Deathstalker Hayward&lt;/a&gt;, the pack led by Ivar claimed &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to distract the Bloodfang forces, encountering Ivar, so that evacuations from &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; could continue across the Lake.\nAfter this, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; with some of his pack, aiding &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; once again as they fight the Forsaken alongside the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; embarked on their journey to explore Azeroth as well as catalog the locations of various artifacts, they visited Silverpine Forest.\nShaw noted his main contact in the area as Ivar Bloodfang, stating that the packleader was his contact within Shadowfang Keep. The pack has apparently claimed it, alongside Fenris Isle, and has taken most of the artifacts within the Shadowfang to Fenris Keep to be guarded closely.\nQuotes.\nIn Shadowfang Keep.\nThe Bloodfang will prevail.\nIn Darkshore.\nThe Bloodfang will hunt the Forsaken to extinction."}

It is an 8 sec &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; which reduces all damage taken by 40%. It can be cast while stunned.\nStrategy.\nAlthough a powerful tool, like many of the Discipline priest's abilities, Pain Suppression's strength lies in preventing damage. Timing and anticipation of incoming damage is therefore key to making the most of it. Pain Suppression is best used just before the target takes a large amount of damage; since it is not on the global cooldown, priests can pop this then focus on shielding and healing the target. When used in this way, priests can allow their targets to survive an otherwise overwhelming onslaught. Since it has only an 8-second duration, waiting until the right moment to cast it is critical.\nPain Suppression really shines in a &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; situation. No one likes to have their enemies healed, so healers are often \"target #1\" and focused on by many enemies at once, especially in arenas. A common strategy for an opposing group is to all simultaneously blow their most powerful cooldowns and spells on the enemy's healer. To avoid being instantly knocked out of the game, a priest can pop this spell in an attempt to survive the onslaught. If used with any combination of &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, , or &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;, and heals; it is possible to survive an otherwise hopeless situation. Hopefully, while the priest was the focus, his enemies will have been destroyed or fairly weakened by teammates."}

She rarely left her lady's side, except when Jaina sent her on a mission. She was also in charge of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;'s spy network and proved to be a formidable opponent being able to go toe to toe with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's&lt;/a&gt; personal bodyguard.\nHistory.\nShe accompanied Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tervosh\"&gt;Archmage Tervosh&lt;/a&gt; to capture &lt;a href=\"Private%20Hendel\"&gt;Private Hendel&lt;/a&gt; in Dustwallow.\nPained was a bodyguard assigned to Jaina by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. She remained with Jaina afterwards, saying that she had never officially been relieved of her duty.\nIn a conversation between Tyrande and Tervosh, she was mentioned to have had a traumatic encounter with dark magi which left a physical scar as well as mental scars. Despite the traumatic event, she stoically continued to do Lady Proudmoore's will and stubbornly refused to accept any help. Tyrande appeared to understand Pained's motivation or need to not return to her people, and thus never recalled her.\nWhen Jaina received an apprentice in the form of &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt;, the gnome and night elf became friends soon afterward. Some time after the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would come to Theramore in order to secure aid in looking for the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; which was stolen from his flight. Upon receiving the news, Pained was quick to depart to the field in order to personally discover any information, noting that while her spies were diligent they might not understand what exactly they needed to be looking for. While searching, Pained learned that the Horde was gathering from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; to launch an attack upon &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;; she relayed the news to Jaina through &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wymor\"&gt;Captain Wymor&lt;/a&gt;. Pained continued to advise Lady Jaina along with Archmage Tervosh.\nWhen the armies of the Alliance and members of the Kirin Tor arrived to defend Theramore against the Horde, Pained helped them get used to the layout of the City and introduced them to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Garran%20Vimes\"&gt;Captain Garran Vimes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Evencane\"&gt;Captain Evencane&lt;/a&gt;. When word reached them that the Horde was on the move, Pained lead an ambush against the Horde forces attacking the West Gate of Theramore. Pained personally fought &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, but was signaled to retreat before the fight could be ended. She returned to Jaina and noticed her about the fight and the fact that a Blackrock orc was among the Horde and was more than eager to continue defending Theramore.\nPained accompanied Jaina to the north gate and discovered the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; weakening the gate instead of empowering it; Pained knocked him out and sent him to Captain Evancane for interrogation. The north gate fell soon afterward and Pained quickly joined in the battle that followed, surviving melee combat with both &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the battle was won, Pained perished when Garrosh Hellscream detonated an enormous &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; empowered by the Focusing Iris, destroying the city. Her corpse was saturated with so much magic immediately afterward that when Jaina touched stray strands of her hair, they shattered like glass.\nIn the RPG.\nThe scary night elf girl with a big hammer is briefly mentioned as being one of the Jaina's assistants. In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", however, she didn't use a hammer but a sword.\nSpeculation.\nShe was very likely a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;."}

Whether with massive shields or crushing two-handed weapons, Paladins are able to keep claws and swords from their weaker fellows \u2013 or they use healing magic to ensure that they remain on their feet.\nStalwart paladins are trained to use the heaviest armor and shields, and can utilize their skill to ensure that enemies focus on them, defending weaker members of their group. Their potent healing abilities ensure that their allies remain in fighting shape and can be &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrected&lt;/a&gt;, while they charge their weapons with holy might, allowing them to deal additional damage with their strikes.

Where a Holy Priest serves as voice of the Light, preaching to the downtrodden and disillusioned, the Paladin serves as hand of the Light, defending the faithful and enforcing divine law like a righteous hammer.\"\nGame guide.\n\"This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead.\" \nCreation screen description.\nClassic\n\"Paladins do battle to protect the world from the forces of shadow. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the Light to heal wounds, create shields of force, and incinerate evil creatures. Although paladins were once exclusively human, a number of stout-hearted dwarves have recently been welcomed into the Order of the Silver Hand.\"\nThe Burning Crusade\n\"Paladins are champions who call upon the Light to heal wounds and combat evil. The draenei employed such holy warriors for millennia before arriving on Azeroth to find like-minded souls among the Alliance. Recently blood elves, too, began wielding paladin abilities. Yet these elves, having little in common with their counterparts, must bend the Light to their will. \"\nClassic guide.\n\"Limited to the Alliance, Paladins are bastions of divine light, meting out justice with magic and might.\"\nBackground.\nThe first paladins may have been &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, who were introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; after fleeing their home planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, and through a ritual during which they infused themselves with the Holy Light, they became &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; and waged war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nFounded during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins were a holy order of warriors whose purpose was to defend and shepherd the war-torn populace of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; had perceived that the pious &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, who had suffered such terrible attrition in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, were ill-suited for the dangers of combat. Along with many of the surviving Clerics of Northshire, he sought those of only the greatest virtue among the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;knighthood&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron and tutored them in the ways of magic. Led by the crusading &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, it now rested upon the new paladins - christened the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; - to heal the wounds sustained in combat and to restore faith in the promise of freedom from &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish tyranny.\nPaladins were also known to minister to the masses during the war, gathering inside &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es to deepen their faith. Through meditating, communing and tithing at these sanctified sites, they discovered new ways to channel their healing and spiritual powers.\nAfter the war, the members of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, a secret order sworn to protect the tomb in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, followed the path of the Silver Hand and learned how to wield the Light to become mighty paladins.\nThird War.\nAlthough the paladins were once loved and revered throughout the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, they had since fallen into hard times. The entire &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was disbanded for &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;refusing to kill innocent townsfolk&lt;/a&gt; who were believed to be contaminated by the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Undead plague&lt;/a&gt;. Disenfranchised and driven from their former homes, the paladins still worked selflessly to protect &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity from the gnawing jaws of evil. Empowered by the Light, these mighty warriors brandish both their warhammers and holy fire in the battle against all who would trample the meek and innocent.\nMany paladins traveled to quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the plague-ridden colonies, but although the paladins were immune to &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; of any kind, they were persecuted by the general populace who believed that they had been infected by the foul plague. Some of these paladins traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt;, embittered by the trials they had to suffer through, they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty, and they accepted to become &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to his service.\nAfter the war, the paladins who remained in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; continued to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; evolved from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the eradication of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. However, there were those who believed that the zealous and fanatic Crusade had fallen from their once-noble purpose, and left to form their own order, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the humans of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; trained their own paladins as members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. A few years later, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; restored the original Order of the Silver Hand in Lordaeron, which later merged with the Argent Dawn to form the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Order of the Silver Hand was formally reestablished and supported by each major paladin order on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt; is an order of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; paladins and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s based in the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, they serve as the primary military and police force of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" draenei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; are an order of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; paladins formed by sapping Light energy from the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, once the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was restored in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat the Blood Knights channel their holy powers through it.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; are an order of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; paladins, who recently learned to use the power of &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;, to wield the Light, much as druids use the power of the moon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; deployed its own &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; zealots.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt; paladins who worship the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;. Some joined &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari%23Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, but most stayed in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; serving the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCode of conduct.\nLike &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who serve the Light, paladins are devout in their faith. To serve as an instrument of the Light is to hold an unshakable faith. After spending much of their lives in hallowed halls studying divine doctrine, those who pledge themselves to a holy order become beacons of the Light for their allies in conflict, taking up the heavy armor and weaponry of justice. Stalwart and steadfast, these protectors are ardent defenders of the Light and all that it touches, and are rejuvenated by its radiance in return. So dedicated they are to their cause that they consecrate the very ground upon which they battle corruption. Holding the unwavering belief that any battle waged to eradicate evil in the world is righteous, these paladins stand on the frontlines in service to all others dedicated to the cause. The truth and virtue of the Light imbue these sacred knights with the power to revitalize their comrades. If necessary, they even lay down their own lives to serve as a martyr for the greater good. Oftentimes the most dedicated paladins become fanatical in their devotion, instruments of retribution against those who dare defy the laws of the divine. These vengeful guardians of the weak are crusaders judging and punishing the wicked. Their resolute conviction in the divine order of all things assures them that victory is inevitable\u2014but they will fight to the end to ensure that the Light prevails.\nAs \"warriors of the Holy Light\", they uphold all that is good and true in the world and revile all that is evil and sinister. They are the embodiment of good and selfless dedication to the protection of their peoples, and offer assistance to the beleaguered while smite their enemies with holy fervor. Found in almost every corner of Azeroth fighting the forces of evil and barbarism, these stalwart, zealous warriors ceaselessly maintain their vigil. Some paladins are known to fight with the ferocity of &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, but their creed calls for them to temper their rage with patience, to make compassion a greater strength than their force of arms.\nNot all wielders of the Light follow the same path. For example, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; follow the path and faith of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; revere the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, whose power can appear either as red flames or as golden magic similar to other divine magic. Among the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; embraced the renewed &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and through it they ask for the Light's blessing to wield their holy powers. It is a harmonious relationship, no longer one of discord caused by the blood elves' attempts to bend the Light to their will by draining the energy of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, which will likely have a positive effect on blood elf society in the long run. In the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; once received their holy powers from the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; of Kings &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, but since his death, it is their faith in his ideals that give them their powers, in order to stand as a beacon of light against the darkness.\nPaladins don't always have to work within good or neutral organizations, as seen by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of paladins and priests who broke away from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, took their commitment to eradicating the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; so far that they turned on their former allies, suspecting anyone whom they believed carried the \"taint\" of the undeath. However, they do have to believe they are working for good organizations or have faith that their cause is good and just. As long as they believe their cause to be just, the Light will continue to serve them because wielding the Light is a matter of willpower and faith in one's own ability to do it. Since he felt conflicted, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to use the Light began to wane after he &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;culled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. He perceived this as the Light choosing to abandon him, which weakened his faith in it further.\nSimilarly, the connection with the Light cannot be forcibly stripped from a paladin that personally conducts himself in an honorable manner. When &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; defended the orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; from his fellow humans, he was &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; after a ceremony was performed by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; to strip him of his light-given powers. Even if the ceremony succeeded, as he lost the blessings and holy powers he had obtained during his ceremony of initiation, he managed to reconnect with the Light through his desperate will to save and heal an injured Eitrigg, and used the Light even after that in the years and wars to come.\nIn his &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20the%20Shadowlands%20and%20Beyond\"&gt;grimoire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the paladins of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Light-Bearers\"&gt;Light-Bearers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fanlin%27Deskor\"&gt;Fanlin'Deskor&lt;/a&gt;, were an example of mortals who dedicated themselves to service and duty in life and whose &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s were consequently sent to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; after death.\nRaces.\nThe paladin class can be played by the following races:\nRacial mounts.\nEach paladin order has a different mount.\nSpecializations.\nHoly.\n Invokes the power of the Light to protect and to heal. \nHoly paladins have devoted themselves to healing, with powerful specializations including &lt;a href=\"Beacon%20of%20Light\"&gt;Beacon of Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Light of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. With their plate armor, Holy paladins are some of the toughest healers in the game. They are most powerful when close to their allies, due to their . When they need to deal damage, they have access to both ranged and melee Holy attacks like &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Like priests who serve the Light, holy paladins are devout in their faith. After spending much of their lives in hallowed halls studying divine doctrine, those who pledge themselves to a holy order become beacons of the Light for their allies in conflict, taking up the heavy armor and weaponry of justice. Holding the unwavering belief that any battle waged to eradicate evil in the world is righteous, these paladins stands on the frontlines in service to all others dedicated to the cause. The truth and virtue of the Light imbue these sacred knights with the power to revitalize their comrades. If necessary, they even lay down their own lives to serve as a martyr for the greater good.\"\nProtection.\n Uses Holy magic to shield &lt;himself/herself&gt; and defend allies from attackers. \nThrough the Protection spec, paladins gain an increased ability to tank enemies. Paladins are especially well known for their ability to tank many enemies at once with rapid threat production. Strong stamina scaling, simple and very high threat generation and the superb &lt;a href=\"Ardent%20Defender\"&gt;Ardent Defender&lt;/a&gt; ability make paladins powerful tanks. With plate armor, shields and an array of powerful self-healing and defensive options, Protection paladins are often hard to defeat even without a healer by their side.\n\"The paladin\u2019s tools of war lay bare their motivations. Clenched in one hand is the weapon, a deadly device for exacting righteous judgment. Locked in the other hand is the shield, a symbolic and literal barrier protecting good from evil. Stalwart and steadfast, these protectors are ardent defenders of the Light and all that it touches, and are rejuvenated by its radiance in return. So dedicated they are to their cause that they consecrate the very ground upon which they battle corruption.\"\nRetribution.\n A righteous crusader who judges and punishes opponents with weapons and Holy magic.\nRetribution paladins favor slow two handed weapons, causing sudden damage spikes through both melee and spell crits. They favor single-target attacks like &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Blade of Justice&lt;/a&gt; to build Holy Power, powering regular use of &lt;a href=\"Templar%27s%20Verdict\"&gt;Templar's Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Storm\"&gt;Divine Storm&lt;/a&gt; for AoE. In PvP, Retribution paladins can be very effective off-healers, but have poor mobility. Retribution paladins can use powerful augments like &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Wrath\"&gt;Avenging Wrath&lt;/a&gt; to buff their damage output.\n\"To serve as instrument of the Light is to hold an unshakable faith. Oftentimes the most dedicated paladins become fanatical in their devotion, instruments of retribution against those who dare defy the laws of the divine. These paladins are vengeful guardians of the weak\u2014crusaders judging and punishing the wicked. Their resolute conviction in the divine order of all things assures them that victory is inevitable\u2014but they will fight to the end to ensure that the Light prevails.\"\nHoly Power.\nIn addition to the &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, paladins have a unique &lt;a href=\"resource%20system\"&gt;resource system&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"combo%20point\"&gt;combo point&lt;/a&gt;s, Holy Power can be gained through certain spell and talents, such as &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Blade of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, and is used for casting other spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Templar%27s%20Verdict\"&gt;Templar's Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Storm\"&gt;Divine Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Up to 5 Holy Power can be stored, and does not decay until 30 seconds out of combat.\nGear.\nPaladins can wear &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; armor and may use a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. They can use &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"main-hand\"&gt;main-hand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;s. \nPaladins cannot &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;, or wield &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;. They also cannot use &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nThey can summon their own &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Warhorse\"&gt;Warhorse&lt;/a&gt; at level 10 and automatically learn the &lt;a href=\"Apprentice\"&gt;Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Riding&lt;/a&gt; skill. At level 17 they can summon their epic &lt;a href=\"Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt;, however, it does not give the benefit of 100% movement speed boost until Journeyman Riding is learned.\nLore-wise, paladins are often depicted wielding large two-handed warhammers. The \"paladin hammer\", in addition to the &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;book of incantations&lt;/a&gt; paladins often carry, is perhaps the most characteristic feature of a paladin. Some hammers are even known to have names, such as &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer%23Equipment\"&gt;Hammer of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Draenei paladins also tend to prefer their own two-handed hammers, a Light-blessed crystalline weapon known as the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Hammer of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;. Blood elf paladins seem to prefer &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;s instead.\nAbilities.\nPaladins stand directly in front of their enemies, relying on heavy armor and healing in order to survive incoming attacks. Whether with massive shields or crushing two-handed weapons, paladins are able to keep claws and swords from their weaker fellows \u2013 or they use healing magic to ensure that they remain on their feet.\n\"Paladin talents increase their ability to heal the wounded, strengthen their capacity to protect their companions, and allow them to deal out vicious damage in the name of justice.\"\nThey have several anti-undead and demon abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Sense%20Undead\"&gt;Sense Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wake%20of%20Ashes\"&gt;Wake of Ashes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Evil\"&gt;Turn Evil&lt;/a&gt; which make them very effective when fighting &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; targets (not including &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; players, who are considered Humanoids for balance reasons).\nBlessings.\nBlessings are spell buffs that can be cast on party and raid members. Blessings are derived from previous Hands, and include &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Blessing of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Blessing of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAuras.\nAuras are spell buffs that can boost the abilities of the party and raid members with passive effects, but only within a certain radius of effect around the paladin. They can be changed at any time, but with only one aura active at a time. Since , all paladin specializations once again have access to auras, among them &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20Aura\"&gt;Devotion Aura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Aura\"&gt;Retribution Aura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concentration%20Aura\"&gt;Concentration Aura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Aura\"&gt;Crusader Aura&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealing.\nAll paladin specializations have access to spells like &lt;a href=\"Flash%20of%20Light\"&gt;Flash of Light&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt; to instantly heal themselves or an ally for the paladin's maximum health, and &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect an ally back from death. Holy Paladins also have &lt;a href=\"Absolution\"&gt;Absolution&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect all dead allies, and &lt;a href=\"Cleanse\"&gt;Cleanse&lt;/a&gt; to remove all poison, disease, and magic effects from them or an ally.\nCrowd control.\nPaladins have regular access to &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;spell interruption&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Rebuke\"&gt;Rebuke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, as well as talents including &lt;a href=\"Repentance\"&gt;Repentance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blinding%20Light\"&gt;Blinding Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nPaladin stats vary by role. Secondary stats can be optionally obtained after primary stats have been met.\nIn the RPG.\nA paladin must be good and will lose all Light-given abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, the paladin's code requires that he respects legitimate authority, acts with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison and so forth), helps those in need (provided they do not use their help for evil or chaotic ends), and punishes those who harm or threaten innocents. While he may adventure with others from different organizations, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil persons, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers or cohorts whose intentions are good. A paladin who violates this code becomes an &lt;a href=\"ex-paladin\"&gt;ex-paladin&lt;/a&gt;, and loses all Light-given abilities until he atones for his violations.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, most paladins are a terrific aid in the war \u2014 skilled in combat, riding, and even doing a bit of healing here and there \u2014 \"Except those damn \"Retribution Paladins\" \u2014 most of 'em can't heal worth a damn\".\nEpic paladin.\nThe epic paladin warrior shines as a burning fire, a living embodiment of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, banishing the &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; corruption. He stands as a legendary symbol among the good races and champions his party's holy cause. Demons and liches loathe and plot against him, while the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders shower him with laurels and praise. He focuses on increasing his offensive and defensive capabilities. He finds that Commander feats are also appropriate. He does not neglect the fact that he is a living monument of righteousness; his reputation often precedes him, and rare is the individual who will not offer aid based solely on his cause and power. He increases his charisma primarily, with a few boosts to strength and constitution to improve his combat potential.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He was among the nerubians slaughtered in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; and later raised by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding. When the Lich King began losing his powers, Anub'arak assisted &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in reaching &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. For years, the undead nerubian continued carrying out his master's will in the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of his former kingdom until he was slain by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. He was later raised once more and relocated to the caverns below &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to plague the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, but the so-called traitor king met his final end at the hands of adventurers partaking in the tournament.\nBiography.\nDeath and undeath.\nAnub'arak was the king of the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27Rekhan\"&gt;Anub'Rekhan&lt;/a&gt; was his most loyal commander.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; pitted the nerubians against the Lich King's forces, with any attempts to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; being ruthlessly snuffed out by Anub'arak. Seeing no way to subvert their defenses the Lich King settled on smashing the nerubians into rubble. Despite the strength and cunning of the nerubian army, the Lich King's minions were endless. When the time came the Lich King was delighted to raise Anub'arak himself into a powerful undead minion. The former ruler was now a slave, and though he chafed at his leash, he could not free himself from it.\nAs an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak crushed anything that posed a resistance to the Lich King's will and slaughtered many of his people. Anub'arak led the undead as they conquered the nerubian &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;s and repurposed them for the Lich King's designs. For this, the living nerubians began to refer to him as the traitor king and lay the destruction of their kingdom at his feet.\nSome time before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak escorted &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, and Kel'Thuzad referred to him as a majordomo.\nRace to Icecrown.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak was sent to meet &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; when he arrived in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Anub'arak saved Arthas from an attack by &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, before he introduced himself and told Arthas of Ner'zhul's plans. Anub'arak helped Arthas to establish a base, and then masterminded the attack on the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;. Anub'arak told Arthas that it would take far too long to fight their way through &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;'s expansive forces, and formulated a plan to go through the underground ruins of Azjol-Nerub to reach Icecrown, but warned that it would be a perilous journey.\nAnub'arak led Arthas into the ruined &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20Empire\"&gt;Nerubian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, negating many perilous traps along the way, but all the while, he fought many of his former subjects, the living &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, who called him the traitor king for serving the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who had destroyed Azjol-Nerub.\nWhen they entered the kingdom, they encountered survivors of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition. Their new leader, &lt;a href=\"Baelgun\"&gt;Baelgun&lt;/a&gt;, reported that an ancient evil had been released beneath the kingdom, and that he would not allow anyone to open the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Kingdom\"&gt;Inner Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s doors. Anub'arak and Arthas defeated the troublesome dwarves and broke into the Inner Kingdom. Soon, they came upon the evil the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; had spoken of - the &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt; - strange, malformed creatures who had been imprisoned beneath the earth in ages long forgotten. They even faced off with a &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt;, a creature of great power and resilience.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kingdom\"&gt;Upper Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, an earthquake separated Anub'arak from Arthas, and Anub'arak and his minions fervently dug through the rubble to get to Arthas before he was slain by one of the many booby traps laden throughout the halls of Azjol-Nerub's Upper Kingdom. Anub'arak was impressed by Arthas's resilience when he found him, and quickly ushered him out of Azjol-Nerub and to the surface, where they engaged with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his servants in a &lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle, Anub'arak defended Arthas as he magically activated the four obelisks surrounding &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;'s pinnacle. Once all four were active, Anub'arak stood by as Arthas climbed the stairs to his destiny.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAnub'arak made his home in the once proud kingdom of Azjol-Nerub. After his betrayal, he twisted and perverted his former homeland into a wretched squalor and ruled over an army of undead nerubians who, like their leader, had pledged themselves to serving the Lich King. &lt;a href=\"Kilix%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Kilix the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; ordered the death of Anub'arak.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the nerubian kingdom was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who confronted Anub'arak. When he was finally killed in his ruined palace, his last words were a relief to be free from the Lich King. The heroes later brought his broken husk to the living nerubians as proof of his death.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; also acquired his &lt;a href=\"The%20Idle%20Crown%20of%20Anub%27arak\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; and put it aside for the nerubians whenever they decided to coronate a new one.\nTrial of the Crusader.\nFollowing his defeat in &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak was once again resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced with frost-related powers. He was sent to plague the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, and resided within the &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Depths\"&gt;the Icy Depths&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as the final encounter during the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trials of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes of Azeroth faced him once more, and this time, he was definitively eliminated.\nServitude to the Lich King.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Damnation\"&gt;Road to Damnation&lt;/a&gt;\", when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; remarked that Anub'arak had agreed to give himself to the Scourge in exchange for immortality, he answered: \"'Agreed' implies choice.\" After that, Kel'Thuzad realized that the Lich King can compel obedience from the undead. In ', Arthas detected the vaguest stirring of resentment in Anub'arak's voice. He speculated that Anub'arak served only because he had to, and would turn on the Lich King if he was able to do so.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, his quote upon death is, \"Ahhh... RAAAAAGH! Never thought... I would be free of him...\", confirming that Anub'arak had been an unwilling slave. The Lich King raised Anub'arak again, following his defeat at Azjol-Nerub, to kill the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. Anub'arak appeared grateful to serve his master there, though that may have been forced obedience. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the reason the Lich King resurrected him may possibly be because he had a fondness for the Traitor King who'd originally escorted him to Icecrown.\nThe living nerubians do not view those who fell defending Azjol-Nerub from the Scourge as traitors, but they frequently refer to Anub'arak as the \"traitor king\". Anub'arak may have betrayed his people in some way (as crypt lords in general did) only to find himself regretting that decision later. Since the nerubians only began using the \"traitor king\" title after Anub'arak returned to lead the undead against them, it is also possible that Anub'arak was held to a different standard and blamed for his deeds in undeath while other fallen nerubians (like &lt;a href=\"Krik%27thir\"&gt;Krik'thir&lt;/a&gt;) were not.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Visual%20Guide\"&gt;Ultimate Visual Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" says Anub'arak was killed in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, raised into a &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;, and turned against his people in death. Although he was a servant of the Lich King, he was not a willing one.\nIn his \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" trailer, Anub'arak expresses his resentment over being forced into servitude and his desire to be a ruler once again.\nStatements of a bigger role.\nStatements made before the release of \"Wrath of the Lich King\" hinted that Anub'arak was going to play a larger role:\nThis may have referred to the cut &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; zone, but Anub'arak went on to re-appear as the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; raid.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Pursues a random raid target (20k initial threat)\n\"Hard Mode Changes\"\nStrategy.\nNormal.\nPhase One: Gather up, have one designated ranged DPS shoot down the frost orbs above to form permafrost on the ground.\nNerubian Burrower adds will spawn in phase one and they stack an Expose Armor debuff on their tanks, up to 9 stacks which increases physical damage taken. These need to be tanked on the permafrost or else they will burrow and heal back to full. The raid should have 2 off tanks (on 25 man) to pick these up. By the time Anub'arak burrows, there should only be 4 of them up; 2 on each tank. They should be killed during phase 2, when the raid has nothing else to do. For groups with only one tank for the burrowers it is advisable to just kill them as they spawn to reduce offtank damage taken.\nPhase Two: Anub'arak will burrow approximately every 90 seconds, starting phase 2. He will pursue a random target with spikes throughout the phase and when he reaches them he will cast Impale. The spikes will gradually speed up until they hit the target, or hit a patch of permafrost. Standing on the permafrost (or being on the other side of permafrost from the spikes) will enable you to avoid the impale, but the permafrost will despawn. After a few seconds, he will select another target. Aggro dropping abilities (Feign Death, Vanish, Divine Shield, Iceblock) will cause the spikes to change target, but their speed will not be reduced.\nSwarm Scarabs will spawn rapidly, scarabs have little hp, start with 20k threat on a random raid member. They all stack the same nature damage debuff on their targets and should be range kited and killed, or killed by melee not being chased by them. They can be slowed by permafrost to gain more distance. After about one minute Anub'arak will surface and begin phase one again. He keeps threat from phase one.\nPhase Three: It is advisable to kill off any adds currently active before pushing Anub'arak under 30%. He will not submerge or summon any more adds at this point (on normal mode). Anub'arak needs to die very quickly after hitting 30% as you will not last long under the effects of leeching swarm. It is not ideal to top off raid members as they will then be taking full damage from the leeching swarm, healing Anub'arak and prolonging the phase. Instead you will want to keep people as low as your healers feel comfortable with (recommended under 50% hp) in order to minimize the healing Anub'arak receives (Anub'arak will be healed for ~60,000 HP a second if the entire raid is at full HP on 25-man mode). Beware of people getting gibbed by penetrating cold. The main tank (and offtank if adds are still alive) will need to be topped off and people with penetrating cold will need some healing. Anub'arak does not have any other tricks and will die upon reaching 0% HP. NOTE: Anub'arak can be healed above 30% by the leeching swarm. The swarm will not turn off once activated. It is recommended to save &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; for phase 3.\n10-player Heroic.\nPhase One: Designate one ranged DPS to bring down permafrost. Placement of permafrost is essential to this fight. Try to get one to the left and one to the right of Anub so that his spikes can easily travel past them in pursuit of a person while in phase two. &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt; helps with positioning orbs. Also shoot down a third one in the back of the room. The main tank should position him so that his rear is near enough to the permafrost that melee can hit adds that will be tanked there. The off tank's job is usually very difficult during this phase as he must get &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; on both adds and position them before dps can start. The adds must be dragged onto the permafrost near the back side of the boss. Have people designated to interrupt each target. While tanking these adds the off tank preferably needs to position themselves off the permafrost so that movement is not slowed when phase two starts. Hand of Freedom can be used to negate the slowing effect of the permafrost on the tank and allow easier positioning. It is best to single target dps these down one at a time as quickly as possible while still doing as much damage to Anub as one can. Both adds need to die before the 2nd set spawns.\nPhase Two: During this phase Anub will burrow. Everyone except for Anub'arak's pursuit target will need to kill the scarab adds before they have a chance to enrage themselves. The objective of phase two is to let the Pursuing Spikes follow someone as long as possible while making sure that person stays alive. The spikes will continue to gain speed until they eventually hit a permafrost. Just before Anub burrows everyone will need to be in LoS of the spikes in between the front two permafrost as to not use (waste) one of them early. Once someone is targeted everyone will need to get away from the space in between the spikes and the pursued person. Rogues can vanish from the spikes, hunters feign death, and mages go invisible from the spikes, however, doing so will not reset their speed, and thus doing so must be done very carefully. Hand of Protection makes the player immune to the spike damage but will not force a target change, thus can extend the time that the spikes follow a target. A good strategy is to have whoever is getting chased run directly back towards the permafrost in the back of the room. Then simply stand in front of it and get bubbled by a paladin. When 2 or 3 seconds are left on the bubble that person must then run into the permafrost and Anub will begin chasing another victim. (Note: although he seems to favor changing targets it has occurred where Anub will chase the same target for a second time and it is recommended to run as far away after Anub hits permafrost.) Communication is key here as using too much permafrost too quickly is a definite wipe. Rogues and hunters are great at evading the spikes and at the last possible second losing aggro. If you can drag this out long enough you should have at least 1 or maybe even 2 permafrost still up. Once Anub surfaces the rest of the adds must be killed quickly and permafrost must be set back up as was in phase 1. The two Burrowers will spawn within 3 to 8 seconds so the off tank must be ready again. Since there is no &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; drop the main tank can get into position before Anub'arak comes back up without worrying about picking him up.\nPhase Three: Anub casts Leeching Swarm. The raid will be taking a lot of damage from this ability and it is not uncommon to see wipes during this phase. The Burrowers do NOT stop spawning and therefor must continue being tanked like normal even while taking 20% damage every 1 second and must be killed as usual. Alternatively, the adds can be allowed to burrow instead of being tanked and killed, this allows more damage on the boss but virtually guarantees a wipe after they resurface. It is advisable for the off tank to use cooldowns and armor pots in order to stay alive. Max damage during this part of the fight is necessary or it WILL be a wipe. Bloodlust/Heroism and trinkets should be popped just as the boss casts this ability and all AOE healing abilities and cooldowns should be used and spread out during the duration of the 3rd phase.\n25-player Heroic.\nKiting Flowchart: \nhttp://coldbear.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/heroic-anub-kiting-flowchart.png\nStratFU: \nhttp://www.stratfu.com/strats/anubarak/anubarak-25-hardmode\nTankSpot: \nhttp://www.tankspot.com/forums/f206/55360-coliseum-anubarak-hard-mode.html\nLoot.\nAs with the other bosses in the instances, there are separate versions of each item for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; raids and for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raids.\nQuotes.\nThe quantity and quality of rewards inside the tribute chest is based upon how many unsuccessful attempts you had during the Trial of the Grand Crusader.

In life, he was the empire's king. In death, he was its conqueror. Charged by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to protect his old empire once more, the traitor king stands vigilant against any that threaten his kingdom.\"\nTactics.\nShortly after the fight starts, a wall of web is raised around his platform which will lock group members out if you are not all inside. Be sure all party members are on or inside the ring before engaging. Anub'arak requires the tank to get quite close (near melee range) before the fight begins and the web goes up. \nWarriors and Druids should not attempt to start the fight by charging Anub'arak as due to his size this will result in a face pull prior to achieving charge range. It is possible to circle around the perimeter and attack from the rear or side so as to start the fight with him facing away from the remainder of the party.\nSpread out around the ring, tanking Anub'arak in the center. He will periodically stun the tank so do not be overzealous with DPS. Carrion Beetles will spawn when he is not submerged which can be easily killed with light aoe while the main focus of DPS remains on Anub'arak. When not submerged he will cast Locust Swarm which results in a moderate damage aoe against all party members and pets (usually cast shortly before submerge). When Anub'arak submerges, all DPS should switch to the incoming adds which fall from above into the ring, with the main tank keeping an eye out for when Anub'arak resurfaces in the center of the ring. The area beneath a player about to be hit by Spikes is indicated by a shifting drift animation and can be easily avoided if the player moves quickly.\nSo long as Anub'arak is picked up quickly after each resurface and the adds are killed quickly, the boss fight should be easily controlled.\nIf you find your healers running out of mana, an effective tactic is to prolong the submerged phase by killing all but the last guardian. While the tank and dps round up and deal with the other mobs, the healer sits back and does minimal healing, regenerating as much mana as possible. Once the healer is back to full mana, the last guardian is killed and the next phase begins. From experience it works best to only do this during the first two submerged phases, the third is usually too frantic and should be ended as fast as possible.\nFeral druids can really shine during this fight. Since they don't use mana for their attacks, a well played druid will be able to use &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt; on the healer, &lt;a href=\"Rebirth\"&gt;Rebirth&lt;/a&gt; on any party members who might die during the fight, heal the party with &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; and round out his job with &lt;a href=\"Abolish%20Poison\"&gt;Abolish Poison&lt;/a&gt;. And, because of the nature of the fight with the boss dissapearing every now and then, even druid tanks will find some time to support their party with these spells. As this fight tends to be pretty intense, it's rare for a feral druid not to blow one or more of his cooldowns, and the lack of their use can point out a careless or badly played toon.\nHeroic Mode:\nFighting Anub'arak while he is up is easy, as long as the tank and melee can avoid Pound properly. The adds phase is the real challenge. Adds come in from all direction. Healers and DPS can aggro easily if the tank is not used to AoE tanking. Several tips here:"}

Along with the majority of the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, they accompanied &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; when he traveled south from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. The anubisaths helped their master install the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and assisted him in constructing the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, before being assigned by the Highkeeper to watch over the two areas. When Ra fell mysteriously silent, the anubisaths continued their sacred charge of watching over Ahn'Qiraj, but they soon became afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s servants traveled south in search of the missing Highkeeper.\nEnslavement.\nMany years later, a group of &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; that traveled southwest overthrew and enslaved the anubisaths of Ahn'Qiraj. The enslaved titan-forged aided the aqir in their battles against the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, but the trolls eventually managed to contain the insectoid threat within Ahn'Qiraj.\nWithin Ahn'Qiraj, the surviving aqir soon evolved into a new race: the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. Countless years after their defeat at the hands of the trolls, the qiraji once again launched an assault on the mortal world, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Their colossal anubisath slaves proved to be efficient killing machines, with a single one of the giants able to smash through an entire unit of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. Though the strongest anubisaths were used as elite shock troops, &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; assigned most of the giants to the front lines, knowing that they would strike fear into the hearts of the elves. However, once the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; entered the war, the tide of battle turned. As the few anubisaths capable of casting spells were far from the front lines, the dragons were able to concentrate their attacks on the giants with ease, and nearly every anubisath was destroyed in the initial assault.\nHowever, one anubisath found a way to strike back against the dragons. Known as &lt;a href=\"Ossirian%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Ossirian&lt;/a&gt;, he managed to hurl his obsidian sword through the wing of the great dragon &lt;a href=\"Grakkarond\"&gt;Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt;. Though the dragon nearly mauled Ossirian to death, the remaining anubisaths and qiraji were able to overwhelm the now grounded wyrm. The wounded Ossirian was dragged back into Ahn'Qiraj, where it is said that he found favor with &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nWhen he awoke, the anubisath found that his strength had been greatly bolstered and his wounded head had been transformed into the shape of a hawk. &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Vek%27nilash\"&gt;Emperor Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt; explained that for his bravery and cunning, Ossirian had received a gift; his essence had been bound to several crystals within Ahn'Qiraj, which would grant him near invincibility as long as he remained close to them. When the other anubisaths heard of Ossirian's survival, they began referring to him as \"the Unscarred\" and revered him as a hero. Ever since Ossirian's victory, the &lt;a href=\"Bones%20of%20Grakkarond\"&gt;Bones of Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt; have remained a sacred site to the anubisaths; a testimony to their ability to defeat even the most powerful of enemies.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nWhen the Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from its prison, anubisaths that were corrupted almost beyond recognition appeared alongside the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; and newly forged &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s as part of its forces in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. More were also in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;. Infused with the power of N'Zoth, these anubisath appear significantly different from those who served &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. Their heads appear to be missing, replaced with a hood filled with blackness and several small glowing eyes. Their skin changed to a dark purple and their feet changed into claws. "}

It's not possible to feign out of a pull or to reset a mob (without wiping). It's also not possible to change your gear based on what aspects the mob has. Plan ahead.\nGenerally, if a hunter pulls with pet, there is a high probability in case of Meteor that the Defender will nuke the MT as soon as he is in aggro range. Therefore it helps to have 2-4 Warriors standing next to the MT upon pull.\nIn case of a plague it is possible to have the tank and the rogues far enough apart that the plagued rogues don't damage the MT.\nA good general strategy is to have everyone stand in one tightly packed group. Everyone can wear their \"normal\" gear. The Defender can be pulled to the group. This completely avoids the Shadow Storm. The Thunderclap can be healed through pretty easily, especially with Prayer of Healing. The Meteor is spread out amongst everyone. You can DPS the Defender down before it explodes. The only time anyone needs to move away from the group is if they are plagued. Priests/warlocks should set up a fear order to chain fear the adds until the Defender is dead."}

Shadow Storm has a range of 20-45 yds. \nThunderclap is a short ranged nature based AoE that emanates around the Anubisath Guardian. There is no attack speed debuff from this spell. Nature resist can reduce the amount of damage taken from this spell. Thunderclap has a range of 10 yds.\nSet 3: Reflect Arcane &amp; Fire or Reflect Shadow &amp; Frost.\nReflect Arcane &amp; Fire will reflect arcane and fire spells back to the user, doing arcane or fire damage. \nReflect Shadow &amp; Frost will reflect shadow and frost spells back to the user, doing shadow or frost damage. \nSet 4: Enrage or Explode.\nEnrage is a standard enrage used near death (10% health), the Guardian's damage increases considerably. Combat by adding extra healing for the MT. \nExplode is only used near death (10% health), causing the Guardian to explode, inflicting a lot of damage. The Guardian is rooted in place so run away!(can be killed before it explodes)\nSet 5: Anubisath Swarmguards or Anubisath Warriors.\nThe Guardian will summon up to four of one of these types of mobs. Warriors have high HP but low damage. Swarmguards have lower HP but higher damage output. Control both through fears and stuns, they will despawn after 1 minute.\nRaid Positioning.\nHow you position your raid will depend on which abilities the Guardian is using. Have a hunter pet pull and keep an eye on it to see which abilities the Guardian is using. Be ready to change your positioning rapidly when you discover what abilities are being used.\nMeteor/Shadow Storm.\nThis one is easy. Have the entire raid clump up around the Guardian's feet. Everyone will be inside the minimum range for Shadow Storm and clumped enough to absorb Meteor damage.\nMeteor/Thunder Clap.\nHave a group of rogues and warriors clumped around the Guardian. Have everyone else in a second clump, outside of the range of the Thunderclap.\nPlague/Shadow Storm.\nThis one is tricky. Try to have everyone spread out as much as possible while still being within 20 yards of the Guardian. When someone gets plagued, have them run away from the raid and try to get far enough from the Guardian so that they aren't getting hit by Shadow bolts.\nPlague/Thunder Clap.\nEveryone should be as spread out as possible. Have a place for plague victims to run and some healers assigned to watch them.\nStrategy.\nThese mobs can be quite difficult. They should all be tanked at the entrance to the Watcher Terrace since they have long wandering patrol routes throughout the area (they never enter the area just about the stairs where you enter, however). You may want to fight the first couple at the bottom of the stairs. Detect Magic needs to be cast right away so the mages/warlocks know what spells to use. If Detect Magic is not reflected, the Guardian is reflecting Shadow/Frost. Once this has been figured out the raid will have to adjust to whichever abilities he has. The mobs he will summon can easily be dealt with with fears and stuns. Don't bother trying to kill them until the Guardian is dead. Everyone should be aware of the trash mobs and do their best to keep them busy. They can be chain feared, stun locked, ice blocked, etc. so everyone can do a little something to help. Warriors should put some sunders on and try to get aggro on them so when they come unstunned, feared, etc, they don't immediately go after the cloth wearers."}

They come in packs of four. There are two packs of these before the first boss, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20Skeram\"&gt;The Prophet Skeram&lt;/a&gt;. The sentinels are the first type of anubisath the raid will encounter in the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj.\nAbilities.\nAnubisath Sentinels have a normal attack that hits for 600 - 800 damage and one random ability. The abilities are:\nWhen any one sentinel dies, the remaining sentinels gain the ability of the fallen sentinel and are healed for 50% of their max health. This means the last sentinel will have 4 abilities.\nStrategies.\nYou must prioritize which abilities will be the worst to have on more than one of the sentinels.\nFirst priority on killing should be either knockback or ones that heal. Mortal strike is pretty mana intensive to heal through on multiple tanks, but in the case of multiple AoE sentinels, this should be killed earlier rather than later. The shadowbolt volley is avoidable if you stand in melee range, so as long as you don't have a mana burn or thunderclap stacked with it, it is easy to deal with if you spread out the mobs so you are either in melee or out of range of the volley. Thunderclap is not difficult if you spread out the sentinels, but if they become stacked on top of each other, it is a raid wiper.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Anubisath Sentinel appears as in the \"\" adventure for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

Unbeknown to anyone, she was in fact not a human at all, but rather the remaining energies of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; transfigured into the form of a human avatar by the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nThe illusion created by Korialstrasz had Anveena living with a doting mother and father in a small house somewhere near &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. Unexpectedly to the red dragon, Anveena began to develop a life of her own with feelings and emotions. She discovered the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; caught up in the net of dragon hunters led by &lt;a href=\"Harkyn%20Grymstone\"&gt;Harkyn Grymstone&lt;/a&gt; and gave him shelter. Forced to flee when the dragon hunters attacked, Anveena and Kalecgos were thrown into a lake by a blast from one of the hunters' guns but managed to survive. As they made their way back to her home, they discovered it was on fire, and Anveena tried in vain to find her parents. It was then that they met &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, a high elf who had betrayed his people to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and was seeking the power of the Sunwell. Dar'Khan placed an enchanted ring of binding on both her and Kalec's necks and demanded to know the location of the Sunwell energies. They were saved by the timely arrival of Kalec's intended, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, who took them to Tarren Mill to locate the mysterious \"Borel\".\nAfter confronting Dar'Khan once more in Tarren Mill and being joined by the paladin &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;, Anveena, Kalec, and Tyri made their way towards the Hinterlands, but were brought down in the Alterac Mountains by a &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;. Anveena was found by the tauren &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, who took her to the ruined castle of Baron &lt;a href=\"Valimar%20Mordis\"&gt;Valimar Mordis&lt;/a&gt;, an undead nobleman who lived in the area. The Baron sought to use her power to energize the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; he had captured from the ghoul &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt;, and raise an army to combat the Scourge (and the living as well). Binding Anveena to the Orb, the Baron resurrected undead behemoths and frost wyrms to do his bidding but was stopped when Trag destroyed the orb in the Baron's hand. Shortly afterward, Anveena was captured by Dar'Khan, who took her to the place where she was \"born\": the ravaged lands of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDar'Khan was at first successful in harvesting the energies from her, and had gained enough power to strike down even a mighty dragon with a single attack, and take control of a dragon himself (Korialstrasz). But at that moment, the power within Anveena awakened. Understanding the true nature of her power and informing him that he had no power over her, Anveena lashed out at Dar'Khan, completely obliterating the traitor, now more lich than mortal. Afterwards, Korialstrasz revealed himself and explained fully what he had done to hide the Sunwell's energies from the Scourge.\nWith the support of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Regent of Quel'Thalas, Anveena and Kalec remained at an undisclosed location in Quel'Thalas under the blood elves' protection. Anveena's identity remained a secret, guarded by her immediate circle (Kalec, Tyri, Jorad, Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;). A few others also knew about her existence, however, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Agents of the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; eventually assumed the forms of blood elves, infiltrated the kingdom's inner circle and learned of Anveena. Kil'jaeden concluded that she would be the key to transforming the Sunwell into a gateway that would allow him to launch an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnveena and Kalec developed strong feelings for one another during the aforementioned events.\nFury of the Sunwell.\nLor'themar and his followers initially kept Anveena's presence a secret from their prince, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who was in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; at the time. They did not know what would happen if Anveena's power was infused into the Sunwell and feared that the prince might act without considering the consequences if he discovered her existence. Lor'themar later had a change of heart and believed that telling Kael'thas about Anveena was the only way to convince him to return home to Quel'Thalas, but the regent lord's messengers were intercepted by Kil'jaeden's agents in Quel'Thalas; the demon lord wanted to place Kael'thas under his control and needed the prince to lose all hope of restoring his kingdom. Once he won him to his side, Kil'jaeden ordered the prince to capture Anveena and &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; and weave their energy into a ritual to summon the demon lord. Anveena was imprisoned in a field of arcane power within the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, where her powers were drained into the Sunwell. The &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; was created to rescue Anveena and end Kael's menace once and for all.\nDuring the ensuing battle, Anveena realized that Kil'jaeden was too powerful for the mortal heroes of Azeroth to defeat alone. Choosing to give her life over theirs, she unleashed her full powers against the Deceiver, weakening him enough so he could be banished back to the depths of the Twisting Nether. But Anveena was gone.\nThe powers of the Sunwell that had been embodied inside Anveena returned to their original state, purified by the heart of M'uru. Anveena had also secretly imbued Kalec with a portion of the Sunwell's power\u2014\"her\" power\u2014so that, in a literal sense, a piece of her would live on in his heart. Korialstrasz later noticed this unique touch of power in the blue dragon's magical essence but chose to respect Anveena's wish of keeping it secret from Kalec.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

A while ago he earned a commendation from TechLead.\nAt the time of the realm forums creation, he pioneered an effort to post a 'Realm Guide' in each, generally detailing information about the realm, forum, and attempting to create a guild list. Unfortunately, some were annoyed at this trespassing, and spammed the threads. Anvilbeard deleted the spammed threads, and left the constructive ones. Some still remain bumped by guilds, but very few are still stickied in their respective forums.\nOver time his activity generally faded when compared to others such as the (in)famous Wormsborough, until a short while before the release of the first ever Warcraft Weekly, which debuted around the time of the release of Patch 1.6.0, where he once again began posting, answering tough questions and generally being a know-it-all. At present he seems to have toned down his number of posts, and when he does they tend to be in threads that involve a large number of trolls. He is quick to eat them when show themselves. \nWas a former European forum &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D77638059%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;MVP&lt;/a&gt; along with Schwick and Highlander.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums-en.wow-europe.com/thread.aspx%3Ffn%3Dwow-blizzard-archive-en%26amp%3Bt%3D29\"&gt;Warcraft Weekly Archive&lt;/a&gt;\nQuotes.\n\"This forum alt is being played by twenty Chinese children.

He would converse with the \"gods of the abyss\", and he would find them dull, witless creatures. Anzu was cursed by &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt; god, and is no longer capable of flight. His will has been broken and dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; cult, who have brought him out of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis children were the &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nThe Gods of Arak.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt; that saturated the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; birthed many kinds of animals, but almost all of them were consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s. But with the end of the Evergrowth by the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s, life had a chance to thrive on Draenor once more, and the remains of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; became forests that teemed with Spirit and accelerated the development of new species. The first to arise were enormous creatures with extraordinary power over the land: some tapped into the power of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, some the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, and others the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Yet survival was a challenge because of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, and winged species proved to be most suited to thrive on Draenor for they could fly out of reach of both forces. Most of Draenor's avians developed in a region called &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;, dominated by a massive spire that towered over dense woods. Three godlike creatures who took form in Arak were Anzu, &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu was much smaller than Rukhmar or Sethe. What he lacked in physical power, he made up for with a keen intellect. Ever curious, Anzu investigated the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s that crisscrossed the world and discovered &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. For ages, the three largely kept to themselves, fighting off attacks from Primals and Breakers. Only Anzu dreamed of a better world for him and his feathered kin. He called on Rukhmar and Sethe to work together to transform Arak into a sanctuary for winged creatures of all kinds. As one, Anzu and his allies drove the children of stone and root from Arak. With the Primals and Breakers gone, Arak became a haven for winged species. Anzu, Rukhmar, and Sethe settled in as caretakers of the land and its varied species. Anzu watched over the multitude of lesser ravens that lived throughout Arak. He frequented the forest canopies below the spire. All seemed well in Arak, but darkness was stirring near the spire.\nAt an unknown point in the past, Anzu had his followers seal three rival bird spirits - the eagle, the falcon, and the hawk - in stone statues.\nOver the years, Sethe became envious of Rukhmar. He coveted the favor of the wind and the warmth of the sun that Anzu and Rukhmar had. Sethe believed Anzu was also jealous of Rukhmar who looked down on them from the spire, and tried to convince Anzu to help him slay her, but Anzu was cunning and cared little for the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, he had a secret affection for Rukhmar but never mustered the courage to confess his feelings. In the dark of the night, he sent one of his &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s to warn Rukhmar of Sethe's plot. Anzu watched from the top of a mountain spire as Rukhmar and Sethe clashed. Thanks to Anzu's warning, Rukhmar avoided Sethe. She flew high, put the sun at her back, and dove at Sethe. With a flap of her wings, she split the sky upon Sethe like the crack of a whip. Sethe crashed into the spire where they fought with such force that it crumbled and fell around him, creating the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spire\"&gt;Broken Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu stepped into the battle then, pinning Sethe under his foot. Looking up at the raven god, Sethe uttered a dying curse: that his blood shall blacken the sea until it runs thick as tar, and his flesh shall fester and soil until the very sky rots with it. Anzu responded that they shall then leave no blood nor flesh and devoured Sethe whole, picking the bones clean. But a small trickle of blood escaped and blighted the valley below, creating the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu felt Sethe's hatred coursing through him. His body contorted, his wings shriveled, and he became cursed without flight. His mind was wracked with painful visions. Anzu had contained Sethe's curse by taking it upon himself, and he would grapple with the curse for some time. In revenge, Anzu had his dread ravens slaughter Sethe's &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s; in one bloody night, Sethe's children were eradicated. Anzu could not bear to present himself to Rukhmar, for if she had not seen him worthy before then surely she would now be disgusted by the aberration he had become. He disappeared into the forest deeps, and he ignored Rukhmar whenever she called for Anzu to show himself.\nAftermath.\nThough Sethe's curse weakened Anzu, it also gave him new power: the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that Sethe had once commanded. As Anzu grew more familiar with his abilities, he shrouded himself in a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;realm of shadow&lt;/a&gt; to hide from Rukhmar forever. He left his consort &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt; to lead the dread ravens. Rukhmar decided that if she could not find Anzu to thank him, then she would reward his sacrifice by creating a new race in his honor. Using her own life energies, Rukhmar transformed some of her &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; followers into the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;: \"heirs of Arak\". They embodied Rukhmar's physical grace and majesty, as well as Anzu's intellect and cleverness. The arakkoa revered Anzu alongside Rukhmar, but they incorrectly believed him to be dead.\nWhen the great Talon King &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; was tossed into the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and was afflicted by Sethe's curse, Anzu saved him from despair and granted him and his followers both arcane sorcery and powers over the darkness. Together, Anzu, Terokk, and the new &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s built the city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; as a refuge for those unwanted by Rukhmar. Terokk used &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with him. But even as Anzu was worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; cult attempted to bring him back to the physical world and put him under their control.\nThe Sethekk ultimately succeeded in their goal following the destruction of Draenor, summoning Anzu's still-cursed physical form to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; so that he may attack the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The Arakkoa Outcasts, who have since become the Skettis arakkoa, no longer worship Anzu, with his only followers being the outcast &lt;a href=\"Grishna\"&gt;Grishna&lt;/a&gt;. The essences of Anzu's ancient sealed rivals were used to create an &lt;a href=\"Essence-Infused%20Moonstone\"&gt;Essence-Infused Moonstone&lt;/a&gt; that could call him to the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt; where, still under the control of the Sethekk, he was put down."}

{"id": "513522", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=513522", "title": "Anzu (tactics)", "text": "Anzu is a &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; and a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; (on &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty only). He is most notable for dropping the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Raven%20Lord\"&gt;Reins of the Raven Lord&lt;/a&gt;, a ground mount. A &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; used to have to summon and kill Anzu as part of the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;Epic Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; quest chain, but as of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the quest chain was removed and Anzu is now a permanent boss encounter.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"A mysterious avian deity worshipped by some of the more savage &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, Anzu is a being whose origins and powers are unlike any other member of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s fallen pantheon. The &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; are silent regarding this malevolent creature, for Anzu's ways are hidden from even them.\"\nStrategy.\nThe fight is a regular tank-and-spank during phase 1. If a caster is afflicted by Spell Bomb, they should STOP casting immediately; if a healer is afflicted, an offhealer, if present, should heal the party for the duration of the debuff. \nAs Anzu approaches 66% (and later 33%), he'll self-banish and summon birds that should be AoE'ed. It is very beneficial to keep the Eagle Spirit active during Phase 2, taking advantage of its 300 DPS room-wide AoE. You will probably find that the Eagle Spirit's AoE is more successful than any mage or druid AoE that you use. There is also the advantage that the Eagle Spirit's AoE will not draw aggro to any party member. If you have a Frost Mage in your party, have them freeze the bird flock to help avoid harm to your party members. Anzu will unbanish after 1 minute or when all birds are dead \u2014 whichever comes first. If it seems likely that the birds aren't going to die in one minute, the tank needs to pick up Anzu while the rest of the group finishes the birds off. \nGenerally, you'll want to keep Hawk Spirit up as much as possible, Eagle during phase 2, and Falcon if you have spare time (the haste effect significantly increases the group's DPS, making the fight less time and mana consuming). While &lt;a href=\"Regrowth\"&gt;Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; is longer, &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; is instant cast \u2014 either may be used depending on the situation. The following macros enable you to cast Rejuvenation on a specific spirit without having to target it directly:\nUsing macros such as the above will make this fight a lot easier than manual targeting. Manual targeting of the spirits becomes very difficult once the bird flock arrives due to the number of mobs on screen.\nAfter the second, and last, wave of birds you may find the best way to finish the fight is to DPS Anzu down quickly.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "674659", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=674659", "title": "Apari", "text": "Apari is a &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; witch and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of Zandalari rebels who oppose the rule of &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;. She had white hair, walked with a noticeable limp, and was always accompanied by her lieutenant and bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Daz\"&gt;Daz&lt;/a&gt;, a bulbous pet &lt;a href=\"blood%20tick\"&gt;blood tick&lt;/a&gt; that she carries on her shoulder.\nHistory.\nIn her younger years, Apari, also called Parri, was best friends with &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, with the two getting into all sorts of mischief together. Her loyalty to Talanji was so great that when her mother &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; sided with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; in his coup, Apari remained loyal to the crown.\nAfter receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; conferred with her father about how to deal with this new threat. They determined that while Rastakhan would defend the city, Talanji herself would lead the armies of Zandalari against the Alliance. Apari was among the Zandalari who remained behind with Rastakhan and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the city when Alliance invaded. Amidst the fighting, a pillar fell on her, leaving her trapped and in her desperation, she called out for the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; to save her. However, her cries went unanswered, and she subsequently called for Talanji when she saw her. Worried for her father, Talanji made the decision to rush on ahead towards him while promising to send aid to her old friend.\nWhile Rastakhan fell in battle, Apari would survive the conflict, though she would suffer a leg injury that caused her to limp. Following the revelation that her old friend was now a priestess of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely disillusioned Apari left the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; and would come to hold a bitter hatred towards Talanji, Bwonsamdi, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, she rallied the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; to her cause, tried to assassinate Talanji, used propaganda to turn the public against the new queen, and killed those who remained loyal to the Queen, like &lt;a href=\"Seshi\"&gt;Seshi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bezime\"&gt;Bezime&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Apari and her followers agreed to aid &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; on their mission to kill the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. However, in order to successfully weaken Bwonsamdi's shrines, Apari required something precious and irreplaceable from Nathanos. After a moment, he handed over his officer's badge\u2014given to him by Sylvanas when they were among the living\u2014and warned Apari that if she failed to destroy the loa's shrines as promised, the consequences would be severe.\nWhen Tayo noticed how Apari's leg injury was harming her, and could possibly lead to her death, she offered the service of a &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; friend she had that could amputate the leg and at another point in their mission, Sira offered the use of &lt;a href=\"Lelyias\"&gt;one of their healers&lt;/a&gt; to tend to her injuries. However the prideful Apari refused and while Tayo accepted this with a resigned grace, Sira was outraged noting that the Widow's Bite was fundamentally loyal to Apari and could easily fall apart with her. However, Apari was unmoved and began to become increasingly obsessed with vengeance against Talanji and Bwonsamdi.\nThis obsession grew so great that she was willing to injure and sacrifice children in order weaken to the loa of graves. Outraged by this Tayo personally stopped Apari which caused the later to strike her across the face leaving her stunned. Apari then declared that she was on the precipice of death, sought to only live in order to see both Bwonsamdi and Talanji dead, and how no one would stop her. Disgusted by this declaration Tayo left, which Apari allowed due to her belief that she would come crawling back.\nWhile Apari, Nathanos, and their forces did battle with Bwonsamdi, Tayo turned to the Horde and aided them against her former allies, and amidst the fighting Apari lost her life to Talanji and Tayo."}

{"id": "107341", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=107341", "title": "Apexis", "text": "The Apexis were an ancient and now-extinct &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n civilization that attained a height of power during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Order\"&gt;Age of Order&lt;/a&gt; before abruptly vanishing. They were a glorious &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; of the sun that ruled vast territories alongside the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;ogre empire&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago.\nThe Apexis had their own language. They were winged, and unlike the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; that would emerge much later, the Apexis arakkoa did not partake in the barbaric practice of throwing outcasts and heretics into the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt; in order to afflict them with the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Apexis were led by two factions: the Anhar, wielders of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and the Skalax, wielders of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. They shared equal prestige and influence.\nBackground.\nRise.\nLong ago, the arakkoa were created by the god &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Summit\"&gt;highest peak&lt;/a&gt;. She taught them about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and told them stories of &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, who they also worshiped, and from the stories they also began to practice the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. She always intended on them returning to &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;, her homeland for which the arakkoa were named, and as she grew old she led them there, three thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. But just as they reached Arak, Rukhmar breathed her last breath. Flames consumed her form and she burned like a second sun in the sky. The arakkoa saw Rukhmar's passing as a sign of their ascendancy. They vowed to create a grand civilization that would outshine any other culture on Draenor in order to honor her. The light of their knowledge and their power would blaze in the heavens just as Rukhmar had.\nCalling themselves the Apexis, the arakkoa claimed the highest reaches of Arak's spire. They harvested timber from the surrounding woods and metals from the nearby mountains and built illustrious gilded structures around their new home. Using their mastery of the Light, the Apexis crafted enormous lanterns burning with enchanted flames that hung along the length of the spire. Guided by tales of Anzu and his noble sacrifice, arakkoa sorcerers investigated the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. By carefully studying the cursed pools, they unraveled the mysteries of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and developed the unique ability to combine the arcane with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Embracing both Light and Void, the Apexis believed they were both natural parts of life. Two factions formed within the Apexis: the Anhar order studied &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magic, while the Skalax studied shadow and arcane magics. Both groups occupied the upper echelons of arakkoa society, sharing equal prestige and influence.\nAs the arakkoa solidified their power in Arak, they also began to explore the rest of Draenor; though not expansionists, they were curious. Outposts were forged across the land to observe local flora and fauna, and by studying and mapping the forests and mountains they were in awe when they realized that many of these were the &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;remains&lt;/a&gt; of ancient &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; that had once walked Draenor. Based on stories from Rukhmar, the Apexis realized the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; were the primordial giants' offspring. They watched the endless warring between the two with pity and fascination. However, they never intervened; they had inherited a touch of Rukhmar's arrogance and to play a part in the lives of land-dwellers was seen as beneath the Apexis.\nTwo thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Apexis developed a device called the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; that harnessed the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;'s energy into incredible destructive power to combat the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; when they encroached on Arak.\nHeight and fall.\nCenturies after defeating the Evergrowth and 1,200 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Apexis had flourished into an empire and their population had swelled. They saw themselves as the most powerful force in the world, that not even the mightiest of Primals had been able to contend with. With nothing to threaten them, the Apexis dedicated themselves to the advancement of science and magic, and knowledge became their culture's most coveted resource. The Anhar and Skalax became the caretakers of wisdom with the duty of cataloging history, the study of magic, and information about the world and its various creatures. Rather than keeping this knowledge in tomes or scrolls, the Anhari and Skalaxi sorcerers combined their magic to develop &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20crystals\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;. By merely touching one of the crystals, an arakkoa would consume all of the knowledge contained within and even experience the memories of whoever had crafted it.\nThe Apexis applied their magics to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20guardian\"&gt;mechanical constructs&lt;/a&gt; that would do their bidding. The arakkoa had always been arrogant, and they had become even more so after their victory. They deemed those who walked the surface to be unclean and used their constructs to mine and gather other resources from the ground.\nDuring the height of Apexis culture, a small group of Anhari priests sought out the remains of Rukhmar. They found her charred bones near the spire, and they used their magics to resurrect her. But it was only a partial success. This new Rukhmar had only a sliver of the original's power and intelligence. Nonetheless, the Apexis worshiped her as their goddess reborn. The Anhari infused her with their Light powers, granting her a long life so she could soar the skies for millennia.\nThe Anhari priests constructed a gleaming sun temple around the Breath of Rukhmar used centuries before. Hundreds of arakkoa gathered each year to commemorate the Apexis victory and honor Rukhmar. Other arakkoa visited shrines carved into the solid rock near the foot of the spire where the Skalaxi sorcerers performed rituals to honor Anzu and his ancient sacrifice. Though Apexis culture seemed destined to continue its rise, a rivalry developed between the Anhar and Skalax as each vied for the support of the greater populace. The Anhari knew that to seize power they would need to control knowledge. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Priest-Lord%20Velthreek\"&gt;Priest-Lord Velthreek&lt;/a&gt; order his followers to gather as many Apexis crystals as they could, and the Anhari did so in secret over a number of years, storing them in their sun temple atop the spire.\nThe Skalaxi and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Lord%20Salavass\"&gt;Sorcerer-Lord Salavass&lt;/a&gt; eventually uncovered what was happening. They believed that knowledge was a basic right for all arakkoa and Salavass called for the immediate release of the crystals. However, Velthreek ignored the demand. He declared the Anhari the sole rulers of the Apexis and that they would decide who would access the crystals and their knowledge. In addition, he claimed that he and the Anhari were the living representatives of Rukhmar herself. Therefore, following their teachings was the only way to attain her favor. Salavas was cunning and knew what would happen to his order if they did not act: the Skalaxi would become marginalized in society and gradually lose influence. He gathered his followers and struck at the sun temple to take the Apexis crystals by force.\nThe battle that erupted at the gates to the sun temple quickly spilled into the lower levels of the spire, with some arakkoa allying with the Anhari and others with the Skalaxi. The civil war engulfed the spire for many months, and to turn the tide of the conflict the Anhari harnessed the Breath of Rukhmar. As the weapon ignited and they prepared to incinerate the Skalaxi, Salavass knew they would be doomed against it and led a handful of his most gifted sorcerers to the top of the spire where they stormed through the Anhari guards. As the Ahhari cut down the intruders Salavass weaved a spell to destabilize the Breath of Rukhmar. It worked, but the result was catastrophic: a furious explosion erupted from the Breath of Rukhmar, instantly killing most of the arakkoa on the spire and shattering the land. After the light dimmed, all was dark.\nThe explosion had split Arak's spire into many smaller spires and the surrounding region was left a barren wasteland. In time, it came to be known as the Spires of Arak. It would take generations for life to bloom in the area again, and even longer for the surviving arakkoa to recover from what had happened. The Apexis society was no more, but from its ashes new cultures would arise.\nLegacy.\nTwo hundred years after the fall of the Apexis, a remnant of the Skalaxi led by &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt; sought to help the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s rebel against their &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; slavemasters by teaching them in the ways of arcane sorcery. This eventually led to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The arakkoa did this to obtain Apexis ruins under the city of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, but the ogre they had taught - &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gorgog the Gronnslayer&lt;/a&gt; - killed Yonzi slowly and gruesomely. Arakkoa ventures into ogre lands became few and far between, and the ogres began to prize Apexis crystals. The Anhari would continue to dwell in Arak, sharing leadership with a line of kings, and eventually became known as the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the present, the knowledge of what happened to the Apexis has long since been forgotten, leaving only speculation as to why they suddenly disappeared. Some say that the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Guardian\"&gt;Apexis Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s turned against their masters. Their name lives on in the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal%20%28item%29\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Shard\"&gt;Apexis Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be found all over &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Monument\"&gt;Apexis Monument&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Relic\"&gt;four smaller relics&lt;/a&gt; surrounding them, are set in a number of places on the plateau. Apexis ruins also seem to surround the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcast&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;, as well as locations within &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Nest%20of%20the%20Ravenspeakers\"&gt;Nest of the Ravenspeakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Veil%20Anzu\"&gt;Lost Veil Anzu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe legacy of the Apexis lies preserved in ancient chambers beneath &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;. Legions of dormant constructs; crystals flush with solar energy; magical techniques lost to the ages - the Apexis left behind caches of immense power. Apexis technology consists of machines powered by solar energy \u2014 energy which itself has been imbued with magic. The &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Core\"&gt;Apexis Core&lt;/a&gt;s are the heart of Apexis technology - solar energy condensed into a resin crystal. The &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; scour Draenor for artifacts left behind by this ancient society and use their technology in their war against the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. They claim it is given to them by the will of &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, but in truth they stumbled upon locations like the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Excavation\"&gt;Apexis Excavation&lt;/a&gt; on accident. Apexis artifacts are capable of enhancing a being's intelligence simply by sheer proximity, as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leorajh\"&gt;Leorajh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Apexis had blueprints for a \"Temple in the Sky\", but it is unclear if they ever actually built it. This might be the temple they built on the top of the spire of Arak.\nThe ogres of &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; seek to gain an understanding of the Apexis relics and wish to benefit from the observations of the adventurers who give their aid to Ogri'la.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;'s genocidal campaign, both high and cursed arakkoa came to realize that the Apexis had known that having light and darkness in equal measure was natural. Only together could the arakkoa survive whatever the future held for them, leading to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt;."}

When the crystal is fully powered it will show a colored ray arcing to one of the buttons. The idea of the game, like , is that you follow the order of the colors which the relic gives.\nEach round will add a counter to the number of buttons you have to press, starting from 1 going all the way up to 10. It becomes seemingly harder to remember all the colors. If you happen to make a mistake you will get zapped by a red lightning bolt damaging you for up to 4000 damage.

They deemed those who walked the surface to be unclean and used their constructs to mine and gather other resources from the ground. 1,200 years later, the golems were reactivated from within the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Excavation\"&gt;Apexis Excavation&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nest%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Nest Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s were originally built as automated caretakers for young Arakkoa, but with the conflict escalating between the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;, many have been repurposed as instruments of war.

Apocalypse soon earned a horrific reputation in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; mage who couldn't control its destructive energies. In time the sword was seized by the malevolent &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;: servants of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. They hid the blade in the catacombs under his home, the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn-game description.\n\"An ancient blade crafted by the Nathrezim which spreads plague, death and violence in its wake, Apocalypse is a powerful tool of destruction. The blade was wielded by the Tirisgarde before it fell into the hands of the Dark Riders. Now the only way to find it is to hunt down the riders to their secret lair.\"\nArtifact lore.\n\"Most stories about the Burning Legion speak of countless demons stampeding over worlds, but the cunning nathrezim know that brute force is not only way to conquer an enemy. One lie can break an alliance. One drop of poison can cripple a giant. One disease can reduce a great city to a graveyard. The nathrezim blade called Apocalypse has accomplished all of these things. It holds the power to spread plagues, incite wars, and turn ally against ally. In the right hands, this weapon has singlehandedly brought entire civilizations crashing down before the Legion's army ever began their invasion.\"\nHistory.\nApocalypse has been forged and reforged by countless nathrezim over their centuries in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Every time the blade changed hands, its new owner would infuse it with additional plagues and maledictions and hone it further into a weapon of unspeakable evil and innumerable crimes. Eventually, it fell into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; during the Legion's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Navane\"&gt;Navane&lt;/a&gt;. The cunning dreadlord infiltrated Navane's united forces, manipulating them into turning against each other and letting Apocalypse's dark magic to inflame their hatreds of each other until, in a single bloody night, Navane's armies slaughtered each other.\nThousands of years ago, reckless wizards in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently tore holes in the fabric of reality. Kathra'natir entered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through one such hole, and quickly set about repeating his work in Navane among the mages of Dalaran, creating magical plagues to sweep through the city. This time, though, he was found out by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated and banished the dreadlord. Apocalypse remained left behind, however. Alodi recognized the blade's dark nature, and the terrible influence it attempted to assert over him, and wished it destroyed. The rest of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, however, chose to instead lock it away in their vault.\nMillennia later, when the Guardian &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; found herself losing the battle against the Legion, the Council began to unearth many of their long-sealed relics to aid in the fight. Apocalypse was given to a mage named &lt;a href=\"Laith%20Sha%27ol\"&gt;Laith Sha'ol&lt;/a&gt;, and it quickly poisoned his mind, driving him to terrible deeds. In Laith's hands, Apocalypse left a wake of death, famine, and pestilence across the realms. Aegwynn eventually learned of Laith's actions and confronted him. When he unleashed the sword's power against her, she used a spell to break its hold over him. Suddenly overcome with the horrors he had wrought under its influence, he dropped the sword and fled. When Aegwynn proved unable to destroy the blade, she sealed it away in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, Laith's son, &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, ran afoul of Aegwynn's son, the Guardian &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh cursed Ariden and his companions to act as his servants, compelling them to seek out powerful artifacts and bring them to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Owing to his father's history, Ariden felt especially drawn toward one artifact in particular: Apocalypse. After he unearthed it, he continued to wield it as he and his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; continued to hunt relics and artifacts over the years.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; sought to wield Apocalypse against the Burning Legion. They tracked it to the catacombs beneath Karazhan, where they confronted Ariden himself. Upon Ariden's defeat, his father's spirit appeared and told him the curse was lifted. Ariden died, and the Deathlord turned the accursed blade against its creators. Once the Burning Legion had been defeated, they expended Apocalypse's power to purge the corruption from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. What became of the sword afterwards is unknown.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

There, she sustained a grave injury that rendered her unfit for combat and was sent back home to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, much to her disappointment as she truly wanted to help her people and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the war. It was during this time that she and her friend &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; started to ponder upon the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and how tauren have been &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s since the start of time. However, all they know about druidism is from the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, which are creatures of the night. The other eye of the Earth Mother &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; - the sun - was however completely forgotten. As Tahu realized this he pondered what could happen should tauren start to harness the power of the sun granted by the second eye of the Earth Mother. It was this small realization what sets in motion the genesis of the tauren priests and paladin order. Tahu ended up abandoning his druidic path and became the first tauren priest, while Aponi abandons her warrior ways and became the first tauren paladin, in an order now known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi defended &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Rise\"&gt;Hunter Rise&lt;/a&gt; from the elemental attacks.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi became a paladin trainer and instructs young tauren sunwalkers.\nLegion.\nAfter the disaster at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi Brightmane convened with the leaders of Azeroth's other paladin orders in Dalaran, such as &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Order%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; was created and with the signing of the Libram of Ancient Kings a new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to lead the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; into battle against the Burning Legion.\nAponi Brightmane later urged to close the demon portal at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Lord &lt;a href=\"Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; then reported that he's received no word from Aponi Brightmane, &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; - who joined her in her mission - since their departure. Fearing the worst, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Azsuna to locate her only to find her libram. It was lacking several pages of story, making it hard to find out what fate befell them. After defeating the commander of the forces defending the portal in Felblaze Ingress, in a daring leap of faith it becomes clear the demon fortress of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; lays behind the portal. Here, Aponi Brightmane is trapped in a cage.\nAponi discovers that the Burning Legion is planning to launch a full-scale assault on Netherlight Temple in which supposedly the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; is to be ended. In Niskara, they also discover &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, High Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, who was held prisoner at Niskara by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi Brightmane as part of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, aids the priests when their temple is assaulted by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the split of the Order during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi Brightmane is no longer a Champion and leader of the Silver Hand. \nDragonflight.\nAponi was amongst those that joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and visited &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;Teerakai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. While there, she reflected on the evils she had faced and how the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; within the plains were not like them.

Apothecaries are a new sight on the battlefield, and unique to the Forsaken. Like &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, apothecaries are support soldiers, administering potions and alchemical brews to heal and strengthen their allies. The apothecaries are new to their role in war, and rarely takes a place in the front of battle. They are an extremely useful support soldier, however, carrying a variety of potions and alchemical brews with which to reinforce the lines and keep everyone in top shape. If pressed into battle, They imbibe a strengthening elixir and use their enchanted daggers. Their Healing domain is both useful to their living allies as well as their liberated undead brothers, and deadly against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen people think of witch doctors, they usually don\u2019t think of Forsaken. However, Forsaken are some of the most skilled &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and while they don\u2019t entreat voodoo spirits for help and don\u2019t call their craft \u201cmojo,\u201d they still possess tricks to make their brews especially potent. These Forsaken call themselves apothecaries, and the greatest among them enter the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20apothecary\"&gt;dark apothecaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe iconic apothecary is a withered Forsaken standing in a laboratory. Beakers and cauldrons bubble and spew horrible vapors into the air. Strange, fleshy creatures mew and gurgle within black cages. The undead female smirks with supreme confidence as she uncorks a vial from one of her numerous pouches."}

Many of them appear in the form of gargantuan &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s. The Wild Gods of Azeroth are creatures of two realms, for while they inhabit the physical world, their spirits are bound to the ethereal &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. When Wild Gods die, they go to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and enter a &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; to be taken care of by keepers of the groves of one of the &lt;a href=\"celestial%20tree\"&gt;celestial tree&lt;/a&gt;s until they are ready to be reborn through the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.

The greatest creatures to emerge from Freya's enclaves were the colossal Wild Gods. Seeing these creatures as her own children, Freya and the Wild Gods often wandered side by side through the primal forests and grasslands of early Azeroth. The area that they spent the most time at was the massive forested peak known as &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and it was upon the slopes of Hyjal that Freya bound the spirits of her beloved Wild Gods to the Emerald Dream. Forever after, Hyjal would remain a sacred refuge to the Wild Gods.\nGroups.\nDifferent cultures around Azeroth have referred to the Wild Gods by various names.\nAncient Guardians.\nThe Ancient Guardians are Wild Gods worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, found in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They are greatly revered by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Famous Ancients include &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAugust Celestials.\nThe August Celestials \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are Wild Gods who remained in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. They have helped and guided the pandaren people for thousands of years.\nLoa.\n\"Loa\" is the name given by the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s to the beings they worship as deities, such as the Wild Gods, including the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, but also other entities such as &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi, &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s and spirits like &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zanza\"&gt;Zanza&lt;/a&gt;. The first, early troll tribes already called &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s elusive Wild Gods as such, and lived among them on the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Countless loa exist, most weak, but some very powerful. Most are shapeless, whereas others have animal or creature forms. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; believe that powerful, enlightened members of their tribe can become loas upon their death. Some loa, like &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, can enter the Emerald Dream. A few of the more famous loa include &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akali\"&gt;Akali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shirvallah\"&gt;Shirvallah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable Wild Gods.\nUnnamed.\nNumerous unnamed Ancients appeared during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Ancients.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; feared that the Ancient Guardians may someday rise up to oppose them. They created twisted versions of the Ancients, summoned to replace them. They were a primal force of nature, but their origins were from a darker place. Those who birthed these beasts reached deep into the blackness, channeling powers never intended for this world. The Twilight's Hammer dreamed of creating their own pantheon of twisted ancients to rule over the land, sea, and air, though only two were summoned before the Twilight's Hammer was stopped.\nRacial ancestry.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that several races originate from the Ancients:\nBrann also &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;speculates&lt;/a&gt; on the existence of several Ancients and their creation of descendant races:\nSpeculation.\nPossible Wild Gods.\nThe following beings may or may not be Wild Gods:"}

This combination of speed, range and the ability to bring down threats from above made them a valuable addition to the Orcish Horde.\nEven after the loss of the main Horde, some tribes decided to stay with their orcish allies, notably by being brought to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and then spread among the various clans of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, or by working for &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.

During phase 2 the battle is fought on the ground.\nThroughout the fight, Ayamiss shoots an &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; of nature damage that hits for about 1000. If you have any &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Resistance\"&gt;Nature Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, use it. Also, he spawns a large group of bugs that can be easily killed with a few &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; every so often.\nWhen the fight starts off, all the melee need to run near the base of the altar to focus on the grubs. Every once in a while, Ayamiss will teleport a random player to the middle of the altar. You can tell he's about to sacrifice someone by seeing a streak of green shoot to the altar. A grub will appear either on the left or right side, so melee need to kill it fast before it reaches the player. Otherwise, it'll kill the player and spawn a powerful elite. It should be noted that this grub moves very quickly and cannot be slowed or stunned.\nPhase 1.\nAll ranged DPS need to gather in the back and start to DPS him down. However, they need to watch for how many stings they have. Never go above 20 or healers will run dry quickly. One strategy is for DPSers to watch the number of stings they have and trade &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; when they get too many.\nAnother strategy is for a ranged attacker with high DPS and good &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Resistance\"&gt;Nature Resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear to &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; him by holding aggro while the rest of the raid DPSes as hard as possible. A trinket mage with &lt;a href=\"Power%20Infusion\"&gt;Power Infusion&lt;/a&gt; works well for this approach or a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Demonologist\"&gt;Master Demonologist&lt;/a&gt; Spec'd Warlock with their Felhunter out, and a magic resistance potion will reduce the damage from the stacked stings. Melee classes that are waiting for a raid member to be sacrificed can use their ranged attacks on Ayamiss as well.\nPhase 2.\nAround 70%, phase 2 begins and Ayamiss lands. He can be &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ed practically anywhere. But a good choice is on top of the altar with the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt;s back against the bordering mountain area. The rest of the battle is the same: melee can jump in, but they still need to watch for grubs. The start of Phase 2 is a complete aggro wipe.\nNOTE: Ayamiss appears to be untauntable, so do not start dps until the tank is comfortable with his aggro - in addition, it would be wise to employ an offtank for when the main tank is being sacrificed as well.\nAnother strategy requires a druid in healing/tank gear to heal ranged tank hard in phase 1, and then proceed to tank Ayamiss during phase 2, as Taunt doesn't work on him and Mocking Blow seems to be parried on every attempt.\nReward.\nReputation (increased in 1.11):"}

She has attained impeccable form and a refined intellect through diligent practice. To Aysa, to follow the way of Tushui and to practice patience, is key to defending what is right. She believes that success in any endeavor never justifies dishonorable deeds. While the Alliance contains a diverse mix of cultures, Aysa is attracted to the high ideals and values that cement the Alliance together.\nAfter the Wandering Isle, Aysa can be found as a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; trainer near the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;, where her pandaren contingent have set up a permanent camp between the two waterfalls above &lt;a href=\"Olivia%27s%20Pond\"&gt;Olivia's Pond&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLi Li's Travel Journal.\nAysa met &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; when Chen's niece was running after &lt;a href=\"Shu\"&gt;Shu&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Wu-Song%20Village\"&gt;Wu-Song Village&lt;/a&gt; but had lost his trail. Aysa advised her to find him by a method of &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAysa and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; met the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Master%20Shang%20Xi\"&gt;Master Shang Xi&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to recover the four elemental spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;. After recovering &lt;a href=\"Huo\"&gt;Huo&lt;/a&gt;, Aysa sent the adventurers to help Ji wake &lt;a href=\"Wugou\"&gt;Wugou&lt;/a&gt;. She realized that &lt;a href=\"Dafeng\"&gt;Dafeng&lt;/a&gt; had been driven into hiding by &lt;a href=\"Zhao-Ren\"&gt;Zhao-Ren&lt;/a&gt;, and that he must be killed in order to ease Dafeng's fears. When the elemental spirits were recovered, the pandaren discovered that the pain of &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; was a thorn - &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;The Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;. Aysa opposed Ji's plan to blow up what was left of the Skyseeker. With the battle between the Horde and the Alliance affecting their land, Aysa chose to join the Alliance. To prove her strength, she fought against the King of the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. \nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAysa took part in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to rescue &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; from the carnage. Ji had been beaten unconscious by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; and was slated for execution, though Aysa helped fight off the orcs and rescued Ji from his predicament. Begging him to live, Aysa promised that the two of them could return to the turtle and be together.\nWar Crimes.\nAysa served as a liaison for the factions and &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; during the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, such as directing them to their appropriate seats. When asked she told &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and some of the other Alliance leaders that Ji was all right after the events of the Siege of Orgrimmar.\nLegion.\nAysa attends the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he was a man who overcame many trials and that they all can all learn from his example.\nTrue to Aysa's words at the Siege of Orgrimmar, she and Ji returned to the Wandering Isle. They can be found in &lt;a href=\"Mandori%20Village\"&gt;Mandori Village&lt;/a&gt; after the isle becomes the monk &lt;a href=\"Order%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt;, teaching monk trainees together.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Aysa can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, she is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAysa is one of the Alliance leaders found in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, expressing \"great respect\" for Anduin but noting that his father Varian was a more capable sparring partner. She is later found meditating at the bow of the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, and says that she is not surprised that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, for the greatest healing can only be found in the greatest wounds.\nAysa was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Aysa and Ji came to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to defend it and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from a potential attack from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Aysa was present at Stormwind Embassy meeting where she learned that the armistice, ending the Fourth War between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, was signed.\nQuotes.\n&lt;Aysa appears deeply lost in her exercises.&gt;\nThe way of the Tushui is one of gaining proper perspective. Through meditation and consideration, we find our way to be the most effective solution to any problem. Through practice and discipline, we honor our bodies to be the perfect implements of our will. To live the way of the Tushui is to be respected both for tempered mind and impeccable form.\n&lt;a href=\"Shu\"&gt;Shu&lt;/a&gt; is precious to us. We need to find him, but he has the tendencies of a young child, so we must not scare him in our approach. I will meditate on where he might be, and how best to reach out to him. Be patient, my friend.\nBe patient with Shu. He acts as if a child, but he is quite ancient, and quite powerful.\nI understand that the mind of the Tushui is not the only path to wisdom, but there are yet choices that should not be accepted. Risks that are too dangerous to ever be taken. Decisions that I cannot forgive\u2026\nIt is time for me to leave Shen-zin Su. I have found respect for &lt;a href=\"Delora%20Lionheart\"&gt;Delora Lionheart&lt;/a&gt; for her confidence and valor, and her tales of the Alliance speak well of her people. I do not yet know if I will find a home there, but wherever my path may lead, I will find a way to help the world beyond this isle.\nDespite everything, I've enjoyed what little time we've had together, &lt;name&gt;. I hope that you might join me, but I understand that this decision is not an easy one.\nStormwind.\nThis city is so unlike anything from home...\nAh, friend, how may I help you?\nStormwind Embassy.\nIt seems like only yesterday that those of us who follow the way of the Tushui pledged to fight for the Alliance.\nThough I have great respect for King Anduin, I must confess that I found his father a more capable sparring partner.\nPlease do not tell him this.\n&lt;Aysa bows.&gt;\nI'm more than happy to help the Alliance find new allies. My first steps into Stormwind were quite daunting, but now I consider it a home.\n\"Wind's Redemption\", Boralus Harbor.\nI am not surprised that Jaina Proudmoore has chosen to return home.\nA wound untreated can never heal.

The volatile &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; lifeblood of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; rushed to the surface and roiled over the world. It was through this event that the Pantheon realized that the Old Gods had embedded themselves too deep in Azeroth's surface to remove without severely harming the world-soul, and so they instead resolved to imprison the vile entities below the surface of the world. After the Old Gods and their &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; minions had been defeated and sealed in their prisons, the titans' most powerful servants \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 set to work to seal the still-bleeding wound. After having labored day and night to construct magic wards around the wound, the tumultuous arcane energies eventually calmed and settled into balance, and the keepers named it the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; dug deep enough into the earth that they were able to find and mine a small vein of Azeroth's blood. &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; fashioned it into the orb on his cane. He believes there is a possibility that this mining operation bears partial responsibility for the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, and it may not have been solely the fault of the Cataclysm.\nLegion.\nAt the climax of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; attempted to destroy Azeroth. Although he was stopped and imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, he did manage to wound the planet in Silithus. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth's world-soul&lt;/a&gt; began to bleed out of the wound inflicted, and as s a result, Azerite began to emerge across the planet. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saw Azerite's potential as a power source and began to fight over it. Realizing that the leaders of both factions didn't even know what Azerite truly was, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; tasked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to deliver his message to their leaders, telling them to heal the wound and not exploit it for power, for Azeroth was the only home they had and they could not allow her to die.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt; off of Silithus's coast, large quantities of Azerite has been discovered and both factions began to fight over it.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; continued to bleed out, she bid &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to call for a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; who could lend her help; in turn, she offered to lend help to them. Magni brought the hero to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the world, where they were given the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to gather Azerite and save the world.\nThe presence of Azerite threw the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; into tumult, with the lesser &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s seeing it as a sign of elemental rebirth.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; used Azerite to create powerful gunpowder and explosives and notably used Azerite weapons to destroy &lt;a href=\"Daelin%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Daelin's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; harvested Azerite throughout &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the power from the stone will fuel their empire. According to &lt;a href=\"Keerin\"&gt;Keerin&lt;/a&gt;, most &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; know better than to go near Azerite due to its volatility, but others don't mind pocketing the \"power rocks\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; empress &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zara\"&gt;Shek'zara&lt;/a&gt; has mobilized most of her forces to search for Azerite. The &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; do not yet know her motives, but they have decided that they don't like it.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s, self-proclaimed &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; earth-warders claimed that the golden world-blood was theirs to protect. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodwake\"&gt;Bloodwake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; fervently sought Azerite for unknown purposes. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; has heard about the mortal races' search for Azerite, and his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; have gathered what they could.\n&lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; was left brimming with Azerite following Sargeras' assault on Azeroth. Seeking to make a fortune and ascend to the title of &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;'s leader &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; focused the company's efforts on weaponizing the mineral and selling it to the highest bidder.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; believed that they, stewards of the titans, should control Azerite.\nShadowlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Heart of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; activated the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to siphon Azerite from the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into the Sepulcher, so that it could power the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Machine of Origination&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of unmaking all of existence. As she was being drained, the Jailer repeatedly attacked Azeroth both physically and with &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic, causing her to bleed Azerite over the chamber floor. Some of it empowered the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s who were fighting Zovaal, but the latter also consumed some to empower and protect himself.\nFollowing the defeat of the Jailer, the Forge of Souls ceased to siphon Azerite from the planet.\nCharacteristics.\nAppearance.\nAzerite comes in two forms: fluid and hardened chunks. It is liquid when it bleeds from the earth and only solidifies when exposed to air. It is surprisingly light in its solid form and once hardened, it cannot be broken by swords, hammers, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s, or the energy pulse from the &lt;a href=\"Crunchola\"&gt;Crunchola&lt;/a&gt;. Armor constructed out of Azerite survived three minutes of bombardment from Sapphronetta's &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Blast%203000\"&gt;Lightning Blast 3000&lt;/a&gt; with only a slight melting of the metal. Azerite's coloration is a combination of icy blue and a golden color similar to honey or amber.\nThe Azerite sample that the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; found below &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; was originally gold and liquid, but when exposed to air it solidified, gradually lost its amazing properties, and changed color to become as red as a drop of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; blood.

Each piece of armor will have no secondary stats but increased primary stat allocation from previous expansion items. It can also always drop at the base item level but cannot be &lt;a href=\"Warforged\"&gt;Warforged&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titanforged\"&gt;Titanforged&lt;/a&gt; or roll any tertiary stats.\nIn addition, each piece will have a number of rings in the &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20interface\"&gt;Azerite interface&lt;/a&gt;, each containing multiple Azerite traits which will augment the player's spec by empowering or modifying existing spells. These Azerite traits are not random on two pieces of the same shoulders, the Azerite traits will always be the same and will not change.\n&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Tides of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; brought \"Season 2\" of the gear to players. In Season 2, with &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and the similar &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; seasons, there is a 5th ring that has two spec-specific trait options for each specialization. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20system\"&gt;emissaries&lt;/a&gt; have a chance to drop beyond ilvl 370.\nAcquiring.\nAzerite Armor can be obtained from the same sources as other pieces of gear which this includes &lt;a href=\"World%20Quest\"&gt;World Quest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt;s and more. However, for Azerite Armor that is item level 340 or higher, Azerite Armor will only drop from sources that are gated through some lockout. This limits the rate that players can earn these pieces, since they can't just farm 50 &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt; dungeons during the first week and get all the best Azerite Armor pieces.\nCompleting each zone and other significant quests, you will be rewarded with a piece of Azerite Armor between item level 270 - 300.\nThese pieces can be farmed from sources with no lockout.\nThese pieces have a lockout preventing players from farming an Azerite piece in quick succession.\nMore limited sources of Azerite Armor are available from &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s and the weekly Mythic+ chest. Mythic+ does not drop Azerite Armor from completing the run.\nFunction.\nEach piece of Azerite Armor is separated into 3, 4, or 5 rings.\nEach ring will allow you to choose one of the Azerite Traits on it and selecting it will rotate the ring so that your chosen Trait is shown at the top! These rings can be seen by Shift-Right Clicking on the piece of Azerite Armor. The effect of Azerite Traits will scale based on the item level of the Azerite Armor -- A higher item level will make the effect of the Traits stronger! \nThe rings unlock one-by-one from the outside to the center. We'll use this color-coded image to explain what each ring contains.\nReforging.\nSometimes, the traits one may chose aren't exactly great for the next boss fight or maybe they just want to try a new combination. Players can't change their traits out in the world, but can visit an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Reforger\"&gt;Azerite Reforger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Bazaar\"&gt;Grand Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; to remove all current Azerite traits from the piece. While the cost is relatively low at first , it will increase in cost the more times it is used. The cost won\u2019t stay that high forever with every two days, the reforge cost decrease."}

The &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Forge\"&gt;Heart Forge&lt;/a&gt; lets players infuse their Heart of Azeroth with Essences to grant new combat-related powers.\nWhich Essences a character can use is based on their &lt;a href=\"class%20role\"&gt;class role&lt;/a&gt;.\nSystem.\nOnce you've collected a new Essence\u2014obtained by participating in a wide variety of content\u2014you'll head to the Heart Forge to infuse your Heart of Azeroth with it, \u201clearning\u201d the Essence and permanently adding it to your collection. Much like Talents, once you've learned an Essence, you'll be able to apply it or swap it out through a new Heart of Azeroth interface within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the Tome of Quiet Mind.\nEach Essence has both Major (generally active) and Minor (passive) abilities. Upon completing the initial quest from Magni, you'll open a single Major slot in the Heart of Azeroth. Placing an Essence in the Major slot grants you that Essence's Major active ability, which is added to your Spellbook. You'll also gain the benefit of any Minor passive abilities from the Essence.\nThere are also two additional Minor slots in the Heart of Azeroth that will activate the Minor (passive) abilities of any Essences added to them. The first Minor slot will become available at Heart of Azeroth level 55, and the second Minor slot will become available at Heart of Azeroth level 65.\nEach Essence has four ranks that provide new effects. Rank 1 provides a unique ability based on your role (damage dealer, tank, or healer), while rank 2 and rank 3 provide enhancements to both the Essence's Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to the spell, providing a unique visual that will make you stand out from the crowd.\nRanks.\nEssences come in four different qualities:\nGallery.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

At its core dwells a slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;nascent spirit&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, it was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, eldritch abominations from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the titans imprisoned the Old Gods deep beneath the earth, before healing and ordering the world, and seeding life across the planet. A great fount of magic that would nurture the land was placed at the center of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, attracted by the Well, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic armies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; found Azeroth and caused the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, two major powers emerged, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Although ravaged by inner conflict and external threats, the peoples of Azeroth have, somehow, always managed to survive.\nGeographical features.\nThe world of Azeroth is comprised of four major &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s, with a number of &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;s scattered about them. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; is located in between the four landmasses, and at the center of it is the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a massive chaotic whirlpool and all that remains of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. To the east lies the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, which is made up of three major regions. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; in the middle, and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the north, these last two separated by a channel and connected by the dwarven bridge of &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. To the west, across the ocean, is &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, which is also divided &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt;. North of the sea lies the frozen continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south the newly discovered landmass of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, which had been isolated and shrouded by &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;dense mists&lt;/a&gt; during the last 10,000 years. The islands of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; have been of major importance in recent events.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; all these continents and islands were one single landmass known as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the name which would live on in the modern western continent. At the end of the war, with the implosion of the Well causing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the landmass shattered into four continents while the sunken land in between became the Great Sea.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forbidding%20Sea\"&gt;Forbidding Sea&lt;/a&gt; is the expanse of water to the east of the Eastern Kingdoms and the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt; sits west of Kalimdor. South of Pandaria lies the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; are two of the tallest mountains on the planet.\nAzeroth has two moons, the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Child\"&gt;Blue Child&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; diverted the magical powers that coursed beneath Azeroth to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, the world's crust splintered, and the resulting unstable rifts tore the very fabric of the magical dimension of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; traveled the cosmos, ordering worlds and searching for additional titans, a miraculous new world, which would later become known as Azeroth, was taking form in a distant corner of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;. Forged by primordial infernos, the world hosted a &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;nascent titan&lt;/a&gt; who stirred to life within its core. As this world-soul developed, she drew in and consumed much of the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, causing Azeroth's native &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to grow increasingly erratic and chaotic. The four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 the ruthlessly cunning &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir the Windlord&lt;/a&gt;, the brutish &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, the protective &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt; and the wise &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon the Tidehunter&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 reveled in strife, constantly clashing with each other and keeping the world in constant flux during the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;. One day, however, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; arrived, plummeting down from the Great Dark and embedding themselves in the world's surface. With the aid of their servants, the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt;, the eldritch horrors established the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and though the Elemental Lords attempted to extinguish what they saw as a threat to their dominion, the elementals were eventually enslaved.\nAzeroth eventually attracted the attention of the wandering &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, who fought the Old Gods in a war of ordering the world and shaping it with artifacts known as the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Though the elementals were powerful beyond mortal comprehension, their combined forces could not stop the mighty titans. One by one, the elemental lords fell, and their forces dispersed. The Pantheon shattered the Old Gods' citadels and, after killing at least &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, they cast the remaining ones down into eternal imprisonment deep beneath the earth, the place of their confinement hidden from all and their powers bound until the end of time. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. With the help of their constructs (the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s), the titans paved new landscapes and shaped the world as they saw fit, allowing life to flourish on Azeroth. Satisfied, the titans built hidden cities for their construct creations and created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Great Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to guard the planet before leaving on their cosmic journey.\nBefore leaving, the titans created an enormous lake filled with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy, known as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of the great landmass of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The Well accelerated the cycles of growth and rebirth, and soon intelligent races evolved from the land's primitive life forms. The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s were among the first and most prolific. Though the various troll tribes varied greatly in culture and traditions, they all shared a common religion centered around the elusive &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, or \"&lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;\", mysterious and powerful beings that originated from Azeroth itself. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful troll tribe, established the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and a great civilisation upon the summit of the sacred &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; mountain range, where many of the trolls' honored loa dwelt. Soon, however, splinter factions of the Zandalari left Zuldazar seeking war and conquest, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; empires. Later, the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;i empire of &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt; rose in the west, forcing the trolls to better defend their major holdings. With pressure from their trollish enemies, the empire of the aqir collapsed and split into the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms.\nAfter their war with the aqir, the trolls controlled most of Kalimdor. A group of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s distanced themselves from their warlike brethren, instead dwelling in cavernous tunnel networks beneath &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding areas. Eventually, some of the dark trolls began migrating towards the heart of Kalimdor, establishing villages along the way and in time re-discovering the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. One of the dark troll tribes settled upon its shores, and the magic of the Well uplifted them into powerful and virtually immortal beings that would later become known as the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, or \"kaldorei\". Using the potent magics of the Well of Eternity, the elves broke troll influence in many regions and established a magocratic empire. At the height of kaldorei power, however, their reckless use of magic attracted the demonic armies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; summoned the Burning Legion into the world, sparking the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves not loyal to Azshara, along with their &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt; allies, were forced to destroy the Well, which caused a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that split the ancient supercontinent of Kalimdor apart, creating several smaller continents: &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;), and \"&lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFollowing the war, there was a schism among the elves. The night elves abandoned their arcane heritage, instead embracing &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism under the tutelage of the first druid, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The kaldorei, with the help of the Great Aspects, planted the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; on top of the last remaining waters of the Well of Eternity, in order to protect and heal Azeroth. However, the Highborne refused to give up arcane magic. Fearing their use of magic would cause another demonic invasion, the night elves banished the Highborne from Kalimdor. Renaming themselves &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, the former servants of Azshara sailed across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in the north of Lordaeron, establishing the mighty kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. There, they rediscovered the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, who still had a strong force over the land. Soon the two cultures clashed in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. With support from the young race of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, the high elves broke and scattered what remained of the Amani empire.\nMeanwhile, on Kalimdor, the night elves were forced to fight with the reawakened &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters, in what would be called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Bent on exterminating all non-insectoid life, the qiraji clashed with the night elves on the sands of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of their ancient &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; allies, the kaldorei were able to defeat the insectoid empire, and closed the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; in order to seal the insectoid race inside &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending the war. \nLiving in peace within their mountain homes, the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt; descendants of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-forged &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, prospered. However, when their high king, &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, passed, a struggle for power over the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; began. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; ensued, forcing dwarf against dwarf and split the dwarves into three clans; the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Bronzebeards defeated the other two and banished them from the city. The Wildhammers went north and founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, settling the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons went south and founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. Angered by their defeat, the Dark Irons prepared two armies to destroy their cousins. However, both of these armies were defeated. Combining their forces, the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer marched to Thaurissan to end the Dark Irons once and for all. Sensing impending defeat, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; accidentally summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. The resulting destruction formed &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and halted the advance of the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer armies, but doomed the Dark Irons to centuries of servitude to the Firelord.\nGreat Wars.\nThough the Legion constantly sought to re-enter Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, through its agent, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, ensured that the demons were kept at bay. However, thousands of years after the War of the Ancients, the Burning Legion attempted to destroy Azeroth once more, this time indirectly. The demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; forced the once peaceful &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. Manipulating the orc &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and possessing the human &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the last Guardian of Tirisfal, the Legion was able to open a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; between both worlds, and the orcs poured through into Azeroth. The extended conflict with these alien invaders became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, during which time the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, as well as establishing strongholds in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. However, the mighty Horde was eventually broken and scattered by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Feeling the effects of their demonic blood rage dissipate as they languished in internment camps, the orcs were able to remember their peaceful, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic roots. Sensing this change, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; set about establishing a new Horde.\nAngered by the Horde's failure, the Burning Legion prepared for yet another invasion, the culmination of their efforts, on both continents. The Legion sent its pawn, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to undermine the Azerothian defenses. After establishing his base in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and defeating the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King set loose in the East a plague of undeath on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that the Legion so despised. This undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; quickly broke the northern powers, demoralizing the people of the Eastern Kingdoms in preparation for a Legion offensive. Lured to north by the Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron became his death knight pawn and the instrument of his liberation from the Legion's grasp. The Scourge under Arthas scattered the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, obliterated Lordaeron and broke the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; in Quel'Thalas. \nIn the West, the demons and their &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; allies made a more direct assault on their old kaldorei enemies. In desperation, the elves turned to &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, a demon hunter from the War of the Ancients who had violated druidic law and had been imprisoned for ten thousand years. During the course of the conflict, Illidan was persuaded by the insidious Arthas to attack the demon known as &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and drink from the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; (a small part in the Lich King's greater scheme to emancipate himself from his Legion jailers).\nThrough the machinations of the then cleansed Medivh, leaders of the New Horde and the Alliance were drawn to Kalimdor. While traveling Thrall's Horde forged powerful alliances with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; exiles and the native tauren of Kalimdor. In Kalimdor the Alliance and Horde joined with the night elves to thwart the Legion advance into &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; was vulnerable to demonic attack. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the daemonic invasion, as well as most of his followers, were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent times.\nConcerned with the separatist Scourge, Kil'jaeden solicited the half-demonic Illidan into destroying the source of the Lich King's power. With the aid of his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; allies, who he had recalled from the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, he succeeded in breaking at least some of the Lich King's power. Hounded by his night elf jailers and the seething &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was unable to complete his task. Suffering under the effects of magical withdrawal, the blood elves were persuaded to enter into the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath, Illidan and his allies fled to the decimated world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There, Illidan toppled the regime of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; to become the new ruler of Outland.\nThe weakening of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; allowed some of the Scourge to regain their free will. Under the Banshee Queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; managed to force the Legion-controlled undead from the ruins of Lordaeron and establish a stronghold beneath its streets. Arthas, meanwhile, fought a desperate battle in Northrend to save his master from the newly empowered lord of Outland, who under increasing threats from Kil'jaeden had taken up his quest to destroy the Lich King once more. Illidan was defeated by Arthas and retreated to Outland, while Arthas merged with the malicious spirit of the Lich King.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the political landscape of Azeroth changed greatly. The orcish nation of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; was established in Kalimdor, as was the human colony of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves joined the Alliance, and the Forsaken joined the New Horde. The remaining citizens of Lordaeron, broken by the Scourge, formed new regimes: the xenophobic and zealous &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the compassionate &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, citizens that stayed in Lordaeron along with the refugees that fled to the remaining Alliance strongholds such as &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. With the armies of the Horde and the Alliance decimated by the Third War, the defense of their borders became the responsibility of small bands of heroes and adventurers.\nAt some point, Azeroth had been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels. The &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; struggled to determine the effects these changes had caused, and some of them feared the worst, as the flow of magic in Stormwind City and &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; was somehow altered.\nAfter a thousand years of waiting, the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; stirred within the confines of their city. Unleashing it's armies once more, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; wished to destroy all life on the world and leave nothing but chaos in its wake. Silithid began attacking the areas all around their fortress, attracting the attention of both the Alliance and Horde. With no other choice, the two were forced to work together and created the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the dragonflights, they recreated the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. With it, they used its power to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; and entered the ruined city. There, they defeated the Silithid and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters. Adventurers fought their way through the city and finally reached the Chamber of C'Thun. After a long battle with the great beast, C'Thun was defeated and his remnants were brought to Caelestrasz. And so, the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt; came to an end. \nAfter major threats in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; were neutralized by Horde and Alliance forces in the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Qiraji War-Effort&lt;/a&gt;, the power-blocks once more formed a tentative alliance in response to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde formed an alliance of necessity with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, while the Alliance warily welcomed the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; exiles into their ranks. The &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; was fought on multiple fronts and against numerous factions. The greatest threat was the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who, after their defeat on Hyjal, were mobilizing their forces for yet another invasion of Azeroth, this time via Outland. Finally, Illidan's hegemony in Outland proved to be short-lived. After losing the support of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, whose addiction to fel energy led him to side with the Legion, the scattered coalition of naga, &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and demons called the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;i and Azerothian forces. After the destruction of the Illidari and his own defeat, Kael'thas returned to Azeroth, where he planned to restore his beloved Sunwell as a means of summoning &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, his new master, into Azeroth. To counter this, the opposing factions in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, joined with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; marched upon the Sunwell, slaying Kael'Thas and forcing Kil'jaeden back to the Twisting Nether. Using the power of the fallen &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; ignited the Sunwell, thus returning the blood elves' power.\nDragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; after thousands of years regained his sanity and saw that magic had run amok throughout the world of Azeroth, and blamed this on the reckless use of magic by the mortal races that had arisen in his ten millennia of isolation. Using the powerful &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, he began to siphon magic from the world. Realizing that Malygos had become a very real threat, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; used what remaining powers they had to magically transfer the rebuilt city of Dalaran to the skies of Northrend to combat their new foe in what would be called the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. Malygos' actions have also incurred the ire of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by the Dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. Forming an alliance with the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflights\"&gt;dragonflights&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; sought to end Malygos' war. The final blow against Malygos was struck thanks to the efforts of mortal heroes where they were joined by drakes of the red dragonflight. With the combined strength of the heroes and the drakes, Malygos was defeated.\nAfter years of sitting dormant, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke and began his invasion of Azeroth. Defending their major holdings from a Scourge incursion in Kalimdor and Azeroth, the Horde-Alliance blocks, emboldened by their conquest of Outland, launched a final joint offensive on the Scourge forces in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, starting the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Their efforts were bolstered thanks to an internal rebellion against the Scourge by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the newly created &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, led by the paladin &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde-Alliance entente ended with the crisis at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Their joint forces were routed at the gates to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; when a separatist faction of Forsaken bombarded the living and dead alike with their new strain of blight. The fragile truce was shattered by this event, and both sides almost entered into an open war once again. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, their separate efforts were enough to finally breach the walls of Icecrown. In a final battle, Tirion and the combined forces of the Horde and Alliance shattered Frostmourne and ended the Lich King. &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; took the responsibility to became the new undead king, in order to keep the Scourge forces at bay.\nSoon after, the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; launched his attack against Azeroth from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Forcing people to lay trapped within their own nightmares, he used these victims to attack those unaffected by the nightmare. And so, the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; began. However, led by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the people from Azeroth were able to fight back. Using their dreamforms, they took the battle to the Emerald Nightmare where they freed &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and confronted the Nightmare Lord and his army. With the help of druids on the waking world, Malfurion was eventually able to destroy the Nightmare Lord's power source, both in the Emerald Dream and on Azeroth. People awoke from their nightmares and things returned to normal. The Horde and the Alliance tried once again to make a treaty, mostly because both groups needed to recover from the recent wars. But this treaty was not meant to last.\nDeep within &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of earth in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; had been waiting, recovering from the wounds of his last battle against Azeroth and biding his time until he could reforge the world in molten fire. Some time after the end of the War against the Lich King, Deathwing returned to Azeroth, and &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;his eruption from Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; massively damaged the world. The kingdoms of Azeroth witnessed seismic shifts in power, the kindling of a war of the elements, and a return to &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;open war between the Horde and the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the powerful &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing sought out to destroy the world in molten flame. Coming to the conclusion that the only way to defeat the great &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspects and Thrall agreed they would need the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to end him. While Thrall retrieved it from the past, the Wyrmrest Accord and their mortal allies battled the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of Deathwing at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. On his way to hand over the Demon Soul, Thrall was attacked by the new leader of the nearly extinct Twilight's Hammer, the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating him, Thrall returned the Demon Soul to the Aspects who empowered it. After unleashing it's wrath upon Deathwing, the great dragon was finally destroyed at the Maelstrom. With the powers of the Aspects gone, the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Mortals\"&gt;Age of Mortals&lt;/a&gt; began.\nAnother threat that the world faced was in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;, a force that could annihilate all life, and &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Highlord Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to an &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;unknown naaru&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Order of the Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, the world was protected until his brother &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the order, joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and destroyed the naaru with the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the sword in the process and blasting its shards across the world. The naaru's essence survived in the crystal shards so the Darkstorm couldn't come. The naaru guided Greydon, and later his son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; to collect the shards and reforge the sword. The same order gave Xaraax to Silverlaine, now known as Malus, and his &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;. Upon capturing the &lt;a href=\"Thorne\"&gt;Thorne&lt;/a&gt;s, Makasa found and reforged the Blade. Wanting to free their family from Xaraax's &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, she raised an army of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s, and various individuals. Makasa led the force to the citadel, fighting her way to the top to Xaraax. He managed to take the blade and began corrupting it. However, he had deemed Malus unuseful, and now, Malus took the dreadlord's former fel sword, impaled him on it and tossed him into the Darkstorm. The fight went on, but eventually, the Thornes and their friends bested the majority of the demons and the evil Hidden. Outnumbered, Makasa, with assistance from Aram, quickly ended his life. With Malus' demise, the Darkstorm evaporated.\nAfter the world was finally free from the grip of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s destructive rampage, the conflict between the Alliance and Horde began to intensify to an unprecedented scale, especially after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Theramore\"&gt;Battle for Theramore&lt;/a&gt; which led to a massive uproar in the other Alliance nations and a full retaliation. The discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the pandaren clans of &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt;, and their newly found allegiance have brought the tales of their mystical homeland of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to the attention of the warring factions, which hope to gain the favor of its inhabitants and gain their natural resources, as the land is undamaged by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm's&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nThe arrival of the Alliance and Horde in Pandaria and their war led to a large disturbance in the emotional harmony of Pandaria. The newcomers' hate, anger, violence, doubt, despair, fear, and pride manifested as &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;, ancient deadly creatures created by the Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;'s last breath. For thousands of years, the pandaren learned to contain their negative emotions, in turn, to contain the Sha from wreaking havoc. Brave adventurers managed to purge the Sha one by one, but as they did so, other forces were at work. The &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies resurrected &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; the ancient emperor of the mogu. The &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; of the lands beyond the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; fell under the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to attack the great wall separating them from pandaren lands. Also attacking the nomadic &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to also attack the pandaren to escape. Lei Shen's forces gathered at his &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;seat of power&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for a great invasion of Pandaria. The Alliance and Horde were quick to land forces on the island to stop Lei Shen, and he was soundly defeated and killed forever at the steps of his throne. The power-hungry Warchief of the Horde &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; began to attempt to use Sha corruption to infuse Horde warriors. After discovering a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;terrible hidden artifact&lt;/a&gt; through goblin excavation, he used its power to corrupt the great &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, killing most of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Returning to Orgrimmar, he built a great underground citadel for his plans of conquering Azeroth and creating a pure orcish Horde. His actions eventually led a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in his ranks to ally with the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;lay siege&lt;/a&gt; to Orgrimmar. Most of Garrosh's followers were killed, captured or happened to escape during the chaos of the battle, the war between the Alliance and Horde was proclaimed to have ended, and the rebellion took control of the city and began to rebuild. Garrosh was then taken to Pandaria to await trial.\nGarrosh escaped with the help of &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20universe\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; of past . The former warchief created the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and had the two universes connected through the Dark Portal. The Iron Horde's invasion force, the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;, attacked and razed the settlements of Blasted Lands, eventually triggering the heroes of the Horde and Alliance for a counterattack to Draenor itself. The &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;campaign in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; resulted in demons taking over the Iron Horde thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. When the natives with the Azerothian forces defeated corrupted orcs and their demonic masters, Gul'dan was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. From there the diabolical orc was sent to Azeroth and he opened a portal for the demons on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Pouring from the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; above the Tomb of Sargeras, the Burning Legion began their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth.\nAzeroth ultimately survived the invasion and ended the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, but not without scars. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth in Silithus forming the . Cracks began occurring all across the planet's surface, the planet hemorrhaging its '&lt;a href=\"azerite\"&gt;life-blood&lt;/a&gt;,' spilling to the surface as a blue-gold substance. As it emerged, it crystalized into thrumming spires reaching towards the sky. The scrambling over this new substance would ignite the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the Alliance and Horde. The two sides recruit &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;new allies&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their depleted ranks.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; declared that Azeroth was made free of the grasp of the Old Gods.\nIn the RPG.\nThe term Azeroth is a human word and is derived from the term used for the ancient primitive-humans that lived on the world pre-sundering, the &lt;a href=\"Azotha\"&gt;Azotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said that when the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; brought the scattered human tribes together as the empire of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, they named the land as a whole in homage to their ancient ancestors: Azeroth. It is unclear whether they named the world or named the continent."}

It can be assumed that, when the game was released, the kingdom and land of Azeroth were one and the same.

The &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; believed her to have such great potential that should she ever awaken, she would become the most powerful titan ever seen\u2014even more powerful than the mighty &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and strong enough to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s by herself. For this reason, Sargeras came to see Azeroth as a threat, and set on destroying her before she could be corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBackground.\nThe Black Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are extremely violent and chaotic, because as its vast world-soul developed, it consumed much of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; of the planet, which balances the elements.\nOne day, as the titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; was wandering in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, he heard the tranquil dreams of the most powerful world-soul the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; had ever encountered, one they would later name Azeroth. To his horror, he discovered that the planet had already been claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, though the defenseless world-soul within remained as yet untouched. After Aggramar and &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; convinced their brethren to save Azeroth from corruption, the Pantheon crafted the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; to do battle against the Old Gods, before eventually imprisoning them deep beneath the surface of the planet.\nThe destruction of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, who was pulled from the surface of the planet by &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, caused the nascent titan to bleed out. Her bleeding would be halted with magical wards by the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28titanic%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt;, and the immense lake left behind when the tumultuous arcane energies calmed became known as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ordering.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; was constructed by the Keepers to shape Azeroth's budding sentience, while its twin the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; would regulate the rhythm of deep earth and fortify the world-soul's form.\nThough some believe that &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; wove the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; into being from nothing, others claim that this strange place had always existed in some form, a dream born from Azeroth's slumbering world-soul. It is said that Freya tapped into this realm and molded what would become known as the Emerald Dream as a way to commune with the nascent titan.\nSargeras' vision.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different.\nSoon after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded, but instead of being cast back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, this time he was dragged down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth's slumbering world-soul\u2014and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured.\nSince then, the eye of Azeroth's world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; wings, a testament to Sargeras's conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt; to drain what would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; of life, even Azeroth's slumbering world-soul quailed. The spell ripped open a magical nexus of unspeakable force, over which the Guardian &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; would one day build &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern times.\nWhile the Pantheon had told the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; many things, they did not tell them about Azeroth's slumbering titan spirit. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; to redirect &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s and eject arcane from the planet upset the equilibrium of the world, sparking natural disasters from Northrend to the southern tips of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. If Malygos hadn't been stopped, these disasters would have spiraled out of control and caused irreparable harm to Azeroth's world-soul.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; dug deep enough into the earth that they were able to find a small vein and mine &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azeroth's blood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; fashioned it into the orb on his cane. He believes there is a possibility that this mining operation bears partial responsibility for the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, and it may not have been solely the fault of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe has been able to heal her wounds caused by the Cataclysm.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth chose &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; king who became one with the earth just before the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, as her speaker. It was Magni who revealed to the people of Azeroth that she was a titan.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; tried to take control &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s body in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt; roars that the Dark Titan will claim Azeroth.\nAzeroth contacted Magni to tell him about the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Observatory\"&gt;Primordial Observatory&lt;/a&gt; beneath the ocean near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, though as Magni would explain to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; she did not do so in words but rather in \"feelings\". He described it as feeling like a sunrise. The reason she directed Magni there was so he would find the &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s: creatures that the titans had infused with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s. Azeroth knew the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; would protect the seekers and use them in the service of the Light.\nWhen Azeroth tried to send Magni a message, something wasn't right and some force was interfering. Magni requested aid in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where he revealed the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Communion\"&gt;Hall of Communion&lt;/a&gt; accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Makers%27%20Overlook\"&gt;Makers' Overlook&lt;/a&gt;. The Hall of Communion had been built by the titans to watch over the world-soul, and from within it Magni could hear her clear as diamond. They discovered that what was wrong was that Azeroth was afraid. After fighting off phantoms of Azeroth's nightmares made manifest, which took the form of minions of the Burning Legion and Old Gods, and reactivating &lt;a href=\"Damaged%20Construct\"&gt;Damaged Construct&lt;/a&gt;s, Azeroth revealed that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was on his way to Azeroth and that their destiny lay on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the climax of the Legion's invasion, Sargeras attempted to destroy Azeroth. Although he was stopped and imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, he did manage to wound her in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Like she did when Y'Shaarj was removed, Azeroth began to bleed out of the wound Sargeras inflicted, forming a pool of blood in the area that could be compared to the Well of Eternity.\nAided by the heroes of Azeroth and their powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapons, Speaker Magni Bronzebeard was able to stabilize the planet's grievous wound. Azeroth was stable, but the road to healing her fully would require much more than a temporary bandage. The events in Silithus were just the first step in aiding the planet.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the start of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth bid Magni to call for a hero who could lend her help. The Speaker brought the hero to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the world, where they were given the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The path to restoring Azeroth would consist in gathering &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and healing the world-soul through the Heart. In doing so, the Heart would also empower the hero in turn. Magni told the hero to keep the necklace close to them at all times while he continued to search for ways to undo the damage done to Azeroth. He would be able to contact the hero through the necklace if need be.\nEventually, Magni and Brann brought &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt;, a titanic watcher from &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, to the Chamber of Heart so that she could analyze Azeroth and find a way to heal her. With the help of Magni, MOTHER, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and many adventurers, the final Old God, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was defeated. The wound, however, still remains.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; and his servants claimed that &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; would soon come for the soul of Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; thought so too, but believed that it could be saved with the help of the mortals.\nWhen the Jailer gained access to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, he used the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to draw out her lifeblood, &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, and use it to power the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Machine of Origination&lt;/a&gt; after he attuned its control pylons, in order to unmake all existence and remake the cosmos under his dominance. Azeroth resisted Zovaal's assault despite his efforts and in the end, he was struck down by her champions. With his death, the tear in the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; above Icecrown Citadel closed and her lifeblood ceased being drawn into the machine. It is unknown what damage the Jailer caused to Azeroth in the process. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; said that when Zovaal tried to pull Azeroth's soul into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, her screams of agony nearly split his head in two.\nAccording to Magni, since Azeroth's spirit was restored after the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, it's like she's started to sing a new song, a melody of hope and healing, and it feels as though a new age is dawning.\nDragonflight.\nAs Azeroth reawakens, primal forces and the life energies of Azeroth are expressed throughout the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nFrom what little has been gleaned of Azeroth's personality, typically communicated through her Speaker, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, she appears to have the demeanor of a frightened child. She suffers horrific nightmares based around the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and other threats to her, and pleads Magni to stay with, and speak with her after she was wounded by Sargeras' &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, similar to how a parent would comfort a child. Magni has compared Azeroth's voice to a song. There's beauty in it, even when her message is unclear.\nSpeculation.\nRetroactive plot effects.\nSince the revelation that Azeroth is, in fact, a titan, certain quotes might have gained new meanings retroactively.\nPrince Renathal.\nPrince Renathal seems to be aware of Azeroth, and is one of the only non-Eternal One inhabitants of the Shadowlands to possess this knowledge prior to meeting her champions. He even goes as far as suggesting \"she has been quite busy of late\", possibly implying activity in the eternal conflict between the six powers, or simply her ongoing self-defense against outsiders seeking to exploit her or her home's resources.\nVol'jin.\nGiven that Azeroth seemingly has the power to give her chosen champions exemption from some of the rules of the Shadowlands, including the Maw, and that Vol'jin's current state is said to be linked to the same power as the Maw Walker's, it may be that Azeroth was the \"hand of valor\" that touched him.

{"id": "127751", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127751", "title": "Azeroth magic", "text": "Azeroth magic, plural Azeroth magiks or Azeroth magics, has existed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; since the titans created the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The Well's energies evolved the nearby &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, who harnessed its power. Disagreements over magic divided the ancient kaldorei empire, and magic was at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, which caused the first major war and split &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; into the continents that cover Azeroth today. Magic has played a role in every major conflict in Azeroth, and was instrumental in the creation of not only the Burning Legion but also the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoes this mean magic is evil, however? Does it mean the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stands against all magic?\nNot at all.\nThe Alliance recognizes that magic is a tool. It can be misused, as it has been many times throughout history. But it can also be used wisely, to aid people and to minimize dangers and combat evil. Indeed, against foes like the Scourge and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s magic is one of the only weapons available. The Alliance would be foolish not to recognize that and take advantage of it when their enemies are so willing to grasp the same power for their own purposes.\nAt the same time, the Alliance is wary of magic, particularly arcane magic. &lt;a href=\"Divine\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; magic is far more benevolent, coming as it does from well-intentioned gods or directly from nature. But arcane magic draws from the Well of Eternity, which was not part of Azeroth until created by the titans, themselves outsiders. And arcane magic is far more vulnerable to corruption.\nOf course, the Alliance is not a unified front. It is a loose collection of like-minded races and individuals, each with their own beliefs and convictions. Each of the Alliance races has a different attitude toward magic, based upon history and hard experience.\nIronforge dwarves.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; traditionally had little use for magic. They are creatures of earth and stone, and understand the physical far better than the mystical. The fact that elves are more prone to magic use (and abuse) may have something to do with the dwarves' antipathy toward both that race and that realm \u2014 magic is strange and elusive and impossible to grasp and hold and measure, just as elves are sly and slippery.\nThis attitude has changed recently, however. As the dwarves discover more about their own heritage, they are re-evaluating their stance on the world around them. The titans were clearly masters of magic, having created the Well of Eternity. They also created the dwarves, which means the dwarves and the source of Azeroth's arcane magic share a common ancestor. Does that mean dwarves might possess an innate gift for magic as well, thanks to this shared heritage? Perhaps.\nThe dwarves' newly rediscovered history is also causing new interest in divine magic. The titans were majestic creatures, akin to gods, and supposedly they personally fashioned and breathed life into the dwarven people. That gives the entire race a direct connection to their creators, something that can easily inspire belief. More Ironforge dwarves have become religious recently as a result, either in efforts to communicate with their progenitors or as a way of following their footsteps.\nOf course, many &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; still frown on magic, both arcane and divine. This is particularly true with older dwarves. These elders still favor steel and stone over magic, and disapprove of their children's new fascination with such strange rituals. Over time, however, as more and more young dwarves not only study magic but grow proficient with it, this attitude will shift farther, until the race as a whole at least tolerates its presence.\nWildhammer dwarves.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarf&lt;/a&gt; culture is different from that of their cousins in Ironforge. Wildhammers live out in the world, residing in forests and mountains rather than in caves. They spend their days out under the sky and surrounded by animals. Though no less pragmatic, this lifestyle has left Wildhammers with a greater appreciation for nature, and a greater admiration for natural beauty, majesty and freedom. As a result, Wildhammers have always been more religious than their cousins, though their religion is nature-worship. Divine magic is well known and highly respected, particularly any magic involving animals, weather and air.\nArcane magic is less common, and most Wildhammers are wary around magi. Study is not a common practice among these dwarves, who prefer climbing and riding to reading, and any dwarf who buries himself in books is a matter for concern. At the same time, Wildhammers are more accepting of individual quirks and so more tolerant when one of their own wants to do something unusual. They may not understand why anyone would spend his days buried in dusty tomes rather than riding gryphons, but they will not force him to abandon his own interests.\nThe Wildhammers know their true heritage but they show no interest in pursuing it. To them, the titans are still only legends and myths; the world is their home, the sky their parent. This means the Wildhammers' attitudes toward magic may not shift as much as the Ironforges', but they are already more tolerant toward the arcane and more attuned to the divine; so the cousins may grow closer in their views rather than farther apart.\nHigh elves.\nThe high elves are considered the most magically attuned race, having descended from the Highborne of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Since their introduction to the Eastern Kingdoms, they have cultivated their magical arts to raise themselves as a force of power. Their practice and dependence upon magic has also developed a weakness, causing them to develop a magical addiction that became noticeable with the destruction of the Sunwell; a font of eternal magical energy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; predecessors had a lot to answer for, particularly when it comes to magic. Some blame them for the Burning Legion gaining entrance to Azeroth, and thus for Kalimdor being shattered and the various races being dragged into war. If not for the elves' obsession with the arcane, they say, none of this would have happened. Demons would not have gained a foothold in this world, the Scourge would never have existed.\nHowever, these people misunderstand the high elves. High elves long knew that arcane magic was dangerous, and built &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s around Quel'Thalas to hide their arcane magic from the Legion. High elves also helped establish the Guardians of Tirisfal to further protect the world from arcane magic's dangers \u2014 though, as all know, the Legion insinuated itself into the world anyway.\nIn ancient times, the Highborne simply didn't believe that arcane magic could be bad. Today high elves are particularly susceptible to (arcane) magical addiction because of their magic withdrawal subsequent to Arthas's pollution of the Sunwell. High elves created the Sunwell shortly after founding Quel'Thalas; since that time, all high elves everywhere could draw upon that powerful arcane magic.\nThey were bathed in power every second of every day. Some high elves never knew anything else: they had the Sunwell all their lives, up until recently. With the destruction of the Sunwell, every single high elf suffered acute pangs of withdrawal and had a hard time of it. Some of them know why. Some of them didn't. The Sunwell has since been restored and with it the once constant source of magical energy to sustain the high elves.\nThe events of the desturction of the Sunwell inspired the schism that created the blood elves. Most of the survivors of the attack of the Scourge upon Quel'thalas took up the name of Sin'dorei (\"Children of the Blood\") to honor the fallen. The Blood elves were changed by the hardships they endured, becoming fiercer and more re silent, gaining a new perspective of the world. Blood elves have a different set of priorities and behaviors than high elves and no longer consider themselves high elves, though they are still very much the same race.\nHigh elves have held a long association with the Holy Light, as well. Though few become paladins, their priests proved invaluable in the Third War. High elves understand the importance of both arcane and divine magic.\nSome high elves practice nature magic, such as the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elven%20druid\"&gt;elven druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight elves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; are the opposite of their cousins, the high elves, in many ways, but particularly in their attitudes toward magic. After the War of the Ancients, the night elves recognized the magical addiction of their kin and pulled away from it, resisting magic's lure and maintaining their discipline despite its temptation. They urged their brethren, the Highborne, to resist as well; but the Highborne surrendered to the magic, trusting their own intellects to control its flow. This sundered the race. Ever since, night elves have viewed arcane magic as, if not evil itself, at least as something too powerful for anyone to control. Those who study the arcane do so at not only their own risk but the risk of everyone around them, and it is sheer arrogance to think anyone could tame such a force and bend it to her will.\nThe night elves turned to nature and their Eternals for protection instead, and over the centuries they developed a deep and abiding love for the world and all its creatures. Night elves commune with the world, seeking to understand it, and as a result it is common for a night elf to become a healer, particularly a druid or priestess of the moon. This occupation is a high calling, and night elves revere their druids and their priestesses of the moon. Druids comprise about 8% of the night elf population; though some outsiders believe they rule the race, that is not the case. The Sentinels command the rest of night elf society (not including druids). Priestesses of Elune, who answer to Tyrande Whisperwind, direct the Sentinels.\nEvery race has its rebels, of course, and so some night elves believe they have been removed from the Well long enough to have overcome its lure. These young night elves believe they can study the arcane arts without fear, and finally master the skills that overwhelmed their ancestors, using the Well's magic to repair the damage done so long ago. Most night elves consider this preposterous, and believe their kin have become high elves in all but name, falling into the same trap those cousins do and thus heading toward the same dire fate. Many night elf elders believe these misguided children should be shown the error of their ways by any means necessary, to save not only them but the rest of the race and even the world.\nFurbolgs.\nDespite their size and strength the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s are a quiet, unassuming race. They live in small tribal villages and keep to themselves. Because they keep their lives uncomplicated and live so close to nature, furbolgs are closely attuned to the world around them, particularly animals. Every furbolg tribe has its shaman, and they are held in high regard. Because of this furbolgs have great respect for any divine spellcaster, but particularly for druids and shaman.\nThey believe the world speaks to its people through every plant and animal; those who learn that language are simply more blessed because they can communicate more directly with nature and thus better understand its needs and desires.\nFurbolgs have little understanding of arcane magic, however. Arcane magic involves bending the world to one's will, and that concept is antithetical to furbolg philosophy. As a race, furbolgs believe in living within nature, adapting to its demands and thus finding harmony with the world around them. Arcanists destroy that harmony, wresting control from nature and forcing it to serve them instead, and in many ways this is a gross violation. Because of this belief furbolgs do not trust arcanists, seeing them as either fools with delusions of control or madmen meddling with forces they cannot comprehend and should not touch. They also see arcane magic as a tool of the Legion, which corrupted many of their people. Those few furbolgs who study the arcane learn to do so quietly lest their tribes find out and punish them for such arrogance.\nGnomes.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are bright, curious, friendly people. They love questioning, love inventing, and love exploring \u2014 all of which makes them oddly suitable for arcane study. Yet most gnomes have too much humor and humility to become enamored of their own power, or to look down upon others. This attitude is a great relief to those who have seen gnome magi in action, because if they had the same arrogance as blood elves or ambition as humans, gnome spellcasters could pose a serious threat to the world.\nGnomes are far less likely to follow the path of divine magic. Most of them are too grounded in earthly desires and too distracted by spiritual pursuits to become devout, or even to pay much attention to the various Eternals and religious philosophies. Gnomes revere creature comforts and creativity more than nature or any particular being, no matter how grand.\nGnomes do not look down upon healers, however. In many ways the gnomes respect such people because they cannot imagine following such a path themselves. They can see the merits of a devout life, and the clear results of divine favor, but have no interest in pursuing such activities. Many gnomes feel that way about arcane magic as well \u2014 they admire the results, and respect the dedication, but are not willing to spend all their time in such pursuits. The gnomes tolerate magic, perhaps more than any other Alliance race, because they are content to let others follow their own interests. Most gnomes are not concerned about the risk of magi creating another magical cataclysm, especially since they are always ready to interrogate each mage, get his advice, and then deflate his ego and help keep him from becoming power-mad.\nHumans.\nMembers of the other races sometimes feel that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s could be their salvation \u2014 or their destruction. Humanity has demonstrated time and again its capacity for overpowering passion, levels of emotion far beyond what their allies consider seemly or even approachable. Coupled with this passion is a burning ambition, not just of an individual but of the race as a whole \u2014 humans wish not just to survive but to improve and to win. This makes them incredibly useful, incredibly strong, and incredibly dangerous.\nNowhere is human potential more evident than in the realm of magic. The high elves taught humans arcane magic and were astonished to discover their short-lived students' capacities. Many human magi succeeded where others failed \u2014 and not because they were wiser or smarter, but because they would not surrender control. Yet despite this, humanity does not have the arcane addiction the high elves suffer. Some humans become obsessed with the arcane, but many want nothing to do with it and are perfectly happy avoiding all signs of magic. In the same way, some humans have no use for &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; but others show a religious fervor unmatched by the most devout night elf or the most reverent furbolg. Druidism is more difficult for humans, because it involves quiet contemplation and a sense of one's own inferiority compared to the needs of the whole; but some humans have the necessary concentration, consideration and calm and have become exemplary wardens of the wild.\nAs a race, humanity is fascinated by magic. More people want it than don't, and even those who want no part of magic love hearing tales of its use and seeing demonstrations of its might. Humanity's gift and curse is its youth. Many claim the race is young compared to its allies, and so humans as a whole have not learned caution. They listen to the tales of magi corrupted by their studies, and believe such a disaster could never happen to them. They hear about healers who lost faith and pity the other races for being weak or losing discipline. Humans believe they can overcome any obstacle, and do not understand that some obstacles are insurmountable by their nature. This arrogance gives humans a great advantage when daring some new feat, or striving against a powerful foe, but it also makes them overconfident and easily lured into bad situations.\nContact with the other races has slowly changed humanity's attitude. As more humans learn both &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; magic, and hear the advice and experience of their older friends, they see their true place in Azeroth and their true importance in the grand schemes of the world and its major powers. This may some day temper human enthusiasm with wisdom, and human ambition with responsibility.

After various attacks, Azgalor invaded but was repelled; after some time he began to attack alongside &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt; but was still held back. During the battle he attacked the human base with undead and demons in his army; he managed to separate a small force led by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; from the main army as he and other powerful demons were attracted by the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Though Broll called to the deep earth to protect his force so that they could reintegrate to the rest of the army, in the end the pit lord overwhelmed him. As Broll fell, Azgalor used his two-bladed sword, &lt;a href=\"Spite\"&gt;Spite&lt;/a&gt;, to smash the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting it and killing Broll's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt;. But just as Azgalor and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; thought they had achieved victory, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; set loose his &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s which imploded the Tree and incinerated Archimonde.\nIt is presumed he was killed during the battle or after Archimonde's defeat.\nCaverns of Time.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Horde and Alliance entered a time pocket of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Here it is seen that after dealing with the Alliance base and Broll Bearmantle, Azgalor ascended to the orc base. There he fought &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers from the future, and was killed in the battle.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAzgalor returned with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; to and was seen in .

Though he isn't as clever as his former master, he has an aptitude for chaos and violence that is legendary even among demonkind. Though the Legion was defeated that day and Azgalor seemingly vanquished, he escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to plot his revenge against the mortal armies of the world, seeking to destroy all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by employing whatever forces he could utilize."}

The fight is a &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;. Even though a raid member dies every 45 seconds, the emphasis is on avoiding the AoE fire damage, not on nuking the boss as quickly as possible.\nPreparation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29%23Tips%20on%20Bosses\"&gt;MH Boss Tips&lt;/a&gt; apply as usual. There should be one tank for the boss and at least one more for the Lesser Doomguards (two is better, in case one of them gets Doom). The Doomguard tanks need two healers, the Azgalor tank three. The other healers should keep up the raid.\nCasters should wear some &lt;a href=\"shadow%20resistance\"&gt;shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; buff as well, to resist the silence. Fire resistance potions can increase survivability; the melee group can wear some fire resistance gear if available. All Warlocks should have a &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; available, but not pre-cast.\nThe boss can be tanked next to Thrall or at the Tauren camp which is the best method if you have a hunter in your raid. It would also help to try to get as much help as possible from the NPCs during the waves,(try to keep the pats alive). Thrall won't die from the rain of fire. The other NPCs probably won't make it through the fight, but they still do decent DPS while alive.\nRain of Fire.\nThe first priority for everyone is to avoid Rain of Fire \u2014 move out of it fast. Beyond that, the periodic silence makes it challenging to keep the tank up. The tank should have as many &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt;s as possible at all times, and (like everybody else) be generally at top health, so that there's a good chance to survive 5 seconds without a heal. It's also possible to stop all melee attacks during silence, so that the Boss doesn't get the increased swing speed from parries.\nIt is possible for many ranged DPS classes to not be targeted by rain of fire by simply staying out of its 30 yd range. Probably, the only ranged DPS class that can't do this without severely lowering their DPS is shadow priests, as their mind flay ability has a short range. If a DPS class that can't out-range the rain of fire is DPSing near other longer range DPS, the rain of fire can hit the longer range DPS simply because of its 15 yard radius. This being the case, keeping the ranged DPS that can't out-range the rain of fire separate from the longer range DPSers will minimize damage taken by the raid.\nLesser Doomguards.\nWhen receiving the Doom debuff, players should run to the predetermined Lesser Doomguard tanking spot. At that place, the melee DDs and the NPCs should kill them. The easiest setup without a hunter misdirect is to tank them at the Tauren camp, while tanking Azgalor next to Thrall. If there is a hunter in your group the best method is to tank Azgalor at the Tauren camp, and let Thrall and his camp fight the Lesser Doomguards. Thrall and his camp alone are perfectly capable of dealing with the Doomguard and keeping no more than 1-2 Doomguards up at a time. At the end of the fight, the tanks should have a total of about 3-4 Lesser Doomguards on them which the raid must kill after Azgalor is dead.\nWarlocks should have their soulstones at the ready, but unassigned. When a vital player (e.g. a healer) is Doomed, they should assign the soulstone. Set up a rotation so that the warlocks are clear on who should hand out the first, second, etc. Soulstones and battle rezzes should be used early and often in order to maximize DPS on the boss and bring him down quickly.\nNote: There is a known bug (as of 2.4) that Doomguard tanks may be unable to get loot because they are not on the aggro table of the boss. It is highly recommended for Doomguard tanks and healer to go in range and do a couple ranged attacks on the boss before going to the Doomguard tanking spot. Healing or bandaging someone who is on the bosses aggro table also should work. A small domed clay oven is present at the Tauren warrior camp that is terrain bugged \u2014 if players with Doom die on top of it, the resulting Lesser Doomguard will spawn in the middle of the raid, causing a wipe.\nPositioning.\nIf your raid has high ranged DPS, it is possible to completely avoid the Rain of Fire through careful positioning. The raid should be split into camps according to roles (ranged, melee, healers). The melee should stand at the designated Lesser Doomguard tanking position and help take down these ads. The ranged DPS should stand in a semicircle in front of Azgalor at absolute max range (30 yds). As his Rain of Fire is cast on a person rather than a spot on the ground, having the raid outrange his ability causes him to cast it rarely if at all. Healers should stand off to one side where they are in range of the main body of the raid, but able to run to the Doomguard tanking position if Doom is cast. At the Lesser Doomguard tank spot, there should be a healer and 2 tanks. If you are having trouble, add one more healer or tank as you see fit. There is no need for a Lesser Doomguard group if you tank Azgalor at the tauren camp as explained above. A few DPSes can be moved to Lesser Doomguard duty if it makes you feel better.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It was eventually defeated by the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires and the survivors settled in different regions of the old continent.\nHistory.\nAbout 16,000 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani empires&lt;/a&gt; had little love for one another but rarely warred against each other. At the time, their greatest common enemy was a third empire -- the civilization of Azj'Aqir. The &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; were intelligent &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s who ruled the lands of the far west. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionist and incredibly evil. The aqir were obsessed with eradicating all non-insect life from the fields of Kalimdor.\nThe trolls fought them for many thousands of years but never succeeded in winning a true victory over the aqir. Eventually, due to the trolls' persistence, the aqir kingdom split in half as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent.\nTwo aqir city-states emerged &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;in the northern wastes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;in the southwestern desert&lt;/a&gt;, built upon conquered &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; cities. Though the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified. As a &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;third kingdom&lt;/a&gt; is known to have risen in the lands now known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls' suspicions may have been proven correct.\nThe Azj'Aqir kingdoms of Azjol-Nerub and Ahn'Qiraj have survived in present-day &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; (respectively). &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt; have also survived, protected with the rest of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; from the catastrophic &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that ended the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. In a conversation he has with &lt;a href=\"Kaz%27tik%20the%20Manipulator\"&gt;Kaz'tik the Manipulator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korven%20the%20Prime\"&gt;Korven the Prime&lt;/a&gt; credits their survival to the &lt;a href=\"Kypari\"&gt;Kypari trees&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nLong ago, before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, there were two &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires: the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in their history, the trolls found themselves threatened by an insect race called the Azj'Aqir. Eventually, the trolls beat back the creatures and split them into two factions, the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in the north and the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The nerubians eventually faced the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and the qiraji fought the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; after the Sundering. The elves won, but the land was blasted by the war, and the elven towns were left in ruins."}

It is inhabited by the arachnid-like &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. Before its destruction by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Azjol-Nerub contained huge libraries of literature, philosophy, arcane lore, and once served as a center of knowledge, art, and learning.\nDuring his conquest of Northrend, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; saw the nerubians as a threat and struck them down during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;. While the nerubians came close to winning, they couldn't win a war of attrition against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They were slaughtered, their kingdom destroyed, and most of them resurrected to unlife.\nIn \"\", Azjol-Nerub can be visited through two 5-man &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; and . The &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Narjun\"&gt;Pit of Narjun&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; is one of the multiple entrances into that massive network of caves and tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, the former king of Azjol-Nerub, is the final boss of the first dungeon.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe ancient kingdom of Azjol-Nerub was built after members of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; race fled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, overthrowing the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; living there and adapting their architecture for their own purposes. The &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires managed to split the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt; into three nations: Azjol-Nerub to the north, &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"Manti%27vess\"&gt;Manti'vess&lt;/a&gt; to the far south. Over the millennia, Azjol-Nerub became the center of nerubian civilization.\nWar of the Spider.\nThat was all before the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He saw immediately that the nerubians posed a major threat. None of the other races in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; had their numbers, their organization, or their discipline. In fact, the nerubians rarely ventured above-ground, but he couldn't risk that chance. The Lich King eventually attacked; he chose to swarm the underground kingdom and wiped it clean during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;. It was long and hard, and the nerubians almost won \u2014 they may prefer thought and art but they're fearsome foes when roused. Unfortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; had an endless supply of warriors and every dead nerubian potentially added to its ranks. In the end, the Scourge's numbers prevailed, and the implacable undead swept through Azjol-Nerub and emptied its tunnels of defenders. The Lich King defeated the nerubians, killing most of them in the process and converting many of the survivors into &lt;a href=\"crypt%20fiend\"&gt;crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s and other undead, and the nerubian civilization all but died.\nThe Frozen Throne.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the mighty &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Web%20Caverns\"&gt;Shadow Web Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kingdom\"&gt;Upper Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s on their way to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. They had to fight &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his dwarven forces, some still-living nerubians and other creatures. It once held a powerful and advanced civilization, and many of its treasures still rest there undamaged. Great riches litter the lower halls, not only gems and magic items but art and literature and scholarly tomes. The Scourge infests this place, and &lt;a href=\"forgotten%20one\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt;s seethe below, eager to return to the world above.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDespite the Lich King's victory over the Spider Kingdom, numerous pockets of nerubians remain, evading the wrath of the Lich King, while at the same time coordinating hit-and-run strikes against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kilix%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Kilix the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt;. Scarred by years of war and abandonment, this vast domain is now occupied on two fronts.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kingdom\"&gt;Upper Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, undead nerubians patrol the ruins of their homeland, guarding clutches of eggs that will one day bring forth a new generation of Scourge warriors. Meanwhile, in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27kahet\"&gt;Old Kingdom, Ahn'kahet&lt;/a&gt;, another enemy stirs: the &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s. Little is known of these horrifying creatures, but rumor has it that they answer to &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;an evil power&lt;/a&gt; lurking beneath Northrend. Destroying the undead nerubians and their tainted eggs will deal a great blow to the Lich King, but eliminating the mysterious faceless ones is also crucial to reclaiming the fallen empire.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the nerubian kingdom was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who confronted &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. When he was finally killed in his ruined palace, they brought his broken husk to the living nerubians as proof of his death.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; later built the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; above the kingdom's northern reaches.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that the nerubians have an enormous secret stash of their own eggs safely hidden away; with the extermination of the Scourge and the faceless ones plaguing Azjol-Nerub, they can begin repopulating under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Ixit\"&gt;Seer Ixit&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that though most of the kingdom is full-on ruins, they heard that some of its buildings still stand, but the art within is disintegrating because the Scourge don't care to maintain it. According to &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-anak\"&gt;Azjol-anak&lt;/a&gt; living nerubians he met there were few in number, but they've all been of a good sort. &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; also expressed interest in retrieving &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s remains from Azjol-Nerub.\nGeography.\nSince their defeat, most of Azjol-Nerub lies in ruins. It's still a fascinating place, and many of its murals, frescoes, and columns stand intact. The Scourge doesn't care about riches, material, or scholarly and rich tapestries still hang on the walls while impressive tomes line bookcases. One could spend months roaming the tunnels and still never see all of the great kingdom.\nAzjol-Nerub as a zone.\nAzjol-Nerub was going to be \"World of Warcraft\"'s first subterranean zone. \"Buildings, temples -- a look and feel very similar to &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, since the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s are where the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; stole that architecture from\", said Stockton of Blizzard. Wall-climbing mounts were planned for it according to &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Brazie\"&gt;Alexander Brazie&lt;/a&gt;. That plan was dropped and developers split the zone into two dungeon instances, &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; and .\nGhostcrawler said in an interview about the dropped &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Abyssal Maw instance&lt;/a&gt;: \"the zone I am personally saddest about cancelling is not Abyssal Maw; it was the Azjol-Nerub quest zone in Wrath of the Lich King.\"\nHowever, Azjol-Nerub is a huge zone, with lots of unrevealed secrets and &lt;a href=\"lore%20location\"&gt;lore location&lt;/a&gt;s, so the idea &lt;a href=\"Zone%20ideas%23Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;could return for a future expansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAzjol-Nerub is the vast subterranean kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s located beneath the frozen continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and was once the center of nerubian civilization. It is not known if they began here, but certainly most, if not their entire race, dwelled here. They left the rest of the world in peace and pursued their interests beneath the ground. Then the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; attacked and defeated them, killing most of the nerubians in the process and converting many of the survivors into &lt;a href=\"crypt%20fiend\"&gt;crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, including the former nerubian king, the &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. But there were also those who fled his touch. After that, most of Azjol-Nerub was and still lies in ruins. It is still a fascinating place though, and many of its murals and frescoes and columns stand intact. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; does not care about riches, material or scholarly, and rich tapestries still hang on the walls while impressive tomes line bookcases.\nAzjol-Nerub is not a safe place, for several reasons. First, of course, the Scourge controls it. Second, creatures live below, including the strange &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s: ancient monsters long imprisoned beneath the ice and recently loosed again. Yet even uninhabited, this kingdom would be dangerous. The nerubians set all manner of traps here, including circular doors that must be moved just so to avoid them crashing down on you, statues that release streams of frost at intruders and pits hidden beneath seemingly normal floor tiles. Many adventurers have ventured into this place, hoping for gold and other treasures, and found death instead.\nAzjol-Nerub can be divided into two sections: the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Old Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kingdom\"&gt;Upper Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n20 years ago the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; civilization was still alive and strong. Azjol-Nerub was their kingdom, and the spider-men controlled all of its tunnels. Their culture is almost as old as the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, and every bit is attuned to life underground. The biggest difference is that nerubians focus more on the cerebral and less on the physical \u2014 their society had more &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s and artists and fewer &lt;a href=\"smith\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s. That was all before the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, of course.\nHe saw immediately that the nerubians posed a major threat. None of the other races on Northrend had their numbers, their organization, or their discipline. True, the nerubians rarely ventured aboveground, but he could not take that chance. He decided to swarm the underground kingdom and wipe it clean in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;. It was long and hard, and the nerubians almost won \u2014 they may prefer thought and art but they are fearsome foes when roused. Unfortunately, the Scourge had an endless supply of warriors and every dead nerubian potentially added to its ranks. In the end, the Scourge's numbers prevailed, and the implacable undead swept through Azjol-Nerub and emptied its tunnels of defenders. The Lich King conquered, and the nerubian civilization all but died, leaving the kingdom in utter ruin.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; staked out an area right by the main entrance to the kingdom and built a camp known as &lt;a href=\"Doorward\"&gt;Doorward&lt;/a&gt;. They are the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s party, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20Expedition\"&gt;Bronzebeard Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt; leads them. He keeps his men hidden from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and in the meantime they keep watch on the doors behind the camp constantly as they know what lies deep beneath the earth here, having vowed to stop such evils, the &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s, from escaping to the surface.\nTwo years ago, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the mighty &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; traveled through this area on their way to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaelgun thought the blood-red door behind his camp was the only way out of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Old Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Not long ago, a second passage was discovered and the Scourge is preparing to enter the tunnel and explore the region below. Baelgun knows the faceless ones there will overpower even the undead and then be free to escape into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; proper, and so he and the other dwarves decided to stop them. Yet he cannot leave the first door unattended, so he asked the heroes to follow the new passage in his stead, making sure no one releases the horrors below.\nPeople and culture.\nThere are not many people left in Azjol-Nerub. Not many living ones, anyway. The place is overrun with Scourge creatures and the undead stalk up and down the corridors and through the tunnels, carrying and hammering and digging. It is best to stay out of their way if possible. Some Scourge creatures walk right by you, oblivious, completely focused on their current task, but others drop everything in order to kill you and reanimate you as one of them. You can't tell beforehand which approach a creature will take, so you are better off ducking when you see them coming.\nThe living nerubians have not completely abandoned their kingdom and there are several here and there. You might even be able talk to a few of them, especially if you are near Baelgun's camp. Most of the nerubians died in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, though, and few remain. The survivors are scattered throughout the tunnels, hiding alone or in small groups, destroying Scourge creatures whenever possible but keeping hidden at all costs. Others form larger bands plotting rebellion, but there is only so much you can do when you are outnumbered hundreds to one.\nBaelgun Flamebeard leads a group of dwarves here. They have good hardy souls, but they are no match for the Scourge, and they might not be able to even stop the nerubians, particularly the larger rebel bands. Fortunately the nerubians are cordial and as it is, they leave Baelgun's crew alone, and sometimes stop by to exchange information or trade found items for food.\nThe only other residents of Azjol-Nerub are monsters \u2014 most mysterious creatures called &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s. Tales say they lived here long before the Scourge came, dwelling too deep for the nerubians to hunt them. Its these horrors Baelgun has vowed to stop.\nGeography.\nAzjol-Nerub is entirely underground. It is a fascinating place that stretches for miles and it would not be a surprise if it lies beneath most or all of Northrend. The rock here is predominately granite, mixed with some igneous stone where volcanoes once rose and where magma from deep beneath bubbled up long ago. The nerubians were thorough artisans and left nary a corner untouched \u2014 every edge is smooth and faceted, every corridor planed and polished. They preserved the odd angles created by nature but straightened and widened tunnels into corridors and vaulted ceilings.\nLittle lives down here, especially now. Various lichen and fungi grow in corners and along the walls \u2014 the nerubians evidently nurtured certain phosphorescent and luminescent varieties to provide light, and these have since grown unchecked. &lt;a href=\"Bat\"&gt;Bat&lt;/a&gt;s perch on doorframes and columns, as do &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s of varying size. Underground lakes teem with blind, silvery-white &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Insectoid\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"worm\"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt;s crawl through the soft dirt alongside. Monsters prowl the deeper caves, and the less said about these the better.\nThe underground region has no separate settlements as it once was a single unified kingdom. Now it is a shadow of its former self, controlled by the Scourge except where pockets of nerubian resistance lurk or where the dwarves hunker down or where even darker creatures roam unopposed."}

This affected even the orcs who did not partake in the drinking of the blood.\nBackground.\nBlood of Mannoroth.\nThe blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, the vile fluid that ran through the veins of the Destructor, was used to corrupt the orcish race and bind them to the will of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Mannoroth was summoned to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; by Kil'jaeden, who instructed the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to spill the Destructor's blood into the empty meditation pool of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, assembled at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of the orcish race \u2014 the first being &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;drank&lt;/a&gt; the burning blood and became minions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Only a select few, most notably &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, refused to drink.\nLethargy of the orcs.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and rounded up into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs began to suffer serious withdrawals and sink into lethargy, or succumb to demon-crazed madness. Grommash, who was one of the few orcs to escape the internment camps, resisted the maddening bloodlust and paralyzing lethargy that was consuming his race for many years. &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; learned that the orcs had been under the crippling influence of demonic power (or warlock &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;) for generations. He speculated that the orcs had been corrupted by demonic powers even before their first invasion of Azeroth. Clearly, demons had spiked the orcs' blood, which in turn granted the brutes unnaturally heightened strength, endurance, and aggression. Antonidas theorized that the orcs' communal lethargy was not actually a disease, but a long-term racial withdrawal from the volatile warlocks' magic that had made them fearsome, blood-lusted warriors. Though the symptoms were clear, Antonidas was unable to find a cure for the orcs' present condition. Many of his fellow &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a few notable &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders, argued that finding a cure for the orcs would be an imprudent venture. Left to ponder the orcs' mysterious condition, Antonidas' conclusion was that the orcs' only cure would have to be a spiritual one.\nFel orcs.\nYears later, after the &lt;a href=\"Exodus%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Exodus of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the curse would be back. Mannoroth \u2014 at the advice of the Dreadlord master of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 spilled his blood into a fountain of life, knowing that the orcs would eventually find it. This would have the effect of not only returning the orcs to their blood-crazed past but also dealing with an old foe: the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nCenarius, as a being so attuned to nature that he can sense the slightest corruption, assumed that the orcs in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; were scouts of the Legion so the demigod, alongside the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, hunted Grommash and his Warsong clan due to their lumber operations in Ashenvale. This, ironically, would send the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; back into the service of Mannoroth and to the reestablishment of their connection to the potent &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic that first bound them to the Legion.\nThe Warsong clan were in a losing battle but a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; sensed a power nearby. Hellscream and his Warsongs went to the source of power that resulted to be the now-corrupted fountain of life, the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Well\"&gt;Fel Well&lt;/a&gt;. Hellscream's witch doctors, who had sensed the power of the fountain, now warned him that the fountain was cursed, but the Warsong chieftain and his forces drank from the corrupted fountain anyway. Later, Cenarius was slain by the newly empowered Warsong orcs but moments after their victory Mannoroth appeared before them and enslaved them once more.\nRedemption.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was able to purge the curse from Grommash Hellscream using a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; and an elven Ritual Circle thus Grommash managed to break free from this second blood pact. Together, the two orcs decide to face Mannoroth. It had been Grommash who had first drunk the blood of the demon Mannoroth - blood that had tainted him and all other orcs who had drunk it. But in the end, Grommash had his revenge. Using all the strength he had left, Hellscream made a devastating blow against the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;, shattering his plate and spear by driving his axe deep into the demon's chest. In an explosion of demonic energy Mannoroth the Destructor was no more, but the effects of this left Grommash mortally wounded. Though he had been the first to drink, and thus the first to fall to demonic bloodlust and madness, he had been the one to end the curse. As he lay on the ground, the crimson haze lifted from the eyes of Grommash Hellscream and his clanmates; the Blood-curse which had damned his race for generations was finally over and thus the orcs were free from their enslavement by the Legion forever. And with that gesture, the orcs began to reclaim their own great hearts, wills, and spirits. However, their skin would remain green, due to the lingering effects of fel exposure.\nBlood of Magtheridon.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s blood to create the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; which was led by &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;. This was done in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually this came to an end as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and some other major factions in Outland stopped Illidan.\nAlternate Draenor.\nOn , was the first to drink the blood of the demon Mannoroth, turning his skin green and changing his visage. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; then proceeded to have all of Draenor's &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s to drink the blood, but &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; had already convinced the orcs and to not accept it. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, Gul'dan took command of it and many orcs drank the blood. and his , as well as Gul'dan's new allies, the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Iskar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Velhari\"&gt;Velhari&lt;/a&gt;, all accepted the fel gift. With the arakkoa, the blood-curse showed the ability to reverse the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nOrcs that drink the blood of a &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; are shown gaining supernatural strength, speed, resilience, and stamina. The effects, as well as side effects, are immediate, and the symptoms that manifest from blood consumption are green skin, glowing red eyes, and a considerable increase in size. Further exposure and physical change cause the skin to turn red, a greater increase in body mass, green/purple/yellow eyes, extra tusks, and bone growth that breaks the skin.\nThe demon blood that most of the orcs imbibed back on Draenor increased their natural bloodlust a hundredfold. With their systems permeated with demonic blood, the orcs burned with a lust for killing that would not be sated even if they slew every last &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on Draenor and would never be sated until death stiffened their corpses."}

But has it truly done so? Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously seek to destroy Lo'Gosh before he can reach the end of his quest.\nPlot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassin%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Stormwind Assassin's Guild&lt;/a&gt; agent arrives in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; forces led by the &lt;a href=\"priestess%20of%20the%20moon\"&gt;priestess of the moon&lt;/a&gt; have put the defeated &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; soldiers to hard labor. &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bristlefur\"&gt;Bristlefur&lt;/a&gt; are not far behind, and Valeera attempts to sneak closer to overhear the conversation between the assassin and the priestess, whose pet &lt;a href=\"Roundeye\"&gt;Roundeye&lt;/a&gt; informs them that &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt; and Lo'Gosh have cleansed the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and are taking it to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, Valeera is discovered and attacked by one of the Sentinels, who accuses her of being a Horde spy working for the orcs. Valeera tries to tell the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; that she's a friend of Broll and Lo'Gosh and that the man they're talking with is an assassin who's been hired to kill Lo'Gosh. The night elves reply that a child wouldn't believe that tale, to which Valeera retorts that even a child would have more sense than to freely tell the assassin what he needs to know just because he's a human. While brawling with the Sentinels, Valeera notices the assassin taking off into the sky on his &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackklaw\"&gt;Blackklaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in Darnassus, Broll and Lo'Gosh meet with &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and explain what happened to the Idol of Remulos after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Since Broll plans further quests in the form of helping Lo'Gosh retrieve his memories and rescuing Valeera from slavery, the archdruid states that it could be dangerous to continue carrying the idol and that it would be better if Fandral kept the statue for safekeeping in the enclave. Broll complies.\nAfter leaving the enclave, Lo'Gosh states that he doesn't trust Fandral and that he seemed overly eager to have the idol in his possession. Broll replies that the statue will be safe in Darnassus; because it's linked to Broll, only an archdruid can tap its power, and Fandral can be trusted implicitly since he is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Lo'Gosh retorts that experience is teaching him that very few people can be trusted implicitly. Broll assures him that he handed over the idol by his own choice and that while the statue is an object of power, he feels more free without it. A night elf approaches and tells Broll that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; wants to speak with him.\nBack in Warsong Gulch, Valeera escapes from the Sentinels atop Bristlefur and heads for Darnassus.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande welcomes Broll home, thanks him for cleansing the Idol of Remulos, and asks to hear more of Broll and Lo'Gosh's exploits over dinner. After hearing the human's tale, Tyrande states that she can feel an aura of dark magic surrounding Lo'Gosh, and suggests seeking out Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore to help restore his memories.\nWhile the assassin makes for &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and prepares to land in &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, Broll and Lo'Gosh head for the &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; roost, where &lt;a href=\"Vesprystus\"&gt;Vesprystus&lt;/a&gt; assures them that &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt; has recovered enough to bear them both to Theramore. Just as Sharptalon takes off, the assassin's gryphon touches down in the main square. An hour later, Valeera arrives atop Bristlefur and overhears Vesprystus telling two night elf girls that Broll and Lo'Gosh left for Theramore earlier that afternoon, with a human on an ebon gryphon following them shortly after. With her friends' lives at stake, Valeera immediately takes off again.\nAt dawn, Valeera finally catches up with the assassin above &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Bay\"&gt;Dustwallow Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where he is following a short distance behind Broll and Lo'Gosh on Sharptalon. The assassin raises his crossbow and prepares to fire at his quarry, but is interrupted when Valeera throws a dagger that buries itself in his shoulder. Valeera jumps off Bristlefur and drags the assassin down with her. From a boat down in the swamp, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and her attendant &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; witness the two bodies plummeting from the sky. Valeera and the assassin end up landing \u2014 and becoming entangled \u2014 in a giant &lt;a href=\"tarantula\"&gt;tarantula&lt;/a&gt; web.\nMeanwhile, Broll and Lo'Gosh reach Theramore, where they are welcomed by Lady Jaina. Upon taking Lo'Gosh's hand, Jaina senses a strange aura of dark wizardry around the gladiator and states that she will need her chamberlain's help to unravel it.\nOut in the marsh, Aegwynn and Sven head toward the spider web where Valeera and the assassin are grappling. Valeera demands to know who hired the assassin, but he replies that he doesn't know and that even if he did, he wouldn't tell her. The human tells Blackklaw to grab his foe, but upon being lifted into the air, Valeera jabs her dagger into Blackklaw's eye, killing it and causing her to plummet into the river. Valeera asks the name of the assassin's patron for a final time. Not noticing the huge, hairy legs creeping up behind him, the human still refuses to answer, and is moments later attacked and devoured by the web's giant tarantula. Aegwynn and Sven reach the injured and exhausted Valeera and carry her into their boat, intending to take her to &lt;a href=\"Medic%20Helaina\"&gt;Medic Helaina&lt;/a&gt; in Theramore. Sven has misgivings about Valeera being a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, but Aegwynn tells him that today's enemies can be tomorrow's friends and that things are not always what they seem. Aegwynn commends Valeera for her bravery in dealing with the guild assassin. When Valeera points out the aura of powerful magic lingering around Aegwynn, she explains that she was once a powerful magic user. While she rarely speaks of it now, she has thought much about the dance of light and dark and can feel that the dance wars within Valeera as it once did in Aegwynn. The chamberlain invites Valeera to seek her out for a talk after she has recovered, but that for now she should simply remember that redemption is never out of reach. Upon arriving at Theramore, Aegwynn asks Sven to summon a healer and have someone tend to Bristlefur. Before leaving, she turns to Valeera and tells her that she has great gifts and that her friends will need her by their side, but that she should choose her course carefully.\nMoments later in Theramore's &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina and Aegwynn conclude that someone may have stolen or destroyed Lo'Gosh's memories. Together, the two of them conduct a ritual to conjure visions of Lo'Gosh's past. The first visions are ones he has had before: a &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;voyage&lt;/a&gt;, and the birth of a &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, however, are new visions: a &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; killed by a flying stone, unrelenting anguish, renewed determination, and finally darkness; but in that darkness, a purpose rediscovered. Lo'Gosh realises that before he lost his memories, he was headed to Theramore. While Jaina and Aegwynn are able to penetrate the surface of the gladiator's mind, the core remains dark to them.\nNonetheless, the visions confirm the gladiator's identity, and Jaina concludes that Lo'Gosh is in fact Varian Wrynn, the lost king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Lo'Gosh is shocked by the revelation, but Jaina and Aegwynn tell him that he needs to learn what happened between his departure for Theramore and his awakening in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the identities of his enemies. Jaina offers to send him back to Stormwind in &lt;a href=\"Wavecutter\"&gt;one of her own ships&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after, Lo'Gosh meets with Broll outside. Having learned that his wife is dead and that his son is alone and in need of protection, Lo'Gosh resolves to return to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; immediately. Broll declares that he'll be accompanying him on the journey, but first they need to find and free Valeera. Not a moment later, Valeera appears behind them, explains that she already freed herself and that she'll be coming with them as well, and excitedly begins telling of her own adventure and asking about Broll and Lo'Gosh's journey. Lo'Gosh tells her to be patient, that there'll be plenty of time for stories on the journey to the Eastern Kingdoms, and that once they arrive, he'll seek out his enemies, and woe betide those who set themselves against him."}

The members of the order are referred to as blood knights, bloodknights, or simply &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s. With the strong support of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;blood elven guard force&lt;/a&gt;, the former of which had a hand in their creation, the Blood Knights rose from unproven and scorned beginnings to become a popular group within sin'dorei society. They are led by their matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first of their order.\nMost Blood Knights were once members of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, proud defenders of high elven society. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of the high elves took up the name \"blood elves\" in honor of their slaughtered people, and in the wake of their ancient kingdom's destruction, many of the elves of Quel'Thalas came to view the Holy Light with contempt. This led to a great number of the blood elves losing their faith, and in turn, their Light-given powers, coming to believe that the Light had failed them in their homeland's hour of greatest need. When they needed a new way to access the Light, they sap the holy energy from the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, held beneath the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Blood Knight headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. However, in a mad lust for power, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; to attack Silvermoon City and seize &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; for his own personal uses. The Blood Knights vowed to aid &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; in defeating Kael'thas, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and restoring their homeland to its glory.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s rebirth, the Blood Knights have chosen to embrace it and to forge for themselves a new identity as they lead their people into a more promising future.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Liadrin pledged her order's support to the reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in their war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knights left the ranks of the Silver Hand after its splintering, and supported once more the Horde against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade%20Townhall/Shamans%20and%20Paladins\"&gt;official Burning Crusade website&lt;/a&gt;:\nNot long ago in Outland, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider and his blood elves waited until the newly arrived naaru departed &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He had little interest in what the naaru hoped to accomplish on this shattered world: it was Tempest Keep that had brought him here. At the prince's signal the elves stormed the dimensional fortress, quickly defeating its automated defenses and claiming its satellite structures. The only real threat the elves discovered was a lone naaru who had stayed behind to maintain the keep's defenses. With some difficulty, Kael'thas subdued the energy being and sent it to Quel'Thalas so that the magic-addicted blood elves could feed upon it. Back in the capital city of Silvermoon, Magister Astalor Bloodsworn was not content with this idea. After long months of study and experimentation, he and his fellow wizards learned how to manipulate and corrupt the naaru's luminous energies. In the end the wizards devised a process by which the powers of the Light could be transferred to recipients who had not earned such abilities. Instead of feeding upon the naaru's magic, the blood elves would wield the naaru's Light-given powers themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, formerly a priestess, had recently renounced her vows, for she felt the Light had abandoned her people. She learned of the wizards' achievement and volunteered to be the first to bend the stolen powers to her will. With her decision a new order was born: the Blood Knights. These renegade paladins are able to harness the sacred powers of the Alliance's noblest heroes. Most members of the Blood Knights were once part of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;--proud defenders of high elven society who came to believe that the Light had failed them in their hour of greatest need. They see their appropriation of the captive naaru's powers as well-deserved justice. Although &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; openly opposed the blood elves' methods, they recognized the Blood Knights' strategic value. Indeed, it is likely that the group figured heavily in the Horde's ultimate decision to offer membership to the blood elves. Blood elf paladins have swiftly grown confident in their borrowed abilities. Nevertheless, as even the most inexperienced mage will attest, when powerful forces are manipulated against their intended purpose.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe Blood Knight order was first conceived by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, two master magi who had sought to find a better use of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s gift to Silvermoon: the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. After the magi had successfully pacified the being, Rommath summoned the former high priestess, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and told her of his plans to create a new order of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; warriors who wielded their powers through sheer willpower - \"masters\" of their power, not servants of it. Liadrin, whose life had been led by extremities (a devout, pious priestess to a vengeful warrior), agreed to consider the offer in the hope of finding balance, and after an introduction to M'uru, pledged herself to lead this new order. She rose as Lady Liadrin, Matriarch of the Blood Knight order. Rommath had met Liadrin years before, in the immediate aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and had noted the former priestess' contempt for the Light.\nThe creation of the order was not without its critics. The &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, were particularly opposed to the Blood Knights' creation, believing the knights' methods of maintaining their powers to have been immoral. The general populace also looked at the unproven Blood Knights with distrust - sometimes revulsion - for the same reason. The regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, also had his doubts, though he was hopeful that the Blood Knights would prove themselves as a valuable asset in time. The Blood Knight leadership maintained that they were simply doing what had to be done to protect Quel'Thalas, and considered many of their detractors to be ungrateful for the service the knights provided in keeping their people safe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; looked upon their exploitation of M'uru pragmatically, knowing this was the only reliable way that the knights, most of whom had come to view the Light with scorn and contempt, could now invoke their powers. However, they were mistaken in their assumption that the naaru had been broken: events had been set in motion beyond their control, and M'uru had, in fact, feigned recalcitrance and \"willingly\" granted the Blood Knights his power in preparation for a long-set reckoning to come.\nThe Blood Knight order attracted elves of many walks of life. Among them were former &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and priestesses who had turned away from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, like Liadrin had. Others were former members of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, proud defenders of Quel'Thalas. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and war heroes also joined the order, embracing their new-found powers.\nThe Blood Knights' path was not an easy one. While they had no particular moral code or strict teachings to adhere to, exposure to M'uru had testing effects on the knights. Some were plagued by headaches and had to overcome physical pain to successfully invoke their powers, while others dealt with suppressed emotional issues being reawakened. M'uru's voice (described as reminiscent of \"shattering glass\") was often distorted and distant - there was little warmth in the road the knights walked.\nAtop his glacier in Northrend, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself developed a fascination with the notion of Light-wielding warriors who invoked their powers without the need for a moral code, and instructed his pawn &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; to entrap the Blood Knights and raise them as undead. This led to a battle where the Blood Knights, that were stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; after reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Sunsail%20Anchorage\"&gt;Sunsail Anchorage&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in fighting off a risen Dar'Khan and his undead hordes. This saw the beginning of a new era for the order, as the Blood Knights' victories began to thaw out public opinion.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Blood Knight order was formally introduced after the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Having styled themselves as their homeland's defenders and the \"true masters of the Light\", the creation of the Blood Knight order eventually gained popularity. While some elves were still viewing the Blood Knights with fear and revulsion, many &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; were now viewing their power as a testament to the fortitude of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knights established themselves as one of Quel'Thalas' most prominent organizations. Its members were instructed to drain power directly from the subdued &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, which granted them a variety of Light-based abilities aside from that of martial prowess.\nWhen the order was founded, a set number of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20Insignia\"&gt;insignias&lt;/a&gt; were forged and distributed, so each new member had to eventually inherit his own from a fallen veteran. The trials of the Blood Knight order were undertaken by newly-inducted members. These ranged from expeditions into the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, to directly funding the powerful order, to trial-by-combat against other Blood Knights; the end result of which would be an ever-increasing rank and status in the order, ending with the title of master and control over the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Charger\"&gt;Thalassian Charger&lt;/a&gt;. The Blood Knights would attempt to assert their dominance over the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the world with their destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the blood elves left behind in Quel'Thalas were tasked with securing their country from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, many soldiers loyal to their &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; were empowered and traveled back to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where the split between the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; was about to happen.\nThe Blood Knights were a key component in the blood elves joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; themselves noting the considerable power of the order\u2014though opposing their methods just as much as the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; did. With their new alliance sealed, a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Halaani%20Guard\"&gt;regiment of Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; began to wrestle &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; and their own new &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; after the journey into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The Blood Knights were also active in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, with their &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s present in various capitals, as they led the Horde effort to take that battleground before the draenei of the Alliance.\nA Blood Knight named &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the order's activities within &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; lands, and tasked adventurers with defiling &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb in Lordaeron. To his surprise, the Lightbringer did not fault him for his actions and urged him to instead turn his rage into helping to rebuild beautiful &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Mehlar later attempted to create a powerful anti-&lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; item named &lt;a href=\"Scourgebane\"&gt;Scourgebane&lt;/a&gt;; enlisting the help of Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to this end.\nThe will of the order would soon be tested, however, for Kael'thas was eventually revealed to be a pawn of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;Eye of Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nTreachery of the prince.\nTraveling to Quel'Thalas once more, a reborn Kael'thas and his \"&lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt;\" minions entered Silvermoon, took M'uru from his place under the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Blood Knight headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, and spirited the naaru to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. In the now empty chamber, the magisters that drained the Light energy stood around, dazed; young initiates seeking to learn the powers of resurrection (who would normally tap the power directly from M'uru) had instead to &lt;a href=\"Claiming%20the%20Light\"&gt;collect&lt;/a&gt; the residual holy energies from the dazed elves.\nNow without any 'natural' way to channel the Light, the future of the Blood Knights looked unclear. &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, however, proclaimed that Kael'thas would not break the order\u2014and that Lady Liadrin was already seeking a new source of power. Without Lady Liadrin personally present to directly represent her order's interests, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; represented them in her place within &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Lord Solanar Bloodwrath&lt;/a&gt;, the right-hand man of Lady Liadrin, established himself in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt; to keep overseeing the duties of training aspiring Masters, something normally undertaken by Liadrin herself.\nSeeing Kael'thas' treachery for herself, Lady Liadrin traveled to Shattrath and met with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin%23Meeting%20with%20A%27dal\"&gt;informed her&lt;/a&gt; that M'uru had known his fate - to aid in the redemption of the people of Quel'Thalas, as prophesied by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. With this new insight, Liadrin pledged herself and the Order to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, the army raised to battle Kael'thas and his nefarious master, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunwell restored.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption and demise of the darkened &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and the defeat of Kael'thas' &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;demonic master&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin observed the sight of the defiled and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, lamenting that the blood elven people may never atone for the sin they had committed in damning M'uru to his fate. Prophet Velen then revealed the \"heart of M'uru\"; unblemished and pure. It was channeled into the Sunwell, and in a massive blaze of light, the blood elves' fount of power was restored. Liadrin was both astonished and taken aback by this turn of events, and Velen mentioned that this was possibly the road to rebirthing the soul of a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Sunwell restored, the Blood Knights now channeled their power directly from it\u2014a far less damaging and far more harmonious relationship than their previous method of gaining power.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s brief assault on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; moved to recruit the sin'dorei forces to aid in the despoiler of Quel'Thalas' downfall, the Blood Knights included. After &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; committed to the war effort, the regent lord planned to have &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; represent Liadrin's interests until she arrived. Rommath later sent word to Liadrin herself, reporting back to the regent lord with the Blood Knight matriarch's preparations for the war.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Blood Knights played a role in the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; campaign, though they took a step out of the spotlight as an organization. The Blood Knights &lt;a href=\"Malithas%20Brightblade\"&gt;Malithas Brightblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liandra%20Suncaller\"&gt;Liandra Suncaller&lt;/a&gt; fought with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, and several were seen as part of the elite &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; regiment found in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The denizens of Silvermoon continued to take a great amount of pride in their Blood Knights, and even Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself was eager to see them in action.\nDuring the quest to restore &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Liadrin was seen speaking to groups of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf%20Pilgrim%20%28Sunwell%29\"&gt;blood elf pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; about the Sunwell's revitalization. Acknowledging the road ahead as a difficult battle, she resolved that the sin'dorei would prevail, and be restored to their greatness.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; and the abdication of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knight &lt;a href=\"Master%20Pyreanor\"&gt;Master Pyreanor&lt;/a&gt; became one of newly-named Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s personal advisors.\nThe more aggressive quotes spoken by the Blood Knight trainers were reworded; now referencing the Light without referring to the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s manipulation. The path to rank and power in the order also became less dubious in nature - instead of undertaking increasingly harsh actions such as engaging in duels to the death and defiling &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;churches&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwell-empowered Blood Knights now instead go about forging powerful items and weaponry for the order's use. The ranks of the Blood Knights are also no longer limited in numbers and the old system of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20Insignia\"&gt;insignias&lt;/a&gt; having to be taken from a dead member's body has been abandoned.\nMists of Pandaria.\nRoughly two months following the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; led a Blood Knight division to the myth-shrouded continent. The Blood Knights served as either protectors of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kaelis%20Sunsoar\"&gt;Kaelis Sunsoar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20Blood%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; directing the Reliquary's movements in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;), or looking to the safety of the regent lord himself in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Blood Knight &lt;a href=\"Aenea\"&gt;Aenea&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with tracking down and capturing a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; warlord for interrogation in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of the Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, and she and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Orestes\"&gt;Ranger Orestes&lt;/a&gt; accompanied Horde heroes to his location.\nThe Blood Knights were later fielded on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; was on the cusp of breaking into the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s stronghold. A Blood Knight &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Bloodknight\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; could be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite not being visible, the Blood Knights were present during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knights were the main force of the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; herself. The Sunsworn hoped to drive out the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic corruption in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; and joined forces with the to defend the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s sacred precinct, , from agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Based mainly in Talador, Blood Knight members could be found all over , from Horde &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s to a small presence in .\nLegion.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, some Blood Knights could be seen at the sparring ring of the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, where Horde champions fought in preparation for the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, they accompanied the Horde to battle.\nFollowing the disastrous conflict, Lady Liadrin led the Blood Knights to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, in order to pay their respects to the fallen &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. In order to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin pledged her order's support to the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, many Blood Knights joined the reformed Silver Hand.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Assault on Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who came to retrieve Tirion's body and make him the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, a few Blood Knights fought alongside the Silver Hand forces to repel the undead invaders. In the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions%20%28Sanctum%20of%20Light%29\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt;, they faced Lady Liadrin who was defeated, however, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself intervened and burned the surrounded death knights, forcing them to flee and granting victory to the paladins.\nLady Liadrin later led a Blood Knight force to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, in order to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebellion in their attempt to seize the city from its Burning Legion-aligned masters. She was critical of the elven forces within the Alliance camp and stated that her Blood Knights are the only ones prepared to carry the weight of this conflict.\nThe offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; also drew the interest of many &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Recruit\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; who wished to join the ranks of the Silver Hand, some were Blood Knights awaiting to be judged by the Highlord itself who eliminated the &lt;a href=\"Volzarak%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Legion infiltrator&lt;/a&gt; among them.\nSome blood elves paladins were later present at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where they could be seen fighting against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knights led by their matriarch fought on the fields of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;. They were wearing new special armors, as well as Blood-Tempered Ranseurs, and all of them appeared to have golden eyes. They faced off against &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, who led the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; troops in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the Order of the Silver Hand has splintered once again at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. During the conflict, Turalyon also scoffed at the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; armies being led by a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Liadrin, questioning what has happened on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to allow this. He then claimed he would take pleasure in enacting justice on a \"misguided paladin of the Horde\".\nFollowing the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin could be seen leaving &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; with a retinue of Blood Knights from Silvermoon. As they marched into Orgrimmar, she explained that they had to root out any signs of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, spare those who turned away from Sylvanas, and to keep unity and order in the city.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knights made their appearance in the paladin section of the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Avaros%20Dawnglaive\"&gt;Avaros Dawnglaive&lt;/a&gt; as a paladin trainer.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Liadrin called upon &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;sin'dorei hero&lt;/a&gt; to aid her against the resurgence of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Blood Knights champions and trainees, Liadrin's adopted daughter &lt;a href=\"Salandria\"&gt;Salandria&lt;/a&gt; among them, defended &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; from the invading undead. After learning about the Scourge's immortal leader, &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt;, Salandria aided the hero in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to empower a ranseur that was to be used against the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;. With the mighty weapon in hand, the adventurer and the Blood Knights ultimately attacked &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; and successfully killed Vorath for good.\nCulture.\nThe stated goal of the Blood Knight order is a simple one: to defend &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and to destroy her enemies. Their specialized Light-based powers have made the order a useful front line of defense against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, while their common mindset with the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; had led to some playing roles of state enforcement. The Blood Knights, and their matriarch in particular, were once highly eager to demonstrate the superiority and dominion of their rapidly-growing order to the \"false paladins of the world,\" though in light of &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;recent events&lt;/a&gt; it appears this creed has somewhat subsided.\nCunning, determination, and integrity are hallmarks of what it means to be a Blood Knight. A recurring theme in the order is the prevalence of the term \"blood\" in several of its members' surnames. This is likely a self-styled reference to both the blood of their many brethren who perished during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and to the moniker of their order.\nEmpowerment.\nBlood Knights are unusual among paladins in that their method of wielding the Light is unorthodox. Originally, the Blood Knights invoked the Light by establishing a link with &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, a captive naaru kept imprisoned beneath Silvermoon. The bond was testing and sometimes painful, but allowed the knights to use the naaru's Light-given powers without a need for faith or piety; indeed, the Blood Knights turned to this method precisely because they believed the Light had turned its back on them in their darkest hour, and they no longer wished to heed its teachings. The blood elves were misguided in their rage against the Light, as their waning ability to invoke it was due to their own inner doubts and dread in the face of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion&lt;/a&gt;, but either way M'uru provided a pragmatic method to access the Light reliably. Members of the Horde, and even many citizens of Silvermoon, considered this method of empowerment to be unethical. The power of M'uru's energy in the knights weakened with distance.\nThis changed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the death of M'uru and the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; used the naaru's heart to cleanse the Sunwell, he transformed it into a fount of Holy Light and arcane magic. This turn of events had a profound effect on the blood elves, particularly for the Blood Knights, as they abandoned wielding holy energies by force and returned to their old ways. Through the Sunwell they would ask for the Light's blessing to wield their powers. It is a harmonious relationship, free of the pain and discord of their previous method, they no longer suffer from its associated negative effects. To wield the Light through the Sunwell, a typical Blood Knight must have strong willpower and faith in their own ability. Although possible to \"steal\" the Light from the Sunwell in the same way they did from M'uru, Lady Liadrin has moved the blood knights away from that type of abuse. The Blood Knights have embraced the Sunwell, as they lead their people into a more promising future.\nUniform and equipment.\nThe Blood Knights generally display a certain dress-code, more often than not including their &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20Tabard\"&gt;order's tabard&lt;/a&gt;. Several standard Blood Knight uniforms exist, and the main one consists of a plate set, decorated with a collage of red and black. The order does not appear to be particularly strict in enforcing its dress-code, and many variations and alterations of the standard uniforms exist.\nLike the Alliance paladins, they also receive their own &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Warhorse\"&gt;thalassian warhorse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Thalassian%20Charger\"&gt;thalassian charger&lt;/a&gt; during their formation.\nUnlike their Alliance counterparts, the Blood Knights tend to make use of swords more than maces, though exceptions do exist. Most Blood Knights are seen wielding either one-handed or two-handed swords, spears, and shields. When &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; presented &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Blood-Tempered%20Ranseur\"&gt;Blood-Tempered Ranseur&lt;/a&gt;, he stated that the weapon was symbolic, and represented the balance that the Blood Knights, and indeed all blood elves, must seek to master. As such, the weapon became the order's distinctive weapon. To properly temper the metal of the ranseurs, they had to be quenched in &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Wrathful\"&gt;the blood of a powerful demon&lt;/a&gt;. While the Ranseur has been made unavailable due to the removal of its associated quest, the &lt;a href=\"%3AVeil-Touched%20Ranseur\"&gt;:Veil-Touched Ranseur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AFallen%20Knight%27s%20Ranseur\"&gt;:Fallen Knight's Ranseur&lt;/a&gt; were made available in \"Shadowlands\".\nIn \"Shadowlands\", the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%27s%20Dedication\"&gt;Blood Knight's Dedication&lt;/a&gt; set was added for blood elf paladins upon completion of their unique outro of the blood elf-only &lt;a href=\"Summons%20from%20the%20Matriarch\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAs &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, many future Blood Knights were members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom became &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and even a few &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the TCG.\nThey were described as &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s serving as the backbone of the Thalassian army.\nSome viewed the Blood Knights' opinion on the Light's abandonment as \"folly,\" and continued to embrace it as priests and priestesses as the Light regardless of the new direction their society was heading in.\nControversy.\nThe introduction of paladins to the Horde along with &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was initially controversial. The decision to eliminate faction-specific classes was explained by Blizzard as an attempt to refine and distinguish the two classes from one another. They had previously suffered from comparisons of their abilities, and the attempt to \"balance\" them and yet have them remain distinct led to the two classes becoming more and more similar to one another. The introduction of these classes to both sides would reduce the controversial issue of faction balance. Nevertheless, this decision has met with some criticism by players and even Blizzard employees have expressed that the decision was not an easy one.\nSpeculation.\nFollowing the abduction of M'uru, exactly how sin'dorei paladins could continue wielding their powers was the source of wide speculation. It was noted by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; that Lady Liadrin was actively seeking a new source of power for the order, and her conversation with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; left a number of possibilities open. For one, it was possible that either A'dal or another &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; continued to empower the Blood Knights, now allies of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. Despite such allusions, however, it was never explicitly stated how the Blood Knights were able to retain their powers between the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;."}

Icarius however points out it would be both of their heads if the message was not delivered. As Zarath heads off to the Black Temple, Icarius is killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests.\nHe is involved in the quest &lt;a href=\"To%20Catch%20A%20Thistlehead\"&gt;To Catch A Thistlehead&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nHis melee attack hits for about 9,500 damage without armor mitigation.\nSpeculation.\nWith Icarius dead, along with the fact Zarath is not seen afterward, it is possible that he was killed on &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s orders."}

{"id": "227934", "revid": "1487011", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=227934", "title": "Blood Mage (Warcraft III)", "text": "Many of the stoic &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, reeling from the loss of their ancient homeland, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, have given in to their hatred and despair and embraced the dark side of their magical natures. Calling themselves '&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;' - these cold hearted refugees seek to expand their remaining magical powers at any cost - even if it means courting the infernal powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;! Though still loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Elves' passions will lead them not only to the highest pinnacles of power, but to the darkest depths of madness.\nHero names.\nEldin Sunstrider, Tanin Hawkwing, Lorn Bloodseeker, Aldos Firestar, Gilaras Drakeson, Hale Magefire, Kath'ranis Remar, Tyoril Sunchaser, Sylvos Windrunner, &lt;a href=\"Tenris%20Mirkblood\"&gt;Tenris Mirkblood&lt;/a&gt;, Marakanis Starfury, Geldor Earthfire, Halendor Burnkin, Kelen the Destroyer.\nInformation.\nA mystical Hero, adept at controlling magic and ranged assaults. Though still members of the Alliance, the Blood Elves have begun to turn to the darkest parts of magic, abandoning the water and frost spells of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; for the fire and heat of what some people fear to be Demonic magic.\nBlood Mages aren't often used by human commanders in small or free-for-all matches due to their lack of versatility but can prove well as a support Hero in team matches.\nFlame Strike is his best damage-dealing spell, dealing equal damage to both enemy ground units and structures, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt;'s Blizzard does reduced damage. In maps where creep camps may be blocked off by trees, a Blood Mage can use Flame Strike on those trees to immediately remove them, and access whatever is inside the hidden area. This is particularly useful in maps such as &lt;a href=\"Plains%20of%20Snow\"&gt;Plains of Snow&lt;/a&gt; where gold mines for expansion are blocked off by trees.\nBanish is a good skill when running magic-damage heavy armies because the targeted unit becomes temporarily ethereal; this prevents them from being physically harmed, but they take additional damage from spells and magic attacks. Banish also slows the unit down.\nSiphon Mana is a great spell for the Blood Mage, and regardless of what spell you go for first, it should be his side skill. The Blood Mage's spells require immense amounts of mana in order to operate, and this spell helps him alleviate this problem. Though nowhere as consistent as the Archmage's Brilliance Aura, Mana Drain can be used to rip mana off an enemy unit or Hero rapidly. It can also be used to channel mana from the Blood Mage to the targeted friendly Hero, making it a quick patch-up for mana-intense heroes like the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhoenix is the Blood Mage's ultimate and is a powerful supporting aerial unit, dealing high magic damage and possessing Spell Immunity protecting it from magic attacks. The Phoenix can be a major pain to enemies if used properly due to its ability to constantly revive itself in its egg form if the egg is not destroyed in time.\nGive the Blood Mage all Intelligence boosting and mana regeneration items. This ensures he can make the most out of his mana and support everyone better.\nIn smaller games, the Blood Mage is usually picked up as a \"mana battery\" after opening with a Mountain King, forgoing Flame Strike in order to focus on the synergy between their other spells: Siphon Mana helps keep the Mountain King's small mana pool topped up while denying the enemy's spellcasting, and Banish into Storm Bolt will outright kill weaker enemies and cripple most others. This allows the Human player to opt for a much more aggressive playstyle than opening with an Archmage.\nSpells and abilities.\nlame Strike.\nFlame Strike's damage is capped to 6 targets at a time; if it hits more than that, then the damage is spread equally across all units. The spell also deals the same amount of damage to buildings. The spell can also clear trees in the targeted area, but given its small AoE, use it sparingly for this purpose. Mid/late game should simply use &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20Team%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mortar Team&lt;/a&gt;s or have peasants already chopping that area down early game.\nWhen used, the Blood Mage swirls around as if he is in a trance, and a gong-like sound will be heard when he conjures the flames. Do not move the Blood Mage until the flames appear, or the spell will be canceled and his mana will be wasted.\nStun the Blood Mage before the flames appear (roughly one second to stop it) or simply run away from the area of effect.\nanish.\nNotes: Healing spells will also heal for 66% more.\nThis spell is useful at temporarily incapacitating specific enemy units, as Banish makes them temporarily ethereal. Ethereal units can cast spells as normal. They are immune to physical damage, but cannot attack enemies. Ethereal units also take 66% additional damage from magic attacks and spells. Banish also reduces the targeted unit's movement speed by 50%.\nBanishing your units can prove beneficial, as it increases the potency of your unit's spells. This also stops the enemy from focusing down on specific units with ease. However, this trick is fairly useless against heavy aerial units, who typically possess magic damage and thus they'll deal more damage as a result. This also allows for increased hero killing opportunities by the enemy with Heroes like the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; and Mountain King whose nuke spells deal very high damage.\nDispel. If the banished unit is an enemy unit, focus them down with magic and spell damage.\nSipho Mana.\nThis spell is useful at taking mana from the enemy for your own purposes. Try to cast the spell against an enemy with high mana pool; to check mana pools, hold on the Alt button - this shows all units health and mana on the visible screen. The blue bar indicates how much mana the units have. Try to use it on creeps or enemy melee heroes, as creeps will not move and enemy melee heroes tend to get stuck and have trouble getting out of the Siphon Mana's range.\nSiphon Mana also works on your own Heroes (though not in the Campaign); simply have the Blood Mage target your desired Hero and he will immediately start siphoning mana to them. Use this on heroes like &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to keep their mana pool replenished so they can cast Holy Light. \nAs a channeled ability, forcing the Blood Mage to move or stunning him stops the Siphon Mana immediately. Running the targeted unit out of range also ends the spell prematurely.\nPhoeni (Ultimate).\nThe Phoenix is a powerful aerial unit that is very effective at taking out aerial units. It also has a pseudo-Flame Strike effect where it'll launch streams of fire to nearby enemy units, causing a burn effect, coupled with its high magic damage. The Phoenix possesses Spell Immunity, preventing heavy aerial units from damaging it in combat. \nThe Phoenix loses health rapidly over time, and cannot recover this health from Fountains of Life. Despite its Spell Immunity, a Paladin can still heal it with Holy Light.\nWhen it reaches 0 health, the Phoenix lands on the ground and turns into a Phoenix Egg. The egg possesses 200 health and also possesses Spell Immunity. If it is not destroyed in 10 seconds, the Phoenix is reborn with full health.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt;'s Feral Wolves, if a new Phoenix is summoned while one is on the field, the old Phoenix is automatically destroyed.\nManual description.\nA mystical Hero, adept at controlling magic and ranged assaults. Though still members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Elves have begun to turn to the darkest parts of magic, abandoning the water and frost spells of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; for the fire and heat of what some people fear to be Demonic magic. Attacks land and air units."}
