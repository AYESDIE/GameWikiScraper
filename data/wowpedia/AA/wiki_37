This will cut down file size but it will also destroy some detail due to JPG being a lossy format. People who want to change the format back to TARGA (TGA) will need to use the following command:\n /console screenshotFormat tga \nYou may also set the format to JPEG but change the quality (decreasing compression and increasing size) with the following commands:\n /console screenshotFormat jpg \n /console screenshotQuality 10 \nYou can also look for and edit (or add) the 2 lines in &lt;a href=\"config.wtf\"&gt;config.wtf&lt;/a&gt;: \n SET screenshotFormat \"\"f\"\n SET screenshotQuality \"q\"\"\nWhere \"f\" is the format (\"jpg\" or \"tga\") and \"q\" is the quality (1-10). Note the double quotes. The change will be reflected the next time you start the game.\nNote that \"screenshotQuality\" only affects JPEG screenshots (TGA screenshots always use lossless quality). There are reports that an older version would compress the images to JPEG and then save them as TGA (causing a loss of quality) but this does not happen with the current patch. Also, note that anything other than \"tga\" in \"screenshotFormat\" sets it to the default (JPEG).\nIf you want to revert to the original settings you can use these commands: \n /console screenshotFormat jpg \n /console screenshotQuality 3 \nOptionally you can create an addon using the &lt;a href=\"API%20SetCVar\"&gt;SetCVar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"API%20ConsoleExec\"&gt;ConsoleExec&lt;/a&gt; API.\nAs of 10th March 2012 (4.3.3)\nSource : http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4366252520#5\nNotes.\nThe last screenshot you have taken is also stored (in lossless, uncompressed format) in the system clipboard, even if you have the file format set to JPEG. It can be pasted from there into most image editing applications.\nSetting the screenshot quality to 10 or the screenshot format to TGA will also prevent the identification watermark from being embedded in the screenshot. This watermark allows Blizzard to identify your account or any third party to identify if multiple screenshots originate from the same account."}

A time bar will appear and it goes from full (with green) to empty. Generally, channeling spells also have a &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Time\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt;, although it is zero (hence instant). However, some exceptions with a casting time above zero do exist, as mentioned below. \nAdditional notes:\nCurrently, all channeled spells, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, are calculated as periodic effects (&lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal%20over%20Time\"&gt;Heal over Time&lt;/a&gt;). \nUsing &lt;a href=\"bandage\"&gt;bandage&lt;/a&gt;s is a channeled ability.\nChanneled Abilities with a Casting Time.\nSome channeled abilities still have a Casting Time, such as &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;. Their behaviour at the beginning is that of a normally cast spell (see &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Time\"&gt;Casting Time&lt;/a&gt;), and after finishing to cast, they function like channeled spells (as above). So the mana is consumed after finishing normal casting, but before starting to channel.\nDifferences to spells with cast time.\nCurrently, all channeling spells (except &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;) technically cause &lt;a href=\"periodic%20damage\"&gt;periodic damage&lt;/a&gt;, which means that they behave like &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; spells for the most part. As a result, do not cause &lt;a href=\"interruption\"&gt;interruption&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, they have only one &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt; check at the cast of the spell; as soon as the spell hits the target, the caster does not need to maintain LoS in order to keep the channel active.\nThere are some characteristics that make channeled spells more or less desirable in specific situations. These are:\nConclusion.\nIf in a situation in which incoming spell pushback, interrupts, or movement is likely, you must decide whether time or mana is of more concern. If mana is more important, you will want to use non-channeled spells. If time is more important, you will want to use channeled spells to do as much damage or healing as you can. Note also that if a channeled spell is fully interrupted (such as with a &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; or a type of &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; perhaps) after a couple seconds, you're better off than if you had been casting a non-channeled spell for a couple seconds and then got an interrupt.\nDifferent classes and situations call for different tactics, however; For example, in melee PvE, a shadow priest who is low on mana but has up will often focus on using the mana-efficient, channeled spell &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt;, but when the shield falls they will often switch to using a combination of &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Spike\"&gt;Mind Spike&lt;/a&gt;, or even their wand to deal damage."}

While it doesn't seem like a lot of damage, each rift does this damage to the entire party every two seconds. It adds up.\nNow, while it looks as though the rifts zap each party member individually this is not the case. The rift lightning is in fact a chain-effect that targets the party member closest to the rift before arcing to another party member in the chain. This means that if one party member is closer to the rifts than the rest of the party, and there is a large enough gap between that member and the rest of the party, then the lightning will not arc to the rest of the group.\nNOTE: The rift lightning will not chain to or from pets.\nWraiths.\nThe wraiths are social with their rifts. If the rifts can zap you, and they can, then the wraiths will aggro to you no matter how far away you are.\nRequirements.\nThe requirement for this achievement is to kill &lt;a href=\"Anomalus\"&gt;Anomalus&lt;/a&gt; without killing any of the rifts he opens. Where normally you DPS in a simply priority setup (Rifts, then wraiths, then the boss) the achievement makes things a bit different. In order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Anomalus\"&gt;Anomalus&lt;/a&gt; you will need to reposition the party every 25% of the boss's health to a new choke point, position all party members correctly in order to minimize all damage from the rifts' Arcane Lightning attack, and kill a lot of arcane wraiths.\nGroup Makeup.\nAny group makeup will work, although there are ways to make your life easier.\nPositioning.\nThe key to this achievement is properly positioning your group members during the invincibility stages so that only the tank is getting zapped by the rifts and has the opportunity to intercept the incoming waves of wraiths. Proper positioning for the group is behind a choke point with the tank between the rest of the group and all spawned rifts. The tank must be the closest party member to the rifts so that he gets zapped rather than the rest of the group, and he must be far enough away that the attack does not chain into the rest of the group.\nChoke Points.\nAt 75%, 50%, and 25% HP when &lt;a href=\"Anomalus\"&gt;Anomalus&lt;/a&gt; shrinks and becomes invincible the party will have to deal with the lightning attack channeled by all active rifts as well as all wraiths that spawn (regardless of their distance from the rifts. Rifts are social with wraiths and the wraiths will aggro to the party when the rifts zap them). The point of a choke point is to funnel all spawned wraiths into a common area so that they can be quickly killed with AoE as they approach.\nStrategy.\nThe strategy is simple: Tank &lt;a href=\"Anomalus\"&gt;Anomalus&lt;/a&gt; until he shrinks. When he does the entire party turns and runs making sure that the tank is the last one to leave. When the party gets behind a good choke point the tank eats the lightning, the healer focuses on the tank, the ranged DPS AoE any and all wraiths that come to play, and the melee chill until the shrink phase is over. When the shrink phase ends the tank picks up the boss and the strat is repeated.\nAfter the third channeling phase is over, the fight is relatively simple. Just continue the fight as before, being cautious of any adds that have spawned and are attacking the tank. If the tank dies, Anomalus can easily be kited back towards the front entrance of the instance while ranged dps kill him, ignoring the adds. \"Keep in mind that a path will have to be pre-cleared before you attempt kiting, as Anomalus can cause nearby mobs to aggro, wiping your group!\"\nThis achievement is perfectly possible with a decently geared group in 80 blues and epics from heroics. Since the majority of damage dealt is , some Arcane Resistance gear will help to significantly lower the healing load required of your healer, however it is not mandatory.\nArcane Resistance is far from mandatory. Properly positioning the group will make life far easier than any amount of Arcane Resistance. Combined with a well timed cooldown, positioning and a good series of choke points will leave you wondering how you ever thought this achievement was hard.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In \"World of Warcraft\", the term 'character' is mainly used to refer to a player character, also known as an &lt;a href=\"Avatar%23Other%20definitions\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"toon\"&gt;toon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe maximum number of characters per user &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; is 60. Players used to have a limit to the amount of characters per &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; but can now create their 60 characters all on one realm if they wish.\nCharacteristics include: &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter selection screen.\nAt the Character Selection screen, you can make a new character, choose a character to play, change your current realm, access tech support, and adjust your account settings.\nClicking the Create New Character button takes you to the character creation screen, where you can generate a character to play in the game.\nThe right side of the Character Selection screen lists any characters you have created. If you haven\u2019t yet made any characters, this area is blank. You can have up to 50 characters, which is the account limit, with no character slot limit per realm for the modern game, but a maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm, with no overlap or regard with the character limits between the modern game and WoW Classic.\nEach character entry shows the character's name, &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;, current &lt;a href=\"location\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; state. Clicking on a character displays it in the center of your screen.\nTo delete a character, select that character and then press the Delete Character button. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. Click the Okay button to permanently erase that character.\nRealms are discrete game worlds. You can interact with all the players in your realm, but originally not with players in other realms, this was changed with &lt;a href=\"cross-realm\"&gt;cross-realm&lt;/a&gt; technology released with the pre-expansion patch for \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\". When you first play World of Warcraft, your realm will be pre-selected for you.\nIf you wish to play in a different realm, press the Change Realm button. A list appears showing all available realms and the current number of players in each realm. Click on the realm you want to join, and press the Okay button.\nCreating characters.\nNew characters can be created from the character selection screen by clicking the Create A New Character button, which will open the character creation screen. When choosing a new server for the first time, the player is automatically taken to the character creation screen.\nThe character creation screen allows the player to choose a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, gender, and &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; for their new character. Note that the race and class choices are essentially permanent, and once the character is created cannot be changed in-game. A character's race can be changed through a paid service outside the game itself, namely the &lt;a href=\"Race%20Change\"&gt;Race Change&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not possible to change an existing character's class by any means.\nOnce the race, class, and gender are chosen, the player can then customize several aspects of their character's appearance, including their face, hair, skin color and race-specific options such as horns, tusks, and tentacles. Each of these features can be adjusted individually, or the player can try random combinations through the Randomize button. All of these features and the gender can later be changed by visiting a &lt;a href=\"barbershop\"&gt;barbershop&lt;/a&gt; in-game.\nFinally, the player must choose a name for their character. The Randomize button can be used to generate random names, in keeping with the race and gender chosen. The choice of the name is permanent unless the paid &lt;a href=\"Name%20Change\"&gt;Name Change&lt;/a&gt; service is used.\nOnce the player is happy with all of their selections, the character itself is created, and immediately becomes available for play. New characters normally start at level 1, except for &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s (which start at level 10), and &lt;a href=\"hero%20class\"&gt;hero class&lt;/a&gt;es (which depending on race start at level 8 or level 10). The starting location, gear, and inventory of each character are determined by its faction, race and class.\nOn &lt;a href=\"public%20test%20realm\"&gt;public test realm&lt;/a&gt;s and during &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; testing, players may be able to create template characters through a special button from the character selection screen.\nDeleting characters.\nCharacters can be deleted from the character selection screen, with the player required to manually type \"DELETE\" in order to confirm the action. Once deleted, the character will no longer be shown or be available for play.\nCharacter deletion is permanent, and deleting a character will cause all gear and items to be lost. However, the Undelete Character feature can allow players to restore certain deleted characters.\nRestoring deleted characters.\nComing with &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the Restore Deleted Character option allows the player to restore deleted characters, with a few limitations.\nWhether a character is available for undeletion depends on its level and the amount of time that has elapsed since it was deleted.\nMoving characters.\nThe following text is from the Worldofwarcraft.com Changing Realms/Character Move page (part of \"Account Management\"):\n\"Character Migration\" in the Terms of Use.\nThe following text is from the Blizzard &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html\"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"WoW\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt; (WoW_TOU_enNA_20050505, May 5, 2005 version):"}

Clicking on this will open the two step process to boosting your character to the given level.\nFinalization.\nClicking \"Level Up!\" Gives you one final \"Are you sure?\" message in the center of the screen before the boost is used.\nVeteran Bonus.\nIf the selected character is level 60 or higher, it would have had its two primary &lt;a href=\"professions\"&gt;professions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; increased to skill 800. If the character did not have any professions learned, the game would have provided defaults based on the type of armor the character wears.\nIntroductory experience.\nFreshly boosted characters do not immediately have access to all abilities appropriate to their level. Rather, they start out with a basic set of spells and abilities for their class, and must unlock the rest of their spells and abilities a few at a time by advancing through a short introductory experience.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, but before the release of \"Warlords of Draenor\", boosted characters had to unlock their abilities through the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;Iron Horde Incursion&lt;/a&gt; world event in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. With the release of \"Warlords\", boosted characters instead acquire their abilities through the &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor%20intro%20experience\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor intro experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nVeteran players that want to skip this progression of spells and abilities may either swap specializations or queue for an instance. This will unlock the remaining spells and abilities.\nGear.\nWhen a character is boosted to level 90 or level 100, all gear slots are emptied and filled with new specialization-appropriate &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;ilevel&lt;/a&gt; 483 (or ilevel 640 for level 100) &lt;a href=\"uncommon\"&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt;-quality gear. The previous gear is mailed to the character. These mailed items may include Timeless items that were earlier mailed to the character by other characters on the same account. The boosted character can immediately turn these into &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; quality gear, increasing that character's item level even more.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It works on a fixed duration, and may be limited to a &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; or a number of &lt;a href=\"characters\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo characters may be transferred that have items on &lt;a href=\"Void%20Storage\"&gt;Void Storage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; or current &lt;a href=\"auctions\"&gt;auctions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gear\"&gt;Gear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt; content, &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; content and character specifications (&lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;...) are transferred. If the destination realm has a character with a name equal to the character name to be transferred, the owner will be prompted to change the name.\nOn 14 February 2023, players were able to transfer their characters for free to any or realm until the Season of Mastery realms were completely removed on 28 July 2023."}

{"id": "134010", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=134010", "title": "Character towing", "text": "Character towing is a term used to describe the process of power leveling a character through the use of a second account and a character that is of a much higher level than the subject character. Character towing, executed properly, can net the subject character large amounts of experience, gold, and items within the shortest amount of time. Some older MMO players may refer to this process as \"power leveling my alt with my (friend's) main\", but it means the same thing as towing.\nThe goal of this guide is to help you level a character, through the use of a second high-level character that you already own, thus leveraging the time investment in your main character to create a second high-level character in the minimum time possible. This technique is feasible for either &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters of any &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter towing is not considered an exploit by the &lt;a href=\"Terms%20of%20Use\"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt;, provided that you have no financial incentives such as selling the character afterward.\nExperience formula.\nThe experience formula for character towing is unknown at this time, but there is a point that the level difference between the towing character and towee character results in the towee only receiving 1 experience point per kill as well as an upper cap to the mob level difference that nets no additional experience.\nThe ideal level difference between the towing character should be enough that the mobs being killed are of a trivial (gray) level difference. This ensures that the towing character is absorbing the least amount of available experience from the Towed character.\nThe ideal level of mobs to tow a lower level character through would be no higher in level compared to the towee than the amount of levels below that character that they could get experience from on by killing on their own their own. The reason for this is that if you kill characters above this threshold you are slowing down the towing process, because these higher level mobs will take longer to kill while only granting a trivial amount of additional experience if any over what killing the recommended level difference mobs would net.\nThe minimum level for effective character towing is unknown at this time. Further research needs to be completed in this arena to come to a conclusive result. Please submit any information to this article for inclusion.\nMethods.\nOverworld grinding.\nOverworld grinding involves putting the towed character on auto-follow on the main character and killing in the Overworld (non-instance) areas. There are several limitations on overworld grinding:\nInstance towing.\nInstance towing is the same as overworld towing, but is strictly carried out via the use of dungeon instanced content in the game world. Instance towing is enjoyable and provides many additional benefits when compared to Overworld towing, while eliminating its limitations. A 2-character run, e.g. level 70 and level 30, through Scarlet Monastery, can net as much as 7900-9000 NON-rested experience, PER WING, and can be accomplished in as little as 10-15 minutes each, depending on class, spec, etc. Rested experience bonus would obviously double this. With roughly 40,000 XP required to level at L30, the ability to clear the instance quickly can have a massive impact on leveling speed, in this scenario. There are multiple benefits, especially when compared to overworld towing:\nBest towing classes.\nThe following class types are the better classes to use in the towing process as the lead character.\nArea of effect.\nAny character class that is capable of hitting multiple mobs at one time will produce the fastest results while towing as they can gather mobs and kill them at a rate that far exceeds other classes. The best towers can clear an entire lower-level instance in 1-2 pulls. As the level of the instance ascends, however, some AoE classes (especially the cloth-wearing ones) will have a harder time killing large groups of mobs before they get themselves killed. Further, with too many mobs attacking caster classes, casting even fast spells can take a very large amount of time without a shield of some kind (like ).\nWhile not a traditional AoE class, the feral druid posses an AoE in the form of &lt;a href=\"Swipe\"&gt;Swipe&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, it hits everything in front of the druid and to either side. Depending on the spec, a druid can make an excellent tower. Specifically, a well-geared &lt;a href=\"Feral\"&gt;Feral&lt;/a&gt;-spec druid has the benefit of using &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Leader%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Improved Leader of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; to continuously keep healing themselves while towing lower level characters through instances. A decently well-geared level 70 feral druid in bear form can pull large numbers of mobs and maintain nearly full health and rage simply through &lt;a href=\"Swipe\"&gt;swiping&lt;/a&gt; continuously. Depending on the druid's gear, this can be done in instances up to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;, or even higher. In these higher level instances, if the druid has enough &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt;, they can potentially outpace a Protection-spec Paladin while towing while avoiding the need for mana or normal healing.\nDPS.\nDPS classes are the next best choice to an AoE class for character towing as their high damage output can outpace a bad pull when fighting lower-level mobs.\nHelpful macros.\nSuggested.\nNote: It is possible to make a macro that will bandage if the towed character does not have aggro, or drink a healing potion if he does. Conditional selection macro in process.\nBest places.\nCertain instances (e.g. Undead Stratholme) are both excellent for towing and result in enormous amounts of dropped &lt;a href=\"Runecloth\"&gt;Runecloth&lt;/a&gt; from the trash mobs, which is useful for rep for the towing toon. Some max-level toons will be happy to tow someone through these instances on the condition that they keep all the Runecloth.\nAnother method of instance towing is as follows:\nExperience per kill observed towing.\nThe following table shows the approximate amount of experience that the towed character will receive if a mob was killed of the level difference shown. Please note that the level differences are always the amount that the mob's level exceeds that of the towed character.\nAny help filling in these numbers is greatly appreciated and may lead to the discovery of the exp formula for towing.\nTips when trying to record data for the chart:\nIt should be noted that Retribution Aura from a Paladin seems to \"steal\" experience from a kill, i.e., if you are being towed by a Paladin using Retribution Aura, and the aura ends up dealing damage equal to 20% of a mob's total health before the mob dies, you will only get 80% of the experience from the kill. Other damage shields such as a Shaman's Lightning Shield have the same effect.\nAlso be wary of \"entrance\" mobs, or mobs that are encountered early in the instance and may yield slightly less experience than the mobs who occupy the main portion of the dungeon. An example of this would be the Scarlet mobs in Scarlet Monastery: Graveyard, who yield slightly less experience than the same level Undead elites found later in the instance. Also, Scarlet Monastery: Armory has the \"Training Grounds\" first room, where mobs yield slightly less experience than same-level mobs found throughout the rest of the Armory.\nReverse towing.\nAnother strategy that can be effective in certain situations is Reverse Towing. In this scenario, the low level towee quests normally, with a high level tower keeping them alive. This has the following benefits:\nThis approach works best when the tower is a healing class, as they can focus on keeping the towee(s) alive to minimise downtime. Ideally the towee should be in DPS or tanking spec to enable rapid mob clearing. \nDue to XP mechanics, a healing-only contribution from the tower seems not to affect the XP gained by the towee. This can make for very rapid XP gains and quest completion.\nReverse Towing also works well when &lt;a href=\"multiboxing\"&gt;multiboxing&lt;/a&gt;. The load on the tower is often quite low, for example requiring the use of only one &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt; and one emergency quick heal. Simply put the tower on follow, press those heals when necessary and play the towee more aggressively that you would normally.\nReverse towing does not work particularly well in instances, due to the time it takes to kill elite mobs with an at-level towee. In these cases, it is recommended to switch back to a more traditional towing arrangement."}

The &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; that seems to haunt the forest is also present in the town.\nHistory.\nAfter the loss of &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt; were sent to the east. Despite having a few problems in their way there, most of the survivors manage to reach Stormglen Village at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;. Here the fleeing residents of Duskhaven were hoping for safety into friendly open arms, but it was discovered that the residents of the town have disappeared without a trace, leaving the village abandoned. It is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the village and converted some of the townspeople into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Those that resisted their \"blessings\" were killed.\nThe village was almost intact, but a group of &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Vilebrood%20Skitterer\"&gt;Vilebrood&lt;/a&gt; overrun the eastern section of the settlement. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was sent to dispatch them. The spiders didn't stop coming, so the adventurer was sent to the Vilebrood nest at &lt;a href=\"Rygna%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Rygna's Lair&lt;/a&gt; to kill their broodmother, Vilebrood Matriarch &lt;a href=\"Rygna\"&gt;Rygna&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was an old man named &lt;a href=\"Bradshaw\"&gt;Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt; that kept a journal of the events transpiring at Stormglen. After recovering its lost pages, &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; was able to know where the town citizens had gone to. As like the rest of Gilneas, Stormglen was also attacked by the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the survivors (presumably those that escaped the Wolf Cult) left for &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains to the east.\nAfter the events in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer returned to Stormglen, telling the refugees to continue east, through the Blackwald, and into the mountains to Tempest's Reach."}

A stormhammer, when thrown, strikes with the fury of lightning and the force of thunder, hitting its target with a thunderclap. The weapon then comes back into the hand of its holder.\nBackground.\nMost sacred to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; is the enchanted forge that lies deep within the secret chambers of each &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gryphon aviary&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that the magical weapons known as stormhammers are fashioned. This destructive weapon, combined with the indomitable spirit of the &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, justifies their position as masters of the skies.\n&lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; raised among the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; from infancy, was the first known human to have earned their own stormhammer.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, human gryphon riders also used storm hammers.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves' signature weapon, this dwarven battle hammer is beautifully crafted, with a lightning bolt patter carved into the polished wooden haft and clouds and lightning etched into the faceted metal head. Even the leather-wrapped around the handle is mottled to suggest clouds and rain. The wielder swinging the hammer can cause a copy of the weapon to appear and fly towards the target, allowing it to be used as a ranged weapon.\nThe signature weapon of elite gryphon teams, storm hammers must be rededicated to their owners each year. The ceremony is held every solstice in the great halls of the gryphon aviaries. The details of the ceremony are secret, but they are said to involve chanting, solemn oaths, and terrible hangovers the next day.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mountain%20king\"&gt;mountain king&lt;/a&gt; can use storm hammers as a spell-like ability.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe stormhammer appears as in the \"&lt;a href=\"Descent%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;Descent of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

Stormheim is notably home to a large population of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who left &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; many ages ago in search of their holy land. The region's rugged, uneven landscape has since become something of a cradle for vrykul society, which is centered around its long fjords and steep ravines.\nReligion and culture in Stormheim generally revolves around the &lt;a href=\"titan%20keeper\"&gt;titan keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, who is viewed as a god among the vrykul, though his nemesis &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; is also venerated in some areas. In recent times, vrykul belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; clan have also pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"demonic\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for power. The &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, the realms to which the vrykul journey when they die, are located in this zone.\nHaving once served as the stage for fierce battles during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Stormheim would once again see turmoil during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the Burning Legion. Both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; would arrive and clash in the region as both groups searched for the legendary &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Set against the backdrop of a major demon incursion, this conflict would decisively shape the early stages of the war on the Broken Isles.\nHistory.\nAn ancestral homeland of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, Stormheim was once considered a city. At one point, it was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Vrykul forces led by the heroic king &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; launched a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the Highborne with their ferocity. For weeks the elves and vrykul skirmished, with the latter scoring immediate victories and gaining enough momentum to push the Highborne out of the city. The elves' last chance to reclaim Stormheim happened at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Suramar%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Suramar Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end the vrykul stood victorious. The Highborne were forced to flee and never made a claim upon Stormheim again. Moments after the vrykul victory, traitors loyal to &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; arose within Magnar's ranks and managed to kill both the king and his son &lt;a href=\"Hruthnir\"&gt;Hruthnir&lt;/a&gt;, but Magnar's people were able to rally and prevent the Helarjar from claiming Stormheim.\nStormheim was host to many brutal battles during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic artifacts still litter the area millennia later. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Stormheim became the easternmost region of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a makeshift prison for &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, would come to occupy the clouds high above Stormheim, and this would grant the region a special significance for the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; people. This race worshiped Odyn as a deity and yearned to join the ranks of his formidable Valarjar. Though native to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, many vrykul would make the voyage to the Broken Isles over the years and gravitated towards Stormheim. The gateway to the Halls of Valor, known as the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, dominated the eastern half of this region, while the vrykul population grew and flourished throughout wider Stormheim.\nAlthough the vrykul of Stormheim are generally loyal to Odyn and the Valarjar, another powerful being holds great sway in the region: the Sea-Witch &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. With her &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;, she traditionally seeks to corrupt the souls of fallen warriors and add them to her ranks, largely to spite Odyn.\nSometime before the invasion of the Burning Legion, the Helarjar attacked and occupied &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;Tideskorn Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in northern Stormheim, converting most of its denizens. It has since become a focal point of Helya's influence in the area.\nSearch for the Aegis.\nAfter thousands of years, Stormheim had become a highly distinct region of the Broken Isles. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, it housed the largest population of vrykul on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and the vrykul of Stormheim had developed their own clans and other factions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20clan\"&gt;Tideskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt;. This era of relative isolation would be brought to an abrupt end when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched its &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' arrival had immediate repercussions for Stormheim. &lt;a href=\"Skovald\"&gt;Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, a prince of the Tideskorn vrykul clan, was attracted by the Legion's offer of power in exchange for service. He secretly forged a pact with the invaders and made moves to seize power within his clan. Alongside his brothers he killed his father, before turning on them as well. Skovald emerged from the civil war victorious as Jarl, leaving only his mother &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bretta\"&gt;Queen Bretta&lt;/a&gt; to oppose his ascension as God-King. By this time, Skovald had also fully embraced the Burning Legion; he and his followers were imbued and corrupted by potent &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt;. In a final confrontation at &lt;a href=\"Kingsfall%20Pass\"&gt;Kingsfall Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Skovald slew his mother and routed her forces.\nAlong with the Tideskorn clan, Skovald also attracted the support of the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt;. Since ancient times, these vrykul maintained a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon becoming Felskorn, however, they betrayed their draconic allies, instead enslaving them. As God-King, and with an army at his back, Skovald quickly turned his attention to retrieving the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, the demons' main objective in the region. &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and most other vrykul opposed the demonic invasion, though there was little they could do to stop the Felskorn's plans.\nMore outsiders would soon arrive on Stormheim's shores, this time in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Though both factions were ostensibly working to defeat the Legion, their efforts soon became directed at one another. The Alliance dispatched their \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to spearhead the strike force, while Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; led a large &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; naval &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt; to carry out her own invasion; the two sides would ultimately clash on Stormheim's northern coast. Both factions suffered heavily in this engagement, though their hostilities were not blunted, and conflict would continue to break out in the campaign ahead.\nIn the aftermath of their initial battle, the \"Skyfire\" would crash near the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Bluffs\"&gt;Weeping Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;, creating the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt;, while most of the Windrunner Fleet remained wrecked in the &lt;a href=\"Cove%20of%20Nashal\"&gt;Cove of Nashal&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde, Alliance, and demons continued their search for the Aegis, while at the same time Warchief Sylvanas herself pursued another goal. With Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; at her side (and the Alliance tracking her movements) she would infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Eyir\"&gt;Vault of Eyir&lt;/a&gt; in central Stormheim. There, she hoped to use the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; to create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; for her own ends. Her plans failed, however, , allowing Eyir to escape.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; renewed his efforts to stop the Burning Legion's invasion of the region. Along with mortal heroes from the newly-arrived Alliance and Horde, he directed a campaign against the Felskorn and their demon allies in the guise of the vrykul Havi. In addition to this, Odyn dealt with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; based from &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;Tideskorn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, who had been creating more &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; from the souls of deceased Valarjar. In both conflicts Odyn's agents met with success, even securing the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s, but God-King Skovald continued to gain ground.\nDetermined to retrieve the Aegis of Aggramar for himself, Skovald would lead a massive assault on the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. Countless Felskorn and demons crashed against Odyn's defenses, and they came close to overwhelming the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. Champions of Odyn would eventually meet Skovald in combat and drive him from the field, thus stemming his reinforcements and crippling his assault on Stormheim.\nThough his armies were bested, the God-King himself refused to give up. He charged forth into the Halls of Valor in search of the Aegis, closely pursued by Odyn's champions. After completing the many trials that stood in their way, these champions eventually confronted Skovald at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seat of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. Before Odyn himself, God-King Skovald and the mortal heroes battled for control of the Aegis. Though determined, Skovald was bested and slain, allowing his foes to claim the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; and move it to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping. Odyn celebrated the victory, which heralded the end of the Legion threat in Stormheim for the time being.\nTrial of Valor.\nSome time after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; continued to plague the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Though she had suffered an earlier defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, her work did not cease. The souls of &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; continued to be twisted into &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate, a fact that deeply infuriated Odyn.\nIn response, the &lt;a href=\"titan%20keeper\"&gt;titan keeper&lt;/a&gt; rallied his champions once more in preparation for a an assault on &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; that would deal with Helya permanently. After being personally tested by Odyn within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, the party of heroes traveled to &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt; in the west of Stormheim. Cutting through Helya's minions, they were able to venture into Helheim itself and confront the Sea-Witch. After a great battle, Helya was slain; her death would forever free Stormheim and the world beyond from the age-old threat posed by the Helarjar.\nInvasion.\nAs the war against the Legion progressed, the demons would launch further &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;assaults&lt;/a&gt; on the regions in proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Stormheim was one of those targeted, and a large invasion force under &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Commander%20Alexius\"&gt;Lord Commander Alexius&lt;/a&gt; descended on the region in strength. &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; chose to lead the defense of Stormheim, directing its varied inhabitants in foiling the Legion's efforts. He was aided in this task by the same mortal &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; that had defeated &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong other acts perpetrated by the Legion during the assault, the demons forged an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Morheim\"&gt;Morheim&lt;/a&gt;, ritually drained ancient &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; spirits in &lt;a href=\"Felscale%20Cavern\"&gt;Felscale Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, established a spying base at &lt;a href=\"Amberfall%20Mesa\"&gt;Amberfall Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, and sacrificed prisoners to harvest their souls at &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Storm's Reach&lt;/a&gt;. They would also deploy at least one &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; to the region, though the landscape proved impassable and it was soon ruined. The &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; were also heavily involved in the defense of Stormheim at this time.\nAfter many of these threats had been dealt with, Stormheim's defenders would discover that they had mainly been diversions. The primary demon attack, based from the island of &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, was well underway by the time Odyn's champions arrived to repel it. With the help of the Thorignir, they were successful in crippling the invasion force. The battle for Stormheim would culminate in a final conflict at the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, where Odyn personally destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; of Lord Commander Alexius leading the assault.\nA new God-Queen.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; raged to the south, an ancient prophecy began to play out in Stormheim guided by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. In line with the prophecy, they sought out the last heir to the late &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Jandvik\"&gt;Jandvik&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. By helping her ascension to the throne, the &lt;a href=\"%3AScrolls%20of%20the%20Faldrottin\"&gt;:Scrolls of the Faldrottin&lt;/a&gt; stated that she\u2014&lt;a href=\"Sigryn\"&gt;Sigryn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014would unite the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; clan once again, and turn it against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. With her newfound allies, Sigryn traveled to the home of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt; and there convened with &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; herself. The &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; explained the importance of the task to Sigryn, who became determined to see it through.\nSigryn embarked on a quest to gain the support of the most important &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; factions in Stormheim, and crush any opposition to her claim to the throne. As part of this, she bested both &lt;a href=\"Runeseer%20Faljar\"&gt;Runeseer Faljar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Velbrand\"&gt;Jarl Velbrand&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;. Doing this gained her the support of both groups, and she soon learned of a greater threat in the form of her still-living brother &lt;a href=\"Torvald\"&gt;Torvald&lt;/a&gt;. Sigryn confronted Torvald, who had a stronger claim, in the eastern village of &lt;a href=\"Vrekt\"&gt;Vrekt&lt;/a&gt;, but was forced to slay him upon discovering his embracing of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies.\nTorvald's dying words led Sigryn to question Eyir, who revealed that &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; himself had been responsible for the death of Sigryn's mother. Infuriated, Sigryn embraced fel energy herself, and departed for the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to confront Odyn. Eventually, the Kirin Tor were able to find a way to follow her there, and a battle erupted between their agents and the would-be God-Queen. Defeated, Sigryn realized the magnitude of her actions, and forcibly ejected the fel power from her person. She subsequently returned to Eyir for forgiveness and punishment, but the &lt;a href=\"titan%20watcher\"&gt;titan watcher&lt;/a&gt; would instead charge her with taking up the crown. Her triumph over the corruption within her proved Sigryn's worthiness to rule, and Eyir named her God-Queen of the Tideskorn as was prophesied. Humbled, the new God-Queen vowed to unite the vrykul of Stormheim against the Legion and its allies.\nGetting there.\nStormheim's uneven and mountainous terrain makes it more isolated than many other regions of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The shared border with &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; also reduces its general accessibility. Only two land routes allow access to Stormheim from Highmountain and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe road from Highmountain descends craggy slopes from &lt;a href=\"Stonehoof%20Watch\"&gt;Stonehoof Watch&lt;/a&gt; to enter Stormheim from the far west. This path eventually passes through the &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Highlands\"&gt;Stony Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and on to &lt;a href=\"Valdisdall\"&gt;Valdisdall&lt;/a&gt;. The second route into Stormheim enters through the southwest, leading from Suramar's &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Thicket\"&gt;Crimson Thicket&lt;/a&gt; and passing &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt; on its way to Valdisdall as well.\nGeography.\nStormheim is an ancient land. A great number of vrykul monuments here create stunning vistas, their towns and cities scattered over countless rocky formations. Thousands of years of the ocean's brutality has carved the labyrinth-like formations that define the region today. The western portion, viridescent and dotted with pines, sits on the base of Highmountain Peak; the mountain's waters creating out the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Bluffs\"&gt;Weeping Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; and flowing into &lt;a href=\"Stonescar%20Gorge\"&gt;Stonescar Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation descends drastically as one progresses eastward and trees become denser and fade into an amber shade. The &lt;a href=\"Runewood\"&gt;Runewood&lt;/a&gt; blankets Stormheim's eastern landmass.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was the brother of &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Swiftspear\"&gt;Swiftspear&lt;/a&gt;, the chieftain of the tribe. He is revered as a hero by the taunka for battling their ancient enemy, &lt;a href=\"the%20North%20Wind\"&gt;the North Wind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSeeking to end the North Wind's dominance, Stormhoof faced the element on the &lt;a href=\"Plain%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Plain of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; near Tunka'lo and at the cost of his life severely weakened it. However, the North Wind was not destroyed, and spent hundreds of years gathering its power before taking its revenge - by changing the course of history itself and making Stormhoof to appear as a servile insurrectionist, rather than a liberator. This change was unnoticed by the people of Tunka'lo, but it gained the suspicion of &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur&lt;/a&gt; the Witness, one of the first tauren druids trained by Cenarius himself, who had been told the story of Stormhoof at &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le%20Village\"&gt;Taunka'le Village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;...and found that Tunka'lo's history did not reflect what he had heard.\nXarantaur, blessed with immortality by the bronze dragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, had been granted an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lorehammer\"&gt;Lorehammer&lt;/a&gt; by the Lord of Time. He tasked adventurers with discovering the truth behind the two conflicting stories and discovered that the North Wind itself was responsible. With the power of the Lorehammer, Xarantaur sent the adventurer back in time to Stormhoof's battle with the North Wind, where they would play the part of Stormhoof in his battle against the evil element. As before, Stormhoof fell in the battle, having weakened his enemy. However, the adventurer picked up the Horn of Elemental Fury dropped by the hero and blew a mighty blast that destroyed the North Wind once and for all.\nWith history set back to normal again, the adventurer returns to the present and meets the spirit of Stormhoof in Tunka'lo - having ensured that the hero's story would not be forgotten.\nCurrent location of the Horn.\nAccording to another legend, possibly modified by the North Wind, the horn was taken back from Stormhoof by the Wind, which then split it in half and gave it to two gorlocs to guard. The horn is reassembled by an adventurer in the Borean Tundra to repel the nerubians and save the taunka of &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le%20Village\"&gt;Taunka'le Village&lt;/a&gt;."}

He had never heard of &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s before but never the less felt they posed a threat. He thought it was odd that night elves would leave ancient trees far from any protection. He also noticed that their were guard towers to the south and west of the settlement, and wanted to avoid them. He asked Oakwidow to vow to deities she venerated to tell him it was safe to pass through the trees. She lied claiming that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; the Moon Goddess had given her blessing, and gave a mad grin, leading Stormhoof and the rest to their doom."}

I kin help us sneak past all dem guards.\nLet me know when you be ready to go.\nWalking up a bit, a town crier appears, stopping the group.\nOnce the crier finishes, he leaves and the group continues. They stop for a bit when the robots pass by.\nAnother town crier, looking for intruders, appears, and the group moves to a building, then they continue.\nThey move to a side when the robots appear.\nThe group moves to a bridge.\nThe group jumps into the water, avoiding Anduin Wrynn who is personally on duty to protect his people and his &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Stormwind Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Cleric%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Stormwind Clerics&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe group emerges from water.\nThe group continues through the bridge to Cathedral District.\nGenn and his worgen appear - cinematic, absent.\nStage 7: WAY Behind Enemy Lines.\nThalyssra conjured up a barrier that deflects the attacking &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Mauler%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Gilnean Maulers&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearing them will result in death.\nOnce the maulers are defeated, the magic barrier is down and the group begins to run, no longer stealthed.\nMore maulers will attack the group. Genn and his units will be close behind you.\nZul runs to a town crier's dropped torch and picks it up.\nThe path to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; is blocked by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who has not forgotten the crimes the Horde has committed against her and her people. She has frozen aura around her and casts an ice wall to block the way into the harbor. Nearing to her will result in ice block and death.\nThe group begins to move to the cemetery, with Genn and his group still behind them.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Battlemage\"&gt;Stormwind Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s teleport to the entrance of the cemetery and attack the group.\nZul drops the torch and sets a building ablaze. Soon it spreads. The group continues running.\nNathanos Blightcaller and the two Deathguard Elite appear on the platform leading down to the harbor. Nathanos fires arrows at guards and knights charging at the group. Jaina stands on the opposite side of the platform, shooting numerous frostbolts on the ground.\nSpeak with Nathanos to finish the stage and continue.\nCatch your breath. We won't stop until we reach the ship.\nStage 8: The Harbor Run.\nThe group heads down to the harbor. They stop by the lion statue as the path is blocked by Jaina's ice walls.\nDestroy &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Barrier\"&gt;Icy Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The group attacks it as well.\nOnce the wall is destroyed, continue with the group to the main section of the Harbor filled with &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Rifleman\"&gt;Dwarven Riflemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Gyro-Engineer\"&gt;Gnomish Gyro-Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil%20Sentinel%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Teldrassil Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Peacekeeper%20%28BfA%29\"&gt;Exodar Peacekeepers&lt;/a&gt;, Gilnean Maulers, Stormwind Knights, and Stormwind Battlemages.\nContinue following the group, killing mobs that attack you until you reach the platform with piers.\nLasan and the eagles fly above you, attacking / drawing the enemies. Continue to the pier.\nContinue to the end of the pier.\nFinal Stage: Well, Ship.\n\"Jaina roots the group with a Frost Nova and starts walking towards it.\"\nJaina teleports back to the city to save it. In the background, you can see the city burning. The group boards the ship. Lasan and his eagles also arrive.\nTalk to Talanji to finish the scenario.\nRegardless of what your Warchief wants, I must return to my people. We are going to Zuldazar, as this is my ship and this is your only way out of Stormwind.\nDo you have a problem with that?\nA cinematic of Talanji wrecking the Alliance fleet will play here.\nScenario complete, you appear in the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.

Stormpikes don't like being bothered with trivial matters.\nThe dwarven Stormpike Expedition has set up residence in the valley to search for natural resources and ancient relics. Despite their intentions, the dwarven presence has sparked heated conflict with the Frostwolf Orcs to the south, who have vowed to drive the interlopers from their lands.\nCustoms.\nThe Stormpike clan's mount trainers have a tradition of etching their names onto the left horn of every &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Battle%20Charger\"&gt;battle ram&lt;/a&gt; they raise.\nThe Stormpike clan is renowned for their rigorous training methods.\nIn the RPG.\nThe mighty dwarves of the Stormpike clan (and others) also train battle rams to serve as loyal mounts.\nAccording to Brann the Stormpike clan have taken a liking to the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and defend them fiercely against the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s invading the area.

While &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; understands why the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolves\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; want the land, he simply doesn't understand why the trolls want Alterac.

He feels these bizarre attempts to take the Alterac Mountains keep the Stormpike clan and their allies away from the front lines against the Scourge, and that it would be better if both sides would get along to fight the other threats.\nSome humans help out the Stormpike clan as well. \"\"&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Balinda%20Stonehearth\"&gt;Captain Balinda Stonehearth&lt;/a&gt; commands a massive human unit reinforcing the Stormpike clan in the valleys of the Alterac Mountains.\"\"\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", the following cards represent the members of the Stormpike clan:\nSpeculation.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, it is currently not stated whether he is the leader of the Stormpike clan as a whole, but it may be the case."}

Knaak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe novel centers around &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt; confirmed it was definitely not about &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202008\"&gt;BlizzCon 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and Chris Metzen and Micky Neilson said Malfurion would play a major role at New York Comic Con 2009.\nThe storyline explores the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The story also takes place after the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; as evidenced by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' nightmare, where she notes that &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; has already been defeated.\nIn an excerpt released, it is revealed that the minds of the entire town of &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; have been trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"audiobook\"&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; version read by Richard Ferrone was released in February, 2010.\nDescription.\nWhen the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was young, the god-like &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s brought order to it by reshaping its lands and seas. Throughout their great work, they followed a magnificent design for what they envisioned Azeroth would become. Although the titans departed Azeroth long ago, that design endures to this day. It is known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, a lush and savagely primal version of the...\nWORLD OF WARCRAFT\nMany are the mysteries surrounding the Emerald Dream and its reclusive guardians, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. In times past, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s have entered the Dream to monitor the ebb and flow of life on Azeroth in their never-ending quest to maintain the delicate balance of nature.\nHowever, not all dreams are pleasant ones. Recently the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, an area of corruption within the Emerald Dream, began growing in size, transforming the Dream into a realm of unimaginable horror. Green dragons have been unexpectedly caught up in the Nightmare, emerging from it with shattered minds and twisted bodies. Druids who have entered the darkening Dream lately have found it difficult -- sometimes even impossible -- to escape.\nNor are these the Nightmare's only victims: more and more people are being affected. Even &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, first and foremost of the druids on Azeroth, may have fallen victim to this growing threat. As uncontrollable nightmares spread across the world, a desperate quest begins to find and free the archdruid.\nSoon nature's enemies will learn the true meaning of the name\nSTORMRAGE\nPlot.\nThe opening chapters follow various characters, and the nightmares and visions they experience. Some, such as Krasus, and the townspeople of Goldshire, are unable to awake. These nightmares are attributed to the spreading of the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, both within the Dream itself and into Azeroth as well. Through these nightmares and visions, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; learns of the impending death of Malfurion, who has not returned from and has been out of reach within the Emerald Dream, as are all the others who have recently walked it, including &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this a convocation of druids is called by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, where he reveals that Teldrassil is threatened by the Dream's corruption, and that the druids' efforts to heal Teldrassil will yield to them a way to save Malfurion. In attendance at the convocation is &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who has received visions of Teldrassil's corruption and death. Tyrande asks the druids to visit Malfurion's sleeping body in Moonglade to address the situation. Fandral does not take the reports of nightmares and endless sleep spreading throughout the world as linked to Teldrassil's corruption or to Malfurion's dire state, and insists on the healing of Teldrassil as the solution. He had initially intended to use the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; to heal the Tree, but Remulos himself forbid it. \nTyrande is not convinced by Fandral's plan, and, desperate to save Malfurion, asks Broll to travel to Bough Shadow, in Ashenvale, where there is a portal that enters the Emerald Dream. He steals the Idol of Remulos from Fandral's chest in &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrande secretly accompanies him to Bough Shadow after meeting in Auberdine, leaving &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; charged with ruling Darnassus until her return.\n&lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, an orc woman, is now the bearer of the enchanted wooden axe once owned by &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. She has been receiving visions which depict Malfurion betraying Broxigar in the middle of battle leading to his death. As a result, she goes on a hunt to find Malfurion and kill him. \nWithin the Emerald Dream, Malfurion is slowly transforming into a tree against his will by the work of someone referred to only as \"the Nightmare Lord.\" He is somehow using Malfurion's druidic powers to spread the corruption throughout the world, but Malfurion can only see shadows and hear his voice, and so does not understand who the perpetrator is, or how to escape. Malfurion is actually the one behind the terrifying or alarming visions the other characters have been receiving- he has been trying to draw them into the Dream to help him. They are his only means of communication without alerting the Nightmare Lord. \nAlong the way, Tyrande, Broll and &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt; plan to enter the dream and are confronted by &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; who is reluctant to help them. He is despondent about the growing corruption and sees any plan to fight against it as futile. They leave him behind to enter the dream and are attacked by a corrupted green dragon. They manage to escape into the dream, where they find that the corruption has resulted in the death and decay of large swaths of the Dream, with many of the inhabitants of the dream, including elementals, Ancients of War, and dreamforms of druids, having become corrupt and hostile as well. They must fight against them as they search for Malfurion, and the origin of the everpresent shadow of a tree and the vision of an mysterious fortress built at the heart of the Dream. Eranikus, who despite complaining and despairing, aids them from time to time, explains that nothing out to have been built there.\nBroll and Tyrande fall victim to various nightmares as a result of the spreading corruption meant to throw them off the path. This requires that they go in and out of the Dream as the situation requires, with the help of the Lucan, who was born inside the Emerald Dream and has some power to bring others in and out at will (though where they end up on either side is unpredictable). Inside, they manage to fight against the corruption and its turned denizens. Thura gets a hold of Lucan and finds her way to Malfurion. She destroys his tree form with Brox's axe, which was enchanted by Cenarion and thus had the power to do so, freeing Malfurion in the process.\nOutside the dream, those afflicted by the sleeping sickness have begun to attack the waking around the world, including in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. Those waking who stand against them in the ensuing battles are forced to kill their own in order to survive, and inside the dreamforms of those afflicted continue on as corrupted. But finally, with Eranikus's help, they make their way to the heart of the dream where they discover that the shadow of the tree was cast by the Nightmare Lord himself.\nMalfurion finds out when the tree is shown to have blood for sap that it is actually his nemesis from the War of the Ancients &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Xavius\"&gt;Lord Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. This is the origin of the mysterious fortress- it was an apparition of Xavius's castle in Azshara before the Sundering. He initially survived Malfurion's spell transforming him into a tree during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and has since entered the Dream in this form and taken on its corruption. Eranikus gives his life in the heroes' defense, and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion destroys Lord Xavius yet again.\n&lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and Broll discover that Staghelm has actually been tricked into believing his dead son Valstann was alive again, when it was really a vision given to him by the Nightmare Lord. Through this vision, he made Fandral graft a branch of Xavius's tree form onto Teldrassil, which is the source of its corruption. He has also been the one keeping Malfurion from leaving the dream, using &lt;a href=\"morrowgrain\"&gt;morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt;. Fandral is taken to Moonglade to recover after he is discovered and the branch broken off.\nNow that they have destroyed the ostensible corruptor of the Dream, the sleeping sickness fades, and the sleepers (who weren't killed) wake up. Malfurion promises never to leave Tyrande again, and the two get married in Darnassus, with many Alliance nobles and even &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and Ysera in attendance. However, though Xavius was ruling over the Nightmare, it is strongly suggested that a much larger and unseen malevolent force is behind even his actions, with the implication that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; are responsible.\nAudiobook.\nAn audiobook adaptation was released by Simon &amp; Schuster Audio in February 2010. It was narrated by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Ferrone\"&gt;Richard Ferrone&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nThe first few pages of the book are pieces of Warcraft art, listed here. There are also maps of Teldrassil and northern Kalimdor."}

The great druid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, for whom the barrow dens are named, used to slumber deep within the dens. &lt;a href=\"Clintar%20Dreamwalker\"&gt;Clintar Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; now sleeps here.\nDirectly north of the barrow dens are &lt;a href=\"Minion%20of%20Omen\"&gt;Minions of Omen&lt;/a&gt;, high level wolf-like creatures. They only come out at night during the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;.

Malfurion was awakened by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to help fight &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nAt some point after the Third War, and the discussions about planting the second &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion arrived here to meditate. Tyrande later arrived here to find his body in a coma. When they were not able to help him, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; decided that it would be best to leave Malfurion's body where it was found, in his barrow den in the Moonglade. The general consensus was that Malfurion's spirit had the best chance of locating his body if the body was not moved. The body remained there for several years under the care of the Circle and the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nOne of the barrow dens was overrun by Nightmare creatures.

The Sentinels here are frustrated and uncertain, probably because they have the unenviable duty of guarding against an invisible attacker \u2014 whatever severed &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from his physical form must be one of the most powerful entities in the world, and that probably does not sit well with anyone. These dens might have a large number of resting druids.\nIn Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nThe Barrow Dens are located on the north-eastern corner of the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "60445", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=60445", "title": "Stormreaver clan", "text": "The Stormreaver clan was a small but powerful &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish clan created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; at the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the clan was destroyed when Gul'dan ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in search of the power therein, being either torn apart by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s dwelling in the Tomb or slaughtered by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; forces sent to exact vengeance on Gul'dan for abandoning the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during its critical time.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;clan colors&lt;/a&gt; was blue.\nHistory.\nThe Second War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan knew that he would need an army of loyal allies to reach the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, as well as protect him from the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s inevitable wrath when it learned of his intentions. Gul'dan convinced &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to grant him permission to form his own clan, claiming that he would keep his activities visible to the entire Horde as opposed to the secrecy he had practiced as leader of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. He and his clan members would be forced to fight on the front lines alongside the other orcs. Doomhammer correctly suspected that Gul'dan planned to use the new clan as a means to expand his own influence, but the Warchief was confident that he would stay one step ahead of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; by planting his own spies among the clan (though unbeknownst to Orgrim, Gul'dan would later win these spies to his side through threats, promises of power, and other means). Furthermore, Gul'dan would need a clan of his own to make an impact in the war since opinion among the orcs had turned against him and no existing clan would accept him or his followers into their ranks. Gul'dan jumpstarted the Stormreavers by recruiting the lesser warlocks and &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who had survived Doomhammer's onslaught of the Shadow Council, though he sacrificed some of them to create the first &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the course of the Second War, the Stormreavers held domain over &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the island of &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde's successful conquest of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim prepared to build a fleet to launch a surprise attack in the heart of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's territories. Many orcs had reservations about crossing the sea, but the Stormreavers urged their allies that it was the best course of action and that the voyage would be safe. Orgrim welcomed the assistance but remained wary of Gul'dan's motivations. The Stormreavers also captured &lt;a href=\"Submarine%23Goblin%20giant%20turtles\"&gt;giant sea turtles&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, to be used as a submersible orcish craft after being pacified by potent spells of control. According to &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan and the Stormreavers were rumored to be amassing a great navy in order to find the Tomb of Sargeras.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nGul'dan finally found an opportunity to break free from the warchief's control when Orgrim was preparing to abandon the siege of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and instead march west to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan convinced Orgrim and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; that the Stormreavers had found a way to destroy the magical barrier around Silvermoon, and that it would only take a few more days. Once the Stormreavers succeeded, Silvermoon would fall and Zul'jin's &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s could exact their vengeance before rejoining the rest of the Horde's forces. Orgrim was loath to leave more of his forces behind at Silvermoon, but with the Alliance forces scattered, Lordaeron was ripe for the taking and he could not allow the opportunity to pass him by. Doomhammer left the Stormreavers to unravel the barrier but ordered the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to also remain behind and force Gul'dan's forces to march west if the shield had not come down within three days. The Warchief also gave the Dragonmaw permission to feed Gul'dan to their &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; if he disobeyed.\nA few days after Doomhammer left, Gul'dan gathered his Stormreaver and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; allies and told them of his plans to seek out the Tomb of Sargeras, promising unimaginable power to all who followed him. Nearly all members of the two clans pledged their support. The Dragonmaw briefly moved to bar his path, but neither side risked fighting and instead, the Dragonmaw set out west to rejoin the main Horde force and warn Orgrim of Gul'dan's betrayal. Upon hearing the news, Orgrim sent the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; to hunt the traitors down. Gul'dan's followers ventured south, took control over a portion of the Horde fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and sailed west, but the Black Tooth Grin were close behind and boarded the rest of the orcish vessels to follow in his wake. After a hard journey across the sea, Gul'dan and his followers raised the Tomb of Sargeras from the depths with a great ritual. Not long after, the Black Tooth Grin approached the island. Gul'dan ordered &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the Twilight's Hammer to hold off the pursuers while he and the Stormreavers entered the tomb. In the darkened corridors of the complex, Gul'dan and his followers were torn apart by demons \u2014 a punishment from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; for dooming what would have been a momentous victory for the Horde and their &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; masters at Capital City. Only a few Stormreavers survived the encounter and quickly fled the tomb after retrieving their &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;master's head&lt;/a&gt;, believing that it held great power. Outside, the Black Tooth Grin cut down many of the Twilight's Hammer and grievously wounded Cho'gall, forcing the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and his few surviving followers to flee west into &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;uncharted waters&lt;/a&gt;. With vengeance served, the Black Tooth Grin orcs boarded their ships and sailed back east. As proof of their victory, they retrieved Gul'dan's skull from one of his followers.\nAftermath.\nThe slaughtered inhabitants of the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer encampment near the entrance to the tomb were later raised into undeath by the vile magics of the demons and kept reliving their last battle. By the time following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the few remaining Stormreavers wandered the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. One such hermit is &lt;a href=\"Drak%27thul\"&gt;Drak'thul&lt;/a&gt;, a former warlock who wandered the isles in solitude, haunted by the ghosts of his slaughtered comrades, and who claimed to be the last of his kind. He was encountered by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; when she journeyed to the Broken Isles and offered to tell his tale to her if she silenced the ghosts tormenting him. Other Stormreavers survived in the Tomb itself, with several &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s having raised hosts of &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20orc\"&gt;skeletal orc&lt;/a&gt;s to protect themselves, and outside of the tomb as small communities.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"Gul'dan the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;\"\nClan Colors: \"Blue\"\nBackground: \"The Stormreavers are a small but powerful clan whose origins are fixed in the history of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; since its coming to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As the last of his kind, the Warlock Gul'dan maintains absolute control over this clan. Gul'dan, who secretly ruled the Horde through his unwitting puppet &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, has found that the shrewd Doomhammer harbors no trust or fondness for him. This forced Gul'dan to found the Stormreavers in order to protect himself from any action &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt; might take against him. With the support of his clan, Gul'dan intends to find the lost &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of the Daemonlord Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. It is legend that this Tomb contains unimaginable power - power which Gul'dan means to possess.\"\nDomain: &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nWhen Doomhammer crushed the Shadow Council, Gul'dan was forced to pledge his service to the new Warchief of the Horde. This did nothing to ensure the warlock's safety, however, and the former leader of the Shadow Council drew power-hungry orcs to him to form his own clan simply to give him some measure of protection from the remainder of the Horde. These would-be warlocks harbored little loyalty for Gul'dan, but their desire for power led them to sacrifice their lives in his service. He trained a select few in dark magic, but most of the clan served as little more than fodder or bodies for his experiments. When the orcs lost at the Dark Portal, Gul'dan brought his clan to the Tomb of Sargeras, where they were slaughtered by the Tomb's guardians. There are rumors (true ones, in fact) that one or two warlocks survived, but the clan has no meaningful presence in the modern world. The Stormreaver Clan's color was blue.\nTwilight's Hammer clan was formed by Cho'gall, the leader of the ogre magi and loyal follower of Gul'dan. This gave the Twilight's Hammer a strong tie with the Stormreaver Clan, although their methods and goals proved much different. While the Stormreavers emulated the secretive ways of the old Shadow Council, the Twilight's Hammer proved to be a destructive juggernaut, nearly unstoppable in battle.\nIn Warlords of Draenor.\nThe official site for \"\" described the &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the Stormreaver clan, stating that \"\"The outcasts he leads, the Stormreaver clan, now fight to wrest their \"rightful place\" in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; from Gul'dan's former master ... and to tempt a great army of orcs into infernal corruption.\"\" However, as this contradicted the Stormreavers' previous origin of having been formed after the Horde's initial invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, early beta testing saw the Stormreavers replaced with generic forces and all references to the clan removed."}

He used to keep the order at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Precipice\"&gt;Broken Precipice&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. When &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt; came to power, he entered in an argument when Mar'gok pushed the legion aside for powerful &lt;a href=\"Felbreaker\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;. So, he sent Tormmok and his followers on an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; to find relics and the first ogre civilization, presumably making sure that they would never return. Before leaving on this quest, Tormmok wanted to take his favorite sword, but &lt;a href=\"Vizier%20Dar%27gud\"&gt;Vizier Dar'gud&lt;/a&gt; refused to let him take it and said, \"You won't need it where you are going.\" Soon after he and the &lt;a href=\"Destroyed%20Expedition\"&gt;Expedition&lt;/a&gt; left for &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey would be ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Botani\"&gt;Botani&lt;/a&gt; and Tormmok would be the last to die if he wasn't saved by an adventurer. Together, they defeated &lt;a href=\"Woodfist\"&gt;Woodfist&lt;/a&gt; and his troops. Not wanting to remain in the forest or return as a coward to the king, he joins the adventurer's garrison. After building a relationship of trust with his new commander, he asked his friend to return with him to Broken Precipice and reclaimed his sword from Dar'gud.\nHe can also be seen watching fights between &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;garrison commanders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nWant bodyguard?

During the course of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; storyline, Torok and his tribe reveal that they have allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and transform into the \"Feltotem\".\nTorok has a son named &lt;a href=\"Mellok%2C%20Son%20of%20Torok\"&gt;Mellok&lt;/a&gt;, who, like his father, eventually becomes a Feltotem.\nBiography.\nA Mountain Divided.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; called a meeting between the leaders of the tauren tribes \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;Ulan Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; and Torok Bloodtotem \u2014 as well as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;. As Ebonhorn began describing a vision that the spirits had given him, Dargrul interrupted him by asking if the tauren were planning on actually using their ancient artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. This caused Jale to ask if there was no end to the drogbar's rudeness, with Torok saying that there better be \"or there will be\".\nLike Jale, Lasan and Dargrul, Torok was shocked at Ebonhorn's revelation that according to the spirits, the power of the hammer would be wielded against the Legion by an outsider rather than a native of Highmountain. Torok simply stated that the spirits were wrong, and when Dargrul argued that the artifact's power belonged to Highmountain due to &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;'s usage of it after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Torok agreed with him. Nonetheless, the Bloodtotem chieftain reluctantly agreed to obey the spirits at High Chieftain Ulan's command. After Dargrul stole the hammer and used it to kill Ulan, Torok told Ulan's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt;, that the Bloodtotem tribe could not spare anyone to hunt him down. As Torok's territory would take the brunt of the fighting, he was forced to depart from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; along with Jale and Lasan.\nLegion.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Riverbend\"&gt;Riverbend&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed by Dargrul, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is sent by High Chieftain Mayla to parley with the Bloodtotem tribe along with the &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; emissary &lt;a href=\"Oakin%20Ironbull\"&gt;Oakin Ironbull&lt;/a&gt;. After killing several of the nearby &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; encroaching on the Bloodtotem village of &lt;a href=\"Cliff%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Cliff's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, Oakin and the adventurer are directed down to the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Blood%20Trial\"&gt;Cave of the Blood Trial&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Torok and perform a traditional Bloodtotem rite of passage. Oakin remarks that it is strange for Torok to be in the cave at this time, but nonetheless complies with the request. After the adventurer performs the first part of the rite by placing the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Wood\"&gt;harpy leader&lt;/a&gt; on an altar and besting a Bloodtotem warrior in combat, Torok sends the hero and the Rivermane emissary further down into the cavern. Upon arriving in the far end of the cave, however, a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic portal opens, and &lt;a href=\"Marakhan\"&gt;Marakhan&lt;/a&gt; emerges, killing Oakin while Torok laughs as his people become corrupted by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies and transform into the Feltotem tribe. &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;non-hostile drogbar tribe&lt;/a&gt; who was being held in the cave to be executed, aids the hero in defeating Marakhan before transporting both himself and the champion to a &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;hidden refuge&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nWhile the champion performs some tasks for Navarrogg in order to set back the Feltotem's efforts and help the drogbar regain his strength, Torok continuously mocks and threatens them. Finally, Navarrogg and the champion fight their way through &lt;a href=\"Torok%27s%20Bluff\"&gt;Torok's Bluff&lt;/a&gt; until they succeed in killing the Feltotem chieftain himself. Navarrogg briefly returns to his home of &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20Grotto\"&gt;Stonedark Grotto&lt;/a&gt; before traveling with his savior to Thunder Totem and declare his allegiance for the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Torok's stead."}

Recently, the &lt;a href=\"Stormcoil\"&gt;Stormcoil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; invaded Darkwood Shoal, killing many of the Tortaka and forcing the rest to flee to &lt;a href=\"Tortaka%20Refuge\"&gt;Tortaka Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, where the tortollans were trapped between the naga-controlled ocean in the east and the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;-controlled desert in the west with little in the way of food and supplies.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives, they help the Tortaka investigate the naga's motives and discover that the Stormcoil are searching for the &lt;a href=\"%3ARing%20of%20Tides\"&gt;:Ring of Tides&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that was lost during a battle between the naga and the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Eraka no Kimbul&lt;/a&gt; centuries prior. The Tortaka resolve that Kimbul may be their only hope against the naga, and the two tribe members &lt;a href=\"Teekcha\"&gt;Teekcha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tulu\"&gt;Tulu&lt;/a&gt; go ahead to Kimbul's &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kimbul\"&gt;ruined temple&lt;/a&gt; to investigate, but they find that the temple's entrance is sealed and that the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;temple grounds&lt;/a&gt; are overrun with huge &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe adventurer helps rescue several Tortaka tribesmen trapped in spider webs, clears out the spiders to make the temple a safe refuge for the tribe, and obtains the Ring of Tides, allowing them to enter the temple and deliver a Tortaka offering to Kimbul.

Thus, the adventurer proceeds to enter the spirit realm and slays Mepjila's spirit, freeing Kimbul's followers from their eternal torment. Shortly after, an an army of Stormcoil naga rise from the sea to attack Kimbul's temple. In response, the loa transforms the adventurer into his avatar to ravage the naga and force them back into the ocean.

He is the patron ancient to all creatures who move effortlessly between land and sea. According to &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, he is one of the oldest of the Ancients, having been alive since the time of the Titans. Due to that, he speaks in an old language that has been long forgotten, which proves incomprehensible (at least initially) to players.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nLike many of Azeroth's ancients, Tortolla took part in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; in order to defend his world. Initially, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; took little heed to him, as he was both non-threatening and sluggish. However, this proved a fatal mistake, as he was able to easily crush hundreds of his enemies with his sheer weight and powerful jaws. Not only that, but his stony skin and hardened shell proved impossible for even the most powerful of the Burning Legion to pierce. He was one the few, if not the only, ancient to not fall during the war, being able to cover the retreat of the mortal races so that they could ultimately regroup and seal the portal. According to Hamuul, after the war he was found underneath a mountain of demon corpses, and slowly asked if they had won once he had shaken them off.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough Tortolla apparently wasn't seriously injured, he needed time to recover from the war and chose to slumber in the healing silt of Hyjal. He did not awaken until &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt; itself roused him, and so when the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; came to capture him he was not ready, so the cultists were able to create the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian%23Dark%20Ancients\"&gt;dark ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Tortolla. After players free him and his unborn children, he is prepared to bring down his wrath and that of his children alongside the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nTortolla later assisted adventurers in closing a portal of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; in a burning &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; town in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nAn unnamed reptilian warrior ancient with a shell was mentioned in one scene of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sundering\"&gt;The Sundering&lt;/a&gt;\".

Some have left the isle to explore other areas, such as &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nTortollans first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", where they lived in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nA tortollan begins his or her life in great danger, as they must hurry from the beach to the safety of the sea just like turtle hatchlings. Tortollans can live for thousands of years, with a 2,372-year-old apparently still being considered young. There does not appear to be any physical difference between male and female tortollans, though their voices are distinctly masculine or feminine.\nThe tortollan race has roamed Azeroth's depths for millennia. While they are clearly an amphibious people, it is suggested that they can breathe underwater (though it is possible this is actually achieved through their scroll magic). In either case, traveling and surviving underwater as they do, they consider themselves to be \"one with the sea.\"\nIn the time of &lt;a href=\"Tezlekhan\"&gt;King Tezlekhan&lt;/a&gt;, great grandfather to the current &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari tried to get the tortollans to leave Zandalar. But because tortollans live longer than trolls do, they were able to get political dirt on the royal family and convince Tezlekhan to let them stay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"sea%20turtle\"&gt;sea turtle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ai%27twen\"&gt;Ai'twen&lt;/a&gt; once saved many tortollans from the \"great purge of the Inky Grotto.\"\nAlways in search of a good story, the tortollans make a regular pilgrimage to visit the turtle &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt; despite the omnipresent danger the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s pose in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt;s learned long ago to never underestimate tortollans, especially how their warriors use unconventional tactics when fighting their common enemy, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and are always eager to learn what the tortollans have come up with.\nCulture.\nThe ancient tortollans are constantly in pursuit of knowledge and the acquisition of rare artifacts, and they're always in need of brave souls to help them acquire what they seek. Aiding them can be risky, but ultimately it will be worth one's while to have these erudite people on one's side. Tortollans make extensive use of magic scrolls in their spellcasting, with their &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;s being &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Flight\"&gt;scrolls of flight&lt;/a&gt;.\nTortollans seem to be very integrated with the Zandalari culture, living in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; right alongside Zandalari trolls. One tortollan, &lt;a href=\"Jol%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Jol the Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, is even the one of King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted healers. However, tortollans tend to stay neutral in most matters. The Zandalari allow the tortollans free passage into their lands because of the useful information they provide the trolls.\nTortollans revere Torga and love to listen to his stories. The tortollans have spent hundreds of years gathering stories. The &lt;a href=\"Tortaka%20tribe\"&gt;Tortaka tribe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; have become followers of &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt; loa.\nThey love to drink the venom from &lt;a href=\"eel\"&gt;eel&lt;/a&gt;s, which gives them a burst of energy. They refer to this as \"eel juice\", but are aware that it is likely not safe for non-tortollans. The &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Blossom\"&gt;Centennial Blossom&lt;/a&gt;, a rare flower that blooms only once every hundred years, is highly prized by the long-lived races of Zuldazar like tortollans.\nTortollans love the stories of &lt;a href=\"Loh\"&gt;Loh&lt;/a&gt;, a young tortollan who traveled the world. When telling the stories, tortollans have their children navigate a turtle representing Loh through a maze.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Tottle\"&gt;Tottle&lt;/a&gt; is a part of the and of \"\".\nIn Hearthstone.\nTortollans are a mysterious race of primitive turtle people that dwell in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Their leader is a female named &lt;a href=\"Spiritsinger%20Umbra\"&gt;Spiritsinger Umbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"George%20Herbert%20Doyle%20IV\"&gt;Professor Doyle&lt;/a&gt; and his assistant &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Malone\"&gt;Eddie&lt;/a&gt; were separated from the rest of their expedition group, they wandered through Un'Goro for several days until they came to a marsh, where they were captured by &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;\"hideous lizard people\"&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, however, the two were rescued by a group of tortollans. Doyle was excited to meet an undiscovered tribe, while Eddie was simply happy to meet something that wasn't trying to eat them. At the campfire, Eddie asked Umbra for help finding the rest of the expedition, but she simply smiled and said, \"The greatest virtue is patience\". Eddie suspected that she was going to lead them to a hilltop village he spotted before they made camp.\nTwo days later, Doyle and Eddie were led to the village as expected and discovered that it was full of strange, primitive-looking &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Umbra handed the two explorers over to them, and the murlocs began drumming on driftwood totems to summon a lot more murlocs. Eddie thought to himself that he and the professor were safe for now, but he also started to wonder if it was a mistake to trust the tortollans.\nAfter spending a few days with the murlocs and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Megafin\"&gt;Megafin&lt;/a&gt;, and discovering that the entire village was built on the back of a , Umbra shouted something to Megafin and pointed in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Un'Goro, causing the entire village to begin moving in that direction. Once the explorers, tortollans and murlocs arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Golakka%20Hot%20Springs\"&gt;Golakka Hot Springs&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the volcano, Umbra took Doyle and Eddie aside and told them to climb the \"fire mountain\" to see \"the truth\". The explorers waved goodbye to their new friends and pitched a base camp at the base of the volcano, leaving them to decide whether to take the smoother but slower path, or the more jagged and faster one.\nAfter a series of adventures, the two explorers and their new companions \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Galvadon\"&gt;Galvadon&lt;/a&gt; and a group of wayward &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 eventually reunited with Umbra, who aided them in a battle against the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt;. The humans, tortollans, dinosaurs, and saurok then journeyed together to the &lt;a href=\"Waygate%20%28location%29\"&gt;Waygate&lt;/a&gt;, where they performed a great ritual with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Amara%2C%20Warden%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Amara, Warden of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Umbra kept looking at the sky and seemed anxious to get going. Suddenly a meteor appeared in the sky, but before long the Waygate flashed with blinding light and the meteor was gone. Everyone started going their separate ways, but before they left, Umbra and the tortollans solemnly thanked Doyle and Eddie and promised to help them get back to their expedition.\nCulture.\nTortollans tend not to be particularly clever. They are known to ride &lt;a href=\"stegodon\"&gt;stegodon&lt;/a&gt;s into battle and appear to revere or worship the turtle &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to eat omelettes made from &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; eggs as well as \"beetleberries\"."}

Often the more cunning and savvy members of the savage troll tribes, witch doctors are uncommon among other, more civilized races that instead rely on shamanistic aid in times of need.\nCreating curses and hexes is a specialty of the witch doctor.

'Hausen' and 'Howzen' are phonetically identical, and the German 'zur' is a name prefix very similar to the Dutch 'van'. Zur Hausens name prefix 'zur' is not a nobility particle in this case but a prefix referring to his ancestral origin, identical to the Dutch 'van', which is also not a nobility particle, unlike the German 'von'. Lastly, both 'Harald' and 'Gustav' (in a more typical variant) are very common Scandinavian names, whereas 'Harald' is the typical name of Norwegian kings while Gustav is the typical name of Swedish and Danish kings. \nZur Hausen was a highly distinguished physician and medical researcher long before he was awarded the Nobel prize.\nAnother possible reference, with a more obvious name similarity, is to the famous TV series physician 'Dr. House'. While both World of Warcraft and \"House, M.D.\" were initially released in the US in November 2004 (23. for World of Warcraft, 16. for the TV series), VanHowzen was likely already present during the beta of \"World of Warcraft\", clearly predating the TV series character.

{"id": "31190", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31190", "title": "Doctor Weavil", "text": "Doctor Weavil is a level 112 &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; undead &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; located on &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. He was previously a part of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest chain&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has several &lt;a href=\"Minion%20of%20Weavil\"&gt;Minions of Weavil&lt;/a&gt; scattered around his compound, all of which apparently are being mind-controlled by him. He is located at the top of the largest house in the compound.\nDoctor Weavil returned for &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Alcaz%20Isle\"&gt;Return to Alcaz Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a world event, now tuned for level 110 players.\nBackground.\nGates of Ahn'Qiraj.\nWeavil was an old acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Narain%20Soothfancy\"&gt;Narain Soothfancy&lt;/a&gt;, both of them formerly being students at the \"Gnomeregan Institute of Tinkering\". Apparently, Narain caused Weavil to fail out of school by destroying the curves on Weavil's exams. For this, Weavil has a grudge against him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;opening of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the player was asked to recover the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;Blue Scepter Shard&lt;/a&gt; in order to reforge &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; to open the gates of Ahn'Qiraj. The adventurer was sent by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; in Azshara who was supposed to hold the shard. Azuregos had however hidden the shard away on a \"&lt;a href=\"Maws\"&gt;very special minnow&lt;/a&gt;\", but explained that the player has to make an &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Buoy\"&gt;Arcanite Buoy&lt;/a&gt; in order to catch it. Azuregos supplied the player with his &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Ledger\"&gt;Magical Ledger&lt;/a&gt; which described how to make the buoy, and sent the player to Narain (an old acquaintance of him as well) to \"make sense of it all\". Unfortunately, the book was written in &lt;a href=\"draconic\"&gt;draconic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to read it, Narain required his own book, which was hidden away on &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; where Narain crashed his &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;. Weavil somehow discovered and stole the book, demanding a sum of money as ransom. Unknowing that Weavil is the thief, Narain sent the player to &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; (where the money was to be handed over) to trick and defeat the \"booknappers\". When Weavil showed up, he went into a rage after discovering the setup and ordered to kill the player before Weavil made his escape in his flying machine. Tearing the book apart, he dropped it's pages all over Azeroth. He eventually returned to Alcaz Island, which Narain used his soothsaying abilities to discover.\nThe adventurer engaged Weavil there, killing him, and acquired one of the pages along with Weavil's diary which conveniently listed the location of the other pages.\nReturn to Alcaz Isle.\nWhen he died, the second that Dr. Weavil's heart stopped, his ultimate plan was put into motion. After adventurers looted his body, a viscous, yellow fluid slowly filled his veins, and jumper cables were implanted to shock him back to... life. Was this undeath? Alchemical engineering? No one is quite sure, but it left him sallow-skinned and over four times as evil as before.\nWhat's worse, he started an internship program.\nGetting there.\n&lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; is found northeast of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Players that have completed the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt; scenario should find and speak with &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; at on the road that exits Theramore Isle to the west to change phases of the zone to the pre-destruction phase.\nAlcaz is well-protected by anti-air turrets and will blast unwary players out of the sky. The only access to the island is near the dock on the west side of the isle, where the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt; can also be found. The &lt;a href=\"Hardened%20Defense%20Turret\"&gt;Hardened Defense Turret&lt;/a&gt;s lining the path to the interior pack a punch, so move carefully or bring healers! Additionally, there are a lot of &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20Mine\"&gt;Proximity Mine&lt;/a&gt;s hidden in the ground that deal \"massive\" damage.\nConsider corpse-hopping along the path, taking the right (eastern) fork in the road at to reach Weavil's main camp.\nAt Weavil's camp, look for the two-story house on the northeast side. Weavil is found on the top floor of the house, protected by his drudges and the &lt;a href=\"Model%20GU-4RD-3R\"&gt;Model GU-4RD-3R&lt;/a&gt; guard dog. He respawns every 7-10 minutes and can be looted indefinitely.\nStrategy.\nWeavil no longer has his mind-control ability, so he can be safely soloed. Try to interrupt the Mind Shatter, as it is unlikely players will get to 10 stacks of Drudge Sludge from the Drudge Bolt Volley.\nLevel 60 information.\nAt level 60, he required 10 people or less to defeat. At level 70, he could be defeated with only a Hunter/Warlock and a Healer. Pet tanks Weavil at a corner, allowing the Healer to stand outside LoS and heal the pet. Hunter/Warlock stands in LoS and DPS. He was soloable by some classes (if not all) at level 80, and is likely soloable by all at level 85.\nStrategy.\nThe line of sight aspect of this fight is similar to &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Razuvious\"&gt;Instructor Razuvious&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt level 80, this fight is easy. He can be killed by two &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; in heroic level gear, one of which is a paladin. The paladin pulls and the second damage dealer attacks to get on the Doctors aggro list. Once the paladin is mind controlled, he bubbles out of it and then you have either 1 minute and 45 seconds or 2 minutes (depending on if the second mind control occurs 2 minutes after the pull or two minutes after the first mind control) to dps him down before the second mind control occurs. The second damage dealer can be a shaman for &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated that roughly 2k dps is needed by each in order to avoid the second mind control. When in doubt, bring a second paladin to taunt at the marker for the second mind control and bubble out of it as well.\nNote that he cannot be soloed by any class without a combat pet, and the only classes able to get away from an endless loop of mind control are: Hunter, Warlock, Paladin, and Mage, as Weavil will reset and return to full health when all opponents are dead or mind controlled. (See Tips for methods to escape).\nAn exception to this is for the Paladin to attack him, then bubble when he casts mind control, and dps him down before the next mind control. He has been successfully soloed in this way by a well-geared Paladin.\nWarlocks and Hunters can solo, using judicial use of threat management and pet tanking.\nHis respawn timer is relatively short, so if someone loots your quest item, just hang around a few minutes and kill him again.\nTrivia.\nThis is a reference to Dr. Evil, Austin Powers' Arch Nemesis in the Austin Powers Movies. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "16907", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16907", "title": "Dodge", "text": "Dodge is a form of &lt;a href=\"melee%20mitigation\"&gt;melee mitigation&lt;/a&gt; where the entire &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"swing\"&gt;swing&lt;/a&gt; is avoided. Dodge is a &lt;a href=\"passive%20ability\"&gt;passive ability&lt;/a&gt; possessed by all players for all classes and races. However this stat is the most important to players fulfilling a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing role. Only close range melee attacks can be dodged; a ranged attack or a spell cannot be dodged. Players can only dodge attacks if they are facing their opponent, however a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; can dodge attacks that are from behind. Incapacitated targets (&lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;ned for example) cannot dodge. \nThere are several ways that dodge is modified. You can increase you chance \"to dodge\" by increasing your &lt;a href=\"dodge%20rating\"&gt;dodge rating&lt;/a&gt; which will all increase your effective chance to dodge or dodge percent(%). Your chance to dodge a hit as well as have your hits be dodged is affected by the level of your opponent. Different classes and talent &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;ializations will also vary the amount of dodge a player has. \nFormulas.\n Death Knights, Paladins, and Warriors no longer receive additional dodge from agility. Instead, base dodge is fixed at 5% for these classes.\nThe amount of dodge you have is affected by your &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dodge%20rating\"&gt;dodge rating&lt;/a&gt;.\nDodge generally goes into two pools that are added together: undiminished and diminished dodge. Your undiminished dodge includes your class's base dodge and the dodge your receive from your base agility. \nformula_1\nDodge from agility.\nAgility generates chance to dodge (dodge %). For level 80s, you can simply use the \"Rd\" value from the table above to find the rate. Note that the base agility (agility from your level and race) plus any agility from talents is undiminished. Agility from your gear and buffs will fall into the pool of diminished dodge. From the game interface, you can easily see what these two numbers are. Mouse over agility in the character window and the white number is your undiminished agility (this will include your talents) and the green number, if there is one, is the additional agility which will contribute dodge with diminishing returns. \nformula_6\nformula_7\nDodge rating.\nformula_8\nDodge rating is the final source of dodge chance, and all of this chance goes into the diminishing returns pool (\"u\"). It converts at a rate of 45.25 (\"Rd\") for level 80s of all classes. \nDiminishing returns.\nformula_9\nThe final step to solving \"d\" from the original equation is diminishing returns. Now we can total the pool that came from two sources of dodge impacted by diminishing returns: agility from gear and dodge rating. \nformula_10\n\"Cd\" is the cap for dodge, and \"k\" is a constant, and these both vary per class.\nAbilities.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; abilities that modify dodge or are related to dodging. Abilities that are learned through talents are listed in the talents section &lt;a href=\"Dodge%23Talents\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchants.\nThis is a listing of high-level enchantments that provide dodge. For a complete list of all enchantments, see the &lt;a href=\"enchantments%20by%20slot\"&gt;enchantments by slot&lt;/a&gt; article.\nNotes.\nGreg \"Ghostcrawler\" Street, the Lead System Designer, posted about the upcoming changes in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; on the official forums. It was in response to some carefully researched numbers showing how overall avoidance was being lowered, and disproportionately to various tank classes:"}

She was a Watcher of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; who, after the events with the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; as the new Commander of the Watch. Sarah is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Ladimore\"&gt;Morgan Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; and the only survivor of her &lt;a href=\"Ladimore\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIn her youth, Sarah lived with her &lt;a href=\"Ladimore\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; in a house in Brightwood. She is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Lys%20Ladimore\"&gt;Lys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Ladimore\"&gt;Morgan Ladimore&lt;/a&gt;, a great and noble knight who fought in defense of the innocent, the poor, and the afflicted. However, when her father returned to his homeland after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it was only to find the dark forests of Duskwood, and his ruined home with no trace of his family. During his search, a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; claimed that all his family was dead and buried at &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, and when he discovered the graves, he ended his life after killing innocent people in his madness. However, he was unable to rest in peace for his crimes, and eventually returned as &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Ladim\"&gt;Mor'Ladim&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful undead who began killing many innocent people in Duskwood.\nWhile Morgan believed that his family was all dead, Sarah had actually survived and later joined the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;, troubled for a long time by the circumstances surrounding her father's death.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Ladim\"&gt;Mor'Ladim&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, she ended up confessing the truth about the relationship between Sarah and the undead, and sent them to tell her that he was finally destroyed after years of terror. Upon hearing the news, Sarah regretted that she wasn't able to do anything to help, then asked the adventurers to bring her ring to her father's grave, so that he could know that she was fine and that no one held him responsible for what happened. This act of love allowed Morgan to finally find peace in death alongside his wife, now ready to find forgiveness for his sins in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; after he learned that his daughter was still alive.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, after it was used to defeat &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Sarah placed the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt; right in front of the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;'s old house, in order to dispel the dark enchantments and to keep the undead docile in the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. It then became her responsibility to check the holy torch on regular basis and to report if there was any problem.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; after being promised freedom and respect by &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;. Ladimore was among those who did not, and mentioned that the defection of her comrades was certainly due to dark magic. When the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the town, Ladimore was seen protecting several inhabitants with the help of &lt;a href=\"Avette%20Fellwood\"&gt;Avette Fellwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nAt some point, Sarah succeeded &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; as the new Commander of the Night Watch.\nDuring their &lt;a href=\"Terror%20by%20Torchlight\"&gt;treasure hunt&lt;/a&gt; in Duskwood, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; found Sarah mortally wounded and struck with a rotting disease after she confronted &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;the Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who stole the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Forlorn Rowe&lt;/a&gt;. She was saved by Flynn with a healing potion, before being brought back to Darkshire to be taken care of by her men.\nAfter the Necromancer was defeated and the Torch of Holy Flame had been recovered and purified, she came to meet Shaw and Flynn at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Raven%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Raven Tavern&lt;/a&gt; and thank them for saving Duskwood from the undead, to which the Spymaster replied that it was mostly thanks to the Night Watch, and that he would send Stormwind guards as reinforcements after the necromancer hinted that the threat was not over. In return, she responded to Shaw's request, and sent watchers to retrieve the treasure for which they had come.\nQuotes.\nHow could they believe the Herald's lies? There's dark magic at play here - mark my words.\nPlease, if you can do anything to stop this, do it now. So many innocent lives lost..."}

He was once the champion of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, chosen to defend the worlds the titans had ordered. However, while he once served as a guardian and protector, he later set out to destroy all &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s and life in the universe, and undo what the titans had strived for ages to achieve.\nHis actions and their effects essentially made him one of the main antagonists \u2014 or as &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; called him, \"the big, mega bad guy\" \u2014 of the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise, and he served as the main antagonist of \"\".\nBiography.\nChampion of the Pantheon.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, Sargeras was born from a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; maturing within a planet in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. He was the mightiest warrior of the titan &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and originally possessed the title \"The Defender\" and was the \"noblest of all\". Like the rest of his kind, he was altruistic and just, unable to conceive of pure evil. When the chaotic &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, spawn of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, began to threaten the Pantheon's work of bringing order to worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras was sent to &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20demons\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; them. Sargeras continued defeating the disorganized and incompetent demons with ease, but he also soon discovered that some demons had begun wielding the dark energies of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. The Defender also suspected the existence of malevolent beings far more powerful than mere demons who sought to influence the physical universe hidden behind the veil of the Void. The presence of these beings troubled Sargeras, but he nonetheless continued his work.\nTo his dismay, Sargeras soon discovered that the demons he had defeated simply returned to the Twisting Nether to be reborn in new bodies and continue to torment the worlds of the Great Dark. The Pantheon grew concerned about this development and the increase of demonic activity, and so sent the inexperienced titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to aid Sargeras in battle. Aggramar proved a quick study and soon earned Sargeras' admiration, and became the warrior's trusted lieutenant. The two fought shoulder to shoulder against the endless demons of the Nether. This allowed Sargeras to more closely study the nature of the Nether, and by learning how to manipulate the chaotic realm's magical energies, he created a prison world known as &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; to contain the demons he had defeated (though in Mardum, the demons were not idle; a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, ruled the pocket dimension with an iron fist, plotting his vengeance). Demonic invasions became increasingly rare, and together, the two titans soon brought peace to the cosmos.\nAt some point, Sargeras had started using the enslaved demonic &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; as hounds to police the use of arcane magics. &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Sacrificial magic&lt;/a&gt; was considered the greatest violation of life and the doomguard had been attuned to instantly punish those who delved into such sorcery.\nBetrayal.\nSargeras and Aggramar eventually agreed to go their own separate ways in order to protect several parts of the universe at the same time, allowing them to more effectively combat the demons. It was during this time that Sargeras learned about the Void Lords and discovered their plans. Coming across a world that had been completely infected by monstrous aberrations known as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the titan ruthlessly interrogated a conclave of nathrezim demons who dwelled on the black world. From them, Sargeras learned that the void lords had sent the Old Gods out into the cosmos to infect any worlds that housed titan &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, and if they succeeded, the world-soul would be twisted into an unspeakably dark creature that not even the Pantheon could stand against: a Dark Titan. Enraged at this discovery, Sargeras cleaved the planet in two, instantly killing the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20world-soul\"&gt;nascent titan&lt;/a&gt; it housed. He then immediately returned to the rest of the Pantheon to tell of his discovery, but they chastised him for his rash action, insisting that they might have been able to purge the world-soul of its corruption without killing it. Sargeras tried to convince the other titans that what he had done was right, and that the universe needed to be purged of life - which, in his mind, could have been already corrupted by the void lords - in order to prevent the risk of a world-soul becoming corrupted and opening the way for the void lords (in his mind, even a lifeless universe was better than one dominated by the Void, for he argued that if life had once taken root in the Great Dark on its own, perhaps it would do so again). Eventually realizing that the others would never see things the way he did, Sargeras stormed off, and never returned.\nBirth of the Legion.\nWhile the titans continued their work, Sargeras meditated on the fate of the cosmos in isolation. Fear, doubt, and despair overwhelmed him, and he eventually came to the conclusion that the only way to spare the fundamentally flawed universe from the void lords was to purge it all of life. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen titan knew that he would need an army to accomplish this, and so he traveled to his prison world Mardum, which had become bloated and twisted with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies over the eons. Sargeras instantly shattered the prison world, unleashing its countless demonic inhabitants onto the cosmos and creating an explosion of fel energies so powerful that it warped his form into a horrific being of blistering hatred. In the process of destroying the prison world, the fallen titan had also ripped open a wound in the boundaries between the Nether and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;, creating a great burning maw of emerald fire that would remain an eternal reminder of the titan's betrayal for all time.\nSargeras then imbued the ravenous demon hordes before him with his power, granting them increased size or intelligence, before offering them a simple choice: join his cause or be destroyed. While most of the demons accepted, a minority refused, instead rallying around the Dreadlord Ulthalesh. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a great felsteel scythe from the fires of Mardum's destruction, using it to harvest the souls of the rebellious demons and trapping them in a new prison. Ulthalesh, strongest in will, was the last to be devoured. Sargeras named the scythe, later known as &lt;a href=\"%3AUlthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;:Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, after the nathrezim who had opposed him, and would over the ages bestow the weapon to nathrezim, &lt;a href=\"doomlord\"&gt;doomlord&lt;/a&gt;s and even &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s, only to see their spirits be devoured by the scythe as they fell.\nWith the rebellious demons annihilated, Sargeras had his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; formed. The army fell upon its first world, extinguishing several mortal civilizations and sentient species. Sargeras himself annihilated the &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; who had been assigned to watch over the planet. Aggramar, Sargeras' former student, was the first to learn of the constellar's death and arrived to confront his former master. He demanded an explanation from Sargeras, but when he realized that his words would not sway him, Aggramar challenged the fallen titan to single combat. The battle between the two raged until, in an explosion of fel and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power, both of the combatants' blades shattered. Heavily wounded, Aggramar retreated and informed the Pantheon of Sargeras' betrayal.\nNihilam.\nThe Pantheon and the Legion, both girded for war, confronted one another near a planet called &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather of the Pantheon, pleaded with Sargeras to abandon his mad cause, telling him of a distant world-soul called &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; who would one day be powerful enough to challenge the void lords. Sargeras listened closely but was unmoved. Despite their earlier battle, Aggramar then made one last attempt to reason with Sargeras. He approached his former tutor, unarmed, trying to persuade him by recounting tales of the glorious battles the two had fought. But Sargeras was set in his ways. With a howl of fury and sorrow, the former champion raised his blade and struck Aggramar down, cleaving him in two. Outraged by this murder, the Pantheon launched an all-out assault on Sargeras, but, unable to stand against the fallen titan's Fel might, soon perished as well. The fallen titan proclaimed his army victorious and set out to continue the Burning Crusade and discover the location of Azeroth for, to him, Azeroth was not the savior of the universe but the opposite, if corrupted. Unbeknownst to Sargeras, however, the titan &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; had managed to weave a final spell which managed to temporarily save the Pantheon's souls from the destruction of their bodies, sending their spirits hurtling out through the cosmos.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThough Sargeras had succeeded in destroying the Pantheon, much of the Legion had been needlessly killed in the battle on Nihilam. Most demons, though bloodthirsty, lacked strategic thinking, and the fallen titan could not direct his entire army at once. On the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras found the cunning and tactically minded agents he sought \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, a race of highly intelligent beings with a natural affinity for magic in all its myriad forms. In the form of a radiant and elegant being, Sargeras appeared to the eredar's three greatest leaders, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, and made his offer: untold power, prestige, and the opportunity to transform primitive worlds into peaceful sanctuaries in exchange for their allegiance. Though Velen had doubts, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde readily agreed. Guided by a vision from the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; Velen and his followers fled, becoming the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. The remainder of the eredar people were transformed into hideous demons, Sargeras' fel whisperings surging through the minds of Argus' every inhabitant and drowning out their ability to reason.\nSargeras tasked Kil'jaeden the Deceiver to seek out the darkest races in the universe and recruit them into the Legion's ranks. Meanwhile, Archimonde the Defiler would lead Sargeras' vast armies into battle against any who might resist the titan's will. Now that his armies were amassed and ready to follow his every command, he launched his raging forces into the vastness of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt;. To this date, it is still unclear how many worlds his Burning Legion has consumed and burned on their unholy &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; across the universe.\nAt some point after the formation of the Legion, Sargeras entrusted an &lt;a href=\"aranasi\"&gt;aranasi&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Queen%20Tyranna\"&gt;Brood Queen Tyranna&lt;/a&gt; with an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; and assigned her as ruler of the now-shattered realm of Mardum. Moreover, Sargeras offered the mighty &lt;a href=\"aldrachi\"&gt;aldrachi&lt;/a&gt; people a place in his Burning Legion. But the aldrachi proved incorruptible: they slew innumerable demons before their race was wiped out. Sargeras, using an Avatar, personally killed their greatest champion and seized his weapons - the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt; which eventually ended up with Kil'jaeden and his loyal demon hunter.\nSargeras also had a personal hound named &lt;a href=\"Goremaw%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Goremaw the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, the Legion conquered a new world, corrupting its leaders and killing their heroes. However, a child, burning with righteous fury for his dying world, crept into the Legion's stronghold and killed several eredar guards--and Goremaw--while they rested. When Sargeras saw his slain hound, he was consumed with rage. That world, and all who lived upon it, was scattered as ashes in the Great Dark. \nThe dreadlord, &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, believed that Goremaw could still serve the Legion. He extracted the felhound's fangs and took them to a great demon forge on the eredar homeworld of Argus and eventually created two of the deadliest weapons the universe had ever known, the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. These daggers could twist the air and bend light, allowing their wielders to conceal themselves effortlessly. He presented the daggers to Sargeras, who was greatly pleased. It took time for Sargeras to find someone worthy of wielding the Fangs of the Devourer. Loyalty was a concern. Skilled &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s are deceptive by nature, all too capable of betrayal. Sargeras would not abide the thought of Goremaw's legacy falling into the hands of the Legion's enemies. Finally, Sargeras found someone suitable to carry these daggers into battle. An eredar &lt;a href=\"tracker\"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari&lt;/a&gt; had distinguished herself in several Legion invasions, silently murdering those who suspected that the demons' promises were laced with doom. She was summoned to Argus and told of the great honor being offered to her. Sargeras promised Akaari that she would become a fearsome instrument of death, one of the deadliest creatures alive in any known realm, but at a cost of her will. If she wanted to be this living weapon, betrayal would become impossible. It was a grim bargain, but Akaari accepted it.\nSargeras had his eyes on a small, militaristic world. Its inhabitants would have fought hard against a Legion invasion. Though they would have fallen eventually to direct force, Sargeras believed they might be vulnerable to fear and paranoia. This world was Akaari's first mission with her newly granted powers. She infiltrated its strongholds alone and was successful. Thus, Akaari became Sargeras' asset, loyal and unquestioning. But even though her will was gone, her guile remained. She requested that Sargeras allow her to roam the Twisting Nether for a time. He agreed, curious to see how she would further the goals of the Burning Legion.\nShe returned to Sargeras with new skills and a new philosophy: fear was a double-edged sword, useful, but not always the right choice. An unseen assassin inspired terror, yes, but an unknown assassin inspired complacency. An enemy could not prepare to face a danger that seemingly did not exist.\nThe first invasion of Azeroth.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, 10,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her people, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, were wielding magic as their plaything. Sensing the great magical power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras finally discovered the location of Azeroth. In order to invade the planet, he called Azshara. The Highborne queen was impressed and overwhelmed by Sargeras' great power. He used a subtle form of mental manipulation while speaking to her and her counselor, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. They saw Sargeras as a god and worshiped him. Azshara agreed to grant him entrance to her world if only for a taste of a portion of his knowledge and energy. (Furthermore, she thought he would marry her.) Thus, the first invasion of Azeroth began.\nArchimonde and the great &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; stormed through &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, ripping the world to shreds and sucking every ounce of energy from it that they could. Sargeras waited in the Twisting Nether for Azshara to strengthen the portal enough to allow him entrance, and during that time, he accomplished many things.\nAmong them, he transformed Xavius into the first &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; and gifted &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; with his dark magic, burning out the eyes of the night elf and covering both of his shoulders with arcane tattoos. Then, he gave the scythe &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt; and commanded her to reap the souls of Azeroth's rebellious denizens, starting with the area that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut, at the crucial moment for his entering on Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, aided by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' woodfolk and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, mustered their forces and rebelled against the Highborne in a climactic battle that destroyed the Well of Eternity and crushed much of the continent to rubble. The defenders of Azeroth paid a great cost to throw the demons back into the Twisting Nether, but in the end, Sargeras' mission had failed for the very first time. Because the portal rift into the Twisting Nether vanished in such a great display of magical power, the forces holding the worlds together ruptured, causing the Well of Eternity to implode. A massive part of Kalimdor sank beneath the ocean, and where the Well of Eternity had been before there was only a gigantic oceanic vortex, later named the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the novel \"&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20Trilogy\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brox\"&gt;Brox&lt;/a&gt; are thrown back in time and are able to help the demi-god Cenarius and the dragon Aspects fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, in this new timeline, Sargeras' first invasion of Azeroth failed. During the end of the war, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; leaped through the portal and using the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Axe of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; crafted by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; killed many demons before catching the attention of Sargeras himself. In a last desperate attempt to buy time for his allies, Broxigar personally attacked the huge titan with the Axe of Cenarius, wounding him in his leg - an extraordinary feat for anyone as he was said to be invincible. Sargeras then killed Broxigar, however, the scratch was pivotal. When Sargeras approached the gateway, Krasus poured the combined power of his companions at the tiny wound and momentarily distracted Sargeras from the portal. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; used this opening to assail the portal and destabilize it. Refusing to believe his defeat, Sargeras stepped within the collapsing portal in a futile attempt to rebuild it. It imploded, casting him in to the Nether.\nAfter the Well of Eternity.\nAfter his defeat at the Well of Eternity, Sargeras immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn't rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the Highborne's laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth's defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning.\nThus he commanded the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn't enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion's invasion or carry out subtler schemes. Such an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits.\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. Thus was forged the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras also had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth's slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. Since then, the eye of Azeroth's world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; wings, a testament to Sargeras' conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\nSargeras and Sataiel.\nIn the millennia after the collapse of the Well of Eternity, &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt;, who was still on Azeroth, grew into an over-ambitious, strong-willed, and supremely confident. She had come to Azeroth to prove herself to Sargeras, but when she saw the heights of power she could reach with &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt;, she wondered whether she'd set her sights too low. She had massacred thousands, turned the &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; into a tomb, and ripped open a magical nexus of unspeakable force. Her destiny was bright, and she needed no one's patronage to achieve it. The dreadlord Ulthalesh whispered to Sataiel from the scythe, infecting her mind. She decided to keep the magical nexus for herself, and she cast potent wards to hide it from the outside world. Then she cut off all contact with the Legion, biding her time until she and Ulthalesh had the strength to challenge the Dark Titan.\nWhen Sargeras discovered her deception, he was furious. The fount of power was his by right, and Sataiel was keeping it from him. Not only that, but his spies on Azeroth informed him that she was harboring delusions of grandeur, conspiring with the spirit of Ulthalesh to slay Sargeras. Such arrogance could not go unpunished. The upstart eredar had to be eliminated. Sargeras found his champion in &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. He sent the Guardian visions of a dangerous entity lurking in Deadwind Pass, a demon awaiting the return of the Burning Legion. Scavell boldly took up the charge, hunting down Sataiel and, after an epic battle, slaying her with her own weapon. Her soul was cast screaming into the scythe.\nAegwynn and Medivh.\nSome nine thousand years after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, another Guardian of Tirisfal, Magna Aegwynn, kept a constant vigil over Azeroth, destroying demons wherever she found them. Sargeras saw that Aegwynn was a serious threat, but he also saw how she could be manipulated. The Dark Titan sent demonic agents on a great dragonhunt. The demons killed several dragons, but Aegwynn inevitably appeared to aid the great beasts. It was then that Sargeras used the Scepter of Sargeras to send his own &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; to battle the Guardian. Though Aegwynn emerged victorious with the help of the dragons, defeat had been Sargeras' plan all along; his spirit entered her body, lying in wait for centuries.\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras' avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. Sargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras' whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; informed Aegwynn that her time as a Guardian was up and asked her to proceed to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to choose her successor. Aegwynn disobeyed the Order's command, deciding that only one of her own lineage would suffice. Sargeras, within Aegwynn, was slowly twisting her thoughts. She became more distant from the Council; rarely being seen by them. Sargeras amplified fears she already had about the Council. The Council had been using its powers to manipulate the politics of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. They believed they had the power to prevent war suffering, for the greater good. Aegwynn believed that their constant manipulations would end in disaster. She decided to not relinquish her role as Guardian, for fear that the Council could elect a new weaker Guardian they could control and manipulate. Aegwynn would eventually fall in love with &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed with her opinions on the council, and the two fathered &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to pass the Guardian powers on to. Unbeknownst to either of them, Sargeras began to corrupt Medivh from within Aegwynn. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved Jeweled Scepter.\nWhen Medivh reached fourteen, his powers as a Guardian manifested themselves throwing him into a coma that lasted for ten years. Medivh awoke a decade later under a facade of control, and assured the clerics and the court that he was fine. In time Sargeras would influence Medivh by guiding his thoughts and emotions towards an insidious end. Eventually, Medivh would become determined to stop the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at all costs and under Sargeras' influence would discover &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that the Horde had been abandoned by the Legion Medivh felt that it would be perfect irony to use the orcs against their (seemingly) former demonic masters. Thus bargaining with the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; from his chambers in the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh promised to furnish Gul'dan with the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; if Gul'dan would bring the Horde to Azeroth. And so, aided on the other side by Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh went to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; in the remote, southern parts of the continent and opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; between Azeroth and Draenor, allowing the orcs permanent access to the planet and signaling the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Age of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dark Portal was opened by him, almost every creature attuned to magic on Azeroth felt ripples as the gateway flared to life. Aegwynn could not fathom what had happened, but she sensed the presence of fel magic and knew Medivh must have somehow allied himself with the Legion. Aegwynn traveled to Karazhan with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; to confront her son about it. The tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. It was then that Medivh revealed that, as he fell in battle before her, Sargeras had spirited his essence into Aegwynn's own body like a cancer, lying in wait for her to conceive an heir as he knew she would. Sargeras later stitched himself into the fabric of Medivh's unborn body so that when he awoke and realized the power of Tirisfal he would also manifest his unholy, demonic heritage.\nAegwynn was stunned as the truth set in, but she did not lose herself to despair. Instead, Aegwynn became angry and knew she would defeat Sargeras there and then, even if it meant striking against her beloved son. The battle between the two shook the tower to its foundations and sent the would-be revelers fleeing. When Aegwynn was temporarily incapacitated, Arcanagos joined in. However, despite being a blue dragon, Arcanagos was severely outmatched. Sargeras struck him down, burning him from the inside out until all that was left was bone. Her friend's death sent Aegwynn further into her rage. Sargeras may have had the full weight of a Guardian's power, but she had centuries of experience. As their duel continued, Medivh slowly gained the upper hand. His original personality then surfaced back and, unable to kill his mother, Medivh instead banished her from his sight.\nIt was shortly after this time that the mages of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; sent Medivh an apprentice. This young apprentice was known as &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who in time would discover that it was Medivh who has brought the orcs upon the lands of Azeroth. During this time, Khadgar and &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; had an audience with &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, where Lothar was convinced of Medivh's corruption. Lothar, one of Medivh's best friends, led a troop of human forces, which included Khadgar and Garona, to deal with the crazed Guardian. During the battle with Medivh, Khadgar\u2014magically aged by Medivh's spellwork\u2014held Lothar's blade to the Guardian's chest, and finally ran it through Medivh's heart. The demon within him awakened at that point, right up until Lothar delivered the mercy stroke, decapitating the Guardian and banishing Sargeras into the Nether. At the same time, Gul'dan was trying to probe Medivh's mind for the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The warlock was still deep within the Guardian's thoughts when Lothar and Khadgar killed him, ending Medivh's treachery and forcing Gul'dan into a coma.\nSargeras desired vengeance against the mortals of Azeroth and expected the orcs to travel through the portal and destroy them. Although the orcs did enter the portal, and eventually caused a great amount of damage to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras ultimately failed in his plans because of Medivh's early death. Eventually, Sargeras wanted to shed the body of Medivh and once again enter his avatar, but he didn't have enough time to do so. Although he tried to control Garona and cursed Khadgar, the apprentice stabbed the Guardian into the chest, forcing the spirit of Sargeras out of his body, and banishing him into the depths of the Twisting Nether.\nGul'dan's encounter with Sargeras.\nThe orcish warlock Gul'dan believed the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to hold amazing power since he had been told as much by both Medivh and the eredar demon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan attempted to claim the tomb for himself, but when he gained access to the grave, Sargeras' avatar was not there. Instead, Gul'dan found a plethora of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that had been driven mad by their long imprisonment. The demons proceeded to attack Gul'dan but he survived the first ambush. Then &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; saw Sargeras (or at least an illusion of him) laughing at him and understood that he had been a pawn, a fool. Now that he knew he would not get the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and would instead die in the tomb, he wrote his story in runes with his own blood. Shortly afterward, the demons sent by Sargeras came for him and killed him, eventually using his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; as a focal point of demonic power.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nSargeras appeared as a distant voice during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; that he was a failure.\nLegion.\nMany years later, the Burning Legion launched their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s that approached the Tomb of Sargeras during the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; were instantly killed by the \"Gaze of Sargeras\", a spell followed by the message: .\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s only hope to defeat the Legion is to find the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, mighty artifacts created by the titans of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; themselves, to close the portal inside the Tomb of Sargeras. Aware that the people of Azeroth are seeking the Pillars of Creation, Sargeras personally sent &lt;a href=\"Thar%27zul\"&gt;Thar'zul&lt;/a&gt; to lead an army of demons to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to stop them from learning more about the Pillars' locations.\nThough he does not appear in person, Sargeras' voice is heard in a flashback to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; when he burned out the eyes of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and revealed to him in a vision the true might of his infinite army.\nThe Legion's full, terrifying might is fixed on summoning Sargeras to Azeroth, and they have already located the key to his return, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s body. Gul'dan seeks to use Illidan's body as a vessel for Sargeras' entry into Azeroth, and so &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; seek out Illidan's soul to return it to his body before Sargeras can possess him. Class orders and a coalition of all elf factions led by Tyrande Whisperwind, Vereesa Windrunner and Lady Liadrin gathered together to back the Nightfallen Rebellion up and take the Nightwell, the Eye of Aman'thul and Illidan's body back from Gul'dan, before he manages to put a portion of Sargeras' soul into the latter.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; attempts to return Illidan's soul to his dormant body. But unbeknownst to Khadgar, Sargeras has already filled Illidan's empty shell, and doing so awakens him. The adventurers then battle &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan is eventually freed of Sargeras' control, allowing him to kill .\nLegionfall.\nAs Kil'jaeden observed Khadgar, Velen, and other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; champions gathered together from his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, he spoke to Sargeras about how everything the Legion had done under Sargeras' design had only given them failure to show for it. Sargeras asked Kil'jaeden if he had lost sight of his destiny and wondered if he had overestimated Kil'jaeden's resolve. An irritated Kil'jaeden claimed that he paid for his destiny with his world and that the time had come to see it done.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Communion\"&gt;Hall of Communion&lt;/a&gt; deep beneath &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; warned her Speaker, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, that Sargeras' coming was imminent.\nShadows of Argus.\nWhen Magni traveled to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; with the forces of Azeroth, he received via &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus' world-soul&lt;/a&gt; a vision of &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, revived and brainwashed by Sargeras. Sargeras told Aggramar that the circle neared completion and the mortals must not stop the rebirth of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, then ordered Aggramar to stop their incursion.\nLater, Sargeras spoke to Aggramar as the latter watched the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; torture the souls of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Golganneth\"&gt;Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Though they refused to be broken, Aggramar assured Sargeras that they would be soon. Sargeras told Aggramar that the essence of &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; was still needed to ensure victory, and Aggramar promised that she would not escape.\nThrough the Antorus raid, one can see Azeroth being more and more covered in a fiery storm, which turns out to be the Dark Titan, seeking to claim his prize. Sargeras ordered &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; to rise in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of Argus the Unmaker, Sargeras was ultimately imprisoned by his kin at the Seat of the Pantheon, bringing an end to the Burning Crusade. But before he could be taken by the remaining titans, Sargeras plunged his &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; into the depths of Azeroth. The thus formed in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; caused &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to bleed out. Her blood would crystallize as a mineral called &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, pooling up across the planet.\nAppearance.\nSargeras is a huge, planet-sized being\u2014so large that his sword, when mostly-embedded in Silithus, is perhaps the tallest object on Azeroth. Upon shattering &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, he unleashed an enormous torrent of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy that warped his very being. His eyes burst in gouts of emerald fire while fel volcanoes ignited across his body, splitting his skin apart and revealing a furnace of endless, blistering hate. The Dark Titan is fully clad in a burning suit of molten, black armor, and his skin cracked with veins of magma. Wildly dancing flames surround his head and form a thick mass of hair and a sweeping beard. A pair of horns extends from his forehead and a pair of demonic wings lie on his back.\nBefore his imprisonment by the Pantheon, Sargeras could be seen surrounding Azeroth as a swirling, fiery mass of clouds.\nPowers.\nThe exact powers at Sargeras' command are unclear, though certainly formidable given his status as a titan and lord of the Legion. His power before his corruption was such that he was the champion of the Pantheon, and he demonstrated the ability to destroy entire worlds with barely an effort. After his fall and corruption, he was able to single-handedly destroy the entire Pantheon with his fel magic, the one thing titans are uniquely susceptible to.\nHe has been shown to display the following powers:\nCharacter development.\nSargeras was originally a footnote in very early \"Warcraft\" RTS lore, a fallen Daemonlord whose dark legacy was used by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. With \"\", he became one of the primary lore villains.\nIt was originally stated in the that Sargeras fell into despair due to the endless evil of the demonic &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, and that he abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; due to coming to believe that the titan's vision of an ordered universe was impossible and pointless \u2014 that chaos and depravity were the only absolutes.\nThe origin of the eredar was heavily &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; in ', and the ' instead showed Sargeras fighting nathrezim, &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s prior to his corruption, but his reason for betraying his fellow titans remained relatively the same.\n\"\" changed Sargeras' backstory once more by providing a more specific reason for his betrayal: namely, the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s and the risk of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; infecting a nascent &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelated artifacts.\nSargeras had various weapons:\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nSargeras was once a &lt;a href=\"vanir\"&gt;vanir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;, called upon to defeat and imprison the hordes of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s native to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, so that their evil would not contaminate the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s' vision of order. Sargeras went about his task devoutly for several millennia.\nShaken by the boundless evil and hate of demons, Sargeras began to despair of his task and gradually slipped into a brooding depression. He was unable to comprehend the nature of such pure evil and came to blame the titans for what he considered to be their flawed pursuit of a false order. Sargeras concluded that chaos and depravity were the only true forces in the universe and angrily exiled himself from their ranks forever.\nSargeras roamed the Twisting Nether for thousands of years, freeing many demon races that he had previously hunted down and imprisoned. He bound the newly released demons to his will and used them to construct an army of massive proportions \u2014 one that eventually became known as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nConvinced that the titans' ordering of the universe was unnatural and ultimately responsible for the corrupted nature of the demons, Sargeras decided to undo the work of the titans throughout the universe. The only way that he could correct their mistakes was to destroy all of the worlds that the titans had shaped and brought order to so long ago.\nSargeras and the Legion eventually became aware of the young world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' reckless use of arcane magic, and Sargeras began to hunger for the limitless energies of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Sargeras' first invasion of Azeroth failed, and his armies were defeated by the demi-god &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; left by the titans.\nThe second time Sargeras assaulted Azeroth, he was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. As Aegwynn surveyed the scene, she found the rift from which the Legion's agents had come through in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. Using this portal, Sargeras entered Azeroth in the form of an &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that this avatar was infused with a portion of Sargeras' soul which he controlled. The Guardian of Tirisfal did not hesitate in attacking, but Sargeras held back, letting the mage destroy his physical body. However, as it died, Sargeras' spirit reached inside Aegwynn's body and hid, lying dormant for many years. Unaware of the tainted presence inside her body, Aegwynn buried Sargeras' physical body in a tomb and cast it deep into the ocean.\nEventually, Sargeras' spirit awoke and possessed the mind of Aegwynn's unborn son, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. When Medivh grew old enough to inherit the mantle of Guardian of Tirisfal from Aegwynn, Sargeras' spirit manipulated him to use his powers to contact &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and open a portal between &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and Azeroth. Sargeras desired vengeance against the human kingdoms, and expected the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to travel through the portal and destroy the humans. Although the orcs did enter the portal and eventually caused a great amount of damage to the human kingdoms, Sargeras ultimately failed in his plans because a band of Medivh's friends recognized signs of possession in the sorcerer and rushed to kill him. As Medivh died, the portion of Sargeras' spirit that had possessed him was released and swiftly dispersed. Many believe that Sargeras' spirit yet endures somewhere, hungering for revenge against the only world ever to withstand the Burning Legion\u2019s might...\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; is fairly confident that the real Sargeras never actually set foot on Azeroth, implying the real Sargeras is still around in the Twisting Nether. Lending this theory further credibility is in &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the power of the Well of Eternity was needed to create a portal strong enough for Sargeras to attempt to enter Azeroth, the creation of which took a long time to be completed. The portal used to bring the Sargeras that Aegwynn fought was powered by a handful of demons and was created in only a few minutes.\nSkills and abilities.\nAs a former Champion of the Pantheon, Sargeras is nearly impervious to physical damage. He is highly resistant to magical attacks. His natural attacks are more powerful than other titans. Demonic influences have given Sargeras' body flames and made him totally immune to fire damage and fel damage. Sargeras' flesh burns with demonic energy, scorching everything in his path. Sargeras' body flames slowly increase the ambient temperature by up to fifty degrees in every direction for one thousand miles. The effect on natural climates can be devastating.\nBody Flames (Sargeras' flesh burns with demonic energy, scorching everything in his path. Sargeras' body flames slowly increase the ambient temperature by up to 50 degrees in every direction for 1,000 miles. The effect on natural climates can be devastating.)\nHis molten armor can nearly burn your eyes.\nRelated artifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorshalach\"&gt;Gorshalach&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Sargeras wielded this &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; when he was still the Champion of the Pantheon. It sundered itself into two pieces upon Sargeras' fall into madness. Sargeras reforged one of the two fragments into his current weapon, &lt;a href=\"Gorribal\"&gt;Gorribal&lt;/a&gt;, while the other fragment was claimed by &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; and reforged into &lt;a href=\"Taeshalach\"&gt;Taeshalach&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The organization is not mentioned in , nor are draenei traitors. However the \"Chronicle\" also notes that Velen's failing visions were not, in fact, tied to Garrosh, but in fact the confrontation with K'ara during the draenei's arrival. This indicates that Velen also suffered from failing visions in the main timeline, a development that was previously indicated as tied to the changes to the alternate Draenor's timeline, and were also the reason for the formation of the Sargerei. The fact that Velen's visions also began to fail in the main timeline means that this could still have been a motive for the defection of some draenei to the Legion."}

Although the Old God was imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, it was incompletely; as his black blood runs through the whole continent, crystallizing into saronite and corrupting all it touches. His whispers escaped with the saronite, tempting many to madness, including the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;. It first appeared across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; around the year -4,500 in areas in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; but was eradicated with the help of &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"Archivum%20Console\"&gt;Archivum Console&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful acid found within Yogg-Saron is believed to be responsible for the liquefaction of saronite.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; called it the \"Black Blood of Yogg-Saron\".\nProperties.\nThe quest &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Evil\"&gt;Pure Evil&lt;/a&gt; shows how strong and resistant the evil metal is. The saronite &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; collected was completely unscratched by the attacks from &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Korfax\"&gt;Crusade Commander Korfax's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Reaper\"&gt;Arcanite Reaper&lt;/a&gt;.

Finally, the ore was struck by the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20Metz\"&gt;Avenger Metz&lt;/a&gt;, and the ore reacted but seemed to reflect the spell back at everyone in the area. The metal itself is very strong yet lightweight.\n&lt;a href=\"Borus%20Ironbender\"&gt;Borus Ironbender&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde Grand Master Blacksmith trainer in &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, remarks \u2014 from his observations of &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 that he had never seen a metal \"breathe\" before, and sends adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Narjun\"&gt;Pit of Narjun&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; to collect samples of this metal for his research.\nSince the Lich King's psychic powers are powerful, and his undead minions have no will of their own to speak of, they might be resistant to the evil of Yogg-Saron. This would seem to be the main reason the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; chose to use this evil ore to create his fortresses in Icecrown as well as create his war machines.\nIt is unknown if the mind of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; are affected by wearing saronite now that they are free from the grasp of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; appears to have found a way to bend saronite to their will and equip their greatest champions in their ascent of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt also has powerful properties that are useful against &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, capable of destroying both their flesh and their soul. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; used saronite to end her unlife, reasoning; \"The fall alone couldn't kill her: her animate flesh was nigh indestructible. But the spikes, the hardened blood of an Old God, they not only would tear the body apart but would obliterate the soul as well.\" Properties that could be forged into a weapon. As such, Sylvanas threw herself off from the Frozen Throne, believing that saronite would grant her rest.\nHowever, saronite isn't indestructible; as seen with a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Colossus\"&gt;Colossus&lt;/a&gt; constructed from a saronite alloy who is still vulnerable to the acid of the massive &lt;a href=\"Jormungar\"&gt;Jormungar&lt;/a&gt;, or even when the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; used a &lt;a href=\"battering%20ram\"&gt;battering ram&lt;/a&gt; to bring down the doors of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. According to the death knight &lt;a href=\"Vereth%20the%20Cunning\"&gt;Vereth the Cunning&lt;/a&gt;, if the entirely made of saronite &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; named had to be finished, it would be hard to destroy but not impossible, and so he decided only to halt its production. Smelted saronite has also been described as being \"brittle\" on two separate occasions, first in the quest &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Smelting...%20Smelting%21\"&gt;I'm Smelting... Smelting!&lt;/a&gt; where the Scourge used broken shards of saronite to create deadlier &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and later in &lt;a href=\"Tempering%20The%20Blade%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Tempering The Blade (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tempering%20The%20Blade%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Tempering The Blade (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; where it was said \"that jagged saronite edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything\" unless it was properly tempered.\nDespite its saronite composition, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; managed to crumple Arthas' armor with a powerful attack of his &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; warhammer. Later, the &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; Sylvanas Windrunner managed to injure and paralyze Arthas with a poison arrow, the latter described that her arrow had \"piercing through his armor as if it were as flimsy as parchment\".\nAlthough saronite armor can withstand and protect from &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al flames, its wearer is not immune to the resulting heat, as the flesh of Arthas was burned and wounded by the &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;arcanic&lt;/a&gt; flames of the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; flames of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; during their respective battle in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses of saronite.\nThe major user of saronite is the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, who utilizes this evil metal to its full potential. They have used saronite to power their war machine and construct their master's stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ramparts, spires, and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;cathedrals&lt;/a&gt; that practically cover the Icecrown region. The Scourge, in the laboratories of the &lt;a href=\"Fleshwerks\"&gt;Fleshwerks&lt;/a&gt;, have also begun implanting broken shards of saronite into the bodies of ghouls, resulting in much deadlier minions in the Scourge legions. The Lich King has even commissioned the construction of a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, , which would be made completely of saronite.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; became the first of the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, he was given a suit of saronite armor.\nAs an agent of the Lich King in , the death knight &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was given a saronite armor after they proved themselves in battle against the enemies of the Scourge. In the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, the skeletal archers led by &lt;a href=\"Orithos%20the%20Sky%20Darkener\"&gt;Orithos the Sky Darkener&lt;/a&gt; used saronite-headed arrows to rain death on the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt;, before sending &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to retrieve them due to their limited number, as they are far from Northrend.\nTo contain the energies that dance across its cold edges, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt; was hewn with piles of impure saronite, treated only by master metal-shapers. As the base of the legendary weapon, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Shadow's Edge&lt;/a&gt; was created from &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, the hammer of Arthas Menethil before he took up &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, reforged by a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with saronite under the order of &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaronite is also used by player characters of both the Alliance and the Horde, as grand master &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s can make armor and weaponry from saronite, and grand master &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s can craft explosives.\nThe side effects of saronite mining.\nOften, mortals who mine saronite for prolonged periods of time appear to be driven insane. Indeed, many of the people who have been rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Mines\"&gt;Saronite Mines&lt;/a&gt; tell of hearing strange whispers of unknown origins, attempting to shape their perceptions of those around them. Others became enraged and simply attacked their would-be rescuers at the very suggestion of being taken away from the &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;\"Master\"&lt;/a&gt;, while still others yell madly about their mysterious \"Master\", and attempt to offer their lives to it by hurling themselves down into the deep recesses of the mines.\nPlayers who spend time in the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Mines\"&gt;Saronite Mines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ymirheim\"&gt;Ymirheim&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Whisper%20Gulch\"&gt;Whisper Gulch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; will begin seeing whispers from a set of \"Unknown Voices\" appearing in their chat logs.\nAppearances.\nNodes.\nOre.\nNodes when mined produce &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Ore\"&gt;Saronite Ore&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chunk%20of%20Saronite\"&gt;Chunk of Saronite&lt;/a&gt; is used in a quest.\nBars.\n&lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Bar\"&gt;Saronite Bar&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"smeltable\"&gt;smeltable&lt;/a&gt; from 2 &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Ore\"&gt;Saronite Ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaceless ones.\nThe &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt;, creatures created by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, appear for some of them to be partially composed of saronite as well. &lt;a href=\"General%20Vezax\"&gt;General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;, the faceless general, gives off saronite Vapors and says, \"The black blood of Yogg-Saron courses through me!\" Other faceless ones are depicted with saronite-colored blood in their veins."}

{"id": "184270", "revid": "54304167", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=184270", "title": "Sartharion", "text": "Sartharion is a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; boss located in the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. He is charged to watch over the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; eggs in the sanctum.\nThis part of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; contains 4 mobs of interest. These mobs are Sartharion (the raid boss himself) and 3 drakes, , , and . Each has their own form of &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s depending on how you engage them. The drake mobs are known as \"Disciple of...\" respectively.\nTwilight Drakes.\n Will of Sartharion - Sartharion's presence bolsters the resolve of the Twilight Drakes, increasing their total health by 25%. This effect also increases Sartharion's health by 25%. \"Active only while fighting Sartharion with drakes alive.\"\nThis will give each drake 1,220,187 health in 10 player (2,789,000 in 25 player) and Sartharion 3,137,625 health in 10 player (9,597,500 in 25 player) respectively.\nShared Drake Abilities.\nEach drake can be taken down without engaging Sartharion. The achievements require leaving one, two, or all three of them up. If you kill them before engaging the primary boss, they each give &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; but no other loot.\nVesperon and Shadron.\nEach drake fight is a typical tank and spank, but after 15-20s the drake will open a portal. One &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, one off &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, and all &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;dps&lt;/a&gt; need to take the portal, leaving only the main tank and his healer behind. Much like phased content, you'll be in the same place (totems still exist where you left them), but instead of seeing the drake, you'll fight a disciple of whichever drake it is. They have a shadow aura that reduces damage taken by 25%, but periodically pulses shadow damage to you. \nVesperon's disciple will place &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D58835\"&gt;Twilight Torment&lt;/a&gt; on the raid frequently, which increases fire and shadow damage taken by 75% and causes you to deal damage to yourself on hit. It used to be possible to temporarily remove the Twilight Torment debuff with any damage other than autoattacking, but the ability was changed with patch 3.0.8 and this is not possible anymore. This disciple can be ignored if fighting Vesperon alone, but is extremely dangerous in a multi-drake Sartharion fight.\nShadron's disciple will place &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D57835\"&gt;Gift of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; on Shadron which increases all Shadow damage done by 50% and provides complete immunity to damage. If fighting Sartharion with Shadron alive, the disciple will use a different version of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D58766\"&gt;Gift of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; and buff Sartharion instead, increasing Fire damage done by 50% and provides complete immunity to &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. This can and will buff Sartharion's Flame Breath to levels that will one-shot your tank if left unmitigated in combination with Power of Shadron, Twilight Torment, and so on. Shadron alone with this buff is not terribly threatening, although his Shadow Fissures can one-shot low &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; targets while Gift of Twilight is active.\nTenebron.\nTenebron is similar to the first two drakes, except that in the alternate realm, instead of a disciple, you will encounter several eggs. The portal group will need to kill as many eggs as possible before reaching a time limit, at which point the eggs hatch, and everyone is reverted to the real world. Any unkilled eggs spawn whelps, which must be tanked and killed as quickly as possible, so that the DPS can return to the drake before the next portal appears. Each of the whelps can apply a stacking Fade Armor &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;, reducing armor by about 1200. \nMost groups will find it is easier to ignore Tenebron's portals and tank/AOE his whelps down, as the dps loss from taking the portal will typically compensate for the higher health of the whelps as compared to their eggs.\nFor Sartharion + one drake learning purposes, Sartharion + Tenebron is probably the easiest step up, since you have the option of just burning the drake and off-tanking/AOE'ing the whelps without taking the portal. With the others, you either take the portal and waste a bunch of time, or don't take the portal and eat a nasty debuff for a while.\nWhen attempting 2 drakes and up, make sure that after killing Tenebron and before taking on the next drake that all whelp add's are killed, as whelps can cross realms between the playing field and the void zone, and can cause a wipe if the tank goes through the portal before all whelps are dead, as they will rampage and go after healers and DPS that &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; them.\nSartharion.\n Cleave - Inflicts 35% weapon damage to an enemy and its nearest allies, affecting up to 10 targets.\n Tail Lash - A sweeping tail strike hits all enemies behind the caster, inflicting 3063 to 3937 (4375 to 5625 Heroic) damage and stunning them for 2 sec.\n Fire Breath - Inflicts 8750 to 11250 (10938 to 14062 Heroic) Fire damage to enemies in a cone in front of the caster.\nWill cast Pyrobuffet at anyone outside the area of his platform, rapidly killing them. Brief dips in the lava will generally not trigger Pyrobuffet.\nSartharion has a 15-minute enrage timer, at which time he will spam Pyrobuffets regardless of location.\nHis immediate area is surrounded by a small moat of lava. The north (right) / south (left) sides of this lava spawn lava waves by Sartharion during his emotes every 30 seconds. See layout/positioning images below for details. Everyone must stay in the layout to prevent the Pyrobuffet. \nDespite his cleave being rather weak, it can still deal a lot of damage to cloth and leather wearers so it is generally best for players to treat the cleave as deadly as the raid will be taking AOE damage from adds and other effects during the encounter, this will reduce the amount of healing stress on your healers greatly.\nStrategy.\nNOTE: North is to the right in the illustrations and west is up.\nAt certain intervals, a raid warning will appear saying, \"The lava surrounding Sartharion churns!\" Lava waves will then spawn that originate from the left or right of the encounter area. These waves place a DoT on any players caught in them, so players should move to the gaps between them. The location of the gaps is predictable depending on the side that the waves originate from, as shown in the illustrations. They are huge, obvious, and slow-moving, however, so players should have no trouble watching for them and moving out of their way.\nWhen the wave originates from the left, the tank will need to rotate Sartharion away from the group to avoid the wave, as shown. When the wave originates from the right, the tank should not have to move. At all times players should avoid Sartharion's cleave, breath, and tail swipe.\nIt is possible to heal the tank through the lava waves and resulting &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;, if your group desires so.\nThese adds are summoned every ?s in groups of 2-4 to be offtanked. If these adds are hit by the lava waves they will enrage to deal 400% more damage, so ~800 becomes 4k, modified by Shadron's aura. Adds should be moved out of the path of the Lava Strikes. DPS will have to drop these as priority after they spawn and are picked up by the OT. The offtank must be careful using area of effect taunts when gathering the adds because Sartharion is not immune to taunt. Rogues can use Fan of Knives with Anesthetic Poison and Hunters can use Tranquilizing Shot to dispel the enrage from the adds, greatly reducing both the damage they inflict and the DPS needed to eliminate them.\nThe major drake of issue is Shadron since everything in the encounter is fire damage. Vesperon is less an issue as your raid is better geared. First time groups should take down all 3 drakes, making the encounter a tank and spank, minor add control, and minor movement to avoid waves. Subsequent visits may provide the chance to try while leaving Tenebron/Vesperon up.\nAt 10% he goes into a sort of soft enrage, summoning what looks like 5-10 of the elemental adds.\nLava elemental add's do not cross over into void zones when you go into them, but whelps do.\nEngaging With Drakes Still Alive.\nWhen clearing the instance with the intention of leaving one, two, or all three drakes alive all trash must still be cleared before engaging Sartharion. It is possible to clear trash without grabbing aggro from the drakes simply by moving along the wall far behind them. All trash and the drakes are linked with Sartharion.\nWhen engaging Sartharion with drakes left alive, they will join in the fight as if you were encountering normally: they will melee whoever is tanking them, cast the &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;-like Flamestrike, and create portals for adds. Needless to say, the fight takes a huge jump in difficulty as not only do you have to pay attention to the elemental adds and waves around the area, but now you have to simultaneously deal with drakes and clearing their adds. The drakes, upon engaging Sartharion, can and should all be killed first. At the start of the fight, they will hover overhead and apply their respective aura then come down at their respective times and start attacking and summoning portals. \nThe offtank should remember that the drakes do a frontal cone shadow breath and to keep them faced away from the raid, preferably parallel with how the main tank is turning Sartharion to make avoiding waves easier. If there's a good supply of rogues and hunters, misdirects can be used to bring fire adds over towards the offtank to give ample time for taunts and aggro upkeep. If this is too much trouble, a third offtank should handle the fire adds and pile them near the drake so AoE can be at its most effective.\nA subgroup of a healer and DPS (the less needed to eliminate a disciple or eggs, the better) should focus on going into the portals and taking care of the adds drakes spawn. At a certain level of gear, almost anyone is able to tank a disciple but will take amplified shadow damage from Tenebron's aura. \nIt is highly recommended that every raider is Tier 7 / Heroic geared before trying Sartharion with any drakes up as the urgency of killing adds will require a high DPS output.\nTypically on 10, 8 dps, a tank and a healer are used. The drakes do however, enrage once Sartharion gets to low health, so an offtank, or class capable of kiting may try to move Tenebron away from Sartharion, as the damage may be too much for the tank to handle. Tenebron is the first drake to come down. When Sartharion reaches 25% health, Tenebron will start hitting for 25 K shadow damage. Healing and tanking cooldowns should be used starting at this 25% health mark. The ability to resist Tenebron's shadow attacks is unknown. With the normal 130 shadow resist aura, the roughly 32 K shadow attack was partially resisted, but always to the exact same number around 25 K. Resist all potions and/or flasks made no difference to the resisted amount, or the net amount of damage.\nUsing this strategy, you must kill Sartharion before Shadron summons his portal, as shortly thereafter he will become immune to all damage. This occurs at roughly 85 seconds after Sartharion is engaged, so you will need a minimum of 30k DPS on 10-man and 91k DPS on 25-man to kill him before this point. Obviously cooldown usage (including Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp/Ancient Hysteria) is recommended.\nSolo strategy.\nKill all the trash mobs in the instance, but don't engage the bosses on the sides. Walk along the edge of the path, as far as possible from the bosses to not aggro them.\nAfter making a trip around the area, get to Sartharion's platform. Pop all cooldowns on the pull and blow the dragon up. The absolute minimum DPS requirement is 58K DPS in 25-player mode, as Shadron opens his portal roughly 85 seconds into the fight (4.8M health in 85 seconds is 58KDPS).\nAt 100, don't even bother with the trash, just run straight to Sartharion and kill him. He should die before the trash gets to the center platform.\nLoot.\nThe amount of loot rewarded is modified by the number of drakes taken alive into the Sartharion fight. As with most \"Wrath of the Lich King\"-tier raids, loot is not shared between 10- and 25-player mode kills. All kills will award one &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Hide%20Bag\"&gt;Dragon Hide Bag&lt;/a&gt;, one satchel of spoils, and two &lt;a href=\"Tier%207\"&gt;Tier 7&lt;/a&gt; glove tokens. With no drakes alive, Sartharion's corpse will also have one or two pieces of loot from the regular loot table. Adding any one drake will reward an additional item from the \"1-drake\" loot table. Adding any second drake will reward an additional item from the \"2-drake\" table. Adding the third drake will reward a mount.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Saru came out of it unscathed and publicly stated that one of his apprentices must have left some &lt;a href=\"%3Afelslate\"&gt;:felslate&lt;/a&gt; cooking too long and that the rumors of Alliance sabotage were nonsense. High Overlord Saurfang himself announced that he would have everything in the forge repaired and promised Saru in writing that he would replace all the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; that was lost in the explosion. This confused Steelfury, since he was certain there hadn't been any Azerite in the forge that day, but he decided that if he was the only smith in Orgrimmar known to be able to work with Azerite, it could only improve his reputation. Saru kept Saurfang's letter in a hidden satchel.

During the sailing, storms caught them, destroying three ships with Dawnchaser tauren. Guided by the visions of Dezco's pregnant wife, &lt;a href=\"Leza%20Dawnchaser\"&gt;Leza&lt;/a&gt;, the last vessel was able to find Pandaria and landed on the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. All in the group now felt a pull to the north. The influence of the sha, however, was felt acutely by the tauren, and Leza fell ill shortly before childbirth. After heading inland by canoe, the group set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Cleft\"&gt;Thunder Cleft&lt;/a&gt;, stymied by the &lt;a href=\"Winds%27%20Edge\"&gt;Winds' Edge&lt;/a&gt; cliffs. Dezco sent Leza's brother Chezin to look for allies, but he found only &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and died from their poison. Increasingly desperate, Dezco tasked adventurers with finding &lt;a href=\"Herbal%20Remedies\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pools%20of%20Youth%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;magical water&lt;/a&gt; to help his wife. However, although Leza's twin sons were safely delivered, Leza did not survive the childbirth.\nDezco later helped the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed his old friend Kor being killed by &lt;a href=\"Groundbreaker%20Brojai\"&gt;Groundbreaker Brojai&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of adventurers, he defeated Brojai, and traveled to Stoneplow in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; where he is found aiding in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. Dezco is later seen in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; guarding the human prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, after which he witnessed the opening of the gate to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Dezco is later seen in the Horde Capital city of &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; located near the flight master in the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Terrace\"&gt;Golden Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, acting as the city's de facto leader.\nBleeding Sun.\nWhen Dezco reached the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; he brought his newborn sons, bearing the &lt;a href=\"weaning%20name\"&gt;weaning name&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Redhorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloudhoof\"&gt;Cloudhoof&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;, where they were nursed by his wife's cousin &lt;a href=\"Nala\"&gt;Nala&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; learned that a child within the Vale was destined to join their order, but after testing several pandaren children at the Shrine were unable to locate the child. &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; then appeared and found his way to Dezco's sons, announcing that one of them was destined to serve the vale. While &lt;a href=\"Zhi%20the%20Harmonious\"&gt;Zhi the Harmonious&lt;/a&gt; was shocked at the selection of a non-pandaren child, Dezco was left to decide which of his sons would remain with him, and which would be taken by the order. However, unwilling to see either of his children taken from his care and raised away from his tauren roots, Dezco decided to instead quietly leave the Vale and return to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, refusing the order's request but honoring his late wife's dying wishes for him to watch over their children.\nHis path home blocked by the encroaching &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien\"&gt;Shao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;Gate of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, Dezco joined a group of refugees to travel south to &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt;, in search of another exit from the Vale. However, by nightfall the group encountered &lt;a href=\"Mokimo%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Mokimo the Strong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weng%20the%20Merciful\"&gt;Weng the Merciful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rook%20Stonetoe\"&gt;Rook Stonetoe&lt;/a&gt; of the Golden Lotus, who had been sent to intercept Dezco. While Dezco was suspicious that the party had been sent to persuade him to return, Mokimo told him he was free to leave, insisting that they had come only to protect Dezco and his children, and imploring him to return to the safety of the Shrine of Two Moons - but Dezco refused to return. That night, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"quilen\"&gt;quilen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Redhorn&lt;/a&gt; was torn from Dezco's body and carried away. Ignoring Mokimo's pleas to allow him to carry Cloudhoof to safety, Dezco gave chase and found Redhorn in the grasp of a group of Shao-Tien mogu. A fierce battle ensued, and at the last second Mokimo placed himself between Redhorn and the mogu leader's poisoned blade, suffering a grievous wound in order to save the child. However, in the heat of battle, Dezco failed to notice his second son Cloudhoof, apparently safe at his side, crushed in his basket.\nWith one child dead and the other dying from the mogu's poison, Dezco and Mokimo made their way to one of the Vale's sacred pools, the pool of hope. Forced to leave Cloudhoof at the waters' edge, the two invoked the powers of the vale to heal the child. A vision of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; appeared, reviving Redhorn and healing Mokimo, but vanished before Dezco could plead for him to help Cloudhoof.\nAs Dezco battled with his grief and a sense of guilt in the death of Cloudhoof, Mokimo offered to assist him in his wishes to return to Mulgore, assuring him that he would find a passage home for the two of them, whatever it took. However, amazed by the order's love and concern for his children, and stirred by Mokimo's speech of home, Dezco realized, at last, the true meaning of his wife's visions concerning the Vale, and gave Redhorn to Mokimo, saying goodbye to his only child and his last connection to his wife, in the knowledge that this was, in fact, the true reason for his tribe's journey to the Vale.\nLandfall and The Thunder King.\nTwo months later, the Horde navy was about to make landfall in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and Dezco sent adventurers to assist the Horde.\nDezco later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;, and was granted an audience with Prince Anduin and the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. He later took up arms with the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; force to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; see to dismantling the local &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; presence.\nEscalation.\nUnder Warchief Hellscream's orders, a Horde excavation force laid waste to sacred ground in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to unearth yet more dangerous artifacts of use to Garrosh's cause. In retaliation, &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; confronted Dezco at the Shrine of Two Moons, and ordered him to leave the vale, threatening to use lethal force should the Horde not comply. Dezco was able to stall Zhu's wrath, informing him that the man responsible for this travesty no longer speaks for the rest of the Horde, and that indeed, many are now rising up against him. Dezco promised to bring Hellscream to justice, asking only time to make it happen.\nNo stranger to dealing with tyrants, Zhu warily allowed Dezco the chance to make things right, giving the Dawnchaser chieftain until the end of the season to make good on his promise.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAfter the defilement of the Vale, Dezco, Nala, and a group of Dawnchaser Braves joined with Golden Lotus Defenders and stood in front of the Shrine of Two Moons. Dezco later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, battling the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; orcs in the halls of the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSeeking redemption, Dezco travels alone without his clan to &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; on . Researching the way the fanatic &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; worship the light in different ways than the Sunwalkers, he seeks a &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Crystal%20%28item%29\"&gt;Sun Crystal&lt;/a&gt; in order to see its light. The Sun Crystal seems to fill Dezco with warmth and comfort, lessening the pain he feels for the loss of his family. However, later Dezco shows he is becoming addicted, asking for more crystals and saying each day feels darker the longer he is without one.\nLegion.\nDezco joined the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and is located in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the split of the Order during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Dezco is no longer a member of the Silver Hand.\nShadowlands.\nDezco crossed the veil to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and can be found in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find the souls of Leza and Cloudhoof. He greets the adventurer as a familiar face and asks them, if they see Leza, to tell her that their son &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Kor&lt;/a&gt; is growing strong and that Dezco will always love her.\nThe War Within.\nDezco appears on the shores of the Isle of Dorn after the Horde and Alliance armies arrive in Khaz Algar. He oversees a sparring match led by his son, Kor (Redhorn) Dawnchaser, and is also accompanied by other prominent Tauren including Aponi Brightmane and Tahu Sagewind.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI swear by the power of An'she, these Kor'kron whelps will not pass.\nThe High Chieftain asked for me to join him in this negotiation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain tribe&lt;/a&gt; is spoken of in our legends and remembered with reverence.\nIt was important that we show respect for such an ancient tribe."}
