No &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; could have created these crawling masses, but yet they exist. This slime seems attracted to the heat of Orcish bodies, and will seep through even the tightest armor to drain into the pores of its victims skin and sap them of strength and life.\nNot all of the putrid, slick goo that oozes from openings in the floors and walls is merely disgusting. Some of it poses great danger as well. While slime has no intelligence, it is attracted to the heat that bodies generate. This ichor will literally drain the life from its victims, as heat is what it uses as food. No magical properties have been found to exist within the slime, but nature is often a magik unto itself.\nInformation.\nSlimes are found in the missions &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead%20Mines%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;The Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medivh%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; as well as in some dungeon maps. They take a while to die, and in numbers, prove to be a real threat. It is advisable to arrange your units in a line when fighting large groups of Slimes, to keep them from being surrounded and overwhelmed.\nThe Slimes encountered in the Northshire Abbey and Medivh missions have upgraded weapons and armor, improving their stats as shown in the unit box above.\nInternal data within the game's files gives training Slimes, a cost of 200 gold, but this is meaningless as there is nothing that can produce slime units."}

For several years, the pirate crew did exactly what they were told. They killed without mercy, and the power of the cutlasses grew ever stronger. When other Bloodsail Buccaneers learned how deep into insanity this crew had fallen, they tried to intervene. Goreblade's pirates survived the counterattack and managed to steal the Bloodsail Buccaneers' most prized ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Veil\"&gt;Crimson Veil&lt;/a&gt;\", for themselves.\nSoon, some crew members began to change. Their forms withered and faded. Only their skeletons remained. Admiral Goreblade did not mind. The cutlasses hungered for blood, and now, so did she.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Goreblade finally discovered the true power behind her weapons. Talgath revealed himself and told her that she had only tasted a meaningless drop of the Burning Legion's strength. If she aided the demons in the coming war, he promised that she would ascend to immortality and find out what might the Legion could truly bestow. The admiral agreed immediately. She made a pact, giving the souls of all her crew to Talgath's tender care. She had already come to enjoy being the unseen terror of the seas. The possibility of bringing a world to ruin consumed her mind. \nWhen the Legion attacked, so did Admiral Goreblade. Several convoys of reinforcements from both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by her crew before they could reach the Broken Isles.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the group operated in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Lights\"&gt;Temple of a Thousand Lights&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. They were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadowblade&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;."}

Soon after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival, Dargrul destroyed the peace between the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the drogbar tribes of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; by murdering &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;High Chieftain Ulan&lt;/a&gt; and stealing the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact protected by the tauren. Using the terrible power of the Hammer, the Underking intends to take control of Highmountain. He serves as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20storyline\"&gt;Highmountain storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nA Mountain Divided.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Dargrul and a mysterious bodyguard convened a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; chieftains. As the Legion had begun marching on Dargrul's lands, the Underking was impatient and prickly, frustrated with the tauren's refusal to use the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; against the enemy. When the tauren sage &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt; had shown him that the Legion's fall would come at the hands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;outsiders&lt;/a&gt; empowered by the hammer, Dargrul was outraged, saying that the tauren's &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;ancestor&lt;/a&gt; had used the weapon to banish &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; from the region and that it therefore belonged to Highmountain alone. When Ebonhorn said that he was certain of what he had seen and that Highmountain's people were bound by fate to aid the outsiders, &lt;a href=\"Ulan%20Highmountain\"&gt;High Chieftain Ulan&lt;/a&gt; said that the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; would obey the spirits, and the other chieftains begrudgingly agreed. In response, however, Dargrul claimed that he had also visited Neltharion's Vault but had seen nothing of outsiders \u2014 only that strength would drive back the Legion. Without warning, the Underking leapt forward and grabbed the hammer, saying that since the tauren were unworthy to wield it, he would do so himself. The Underking's hooded bodyguard used his magic to call forth great spikes from the earth which locked the three lesser chieftains in place. When &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Ulan, said that Dargrul was starting war, he responded by saying that he was \"ending\" the war \u2014 that the Legion could not be reasoned with, that he knew the tauren would not act and that he would not let his people's fate rest in their hands any longer. When High Chieftain Ulan tried to stop Dargrul by saying that the drogbar relied on the tauren for food, the Underking replied that he would take all of Highmountain by force. He then used the hammer's power to instantly kill Ulan before fleeing, leaving the tauren tribes divided and weakened.\nLegion.\n\"For centuries, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; tribes of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; lived in peace. But soon after the Legion's arrival, a drogbar leader named Dargrul the Underking destroyed their unity and stole the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact protected by the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Using the terrible power of the Hammer, the Underking intends to take control of Highmountain.\"\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jale%20Rivermane\"&gt;Jale Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer are fighting &lt;a href=\"Gelmogg\"&gt;Gelmogg&lt;/a&gt;, everyone turns into stone with the arrival of the Underking himself. He questions Gelmogg if he's having trouble then underestimated his worth. After he thought Gelmogg were victorious in the end, he wanted him to join the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Drogbar\"&gt;Drogbar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riverbend\"&gt;Riverbend&lt;/a&gt;. Jale quickly went to her village to tell everyone to evacuate with the Underking's arrival. Unfortunately, the power of the hammer did devastating damage to the village. After rescuing Jale, &lt;a href=\"Warbrave%20Oro\"&gt;Warbrave Oro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oakin%20Ironbull\"&gt;Oakin Ironbull&lt;/a&gt;, the confrontation of Dargrul was quickly approaching. Oro taunted the Underking only to be spiked in the end. His advisor &lt;a href=\"Ularogg%20Cragshaper\"&gt;Ularogg Cragshaper&lt;/a&gt; sees the stranger moving and lives. Dargrul wanted to let them know that their doom is at hand once he masters the titan's relic.\nWith all the tribes back in unity, they marched to &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt; to end it all for good. Of course the Underking was prepared of an plan. First, he shaped a cave for himself to lure everyone when his army of stone failed. Then he taunts them and flees into the &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair of the once proud great dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Within the dragon's lair, he questioned the champions that the tauren believed they were prophesied to seize the hammer. He taunted them to see one worthy of wielding the power of a titan. Dargrul the Underking couldn't believe it in the end that he was beaten and said that he was chosen only in the end that &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; said that the hammer never chose him. To that end, it seeks a wielder who possesses true strength, and he was found lacking."}

After defeating the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in the , he and his fellow death knights broke free from the Lich King's control during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and founded the order of renegade &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of Darion, the Ebon Blade spearheaded the attack against the Scourge alongside the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily allied with them to form the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and topple the Lich King.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; became the Jailer of the Damned, Darion continued to lead his knights in keeping all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; safe, helping the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; stop threats beyond the Scourge. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Darion came to an agreement with Bolvar, he and his knights willingly acted as the Lich King's agents against the Legion, if the Scourge remained contained to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Darion and his Horsemen seconded Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in their &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s ultimate defeat, Darion vowed to lead the Ebon Blade and return to Northrend to keep the Scourge in check.\nBiography.\nThe Ashbringer.\nOn the day of Darion's birth, he was stillborn. His father Alexandros, in a hurry, rushed the baby to a nearby stream, and from the freezing water, Darion Mograine entered the world. However, the joy his father felt quickly turned to grief as his wife and mother of his children, &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Mograine\"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt;, died due to complications from the birth. When the first hint of the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; started to spread around &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he lived in a farmhouse in &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;. With Renault, Darion secretly attended their father's meeting with the members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, where they learned about the situation in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the growing number of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and witnessed the purification of what would later become the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with his brother, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at a relatively young age soon after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. In a battle within the plagued city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, in which young Darion insisted on fighting, he took a serious wound and fell unconscious for a day. Upon awakening, the boy described his experience as being surrounded by darkness, before being shown a light that he followed back to life.\nFollowing the death of his father, Darion began to question the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; before being confronted by the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zabra%20Hexx\"&gt;Zabra Hexx&lt;/a&gt;. After being counseled by the troll to search out his father in a &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;fortress floating above a burning city&lt;/a&gt;, Darion joined the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith a handful of Argent Dawn volunteers and a mysterious mage known as &lt;a href=\"Castillian\"&gt;Castillian&lt;/a&gt;, Darion infiltrated the fortress of Naxxramas. After besting the lords of the Necropolis and losing his entire party to the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; came into Darion's possession. The sword's voice led him to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; where, unaware of the actual treachery of his brother, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, Darion was attacked by Renault who considered him to be the last link from his past, coming to torture him. The spirit of Alexandros Mograine appeared from the Ashbringer, beheading his traitor son and forgiving him afterward.\nRealizing that his father's soul was trapped within the Ashbringer, Darion stole a steed from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and ran away. &lt;a href=\"Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; then visited him in a dream, telling him to go and find &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. Darion followed the ghost's orders and eventually found Tirion, telling him what happened to his father, though only after arguing with the pariah. Afterward, Tirion told him of how he was banished. He told Darion that nothing could be done for Alexandros. When mounting his stead, Tirion told him that only an act of love greater than the act of evil could free his father's soul. Darion then invited him to join the Argent Dawn and despite Tirion's outright refusal, left the option open by asking him to \"Be a Hero\".\nAfter his meeting with Tirion, Darion ventured to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; where he came across a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army waiting to attack. &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;, overjoyed at his return, told him about the one thousand souls of the champions that died defending &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge and were later carried beneath the chapel. Darion took his place in the lines of The Order of the Argent Dawn in defense of the fallen. During the night he experienced a terrible vision about a world without the Light, a world where the Scourge were triumphant. In the morning, a call to arms was made to the soldiers as the First Battle for Light's Hope began. As the tide began to turn against the Argent Dawn, Tirion arrived riding &lt;a href=\"Mirador\"&gt;Mirador&lt;/a&gt; and managed to save a woman from an &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; as he joined the fray. As it seemed as though the Light-blessed soldiers of the Argent Dawn might prevail, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; himself joined the battle. Understanding that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s right hand had appeared, Darion charged forward, wielding the Corrupted Ashbringer as his father had long ago, and fought his way to Kel'Thuzad himself. The &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; showed no fear and said that even the Ashbringer was not powerful enough to stop him. At that very same moment, Darion realized what Tirion's words meant. Darion, as an act of love not only for his father but also for the cause they believed in, plunged Ashbringer through his heart with the words \"I love you, dad.\" In response to his noble action, the souls of a thousand vengeful knights erupted in pillars of light that purged the hills around the chapel of all traces of the Scourge. All that remained were the figures of Kel'Thuzad and the undead figure of Darion Mograine, the Corrupted Ashbringer still pierced through his chest.\nAs Kel'Thuzad stood triumphant, he commented on how he was willing to sacrifice his own forces if it meant claiming the last Mograine's soul. In an eerily similar fashion, he asked Darion, \"Who do you love?\" Now lifeless in the service of the same force he swore to eliminate, the newly risen death knight pulled out the Corrupted Ashbringer, accompanied by a sickening noise as the blade exited his flesh, and answered back, \"No one.\"\nWrath of the Lich King.\nSome time later Darion was made Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, an order of Death Knights with the sole purpose of annihilating the remaining living in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. He also planned and formulated not only the forces in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, but also the strategy of the forces of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the would-be assault on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. He gave command to all newly created Death Knights under his authority, orders to aid in the taking of the Eastern Plaguelands in the name of the Lich King from the fortress that is Ebon Hold.\nAfter the crushing of the Scarlet Crusade, the Death Knights of Acherus began preparation for their final assault on Light's Hope Chapel. Darion assembled his most worthy and strongest Death Knights to begin the Second Battle for Light's Hope. There he learned that the Ashbringer would refuse to strike down any foe, and refused to obey his commands. One of his three generals then fled, as he was forced to face the tremendous power of Lights Hope Chapel's consecrated ground. As Tirion arrived, Darion admitted defeat to the superior forces of the combined &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and Argent Dawn. At that moment, his father's spirit appeared to him briefly, before the Lich King appeared and trapped his soul within Frostmourne. After the Lich King admitted to sending the Death Knights to their doom just to bring Tirion Fordring out of hiding, Darion attempted to attack his master, only to be sent flying. As the Lich King was about to end the Death Knight's life, Darion threw the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to Tirion who in turn was able to purify it and push the Lich King back with the combined forces of the redeemed blade and the sacred ground.\nIn response to the Lich King's betrayal, Darion now leads the newly freed Death Knights, now known as the Knights of the Ebon Blade, in a campaign to wipe out the forces loyal to the Lich King from Ebon Hold and establish it as a neutral haven for all Death Knights to call home.\nHe can be found initially at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Vanguard\"&gt;Argent Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; discussing tactics with &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;; after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Line%20Of%20Defense\"&gt;The Last Line Of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, he moves to an area in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Light's Breach&lt;/a&gt;. During these events he is disguised as &lt;a href=\"The%20Ebon%20Watcher\"&gt;The Ebon Watcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarion appears again, this time undisguised, during &lt;a href=\"The%20Air%20Stands%20Still\"&gt;The Air Stands Still&lt;/a&gt;, summoned by the player to fight &lt;a href=\"Underking%20Talonox\"&gt;Underking Talonox&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt;, and again in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirion%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;Tirion's Gambit&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; and a group of Ebon Knights.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Fate%20of%20Bloodbane\"&gt;The Fate of Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; Darion leads a group of Knights of the Ebon Blade in fighting &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Suffering\"&gt;Host of Suffering&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and Darion Mograine next appear together in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; where they lead the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, a union of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is also involved in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould a raid member with the &lt;a href=\"Unsealed%20Chest\"&gt;Unsealed Chest&lt;/a&gt; bring &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%27%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Alexandros' Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; to Darion, he will reunite with his father, the Ashbringer &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. Alexandros explains that during his time of captivity in &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, the one memory that allowed him to keep his sanity was Darion's sacrifice. Darion proclaims that for his father, he would give his life \"a thousand times\". In gratitude, Darion gives the player his personal steed, the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Crimson%20Deathcharger\"&gt;Reins of the Crimson Deathcharger&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Darion found &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s prison of ice.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nTaking the chance to discover the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; for Bolvar's salvation, Darion Mograine has traveled to and can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt; (Horde), offering the quests &lt;a href=\"Shadowy%20Secrets\"&gt;Shadowy Secrets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20Soulbinding\"&gt;Secrets of Soulbinding&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen moved to the gates of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Darion wasn't surprised with the Lich King choosing the chosen death knight to be his hand since they know of their exploits. He exclaims that they are not bound to the new Lich King, but he could be a valuable ally to deal with the Burning Legion. It is also in their best interests that the Scourge stay contained. After one of the &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s are recovered, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; made the death knight who obtained it the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the Ebon Blade. Mograine, more than happy to not be wielding yet another fate-altering magical weapon, pledged himself as the first follower under the Deathlord.\nThe Lich King's voice spoke to the Deathlord, telling them that the time of the Four Horsemen is at hand and they will bring them back into the fold. Darion explains to the Deathlord that the Four Horsemen of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; were no ordinary death knights, as they were born of pure unholy power gifted from the Lich King to &lt;a href=\"Kel%27thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Now this power had been passed onto the Deathlord and he is sure that they will wield it with great conviction.\n&lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; was the first to be raised as a part of the new Four Horsemen, an act which Darion knew would outrage the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The next Horseman, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, was the previous king of the fallen kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. When the third Horsemen was announced, Darion was surprised to learn that it was the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; fanatic &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. He told the Deathlord that Whitemane was not listed in the annals of history alongside the names of fallen heroes. But despite her madness and zealotry, she held a bond to the Light unmatched by even the greatest paladins. Darion was sure that she would serve the Ebon Blade without compromise.\nWhen the Lich King announced the identity of the last Horseman, Darion was outraged, claiming that the Lich King demanded too much by asking to raise &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. Darion reluctantly obeyed but warned the Deathlord that there would be no redemption for what they were about to do. Furthermore, the Silver Hand would never hand Tirion to them and the blood that they were about to spill would stain their hands forever. Upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Darion informs the Deathlord that there's a tomb behind the chapel where the power of the Light is weak. The Deathlord then raised the dead from within the tomb distracting the guards long enough for them to make their way to the chapel. Darion strangulates &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; allowing the Deathlord to enter into the paladin order hall and tells them that he and the horsemen would meet them in there. When &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; fell before the Deathlord, Darion and the horsemen walked up to the tomb. As Darion passes by Liadrin she calls him a monster to which he sadly responds that \"without monsters, there can be no heroes\". He then asks the Deathlord to raise Tirion. However, when raising Tirion from his tomb, the Light cancels the channeling knocking the Deathlord across the room, stunning the death knights and ravaging their bodies. Darion, not willing to allow his faction to fall, creates a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; which the horsemen use to retreat back to Acherus, after which he &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt;s the still stunned Deathlord, telling them to take the Death Gate before pushing them through it, saving them from certain death. Unfortunately, Darion himself didn't manage to step through the Death Gate quickly enough, and he was struck down by the power of the Holy Light. Back at Acherus the Deathlord and the three horsemen gather around Darion's body. Nazgrim exclaims that they must do something before Darion is truly lost to them but Whitemane tells him that the Light has completely ravaged Darion's body and that there's nothing that they can do for him. Trollbane then commends Darion's sacrifice, saying that despite having seeing a lifetime of war he had never before seen such a sacrifice. It's then that the Lich King contacts the Deathlord telling them how Darion had sacrificed more for the Ebon Blade than any other and that while his broken and scarred body was now laying in front of them, death was only meant for the living and it had no power over the damned. The last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, was laying before the Deathlord and at their command Darion was raised from the dead once again and ordered by the Lich King to take leadership of the group.\nCorrupted Ashbringer.\n\"The following section is a &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%23Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of the 's &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden cosmetic appearance for the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMaxwell Tyrosus together with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Acherus demanding an audience with the Four Horsemen. Though they were greeted with hostility, Maxwell reminded Darion and the other Horsemen that the death knights were indebted to the Silver Hand for attacking Light's Hope and the Sanctum of Light in an attempt to raise Tirion as one of theirs. Agreeing, Darion and the Horsemen corrupted the Ashbringer with their energies, before ordering them to leave and never come back.\nLegionfall.\nDarion was one of the class order champions who met with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rimefang%27s%20Harness\"&gt;Rimefang's Harness&lt;/a&gt; appeared in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and the Deathlord wanted to retrieve it personally. &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt; went to scout ahead there to be there to lend a hand. When the Deathlord and Minerva returned, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; strategized what to do with the harness. They could utilize its power to bind the spirits of deceased drakes of &lt;a href=\"Daumyr\"&gt;Daumyr&lt;/a&gt; brood. Upon return, the Deathlord made quite the entrance that made the Four Horsemen mount up for battle upon the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Darion proclaims that the Burning Legion will fall and that the Ebon Blade shall strike them down for Azeroth.\nAftermath.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Darion carried &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a death knight, representing the Knights of the Ebon Blade.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUnder Bolvar's command, Darion and the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;other horsemen&lt;/a&gt; acquired fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and following its completion witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights being raised. Darion personally sent the new death knights to travel to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; if the death knight is &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; if it is &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and make a choice from the &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Call%20Board\"&gt;Hero's Call Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe Ride Forth.\nBelieving that Bolvar had fallen to the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Darion attempted to kill him. However, Bolvar forcibly controlled the former's body and made him return to , while taunting him about requiring his fellow horsemen. Though wary of it being a trap, the horsemen agreed to kill the Lich King, and decide who would wield the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; after Bolvar was slain. However, en route to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Four Horsemen, using their connection to the Lich King, discovered him locked in combat with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that this was all part of Bolvar's gambit to have the horsemen arrive and kill the winner of the conflict.\nDarion was outraged at learning this deception, but privately acknowledged that if he knew of the plan, he would fight to have been there when Sylvanas had arrived. Darion and the others were stunned when Sylvanas won and destroyed the helm instead of claiming ownership of it, thereby opening a rift into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. With the Scourge &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;no longer under control&lt;/a&gt;, Darion ordered &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to rescue Bolvar, while he and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; fought to keep Acherus under their control.\nShadowlands.\nInto the Maw.\nFollowing the events at Icecrown Citadel, Darion stepped down as highlord of the Ebon Blade and passed the mantle to Bolvar, now no longer the Lich King. Darion summoned champions of the Alliance and Horde and brought them to Icecrown to meet with Bolvar and the faction leaders and discuss the fate of leaders that had been kidnapped by Sylvanas. At the Frozen Throne, the heroes used the shattered Helm of Domination to open a portal to the Maw. Darion volunteered to lead the Knights of the Ebon Blade that would join the heroes on their mission to rescue the kidnapped leaders. Following a disastrous arrival at the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Crucible of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; where they were quickly attacked by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Darion and the heroes pushed on to &lt;a href=\"Calcis\"&gt;Calcis&lt;/a&gt; where they found &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe group escaped another Mawsworn attack to take up refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Respite\"&gt;Forlorn Respite&lt;/a&gt;, where Jaina and Thrall explained what they knew about the Maw and its ruler, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Darion suggested that they might find a way to escape by interrogating some of the realm's oldest souls. He lent a shard of the Helm of Domination to the heroes and helped them take control of a nearby &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Amalgamation\"&gt;Tormented Amalgamation&lt;/a&gt; and bring it back to the respite. While Jaina, Thrall, and the heroes went in search of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Mograine used the shard's remaining &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; powers to interrogate the amalgamation, eventually forcing it to reveal the existence of a &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;waystone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Zovaal's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, which was also where &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; was being held captive. Jaina, Thrall, Anduin, and the heroes set out to find the waystone, but Darion and his surviving knights remained on guard in the respite since they couldn't abandon the innocent souls trapped in the Maw. Darion asked the heroes to signal the knights when they found the waystone; however, this didn't happen as an attack by the Jailer led to the adventurers being the only ones to make it out of the Maw while the leaders and knights were left behind.\nThe missing baron.\nAn adventurer, now called a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, later returned to the Maw in search of a missing &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; baron. Bolvar\u2014who had traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; directly from Azeroth\u2014stated that he didn't know how to find this baron but instead lent the Maw Walker an &lt;a href=\"%3AAmulet%20of%20the%20Horsemen\"&gt;:Amulet of the Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, an item carried by each of the horsemen that linked them to each other and would allow the hero to locate Darion. The hero freed Mograine from a cage he'd been locked in by &lt;a href=\"Brethlun%20the%20Brand\"&gt;Brethlun the Brand&lt;/a&gt;, after which the two encountered the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;. She offered to help them in exchange for the amulet and revealed that a Maldraxxi baron was being held captive in &lt;a href=\"Perdition%20Hold\"&gt;Perdition Hold&lt;/a&gt;. As the trio traveled there, Darion tried to convince Ve'nari to help them rescue the captive faction leaders as well, but she replied that they were held in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; and that it would be foolish to go after them. In Perdition Hold, the group found the baron, who was revealed to be none other than Darion's father Alexandros. Darion was shocked by this since he had never expected to see his father again and had been so focused on the mission that he'd never considered the possibility of his family's souls being present in the Shadowlands. With Ve'nari's help, the Maw Walker freed Alexandros and brought the Mograines to Oribos. While Alexandros returned to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, Darion stated that he had to return to Azeroth and tell their allies of what they'd learned. However, he also told his father that he would stand by his side once more when he could, and Alexandros promised his son that they would have time to speak again later.\nChains of Domination.\nDarion subsequently took up positions in Oribos with Bolvar and the rest of the Ebon Blade. During &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;:the Battle of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, he led the Ebon Blade in defending the city from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. Mograine and the other horsemen accompanied Bolvar and the heroes of Azeroth during the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;s through the fortress' various levels. After the battle, Darion traveled to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Alexandros. The Mograines discussed Tirion Fordring, with Alexandros questioning why Darion had sought to deny the man his rest by raising him as a horseman. Darion replied \"I once told Tirion that only a silver hand could wield an ebon blade\" and that he'd seemed like the right choice for the fourth horseman. In response, Alexandros lamented that this wasn't the legacy he had meant to leave for his son. Darion replied that Alexandros had taught him to defend what he held most dear, a legacy he was proud to uphold, and his father responded that he was proud of Darion in turn.\nEternity's End.\nDarion accompanied the covenant forces to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar ordered Darion to lead the covenants against the Mawsworn at &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Terra\"&gt;Provis Terra&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;. A Maw Walker later joined him and helped him in the battle until the two heard a disturbance in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Flora\"&gt;Provis Flora&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered that &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the Ebon Blade's ranks and failed to stop the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Kin%27tessa\"&gt;Kin'tessa&lt;/a&gt; from destroying one of the obelisks protecting the Forge. Darion stayed at his position but sent the Maw Walker to report this development to Bolvar.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was freed from the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic, Darion met with Bolvar and the others in the &lt;a href=\"Geometric%20Cavern\"&gt;Geometric Cavern&lt;/a&gt; to discuss how to counter Domination. The &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; suggested they should experiment with the remains of the Helm of Domination, but first they needed to test if it still worked. Darion volunteered as test subject, and the Maw Walker used the helm to turn him aggressive and then defeat him. The Maw Walker later learned that the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; could offer resistance to Domination, and that complex phrases from the language were stored in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker, Darion, Bolvar, and Bolvar's daughter &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; headed there to retrieve them. Darion stayed at the &lt;a href=\"Deserted%20Overlook\"&gt;Deserted Overlook&lt;/a&gt; while the others worked, and when they came back, he informed them that the Primus had sent word telling them to go to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. There memories could be drawn out and expunged, and those who had suffered from Domination in the past could infuse the memories of what had allowed them to resist into the shards of the helm. Darion volunteered for the ritual after Bolvar, drawing out &lt;a href=\"Bloodbound%20Memory\"&gt;Bloodbound Memories&lt;/a&gt; which the Maw Walker defeated, allowing him to imbue his resistance into the helm. Once all the shards were infused, the group traveled to Torghast to meet with the Primus, who used the language and the memories to reforge the Helm of Domination into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument allowing them all to become resistant to Domination.\nAfter the Jailer's defeat, Darion attended &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s trial in Oribos. As they were no longer needed in Oribos, the Knights of Ebon Blade prepared to return to Azeroth, and Darion and Bolvar discussed how the knights needed to continue keeping the rampant Scourge on Azeroth in check. Bolvar suggested that he could return to Icecrown to prevent the citadel from falling into the wrong hands, but Darion disagreed, saying that the Ebon Blade would protect the fortress and that Taelia needed her father.\nQuotes.\nShadowlands.\nDialogue.\nIf the player tries to jump into during this phase, Darion will &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt; them out:"}

A pro-&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; figure, he dissented with King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to separate his people with the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley led the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that caused a civil war in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, during which he was imprisoned. When Gilneas was attacked by &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, he was freed and became a worgen himself. Both Crowley and Greymane reconciled and joined forces against the threats Gilneas faced. He now leads the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; which fights against the Forsaken along with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to assault Azeroth, Darius and his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt; joined Genn on the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of his army forces.\nBiography.\nLord of His Pack.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Crowley was a nobleman whose lands and people were outside of the border that would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. He owned the towns of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being young and new to the Gilnean council of Lords, his humanistic and charismatic qualities made him loved by the Gilnean people and earned him the respect and friendship of the king of Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley was one of the nobles that accompanied Greymane to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; to hear of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s fall and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s warning about the invading &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley was sympathetic to the Alliance's plight and advised Greymane to send aid to the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane agreed out of self-serving reasons but offered only token support.\nYears later, Gilneas seceded from the Alliance following the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the Second War, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. When Genn started the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, a massive barrier that walled off his lands from the rest of Gilneas, Crowley opposed the King's decision to abandon his people. In retaliation for Greymane's decision to abandon the Alliance, it was Crowley that was responsible for sending the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe King had tried to reason with Crowley, to make it clear that this wall was the way forward, and to explain why assisting the Alliance was so wrong. But Crowley refused, and insisted that he was doing what was best for the future of Gilneas, that he would end the King's \"tyranny\", and started a rebellion against Greymane, gathering like-minded Gilneans including his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; in forming the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting civil war weakened the kingdom and split the populace into two groups, \"royalist\" and \"rebel\", labels that continued to spark fights years after the event ended. He was eventually arrested on the grounds of treason and held at &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nShortly before the attack on Gilneas City, Genn was thinking about granting Crowley amnesty.\nWhen the capital of Gilneas was attacked by feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, Crowley was released by Gilnean &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and convinced to give aid to Greymane, who had ordered the evacuation of Gilneas. When he and his released men regrouped, he gave them a speech of a union against the worgen. In order to divert the worgen's attention from the fleeing citizens, Crowley led a group of brave Gilneans to stand against them at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley and his followers were overwhelmed, and &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;became worgen&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt; took &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;, he encountered Darius Crowley, one of many Gilneans that Belysra and her night elves had been trying to help with their worgen affliction. A Loyalist, Halford still thought of Darius as a rebel and a traitor and lunged at him but the fight was broken up by Belysra who reminded them that the past didn't matter anymore and that they both needed to put it behind them in order to preserve the future of Gilneas. Both agreed to put the past behind them and work together to capture feral worgen in the woods of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; and make them sane again and regain their humanity.\nHe worked with the adventurer to retrieve the stolen &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from the hands of the Forsaken. He was worried of how Lorna would react to the news that he had the curse, but she was fine with it (considering that she had thought he had been killed instead). As the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt; went on, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and Lord Godfrey traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; to ask Crowley to help unite Gilneas against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Due to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;'s prejudices towards the worgen, Darius was hesitant to accept. Greymane tells Darius that he is asking as an equal and after revealing that he too had succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;Worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, Darius agreed to join forces. \nHalford Ramsey along with Lord Crowley and his Gilnean worgen followed &lt;a href=\"Belrysa%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belrysa Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; in confronting &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;. Belrysa attempted to use the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to seal away Alpha Prime and his &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, but before she could do so, a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; shot her in the arm. This caused her to drop the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and Alpha Prime signaled for the army of Forsaken to surround them. Alpha Prime took possession of the scythe, but just as he was about to finish Belysra off with it, the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolf&lt;/a&gt; of Belysra's old lover \u2014 \u2014 killed Alpha Prime. With the death of their leader, the Wolf Cult scattered; leaving the Forsaken without their lupine allies and open to attack from the night elves and Gilneans. Shortly afterwards he, Halford and other Gilneans witnessed King Genn Greymane's confession of being afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; to his subjects and the Gilnean people's acceptance of him.\nDarius later participated in &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;The Battle for Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; with Genn and though they were successful in retaking the city, the Forsaken's Horde reinforcements and intent on using the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; forced the Gilneans to flee and seek sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Before the worgen left, he was present at Liam's funeral in &lt;a href=\"Aderic%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Aderic's Repose&lt;/a&gt; and in Keel Harbor he led the organization of defenses against the invading Horde. While most of the worgen left, he and his daughter remained.\nGilneas Liberation Front.\nWith Gilneas now in enemy hands following the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Crowley led the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Worgen\"&gt;Hillsbrad Worgen&lt;/a&gt; bolstering their numbers, and with help from the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who used a submarine to pass through enemy lines, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; gained the upper hand in Gilneas. However, agents of the Horde ended up destroying some of the reinforcements and enabled the Forsaken to resurrect Lord Godfrey as one of their own, a fact that none of the Gilneans were aware of.\nWith Godfrey's help the Forsaken successfully captured Darius's daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley led the Alliance's final push into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself rode out to meet with Darius at the shattered &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and gave him two choices - the surrender of the Gilneas Liberation Front, or Lorna's death and resurrection as one of the Forsaken. Without a moment of hesitation, Darius agreed to surrender the Gilneas City in order to protect his daughter. Sylvanas allowed them to retreat to Gilneas, which was still contested between the Alliance and the Horde.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Darius and his daughter Lorna joined &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\". He is seen standing next to &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Footman%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Gilnean Footmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; led by Genn and Darius' daughter Lorna established &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt; to secure &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; from threats. Darius later made an appearance if an Alliance player reaches Prestige Rank 2, where he is found in Stormwind Keep alongside Princess &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; following the accepting of the quest, &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience\"&gt;A Royal Audience&lt;/a&gt;. He was among the audience that congratulated the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from Anduin Wrynn, as well as an artifact appearance.\nCrowley was later found to have been taken captive by the naga on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; alongside many other warriors. An Alliance warrior freed him, and he aided them in freeing the other warriors from the front. His counterpart for the Horde is &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, unlike Eitrigg who does not have this function, if the warrior frees any Forsaken, Crowley has a chance to run up and instantly kill them. If a pack of warriors is freed and he does this, any worgen freed will also cheer.\nCrowley then joined the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; as one of their followers, which also opened up recruitment for the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;; despite Crowley not being a part of this organization. It's possible this is just due to his place as a leader in the Alliance and prior working with the 7th Legion in Gilneas.

The construct is considered magnificent, sentient, and most importantly... deadly.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"During his reign, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; labored to build a &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; servant that would defend his citadel without fear. When his first attempt failed, rage took hold of the Thunder King. He poured this negative emotion into his next, and most successful, creation: the Dark Animus. To this day, the ornate construct observes its duty, empowered by the mysterious substance at the heart of all mogu &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shaping&lt;/a&gt; experiments.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"The mechanics of the Dark Animus encounter aren't quite like any boss fight we've done before. It centers around a fixed quantity of the mysterious swirling liquid, known as Anima, that is at the heart of the mogu experiments in this wing. The vital fluid animates golems, escaping and moving on to larger and larger constructs as the initial vessels are destroyed, until it eventually amasses enough volume to empower the Dark Animus itself, largest of all the golems. The encounter has a certain puzzle-solving element to it, and players will need to carefully manage how they shift around this finite quantity of Anima or the fight will quickly get out of hand.\"\nStrategy.\n10 man.\nOn 10 man difficulty, to compensate for fewer players, 13 out of 25 Anima Golems will be Critically Damaged, and 3 out of 8 Large Anima Golems will be Critically Damaged. Neither of the two Massive Anima Golems, nor Dark Animus, will be Critically Damaged.\nOn the pull, all of the Anima Golems will have 4/4 Anima and will activate. The general idea is to move this Anima to as few adds as possible before activating the Dark Animus, then defeating it before it reaches 100 Anima (at which point Full Power will wipe the raid).\nDealing with Crimson Wake from the Large Anima Golems is a massive distraction for the raid, so the raid should avoid activating the Large Anima Golems. However, the three Large Anima Golems that are Critically Damaged will not activate, and can be used as Anima batteries.\nWhen the 12 non-damaged Anima Golems activate at the start of the fight, have the tanks pick up two each. All other raid members will pick up one. With the exception of the tanks, care must be taken to keep the Anima Golems apart from each other, as non-tanks will not be able to handle the damage increase from Acceleration Link (though tanks will have little difficulty with this).\nThe two tanks will pick a Critically Damaged Large Anima Golem, drag their adds over there, and have DPS kill them there. Two other pre-assigned raid members will take their adds to the third Critically Damaged Large Anima Golem (separately, because of Acceleration Link), and have DPS kill them there. DPS must take special care not to prematurely kill Anima Golems, otherwise Anima will likely jump to a non-desirable Golem.\nIf this part of the fight is executed correctly, there will be six Anima Golems remaining with 4/4 Anima (as well as the 13 Critically Damaged Anima Golems with 4/4 Anima), and all three Critically Damaged Large Anima Golems will have 8/8 Anima (these Golems will do nothing despite having Anima).\nFor the next step, one of the remaining Anima Golems should be taken over to one of the two Massive Anima Golems, and killed there; this will activate this Massive Anima Golem. One tank needs to pick up the Massive Anima Golem, and tank it in the center of the room. DPS must ignore this add; it must remain alive until the end of the encounter. The second tank will pick up one Anima Golem at a time, and bring it to the activated Massive Anima Golem; DPS will kill it when it is positioned. Healers will need to keep an eye out for Matter Swap on the Massive Anima Golem tank, and dispel it when there are 5 seconds remaining on the debuff (no more, no less). Explosive Slam can be easily moved away from; however, if the tank takes an Explosive Slam, a tank swap is required.\nIf this part of the fight is executed correctly, all Anima Golems that are not Critically Damaged will be dead. The 13 Critically Damaged Anima Golems should still have 4/4 Anima, the Critically Damaged Large Anima Golem should still have 8/8 Anima, and one of the two Massive Anima Golems should have 24/36 Anima (the second Massive Anima Golem should have 0/36 Anima).\nNext, have the Massive Anima Golem tank bring the Golem over to three of the Critically Damaged Anima Golems in succession, and have them killed. Do NOT choose the Critically Damaged Anima Golem that is closest to Dark Animus (this Golem is specifically for activating Dark Animus, and it should be marked before the fight). If executed correctly, three of the Critically Damaged Anima Golems will be removed from the fight, and the Massive Anima Golem will have 36/36 Anima.\nAt this point, there is no further benefit to moving Anima between the adds, so have DPS kill the aforementioned Critically Damaged Anima Golem closest to Dark Animus (note: if there is a risk of the Anima not jumping to Dark Animus, then save one of the mobile Anima Golems to activate Dark Animus, and kill an extra Critically Damaged Anima Golem to push the Massive Anima Golem to 36/36 Anima). The Anima from this Golem should jump to Dark Animus and activate him. If the Massive Anima Golem has 36/36 Anima when Dark Anima is activated, the raid will then have 216 seconds to kill Dark Animus before he siphons 100 Anima. This is a burn phase, so pop all DPS cooldowns and nuke him.\nRaid members affected by Anima Font must take care not to stand near other raid members. For Anima Ring, it is advised that a DPS or healer breaks the ring to allow the Dark Animus tank to escape without receiving the debuff; if the tank does receive the debuff, the tanks will have to swap the Dark Animus and Massive Anima Golem between them. Ranged and healers must simply stop casting when Interrupting Jolt goes off (healers should do their best to top up the raid in preparation).\nWhen Dark Animus reaches 100 Anima, it will then channel FULL POWER which will very quickly wipe the raid (however, players will not be \"immediately\" killed). Raid members should use any damage reduction/immunity effects to try to finish him off.\n25 man.\nAs there are no Critically Damaged Golems in 25 player difficulty, the raid will need to activate both Massive Anima Golems, and have Anima Golems killed near them until both reach 36/36 Anima (this will require exactly 9 Anima Golems per Massive Anima Golem; 18 in total). Once this is achieved, one of the 7 remaining Anima Golems should be brought to Dark Animus and killed there to activate it.\nApart from this difference, proceed as per the 10 man version. Large Anima Golems should still not receive any Anima under any circumstance.\nTwo tanks should still be used\u2014initially one per Massive Anima Golem, thereafter one on Dark Animus and the other handling both Massive Anima Golems. If the damage from two Massive Anima Golems cannot be handled by the tank and healers, consider a third tank.\nHeroic.\nDark Animus now activates immediately and starts with 52 Anima (for a total of 152 Anima distributed throughout the Golems). However, the raid is given a 2 minute grace period before it begins to cast Siphon Anima.\nDark Animus will also periodically cast Empower Golem (typically hitting Massive Golems), putting an extra strain on tank healing.\nAll abilities hit much harder, with Interrupting Jolt hitting for a significant percentage of the raid health. Anima Font will be cast as soon as the encounter begins (as Dark Animus begins with 52 Anima) and can one shot players who stand in it.\nThe Raid should do the same Strategy as Normal mode 90 secs after the encounter begun(since you don't want the massive golems to get empower stacks early) and proceed with it.\nAn alternative strategy consists of just &lt;a href=\"zerg\"&gt;zerg&lt;/a&gt; Dark animus while raid keeps the golems apart and move from anima front without stacking them.But this strategy requieres a huge deal of dps and is hard to perform(since it requieres ppl to still move from anima front and at same time not stack golems,which can be somewhat problematic,specially for 25Man),but is possible for raids Heavy overgearing the encounter.\nSolo.\nStart by popping the orb with a ranged attack, then quickly run behind the boss and stand with the character's back to the wall. If creatures can get behind their target, they will ignore dodge and parry, so prevent this by standing back to the wall.\nPop all cooldowns and spam instants on the boss. High-level characters should be able to dodge and parry the melee swings of the small anima golems, but chracters \"stop dodging and parrying\" while casting any spells with a cast time.\nIn heroic mode, the Dark Animus starts attacking immediately, so focus all attacks on it!\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

As one of their main glyphs, it allows a warlock to indefinitely stay in a demon form and use most of the said abilities, including &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; unlike its more DPS-wise brother. &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Plating\"&gt;Nether Plating&lt;/a&gt; works in this form, the main purpose of this form is mainly for off-tanking in case the tank is killed and the creature is on its last legs but you need a tank. It gives you black and purple demon wings like those in Metamorphosis and once &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Fury\"&gt;Demonic Fury&lt;/a&gt; reaches a certain point it sprouts purple horns as well. Warlocks are incredibly well armored and a warlock using this can pick up the slack left by a dead tank. A skilled warlock who focuses their gear on this ability can tank normal dungeons and, to a limited extent, heroic dungeons as well, however due to the lack of a crit reduction ability, they are not viable for raids.\nSpecifics.\nThis does not increase your DPS so it is useless to use it unless you're off-tanking or leveling by yourself against a powerful creature. This also increases the threat of your abilities so if you use it in an instance it'll pull aggro from the tank, which might warrant a kick from the group. However, it is useful in the fact you don't constantly have to cycle between Metamorphosis and your mortal form when you use &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Leap\"&gt;Demonic Leap&lt;/a&gt; it takes the fury but you're technically already in a demon form so this makes you just fly forward without going into &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;\nIn PvP this is likely very viable with the amount of defense it offers overall, and the utility of the abilities within. Demon leaping past your enemy on a hill, or using &lt;a href=\"Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; on another player to stun them for 8 seconds while you attack the other player. As well as the damage ward and AoE power it offers, it will bring use to warlocks in arenas and such."}

The information is from a Classic realm level 60 point of view and may be neither accurate nor relevant anymore.\"\nThe Dark Coffer is one of the major reasons high-level characters are still raiding &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasically, it is a chest with various valuable items including greens and gems.\nHowever, the main reason to visit the safe is the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Essence%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Burning Essence (quest item)&lt;/a&gt;, which is needed for the +20 Fire Resistance &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Arcanum%20of%20Resilience\"&gt;Libram Enchantment&lt;/a&gt; for your Head/Leg slot as you progress through the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.\nCasters may also want to get the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blood%20of%20the%20Tormented\"&gt;Black Blood of the Tormented&lt;/a&gt;, for the +150 Mana enchantment.\nThe Coffer Run.\nPreparation.\nBefore you head off to BRD you should consider the following:\nGetting to the Dark Coffer Room.\nAfter entering the Blackrock Depths, turn left and have the gate opened either by a rogue or with the Shadowforge Key. Kill or avoid the fire elemental, opening the next gate to the right. Unlock the door and enter the Shadowforge Lock room. Watch out for roaming fire elementals up the stairs. On top of the stairs run straight forward and enter the top level of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths%20regions%23Ring_of_the_Law\"&gt;the arena&lt;/a&gt;. With the arena event uncompleted, all spectators will aggro. However, they can be avoided by hugging the inner ledge while crossing the room. Tauren can also try to step upon the ledge to gain even more distance to the spectators.\nOnce on the other side, fight to the Coffer Room. Turn left and fight to the large Bridge (watch out for the \"ambush event\") and enter the Domicile. One can try to cross the room to the set of stairs to the left side in the back of the room without aggoing any mobs on the way, but most suggest taking the groups out regularly. Fight through the Domicile to a round-shaped room on a semi-circular ledge. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; is below. The Dark Coffer room is beyond the next entrance along the ledge.\nGo inside the room and clear any mobs. In the back is the Dark Coffer at the center of the wall (along with numerous &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Coffer%20Door\"&gt;Relic Coffers&lt;/a&gt;, openable for minor loot using &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Coffer%20Key\"&gt;Relic Coffer Key&lt;/a&gt;s). Be careful though, since the 4 golems will come to life and attack once all Relic Coffers are open.\nSo where is the Key ?\nIf you have come so far, you will stand in front of the Dark Coffer and have no idea of how to open it.\nThe key is held by a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper\"&gt;Dark Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found inside the instance. However, he only spawns after you examine the picture which is located inside the Coffer Room (really hard to miss).\nDark Keeper Locations.\nOnce you examine the picture a Dark Keeper will spawn at a location which is pointed out within the text. However, the hints given are not very helpful for people who don't know the Blackrock Depths that well, so here are the different locations of the possible Keeper spawns:\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper%20Bethek\"&gt;Dark Keeper Bethek&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper%20Ofgut\"&gt;Dark Keeper Ofgut&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper%20Pelver\"&gt;Dark Keeper Pelver&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper%20Uggel\"&gt;Dark Keeper Uggel&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper%20Vorfalk\"&gt;Dark Keeper Vorfalk&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Keeper%20Zimrel\"&gt;Dark Keeper Zimrel&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Dark Coffer Loot.\nDark Coffer Loot table http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/object.html?wobject=322#Known_Drops\nOnce you have killed the Keeper, loot the Key and return to the Coffer Room to open the Dark Coffer. One of the most desirable items the coffer has been found to contain is one or two &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Essence%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Burning Essence (quest item)&lt;/a&gt;."}

When &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; rallied the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the arakkoa decided to strike against him. However, Gul'dan - having been taught the secrets of the arcane by the eredar lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; - unleashed powerful magics against the arakkoa, destroying their encampments. Gul'dan's powerful spells made the Dark Conclave arakkoa into ghosts, left to wander throughout their ruined encampments.\nDespite Gul'dan's spellwork, Dark Conclave agents continue with their plans to this day. At the Sketh'lon Base Camp east of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, they are attempting to summon a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20and%20powerful%20evil\"&gt;powerful being&lt;/a&gt; of death and destruction, believed to have been a last ditch effort to oppose Gul'dan. However, Gul'dan's spellwork augmented the powers that would allow them to summon this creature - whose appearance is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; - into Outland. &lt;a href=\"Parshah\"&gt;Parshah&lt;/a&gt;, an arakkoa who deserted the Conclave, is attempting to gather powerful magic items in order to disrupt the Conclave's summoning.\nOne of the lords of the Dark Conclave was the arakkoa known as &lt;a href=\"Asghar\"&gt;Asghar&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were marshaled by &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and ruled by the self-styled Warchief &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the orcs of Thrall's Horde, they remained steadfast to the ideals of the old Horde and embraced the demonic bloodlust.\nHistory.\nDefeat of the Blackrock clan.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; was the base of operations of the old Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was captured and sent to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; as a prisoner, and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; was defeated. The survivors fled to their last bastion of hope, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and there they fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, some warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ultimately destroyed the Burning Blade clan, and the Blackrock clan and the warriors from the Dragonmaw clan were defeated and imprisoned. Although some Dragonmaw warriors died at the Dark Portal defense, most of that clan was still at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, fled to find sanctuary within the mountainous stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that Rend declared himself &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the weakened &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, slowly rebuilding his forces with whatever orcs had survived and could make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the foundation of Dark Horde. The Blackrock orcs struck a bargain with the local &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves descended even deeper into the mountain, while the orcs occupied the higher levels. However, the bargain was never intended to be kept.\nTwo years later after the Second War, when the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, an expedition of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; and orc chieftains reached Blackrock to parlay with Rend and Maim, trying to get them back under &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership. The expedition was mostly interested in the Dark Horde's &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, but any help was refused by Warchief Rend, who wanted the Horde of Draenor to fail so he could gather all its survivors to him and start another war of conquest on the Alliance. The &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; then offered the help of his own flight to &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, and the Aspect then ordered his son &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; to make his home in the upper reaches of Blackrock Mountain and make this Dark Horde his personal army.\nConflict arose in Blackrock Spire between the Blackrock clan and the Dark Iron dwarves that led to many Blackrock orc casualties. They managed to displace the dwarves in the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;upper portions of the mountain&lt;/a&gt;, but only after the death of Maim.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn%20tribe\"&gt;Smolderthorn tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firetree%20tribe\"&gt;Firetree tribe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spirestone%20clan\"&gt;Spirestone clan&lt;/a&gt; retained their alliances with the Blackrock clan.\nAfter the destruction of the second &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, there was only one clan that was large and strong enough to disrupt the peace in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; and located in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. They held control over the Dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; by using the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros planned to reunite the falling Horde, unleash the red dragons over the Alliance, and continue the conquest of Azeroth. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, aided with dwarven resistance fighters, destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; and set Alexstrasza free. Alexstrasza was full of vengeance and incinerated Nekros and most of the Dragonmaw clan. The few survivors were rounded up and thrown into the internment camps.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; has taken control of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and has made the Dark Horde as his pawns.

Nefarian and his brood are at work creating a &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;Chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; with the powers of all the flights to release on the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and eventually the races of Azeroth. They still practice demonic magic and their &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s can summon demons to help them in battle. Also, they have contracted some &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries and train &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s for war.\nApparently, the &lt;a href=\"Firegut\"&gt;Firegut&lt;/a&gt; ogres and the Dark Horde have made an alliance, as the ogres keep the mineral-rich &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Rock\"&gt;Dreadmaul Rock&lt;/a&gt; guarded and kept the supply lines open at all times.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaws&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; apparently escaped the internment camps and are now led by Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, now they've regained strength, and have an encampment northeast of &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.

They may have joined the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Assassin%20%28Northern%20Barrens%29\"&gt;Kor'kron Assassins&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\n&lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, is in charge of the Dark Horde. He calls himself &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, and all the other members of the Dark Horde address him as such. The true ruler of Blackrock Spire is &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; the black dragon. All Dragonmaw orcs belong to Rend's force; their clan leader, Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Nek%27rosh%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nek'rosh Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, leads one band far to the north, in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Compendium/Forest%20Troll%20Tribes\"&gt;Troll Compendium - Forest Troll Tribes&lt;/a&gt;:\nMilitary tactics.\nThe remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans, along with their &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; allies, form a brutal though small force. They are outnumbered in a hostile land, these &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies have developed more sophisticated tactics than those they used in the past. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;original Horde&lt;/a&gt; that came from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; had the benefit of large numbers; it appeared that for every orc that fell, ten more came to take his place. Now, these renegades temper their chaotic, bloodthirsty natures with caution, as they no longer have the forces to support reckless charges.\nThe Dark Horde uses the terrain around &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to its advantage. Orc and goblin lookouts hide behind carefully stacked rockfalls they can trigger in an instant, burying enemies on the path below. The renegades engage enemies in bottlenecks, where a pack of ogres or forest trolls make short work of assailants forced to approach one at a time. The renegades also know the best ambush sites on the Spire, where they throw rocks and fire missile weapons at enemies in shallow canyons.\nWhen engaging enemies outside their territory, these renegades prefer to scout the land and pick defensible positions before attacking. The orcs try to have one or two locations to which they retreat when hard-pressed, usually rocky terrain with plenty of cover or thick forest (unless they are fighting &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;). The warriors attempt to lure their foes into unfamiliar ground where, if the orcs have no advantage, at least neither does the opposition.\nThe Dark Horde places its toughest warriors, usually ogres, in the front ranks, keeping weaker fighters in the back with ranged weapons and healing magic. In rare cases, the strongest orc leaders might appear mounted on the backs of &lt;a href=\"black%20drake\"&gt;black drake&lt;/a&gt;s, but such a sight is never seen outside Blackrock Spire. The melee fighters use intelligent tactics in battle, however, after a few attacks the bloodlust can take over the orc. Warriors lose control and lash out wildly at their opponents. Instead of using multiple attacks on one enemy, an orc may swing once at every enemy in range. These renegades train themselves to focus their attacks on the strongest enemy they can see until he falls, but in the heat of combat they often forget such training and may chase weakened stragglers across the battlefield.\nTwo types of spellcasters support the renegades. First, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s call down annihilating magical barrages and summon fiendish monstrosities. Second, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s, usually &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, assist the troops with healing magic and defensive spells. Orc warlocks who serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; also assist them.\nMembers and allies of the Dark Horde.\nMembership.\n &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; - Orcs make up the majority of the Dark Horde.\n &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; - Many ogres decided to stay under the leadership of the son of Blackhand.\n &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;Forest troll&lt;/a&gt; - A few forest trolls intend to honor the pact the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; made with the forest trolls and continue to follow what they see as the true Horde.\n &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; - The Dark Horde has hired many goblins to assist them in assassination and forging.\n &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s - Many members of the Dark Horde practice demon worship and summon &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s to their aid.\nAllies.\n &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; - led by &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, in truth they are controlling the Dark Horde.\n &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Ritualist%20Tarak\"&gt;Ritualist Tarak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;\nCommand structure.\n &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Tooth Grin clan was almost destroyed. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; was over. However, &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; survived and slipped into the shadows.\nThey became a beacon for orcs who longed for the old days, and soon, their ranks began to swell again. They are fighting a war which they are unaware ended some time ago.\nOrc warlocks and other clans that refuse &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership are strongest in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoundation of the Dark Horde.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, serving as dual chieftains over the defeated Black Tooth Grin clan and the weakened Blackrock clan, apparently rescued some of their warriors from the prison camps, set up a base in Blackrock Spire, and formed the Dark Horde. The &lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn%20tribe\"&gt;Smolderthorn tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firetree%20tribe\"&gt;Firetree tribe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spirestone\"&gt;Spirestone&lt;/a&gt; clan retained their alliances with the Blackrock clan. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; was loyal to &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; before his death, and when he was killed they pledged their loyalty to his sons; thus they remained with them as well.\nRend Blackhand returned from the shadows and took full control of the Blackrock clan after the death of Orgrim Doomhammer.\nThey were in constant war with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; parties and &lt;a href=\"Firegut\"&gt;Firegut&lt;/a&gt; ogres. Eventually, Dark Iron dwarves from Blackrock Depths tried to destroy the Dark Horde. The Dark Horde fought back, and Maim was killed in savage battle. His sacrifice, plus Rend's \"alliance\" with the black dragonflight, allowed them to drive back the Dark Irons and maintain their hold on Blackrock Spire. Apparently Firegut ogres were enemies of the Dark Horde as they were unwilling to accept non-ogre allies.\nThey allied with the &lt;a href=\"Torchbelcher\"&gt;Torchbelcher&lt;/a&gt; tribe and the Torchbelcher provide them with warriors and mages. It's rumored that Rend is willing to allow &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to join him.\n&lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his orcs had several encampments in the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the mountain as their own, but refusing entering in the depths of it. They prefer to stay near the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow the Dark Horde is barricaded inside Blackrock spire under &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s command. They are as bloodthirsty and savage as the Horde of old and are as barbaric as the orcs from the First and Second Wars.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; would have eliminated this renegade group if it wasn't for &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, because the big black dragon is protecting them.\nAllegiance with the Forsaken.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron happily aid the Dark Horde in the area. They don't care whether the orcs are evil or not; it's actually easier for them if their allies are evil. Recently the Dark Horde may no longer accept assistance from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Horde may have started attacking them because they \"support Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" which they believe is not the real Horde.\nNotes.\nSkin color.\nUnlike other orcs, the skin tone of some of the orcs within the Dark Horde is a dull gray rather than green. ' revealed that this skintone is a result of the clan living inside of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; without sunlight for years.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", the orcs of the Blackrock clan are shown to have gray skin. It seems that the clan has had the gray skintone since long before the invasion of Azeroth and the drinking of Mannoroth's blood. However, since the gray skintone has never been shown until \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", and they were previously depicted as green as the other orc clans, it's possible that this has been &lt;a href=\"Retcon\"&gt;retconned&lt;/a&gt; already."}

It can be forged only in the hottest of environments, and only when such places are uncorrupted by magic. The deep-dwelling dwarves of Blackrock Mountain employ a forge constructed directly into a river of molten lava, the only place they could find that could generate the required amount of consistent heat. There are also rumors that a similar forge exists in the heart of the Elemental Plane, where dark iron is much more common. A journey to this site would not be for the faint of heart. Dark iron is inherently sensitive to magic. If corrupted by incorrectly cast spells, it fractures into useless powder. Magical enhancements can be added to dark iron arms and armor only as the newly forged item cools to just the right temperature and consistency. Once the item is complete, no further enhancements or enchantments can be added. Such attempts simply fail, wasting any ingredients used in the attempt. For obvious reasons, magic dark iron items must be created at the time they are forged. Items made of dark iron are a shadowy gray color. They appear more like charcoal than metal, and if struck give a flat, dull tone instead of a metallic clang. Although they have a fragile appearance, dark iron items are exceptionally tough and resilient in battle."}

Another pair of doors are located at the northeastern end of the road, with the East and West Garrisons overlooking the approach to those doors. The eastern door of this pair is slightly ajar when players first enter the instance. That position allow the players to pass through the doors and access &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt; and specifically the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; via the road.

To travel from the &lt;a href=\"East%20Garrison\"&gt;East Garrison&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Garrison\"&gt;West Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, the players must first close the eastern door by activating a &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Lock\"&gt;mechanism&lt;/a&gt; located in the East Garrison. Closing the door brings the passages inside the doors into alignment. There is no known way to reopen either door once the mechanism is activated."}

The card has a scratch-off code which is used to obtain the item. Originally, a given code would only give you one turtle on one character on one server, so you wouldn't get it on all your characters (unlike the collector's edition &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s).\nThe Saltwater Snapjaw card comes in both loot and ordinary forms; only the loot version has the scratch off code. The card is apparently extremely rare and sells for as much as several hundred dollars on eBay. The initial printing of the card game sold out almost immediately, making these cards even rarer.\nThe Riding Turtle was originally simply for looks. While mounted on the turtle you move at normal running speed, though you are actually mounted so effects that affect run speed do not operate but effects that affect mount speed do. When the &lt;a href=\"aquatic%20mount\"&gt;aquatic mount&lt;/a&gt; system was added in with the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Turtle%20%28mount%29\"&gt;Sea Turtle (mount)&lt;/a&gt;, that was likely when the Riding Turtle also became an aquatic mount.\nThe mount can also be acquired through the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Riding%20Turtle\"&gt;Lucky Riding Turtle&lt;/a&gt;, an Asian promotional item.\nIcon description.\n\"Summons and dismisses a rideable turtle.

After 2.0.x patch it was made into an Epic (purple) item. The effect of the item was not changed, but you no longer have to worry as much about accidentally deleting it as it is now protected by the item deletion confirmation prompt.\nSaltwater Snapjaw.\nBesides being a potential loot card, the Saltwater Snapjaw card is also useful in the card game. Its ability to prevent all damage to it this turn for a cost of 3 can make it difficult to kill. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//warcraftcardgame.com/cards/Saltwater-Snapjaw/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"}

They carry a long rifle against their shoulder and scowls on their faces.\nA rifleman's tactics are fairly basic; find a nice corner from which he can survey as much of the surrounding area without being spotted as possible, plot an escape route, and wait for his target to walk into his sights.

Yet, as new threats arose to threaten their hard-won freedom, they offered their expert skills and tenacity to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Using the legendary single-shot Blunderbuss Long Rifles, riflemen are excellent marksmen and can shoot both land based and airborne opponents.\nInformation.\nThe Rifleman is a ground ranged unit that works especially well in team battles due to their fairly decent stats and relatively cheap cost. Compared to the higher damage from &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Fiend%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s, Riflemen possess just slightly lower health than Crypt Fiends, and their attack is instant-based; meaning the projectile does not need to travel to hit enemies, whereas the slow arc of a projectile can give an enemy unit or hero enough time to survive.\nIn order to train Riflemen, a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; must be built. Riflemen are extremely effective against Light and Unarmored units due to the bonus damage they inflict on them. Riflemen work especially well with a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; because he can both heal and provide them with a defensive aura to prolong their survival, or with a &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt; to target specific units.\nRiflemen possess Normal Armor, so if they are being attacked by a unit with Normal damage, immediately move them away until the enemy stops trying to attack them.\nIf planning to use Riflemen for the majority of your game, research Long Rifles to give the Riflemen more range to their attacks. \nManual description.\nThe manual differs from the Battle.net version in just a sentence. While the manual says: \"\"...protected their mountain kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; ever since the battle of Grim Batol.\"\", Battle.net says: \"...protected their mountain kingdom of Khaz Modan for hundreds of years.\"."}

The Well pierced the planet's molten core just before being utterly obliterated.\nAs it was driven downward into the sea, the Well of Eternity continued to collapse in on itself and was finally obliterated. Its violent destruction has left behind a deep trench on the ocean floor that reaches all the way to the planet's core. To this day that core remains exposed and heats the ocean's cold waters. The magical energies that still emanate from the trench have caused monstrous mutations in all nearby living things.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Rift is all that remains of the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; which itself is located underneath and in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the powers released in the Well of Eternity blasted the well downward, smashing through seawater and rock, driving it into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s molten core. Ten thousand years later, that core is still exposed. The well's descent broke an enormous fissure in the ocean floor, and red and orange light from lava is visible deep, deep down. Although there is an incredibly high pressure, &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; are capable of swimming in it with just few problems. The Well's descent also destabilized the seafloor for miles around, causing the thermal activity that characterizes the region to this day. If not for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, this area of the sea would be chill, perhaps freezing. But now, even near the surface, is pleasantly warm, increasing to uncomfortable, dangerous, and even lethal heat in places.\n&lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; was constructed on the sides of the Rift. Although &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; could not go too far down into the Rift due to the pressure, he said that \"\"Perhaps the Well of Eternity still exists, in some form, in Azeroth's heart, for &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; currents emanate from the Rift.\"\"\nSpeculation.\nIn \"\", the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; may be directly related to the energies emitted by the Rift, and may or may not be at a depth that is inside of the Rift itself.

The druids also believe that it bleeds into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Players enter the rift through a vision of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt; in the Emerald Dream's &lt;a href=\"Moonglade%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nStormrage.\nGazing into it, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; saw it as a bottomless chasm which radiated with primeval energies that even he dared not investigate. Indeed, the very rift itself seemed half-dreamed, for it had a surreal quality to its expanse and to the archdruid now and then seemed to ripple as if ready to fade or change.\nCuriously, only then did Malfurion truly sense that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;ancient evil&lt;/a&gt;, though it fought to keep its grip there, did so from somewhere deep in the depths of Azeroth's own seas.\nMalfurion and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; cleansed the Emerald Dream everywhere, except in the rift where the Nightmare stubbornly held firm. There was no point to keep pushing, as the people of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; still needed the couple's help. Thus, Malfurion sealed off the vicinity around the rift, he and Tyrande silently agreeing that the day had been saved, and this was another war that would have to wait for a better time. &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit was also sealed inside the Rift of Aln.\nDuring the events on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Nightmare stirred in the Rift of Aln, perhaps seeking a new Nightmare Lord.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; held a fragment of power from the Rift of Aln, and the revelation disturbed Malfurion greatly. Believing it to be , he set off for &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, where he was first trained as a druid.\nLegion.\nIn order to rescue the demigod &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; stepped through a portal to the Rift of Aln that lay abandoned in a dark corner of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;. They stepped into a recreation of Malorne's &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Nightmare\"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. They helped Malorne relive his fatal encounter with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and saved him from the Nightmare's grasp.\nLater, during the &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s' assault on the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; followed &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; into the Rift of Aln, where he was defeated."}

When cast on a friendly target, it randomly selects up to three enemies attacking that target and casts the Righteous Defense taunt on them.\nNotes.\nLike a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Taunt%20%28warrior%20ability%29\"&gt;Taunt (warrior ability)&lt;/a&gt;, this effect not only forces the enemies to attack the Paladin for 3 seconds, but also brings the Paladin's threat up to that of the rescued target's, allowing the Paladin to hold aggro if he or she continues attacking. If 1, 2, or 3 enemies are attacking the target, Righteous Defense will taunt them all. If 4 or more enemies are attacking the target, it will taunt 3 of them at random.\nAgain like a Warrior's Taunt, Righteous Defense can also be cast on an enemy mob, and will have the same effect as if cast on a party member: if the enemy that is taunted is attacking another player, up to three enemies that are attacking that player will be taunted - but not necessarily the one initially targeted. If the enemy is already targeting the Paladin, or not targeting anything, the spell will not be cast or trigger its cool-down.\nAs of Patch 3.0.8, the addition of &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; has made Righteous Defense as a single-target taunt somewhat obsolete, as Hand of Reckoning not only taunts but also generates additional threat. Unlike Righteous Defense, Hand of Reckoning is also usable on mobs that are not targeting anyone (or are targeting the Paladin, although with no effect). Righteous Defense is nevertheless a very powerful taunt, and you should not hesitate to use it if others pull aggro.\nTips and tricks.\nBased off testing on &lt;a href=\"Growl\"&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Command\"&gt;Dark Command&lt;/a&gt; post &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, Righteous Defense no longer suffers from miss chance against level ?? raid bosses. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; it had a 17% chance to miss, well above the melee hit cap of 8%. &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Righteous%20Defense\"&gt;Glyph of Righteous Defense&lt;/a&gt; could help to cover this (removed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;). Since failing to taunt on some bosses can result in deaths or even a wipe (especially when tanks need to alternate aggro), this glyph was indispensable.\nRighteous Defense's inability to be cast on oneself can be useful. Righteous Defense can be pressed repeatedly while targeting a mob without fear of wasting its cool-down. If it is cast, then it must have found a target other than the Paladin to taunt off of.\nWith the help of certain add-ons, Righteous Defense can be used to pull mobs off of allies faster than most other tanks are capable of, particularly when multiple mobs are involved. Some &lt;a href=\"UI\"&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt;'s, such as &lt;a href=\"Grid\"&gt;Grid&lt;/a&gt;, will mark party or raid members that currently have aggro from a mob. Using a macro or a click-to-cast add-on such as &lt;a href=\"Clique\"&gt;Clique&lt;/a&gt;, one can pull enemies back simply by clicking on a player's name, without having to target the player or the mob(s) in question.\nUseful macros.\nUsing a macro, Righteous Defense can be cast on a target underneath the mouse. This is useful if the Paladin wishes to taunt enemies without needing or wanting to switch targets:\n #showtooltip\n /cast [@mouseover] Righteous Defense"}

If any fungal creature stands in Creeping Moss it receives healing, so keep the boss and adds out of it.\nOnce you have picked up the flamethrower you gain a heat gauge and an &lt;a href=\"ExtraActionButton1\"&gt;ExtraActionButton1&lt;/a&gt; which \"toggles\" the flamethrower. If you leave the flamethrower on long enough to max out the heat gauge it overheats and becomes unusable for 10 seconds. Never ever allow this to happen. The flames from the flamethrower are emitted in the direction of the player's movement, so \"strafing\" does not have the effect you would hope. Just imagine you're mowing a lawn.\nUsing the flamethrower gives the player stacks which increase critical strike chance, multistrike chance, and haste. The buff stack erodes by one each 3 seconds.\nCurrent strategy is to let a character with improved speed (like a cat-form druid) wield the flamethrower. Burn away the Creeping Moss until your heat gauge exceeds 3/4, then deactivate the flamethrower. Switch back to DPSing the boss or adds (aided by your Burning Infusion stacks) until your heat is down to 1/10 and find another strip of Creeping Moss to burn away till your heat gets high. The realities of the battle will probably force you to use your flamethrower at other times.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Gryphon Riders possess even more damage and health than Wind Riders, and as magic damage is effective against heavy and light, it makes them effective in taking down units of these armor types. They can deal splash damage against nearby enemies, which is further bolstered with Storm Hammers.\nGryphon Riders should be accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Flying Machines&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonhawk Riders&lt;/a&gt;, depending on what you are facing. Both units have their advantages and disadvantages. Flying Machines rely on sheer numbers for reliability, whereas Dragonhawk Riders are bulkier and can remove some threats to the Gryphon Riders. Regardless, it's important to protect the Gryphon Riders from any easy-to-mass anti-air fliers such as Flying Machines, &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryphs&lt;/a&gt;, who can easily overwhelm Gryphon Riders with sheer numbers.\nLike most late-access human units, Gryphon Riders have \"hybrid\" research; rather than relying on melee or ranged upgrades completely, they use both; melee weapons and ranged armor research. As they require full access to the tech tree in order to be unlocked, coupled with their high cost, it's important to tech quickly and get an expansion or two running to offset their costs.\nSpells and abilities.\nStorm ammers (Passive).\nNotes:\nBattle.net description.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;wild dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peaks\"&gt;Aerie Peaks&lt;/a&gt; have once again responded to the call and brought their mighty &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s to aid the besieged &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in its time of need.

Later the functionalities of the building were extended to also include &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;thalassian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst War.\nAt the times of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, gryphons were uncommon but, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; still trained and loaned some out. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; had converted one of its towers to an aviary, though according to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; it was precisely the wrong spot for such a place because of bad crosswind.\nSecond War.\nAn homage to the legendary beasts housed within, the colossal aspect of the gryphon aviary loomed over all that it surveyed. Hewn from solid rock by the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, their aviary inspired dread in the hearts of whomsoever these &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;gryphon riders&lt;/a&gt; called foe. Deep inside these massive structures were the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; aeries and the dwarven workshops where saddle and harness were crafted.\nMost sacred to the dwarves was the enchanted forge that lied at the heart of each aviary. It was here that the magical weapons known as &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s were fashioned. A stormhammer, when thrown, stroke with the fury of lightning and the force of thunder. This destructive weapon, combined with the indomitable spirit of the gryphon riders, justified their position as masters of the skies.\nThird War.\nThe greatest achievement to come from the alliance of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s is quite possibly the taming and training of the mighty, noble &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. Following years of failed attempts, dwarven riders finally succeeded in gaining the trust of the aloof gryphons. Together with the humans, dwarven riders gave the greatest care, providing lodgings that would most closely resemble the gryphons' aeries among &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peaks\"&gt;Aerie Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh elven and blood elven aviaries.\nThe Aviary helped the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in ' by serving as a point for training units. However, the Aviary couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;high elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of The Frozen Throne expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe aviary also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in The Frozen Throne. This aviary produced unique blood elven-only units.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; is the refuge of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s. It is home to the aeries where the dragonhawks and &lt;a href=\"giant%20eagle\"&gt;giant eagle&lt;/a&gt;s originated and are bred for the elite &lt;a href=\"windrider\"&gt;windrider&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Aquel%27Luer%27Thala\"&gt;Aquel'Luer'Thala&lt;/a&gt; is the blood elf in charge of the units stationed on the island.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nOne gryphon aviary is still left standing: the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. As indicated by the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix-Hawk%20Hatchling\"&gt;Phoenix-Hawk Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; are still breeding &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s but no building dedicated to this task can be seen in-game.\nOther places also have generic aviaries, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Roost\"&gt;Gryphon Roost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aviary\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; who is dedicated to raising &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; has been seen capturing &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Aerie\"&gt;Twilight Aerie&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"People%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;People of the Sky&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; train &lt;a href=\"hawk\"&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Aerie\"&gt;Secret Aerie&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Splinterbark%20Roost\"&gt;Splinterbark Roost&lt;/a&gt; is a wild gryphon roost in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", one scene would have had &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; interacting with &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; dwarves near an aviary northeast of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall himself had to transform into a dwarf in order to not be attacked.\nA &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt; were nearby, and the aviary contained a forge and a harnesses and shields workshop as well as a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; roost."}

{"id": "68195", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=68195", "title": "Gryphon rider", "text": "Gryphon riders (also spelled gryphonrider and gryphon-riders) are &lt;a href=\"windrider\"&gt;windrider&lt;/a&gt;s who serve as air support in the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s nations. Most of them are &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, known to wield deadly &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s and to have a special bond with their &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; mounts, but recently &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s alike have started deploying gryphon riders of their own.\nA group of gryphon riders is called a gryphon wing. They are often under the guidance of a wing commander, which is sometimes stationed on the ground near their target area.\nGryphon riders typically need an harness to properly control their mount. A saddle is preferred though optional, as some dwarves are known to ride without.\nFirst War.\nAt the times of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, dwarves had trained and loaned out two gryphons to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who himself expertly used the beasts in his Guardian duties. A dwarven gryphon rider was also known to reach the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; twice a week to act as a courier between the mage and the outside world.\nDuring the assault against Karazhan, no less than six flights of gryphon riders departed from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, among which were &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and some of his men. Khadgar was unaware that there were this many trained gryphons in the world, much less Stormwind, and surmised that Lothar had talked with the dwarves.\nSecond War.\nFrom the ominous and foreboding peaks of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; came the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; gryphon riders. Mounted upon their legendary beasts and wielding the mystic &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s forged deep within the secret chambers of their &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Aviary%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;aviaries&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;feral dwarves&lt;/a&gt; feared no enemy - and relied upon no friend. They had allied themselves only with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, distrusting both their &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarven cousins&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s alike. When the call to battle was sounded, however, they could be counted upon to fight alongside any who opposed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThe daring &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; had responded once again to the call and brought the mighty &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peaks\"&gt;Aerie Peaks&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in its time of need. Armed with their trusty, lightning-powered &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s, the fearless wilddwarves sought to keep the skies of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; free from enemy forces. The proud gryphons shared their riders' implacable resolve and stood as noble symbols of the Alliance's fortitude.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThough gryphon rider characters already existed in the original release of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", it is only with the \"\" expansion pack that &lt;a href=\"flying%20mount\"&gt;flying mount&lt;/a&gt;s and the mechanics for flying &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s were added. Special town &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s able to counter flying &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s also had to be created. In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, all of the Alliance villages were protected by the same &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20Guard\"&gt;Gryphon Rider Guard&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Roughnecks\"&gt;Roughnecks&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; gryphon tamers and riders on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; that are taught and led by &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Tak\"&gt;Boss Tak&lt;/a&gt;, a Wildhammer dwarf. The Roughnecks provide all gryphon mounts for Kul Tiras.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; gryphon riders patrolled &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nGryphon riders are the air power of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the men who fly through the air and risk their lives in an aerial blitzkrieg. To a man (or woman), they describe their job as the most exhilarating in the Alliance. Wearing a breastplate and a jaunty leather cap, the stout, friendly &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarf&lt;/a&gt; stays close to his steed. In combat, the gryphon rider's tactics are surprisingly similar to those of normal cavalry; they charge in, strike a blow, and get out before the opponent can launch a counterattack. As one gryphon rider puts it: \"If they've got no spellcasters or missile troops, battle's a picnic.\" They usually use an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon, and they are never without their &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGryphon riders are usually of the &lt;a href=\"windrider\"&gt;windrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"windwarrior\"&gt;windwarrior&lt;/a&gt; classes."}

{"id": "16380", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16380", "title": "Guard", "text": "A guard is a type of &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; that protects &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"City\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;, and certain roads within their territory. Most guards in major cities will answer questions about the city they protect if interacted with, guiding &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s to various useful locations. While guards will sometimes attack nearby &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, their true function is to guard against players of the opposing &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, or in some cases to attack any player tagged for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuards in levelling areas are often several levels higher than other NPCs in the area, and are usually far stronger than player characters questing at that level, allowing them to defeat most attackers easily. Guards in critical levelling points such as the &lt;a href=\"starting%20area\"&gt;starting area&lt;/a&gt;s are usually at or above &lt;a href=\"max%20level\"&gt;max level&lt;/a&gt;, giving them an insurmountable advantage over levelling players. Despite this, guards are usually vulnerable to attacks from max level players, whose high level and superior gear can allow them to defeat even groups of guards with ease.\nGuards may be stationary or patrolling, and will respawn faster than most NPCs if killed. Guards can also be spawned through NPCs sighting enemy players. Guards on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20server\"&gt;PvP server&lt;/a&gt;s are weaker than those on &lt;a href=\"PvE%20server\"&gt;PvE server&lt;/a&gt;s and take longer to respawn, since players on these servers are typically more open to cross-faction combat.\nEach faction with a capital city has a race-specific guard. Major cities each have three elite named guards, except the cities introduced in \"\": &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, each race has a different kind of guard.\nCombat.\nFrom a &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; perspective, guards defend their posts against a range of threats, from &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; warriors, and generally serve to keep the peace in the towns and cities. As far as gameplay is concerned, most guards serve a much simpler purpose: to attack players of the enemy faction on sight.\nGuards are permanently tagged for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat and will automatically attack players of the enemy faction as soon as they come in range, \"regardless\" of whether PvP is enabled on the player, or the type of &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;. Attacking a guard (as with any enemy &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;) automatically tags a player for PvP combat. The \"Territory is under attack!\" message will appear in the enemy faction's Local Defense chat box. \nBecause of their level advantage, guards usually do a decent job of preventing &lt;a href=\"griefer\"&gt;griefer&lt;/a&gt;s from killing questgivers and other critical NPCs. However, max level players can still dispatch most guards with ease. Killing guards does not count as an &lt;a href=\"Honorable%20Kill\"&gt;Honorable Kill&lt;/a&gt; or award any &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;, making attacking guards pointless for most purposes. Guards do serve as valid combat targets for players assaulting enemy cities and faction leaders, although such groups usually use &lt;a href=\"flying%20mount\"&gt;flying mount&lt;/a&gt;s to circumnavigate most guards.\nGuards also at times attack hostile &lt;a href=\"creature\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;s that come nearby. This can sometimes be used to the player's advantage, such as running towards guards when a mob is about to kill the player. However, mobs killed by guards will not award experience or loot to the player, even if the guard's contribution was unnecessary or unwanted; players should therefore fight away from friendly guards if possible, unless in need of assistance. Note also that the behaviour of guards towards mobs is unpredictable, and relying on their help can sometimes result in the player dying to a mob well within town walls, while the nearby guards stare happily on.\nIf a player gets close to an NPC in an opposing faction's town the NPC will often call out for help, which will spawn 1-3 guards immediately. The spawned guards' levels are often higher than that of the other normal guards that are there by default. The extra spawned guards disappear after some time.\nNeutral guards.\nGuards in &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; towns like &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; serve neither Alliance nor Horde, but are interested only in settling fights and keeping the peace - which they aim to achieve through killing any PvP-flagged player that comes within range. These guards will happily assault both attacker and victim alike, regardless of which player started the fight; the only protection against this is to take great care not to use any hostile ability or deal any damage to the attacker. Note that certain defensive abilities have built-in damage-dealing components, making this easier said than done.\nAlliance.\nStormwind (Human).\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Patroller\"&gt;Stormwind City Patroller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28Guard%29\"&gt;Officer&lt;/a&gt; (Stormwind Elite), &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defender\"&gt;Stromgarde Defender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt;\nNorthshire, Goldshire, Lakeshire, Nijel's Point, Southshore (wears town tabard)\nDarkshire (&lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;), Hillsbrad (&lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Footman\"&gt;Hillsbrad Footman&lt;/a&gt;), Sentinel Hill (&lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;), Refuge Pointe (&lt;a href=\"Refuge%20Pointe%20Defender\"&gt;Refuge Pointe Defender&lt;/a&gt;), Stromgarde (&lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Defender\"&gt;Stromgarde Defender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Cavalryman\"&gt;Stromgarde Cavalryman&lt;/a&gt;), Tiragarde Keep (&lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt;), Theramore (&lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt; - not affiliated with Stormwind)\nTheir uniqueness comes from their shields, and that they can improve their chance to block.\nIronforge (Dwarf).\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer\"&gt;Mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Ironforge Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thief%20Catcher\"&gt;Thief Catcher&lt;/a&gt; (Ironforge Elite)\nAnvilmar, Kharanos, Thelsamar\nTheir uniqueness comes from their ability to use storm clap.\nSome mountaineers can also shoot in addition to their melee attacks.\nGnomeregan Exiles (Gnome).\nNone as of patch 2.4.1\nDarnassus (Night elf).\n&lt;a href=\"Teldrassil%20Sentinel\"&gt;Teldrassil Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20Sentinel\"&gt;Darnassus Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huntress\"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt; (Darnassus Elite), &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Protector\"&gt;Darnassian Protector&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Treants\"&gt;Treants&lt;/a&gt;, Darnassus only), &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Protector\"&gt;Ancient Protector&lt;/a&gt;\nAldrassil, Dolanaar, Auberdine, Astranaar, Feathermoon Stronghold\nExodar (Draenei).\n&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;Exodar Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Velen\"&gt;Shield of Velen&lt;/a&gt;\nHorde.\nOrgrimmar (Orc).\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Grunt\"&gt;Orgrimmar Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28Guard%29\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Elite\"&gt;Kor'kron Elite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Roof%20Stalker\"&gt;Troll Roof Stalker&lt;/a&gt;\nTowns protected by Grunts:\nValley of Trials, Razor Hill, Splintertree Post, Zoram'gar Outpost, Hammerfall, Kargath\nTheir uniqueness is that they use a two handed weapon and enrage.\nDarkspear Trolls (Troll).\n&lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Watcher\"&gt;Sen'jin Watcher&lt;/a&gt;\nTowns protected by Watchers:\nSen'jin Village, Shadowprey Village\nThunder Bluff (Tauren).\n&lt;a href=\"Brave\"&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bluffwatcher\"&gt;Bluffwatcher&lt;/a&gt;\nTowns protected by Braves:\nBloodhoof Village, Camp Narache, Shadowprey Village, Ghost Walker Post, Sun Rock Retreat, Freewind Post, Camp Mojache\nUndercity (Forsaken).\n&lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercity%20Guardian\"&gt;Undercity Guardian&lt;/a&gt; (abominations), &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28guard%29\"&gt;Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt; (Undercity Elite), &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dreadguard\"&gt;Royal Dreadguard&lt;/a&gt;\nTowns protected by Deathguards:\nDeathknell, Brill, Sepulcher, Tarren Mill\nTheir uniqueness is their abominations, which have plague cloud, a buff which regularly damages foes around them.\nSilvermoon (Blood elf).\n&lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Guardian\"&gt;Arcane Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;\nTowns Protected By Guardians: the Falconwing Square of western Silvermoon City, Fairbreeze Village, Tranquillien, Sunstrider Isle\nTheir uniqueness is that the model of their guards is unique compared to other blood elves."}

When the young &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was sent to become the Guardian's apprentice, they requested him to research specific things for them in there. The Great Magus actually had the habit of sending tentative new assistants to sort out the library, which was a horrible mess of trapped books, disjointed tomes, and unsorted correspondence. At least two assistants had died there, only scorch marks being left of them. With the help of a trap-detecting device, Khadgar eventually managed to sort out the library to better order in about three full weeks of work. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; later spend some time in the library acquiring knowledge about the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; eventually attacked the library, leading to many damages among the cases and books.\nTides of Darkness.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, among the members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the high council of the Kirin Tor \u2014 the archmage &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was the most eager to gain access to the Guardian's Library, and thus he was most upset when the library was lost and sealed off from the rest of the world.\nBurning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar unlocked Karazhan in order for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to raid the tower and defeat its &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;ghostly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants. When they entered the library, the huge room contains thousands of books in varied conditions - some kept neatly on the shelves, some scattered across the floor or on tables and chairs, and some priceless tomes were even piled up and used for bonfires. The ceiling of the room has broken out, and huge chunks of rock hang suspended in the air, eternally resisting the call of gravity. This is the location of the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt;, and also grants further access to the top of the tower and its last bosses. &lt;a href=\"Kamsis\"&gt;Kamsis&lt;/a&gt; the conjurer, &lt;a href=\"Gradav\"&gt;Gradav&lt;/a&gt; the warlock, and &lt;a href=\"Wravien\"&gt;Wravien&lt;/a&gt; the mage can also be found in the library.\nLegends.\nAt some point, when the sisters &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt; entered Karazhan looking for their father, the paladin &lt;a href=\"Dougan\"&gt;Dougan&lt;/a&gt;, they met the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; in the library. Furious, the spirit attacked the girls, only to be stopped by the ghost of Dougan.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, owing to the fact he spent so much time in here, Khadgar referred to the Guardian's Library as his. After he personally informed &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; about the arrival of the Legion, Khadgar flew to Karazhan on a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; in search of knowledge to aid against the demons. While he was searching the libraries of the tower, an image of Medivh appeared to show him a vision of the end of Azeroth, before offering him to become the new &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to prevent this fate. However, Khadgar refused the offer and discovered that Medivh's echo was in fact a monstrously gargantuan &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, the latter attempted to attack before the Archmage destroyed him with his arcane magic.\nWhen Khadgar and the adventurer traveled to Karazhan, in order to find information about the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; and their location, they entered the library and fought its sentries. After the battle, Khadgar managed to reprogram the guardians and sent them to repel the demons in the tower.\nWhen the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; intended to use Karazhan as a conduit to each and every one of the countless worlds that they had consumed during their &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the Heroes of Azeroth were once again sent by Khadgar to stop them. When they entered the library, gravity appeared to have been twisted with the floor becoming the ceiling. There, the adventurers fought against demons, giant spiders and rats, and even some enchanted books, before they encountered the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Shade of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Devourer\"&gt;Mana Devourer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar returned to Karazhan as he hoped that somewhere in Medivh's ancient texts lay the knowledge needed to heal &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Prince &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Karazhan where he received information from the library that allowed him to craft &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mental%20Clarity\"&gt;a potion&lt;/a&gt; that could cleanse someone of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s corruption.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; went to the library to inform Khadgar about the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, ancient enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, and their return that threatened the world."}

{"id": "201893", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=201893", "title": "Guardian's Moldy Card", "text": "A Guardian's Moldy Card is a pledge gift given out by (&lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; seasonal &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. These are combined into packages which are in turn hierarchically combined with other pledge packages for &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and rewards. \nAll of the Love is in the Air pledge gifts are non-functional as regards their name and picture. You cannot read a Guardian's Moldy Card.\nSource.\nGuardian's Moldy Card is one of two pledge items (the other is ) that can be found inside a or a , given by Undercity Guardians as part of the Love is in the Air event. There is always one and only one of these two pledge items in each of these containers. (The Pledge of Friendship contains only the pledge item; the Pledge of Adoration contains functional gifts as well.) The odds of getting either pledge item appear to be about even, but in the short run you are likely to get a stack of one while trying for the other. \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Guardian's Moldy Cards in order to remove a Guardian's Moldy Card from its container. To remove the Guardian's Moldy Card from its container, right click the Pledge of Adoration or Pledge of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Guardian's Moldy Cards in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Sheaf%20of%20Cards\"&gt;Sheaf of Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Pledge of Adoration: Undercity and Pledge of Friendship: Undercity container items do not stack. Opening your Pledges of Friendship: Undercity should save inventory space, since both pledge items stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Pledge of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Pledge of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Guardian's Moldy Card pledge item stacks 20 high, but the Sheaf of Cards package item does not stack at all.\nUndercity Guardians.\nThe s respond androgynously, so your character can use either a &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Bottle\"&gt;Cologne Bottle&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Perfume%20Bottle\"&gt;Perfume Bottle&lt;/a&gt; to get the \"give a \" dialog from any Undercity Guardian, if you want to gather these pledge items. \nAll of the Undercity Guardians are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. For the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. Since all of a city's guard NPCs are the same race, the distinction does not come into play for the pledge items. \nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nDuration.\nThis item is &lt;a href=\"Undercity_Gift_Collection%23Notes\"&gt;primarily&lt;/a&gt; useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year.\nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article."}

It causes a friendly target to receive 40% increased healing for 10 seconds. If the target dies while under the effect of the spell, the Guardian Spirit will prevent death by sacrificing itself and restore 40% of the target's maximum health - massive amounts of damage will however not trigger this effect. Guardian Spirit can be cast while stunned.\nNotes.\nShould the target get a fatal blow while under the effect of Guardian Spirit, the Guardian Spirit will prevent the target from dying, and in addition heal the target for 40% of their maximum health. However, as Guardian Spirit's heal is increased by effects that increases healing done (and received), in practice it will always heal for more than 40%.\nHealing debuffs such as those caused by &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; will reduce the healing received from Guardian Spirit by 25%.\nThe Holy priest &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt; is also procced by Guardian Spirit, providing at least an additional 10% of the total heal, over 6 seconds. Additional Mastery will of course increase this amount.\nTips and tactics.\nGuardian Spirit has 2 functions: to increase healing received, and to provide an emergency heal should the target die. While saving Guardian Spirit as an emergency cooldown can be very effective in preventing wipes, the spell's 40% healing increase should not be overlooked. With only a 4-minute cooldown it can be used regularly to boost healing and conserve mana. However it is usually more advantageous to allow the target to 'die' while under the effect, in order to benefit from the spell's 'sacrifice' heal. Announcing your target before allowing your target to 'die' is usually a good idea.\nThe optimal amount of healing can be gained from Guardian Spirit by healing the spell's target for a few seconds before allowing them to 'die'. As the buff is consumed in order to save the target from death, the 40% healing increase will only be available before the Guardian Spirit sacrifices itself."}

The four priests are channeling auras on the golem, which grant Tak'u an ability. If a priest is dead when Tak'u activates, it will not have that ability for the rest of the encounter. Each priest has 630,000 health, and priests are either alive or dead as far as Tak'u is concerned, so it's all or nothing. This translates to some multiple of 21,000 DPS necessary to knock out priests in the first 30 seconds.\nBlow cooldowns at the beginning of the encounter to kill as many priests as possible to make the fight against Tak'u itself easier. Tak'u has Lightning Strike no matter what, so simply get out of the targeting circle when the golem casts it. Fire of the Serpent must be interrupted, as it does 250,000 Fire damage that can't be avoided. Waves of the Hyrdra is a magic buff that heals the golem for 472K a tick, but can be dispelled and spellstolen. Wrath of the Direhorn is a large (roughly 20-yard) point blank area of effect that must be run out of. Gusts of the Hawk spawns a handful of tornadoes that criss-cross the arena in straight lines and do some minor Nature damage.\nOnce Tak'u activates, the fight is merely getting out of the areas of effect and interrupting/dispelling as appropriate. Classes without dispells or interrupts should thus focus on the respective priests and kill them before the fight starts.\nNote that to gain credit for the achievement &lt;a href=\"Our%20Powers%20Combined\"&gt;Our Powers Combined&lt;/a&gt;, kill either zero or all four priests before Tak'u activates. Then, kill Tak'u the other way."}

The Guardians were imbued with powers from all members of the Council of Tirisfal, becoming extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s in their own right. At the time &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; became Guardian, all Guardians were given the honorific title \"Magna\", which comes from a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; word meaning \"protector\". It is unclear if &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; ever received this honorific. He is usually known as \"Magus\".\nThe Guardians of Tirisfal have served for ages to protect the world from demonic influence.\nEach archmage participating in the empowering ritual loses part of their power. The loss of power lasts as long as the Guardian of Tirisfal that had been empowered lives. The power is regained if the Guardian of Tirisfal dies or is stripped of power by the surviving council of archmagi. A Guardian of Tirisfal cannot be stripped of power if all of the empowering archmagi are dead. Instead, they must be killed before there can be another Guardian of Tirisfal. Due to their given powers, Guardians live for centuries, and as a result, there have been few of them. Only the names of six are known:\nGuardians of Tirisfal.\nAfter the events of &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh refers to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; as the new Guardian, but Khadgar refuses the position. Medivh counters, however, by stating that it's not power that makes a Guardian, but courage and a just heart, qualities he says make Khadgar a far greater Guardian than himself.\nNon-canon Guardians.\nThe issue of Med'an being &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; or not is something that had been brought up in the fanbase since his introduction. When asked about it at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Afrasiabi\"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi&lt;/a&gt; responded: \"Certain fiction exists outside the World of Warcraft that we love, but is it necessarily what we would consider canon? So Med'an as Guardian, isn't considered canon in Warcraft lore, which is why in the last five years you haven't seen a reference to him. Um, so, that doesn't mean that there can't be a story for Med'an, it's just not like it was laid out in the comics.\"\nBased on what Afrasiabi said at the end, the character himself still seems to be canon, just not him being Guardian. Given the many events from the comics that have been subsequently referenced in the game or other materials - such as &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s mutation, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;'s vendetta against Cho'gall in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Aegwynn's death, and &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; inside of &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; - it seems that for the most part, the events of the comic still happened, just without Med'an being the Guardian. When asked further, Afrasiabi clarified that he did not mean the entire comic was non-canon, only that Med'an being Guardian was.\nHistory.\nFoundation of the Order.\nFollowing the inadvertent summoning of several &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the Burning Legion into the streets of the newly founded city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and the summoning of elementals from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; by both elves and humans, the ruling &lt;a href=\"magocrats\"&gt;magocrats&lt;/a&gt; of that city sought out the help of the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was able to help neutralize the immediate problem, the underlying threat of the Legion remained.\nFormed by a secret pact between the human and elven mages, the Council of Tirisfal was created to oversee the secret war to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from demonic invasion. Taking its name from the council's meeting place in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the Council imbued a single mortal with incredible powers of both elven and human magic. This person was called the Spearhead, with the Council channeling a part of their power into them. However, this put the Council at risk as they had to be within close range of the Spearhead while channeling their power. The Spearhead was reworked into the Guardian by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, by restructuring the transfer ceremony used to link the Council of Tirisfal with the Spearhead. He did this by using a spell that &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; and him devised that will allow the Council of Tirisfal and the Spearhead to link at great distances. This allowed them to engage the enemy with the Council of Tirisfal's power and safety intact and out of harm's way. To reflect this change, the Council of Tirisfal altered the title of Spearhead to Guardian-- of the Council's power, safety, trust, and defense of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The spell would later be applied to a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and used for all Guardians from that day on, until the day Aegwynn refused to return her power.\nThough there would only ever be one Guardian at a time, they held such vast power that they could single-handedly fight back the Legion's agents wherever they were found in the world. The Guardian's power was so great that only the Council of Tirisfal was allowed to choose potential successors to the mantle of Guardian. Whenever a Guardian grew too old, or wearied of the secret war against chaos, the Council chose a new champion and under controlled conditions channeled the Guardian power into its new agent.\n&lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian before &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, stopped &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt; after she had used &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt; to drain the life from &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nAegwynn and Medivh.\nThe Guardians of Tirisfal were finally corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; when his &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; fought the Guardian Aegwynn in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Guardian Aegwynn successfully defeated Sargeras, his dark spirit entered her. When Aegwynn went rogue, the Council of Tirisfal created the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; to hunt her down. &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the Tirisgarde, but he came to understand Aegwynn's perspective and fell in love with her, but when they had a child together, Sargeras' spirit passed from Aegwynn into that child.\nDetermining that she, not the Order, should determine the heir to the mantle of Guardian, Aegwynn imbued her new son &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; with the powers of a Guardian, though these powers would not be realized until he reached adulthood. Unbeknown to Aegwynn, the spirit of Sargeras had tainted Medivh's soul. Medivh would eventually be overcome by the will of Sargeras and conspire with &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his orcish &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to open the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; which would allow the orcs to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Medivh's death during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, which brought the unbroken chain of Guardians to an end, it was decided that none could resist the temptation of the Guardian's powers. Thus, no new Guardian was chosen, and nothing more was ever heard of the Order of Tirisfal.\nThe New Order.\nAt the behest of former Guardian &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, Archmage &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; (a member of the first Council), a &lt;a href=\"new%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;new Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; was formed to combat the threat of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;foul masters&lt;/a&gt; while the Alliance and the Horde were focused on the war with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. The first Guardian of the new Council was &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, the child of Medivh and &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, who took up the mantle at the behest of his father. Following the defeat of Cho'gall in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, Med'an returned the power of the Guardian back to the Council. The Council has yet to choose a new Guardian.\nIn the RPG.\nA Guardian of Tirisfal can understand and speak &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere can be only one Guardian of Tirisfal at a time. Each Guardian of Tirisfal is empowered through a long ritual by a council of seven archmages. The secrets of this ritual are closely guarded, if not all but forgotten in recent times. A new Guardian of Tirisfal cannot be empowered while the previous one exists. Only through his death, or through an equally long and secret disempowering ritual conducted by the surviving archmages who empowered him, can a Guardian of Tirisfal be stripped of his power. Magna &lt;a href=\"Aranda\"&gt;Aranda&lt;/a&gt; was a Guardian."}

Collect 5, then fly back to Shattrath and port back to the Isle to turn in.\nAs of 04/22/08 many of the ravagers are evade-bugged. If you use a gland on a bugged ravager, nothing happens and you'll lose the gland. If you're a hunter you can use Hunter's Mark on the ravager; if the mark holds, it isn't bugged and you can use your gland, but if the mark pops the Evade message, find another.

The discovered recipe is learned automatically. Non-factors include physical location, level, and skill level.\nWhen you discover a recipe, your character will perform an animation, and a message describing your discovery will be visible to nearby players of both factions.\nDiscovery of Burning Crusade recipes.\nCauldron Recipes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20%28alchemy%29\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; recipes will only be discovered when making a related item. For example, producing enough &lt;a href=\"Major%20Shadow%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Major Shadow Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;s will allow you to discover the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20of%20Major%20Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Cauldron of Major Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that discoveries of cauldron recipes occur with a much higher frequency than other discoveries. Comments on Thottbot for the cauldron recipes report that only 1-5 batches seem to be required before the discovery is made. One estimate for the discovery rate is 30%. \nNote: there appears to be no Cauldron of Major Holy Protection. \nNon-Cauldron Recipes.\nFor the non-Cauldron recipes, the following requirement applies:\nDiscovery of Wrath of the Lich King recipes.\nElixir and potion recipes.\nPerforming &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20Alchemy%20Research\"&gt;Northrend Alchemy Research&lt;/a&gt; causes an elixir or potion recipe to be discovered. Unlike in Burning Crusade, where discoveries were made by creating elixirs or potions, &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20Alchemy%20Research\"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; is the only confirmed way to discover WotLK elixir or potion recipes.\nTransmutation Recipes.\nWhen performing , one of the eternal elemental transmutations, or one of the epic gem transmutations, there is a high probability of discovering a new eternal elemental transmutation recipe. Performing one of the lower level transmutations will not give a discovery.\nDiscovery of Mists of Pandaria recipes.\nOnly three MoP alchemy recipes are learnable from trainers: &lt;a href=\"Master%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Master Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%27s%20Rejuvenation\"&gt;Alchemist's Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zen%20Alchemist%20Stone\"&gt;Zen Alchemist Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The other 32 MoP alchemy recipes are learnable through discovery. It is believed that crafting any MoP alchemy recipe has a chance to discover any other MoP alchemy recipe, as long as you meet the minimum skill requirement.\nAlchemy Myths.\nBased on reported examples of discoveries:\nIt is believed by many alchemists that transmutations are discovered while transmuting and that new potions and flasks are discovered while making potions, flasks, or elixirs. However, there are several reports of discovering a transmutation recipe while making an elixir or potion, and vice versa. It may be the case that the item made doesn't affect what is discovered at all, or it may be that the chance of discovering a new transmutation is reduced when making a potion.\nThe exact chance to discover a new recipe is not known, and cannot be known without disclosure from Blizzard or extensive analysis collected from logs. From discussion on the official World of Warcraft professions forum, and via comments about the recipes on third-party web sites, most players believe the discovery chance is tiny. One estimation was 0.01% prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1\"&gt;patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt;. In the patch notes for 2.1, the discovery rate was described as being increased significantly. However, the new chance is still not known. One estimate is 0.1%, but there is no evidence for that number.\nImmediately prior to the release of patch 2.1, Blizzard introduced a hot fix to prevent discoveries from occurring. This was reportedly to prevent an exploit where alchemists who repeatedly tried to create potions with no bag space would still make discoveries even though no potion was created nor potion ingredients consumed.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; introduced a bug which prevented discovery through , however this bug was corrected in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.3\"&gt;Patch 3.3.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nInscription.\nInscription recipes can be discovered from researching:\nJewelcrafting.\nMists of Pandaria\nTailoring.\nMists of Pandaria\nLeatherworking.\nMists of Pandaria\nBlacksmithing.\nMists of Pandaria\nCooking.\nA discovery system is used for cooking in the WoD beta. &lt;a href=\"The%20Joy%20of%20Draenor%20Cooking\"&gt;The Joy of Draenor Cooking&lt;/a&gt; scroll raises maximum cooking skill to 700 and teaches two recipes: &lt;a href=\"Grilled%20Saberfish\"&gt;Grilled Saberfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saberfish%20Broth\"&gt;Saberfish Broth&lt;/a&gt;. Cooking any Draenor recipe has a chance to produce a random BoP cooking recipe scroll in addition to producing food."}

They also have a collection of information pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s' experiments with the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, the progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s.

They lead to the gates of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Watcher%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Stone Watcher of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, the discs cannot be moved, but accurate and smaller copies have been obtained. They contain a lot of new information, as on the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; which gave bodies of flesh to the dwarves, but only a small part of their content was discovered. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; is the one who should be contacted for more information.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe Discs were crafted by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate the departure of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; so when they returned, they would posses a record of what had happened in their absence.\nThe stolen discs.\nAfter the titan &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt; Loken was mind-washed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;, concluded that to overthrow their corrupted brother they would first need to gather intelligence on Loken and his activities. To this end, they planned to steal the Discs of Norgannon from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Since the discs had recorded everything that had transpired in the world, they had also recorded Loken's betrayal. If there was any hope to undo his damage, it would be through a careful study of his actions.\nWhile Tyr distracted Loken in the gates of Ulduar, Archaedas and Ironaya infiltrated the titan city and stole the discs. Once out, the three departed from the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; knowing that Loken would soon hunt them down once he found the truth. After gathering their loyal forces, the three journeyed to the south where they hoped to find a refuge from which to plan their next move. When Loken found out the discs were stolen, he panicked because if Tyr and his allies showed the artifacts to &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; or the Pantheon, his own life would be lost. Out of desperation, he turned to the Old Gods minions, the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi &lt;a href=\"Zakazj\"&gt;Zakazj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;. After freeing and resurrecting them, the creatures felt the touch of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; on Loken's mind and they obeyed him to kill Tyr and the rest of his allies.\nFar in the south, the C'Thraxxi caught up with the fleeing &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. Tyr ordered Archaedas and Ironaya to flee with the discs while he stayed behind to hold off the Old God creatures, eventually sacrificing himself to defeat them. Archaedas and Ironaya returned and after burying him, continued their journey. They finally reached the easternmost titan-forged vault in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. In there, the two &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s carved out new chambers to hold the Discs of Norgannon and vowed to protect the history of Azeroth with their lives.\nIn Ulduar, Loken knew that he wouldn't recover the discs so he attempted to replace them instead. He created an archive of his own design which he dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, and adjusted the historical events contained to his liking, hiding his sins from the record. The tribunal has several of these false discs in racks beneath it.\nUldaman.\nUpon defeating &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, the guardian of the Discs, the room containing the Discs and other treasures will open, allowing players to access the Discs. Upon doing so, the &lt;a href=\"Lore%20Keeper%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Lore Keeper of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; will materialize and begin explaining the origin of the Earthen. After receiving all of the information, the player can access the Discs again to receive their own miniature copy to take to either &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) or &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance).\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire%20Campaign\"&gt;Black Empire Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Discs are still intact in Uldaman, with no records of unauthorized access.\nMechagon.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; is in possession of a corrupted Norgannon disc according to &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Bitbyte\"&gt;Archivist Bitbyte&lt;/a&gt; and its fragments have been discarded via the Mechagon waste system.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nThe Discs of Norgannon, also known as Disks of Uldaman, are a series of platinum discs which a single ring binds. The discs bear imprints in the alien titan language, and written on the discs are all the universe's secrets. The discs' bearer gains phenomenal spellcasting abilities and protections against spells, as well as access to the mysteries contained within the discs' cryptic runes. &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; the Dreamweaver has kept the discs for ages immemorial, but rumors whisper that he has lost the artifacts. This story is true, as dwarven excavators in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; recently discovered the discs \u2014 which bore proof of the dwarves' titanic genesis. The discs' true powers, however, will likely remain undiscovered. The knowledge contained in the discs is immense and puissant. Their secrets would topple mortal kingdoms and set the universe ablaze. Norgannon \u2014 and the rest of the pantheon \u2014 may soon return to Azeroth to recover the discs. The discs also act as a spellbook for every arcane spell in the universe (or most of them). Rumors maintain that the discs contain other powers as well \u2014 powers that could scorch the universe. None besides Norgannon \u2014 and perhaps not even he \u2014 knows how to access these capabilities.\nBael Modan ruins.\nEighty-nine discs are scattered on the shelves of the Ruined Library of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The platinum discs explain that the troggs were the titans' first attempt to create life from living stone, but the experiment was a failure. When the titans saw how brutal and misshapen the troggs were, they buried them in vaults all over the land. A number of dwarf groups are interested in obtaining the undamaged discs. Some slightly larger discs, called the Discs of Norgannon, are powerful magic artifacts and hold a secret history of the titans' war against the Old Gods. Several factions would do anything to get their hands on these invaluable discs. Some believe that the Bael Modan discs are the Discs of Norgannon."}

{"id": "87906", "revid": "53899918", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=87906", "title": "Dispel", "text": "Dispel refers to the general game mechanic of removing &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s. All of these effects belong to a particular &lt;a href=\"dispel%20type\"&gt;dispel type&lt;/a&gt;. Most dispel abilities remove effects from a specific dispel type, but in some cases they remove depending on a specific mechanic (for example, &lt;a href=\"Luffa\"&gt;Luffa&lt;/a&gt; removes &lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;bleed effects&lt;/a&gt;). Dispel mechanics can also be categorized into defensive and offensive dispels. Defensive dispel abilities remove &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s from friendly units, whereas offensive dispel abilities remove &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s from enemy units. Dispelling specific abilities may cause an additional effect to occur in response, otherwise known as dispel protection or dispel backlash.\nFor a list of dispel abilities for specific dispel types, see \"&lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dispel%20Type%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"typeless\"&gt;typeless&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDispel capabilities by class.\nBelow is a table showing which classes can dispel which types of &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s. Self-only dispels (such as &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt;) are not included. &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Talents\"&gt;PvP Talent&lt;/a&gt; dispels are marked with a yellow asterisk () and only function in &lt;a href=\"War%20Mode\"&gt;War Mode&lt;/a&gt; and instanced PvP content; they do not function in &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDispel Abilities.\nBelow is a list of abilities that can dispel effects based on class, then type (defensive or offensive). Each type of effect that can be dispelled is marked by an icon next to it. Self-only dispels are not listed.\nDispel Protection.\nThe following abilities have an additional effect if they are dispelled. These \"protection\" effects exist in order to deter an opponent from dispelling them. The effects caused by dispelling vary; some benefit the caster while others harm the victim or the dispeller. Certain abilities only gain protection effects via talents; these talents are listed instead.\nDispel Resistance.\nIn \"\", there are limited ways to resist both offensive and defensive dispel effects. When an offensive dispel is resisted, it does not remove any buffs. Likewise, when a debuff resists a defensive dispel, it is not removed.\nFor offensive dispels, both &lt;a href=\"Devour%20Magic\"&gt;Devour Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt; are capable of being resisted so long as the target has sufficient &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;. \nDefensive dispels are not hindered by the afflictor's magic resistance, but rather by select talents that grant dispel resistance. For example, the talent &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Poisons\"&gt;Vile Poisons&lt;/a&gt; gives up to a 40% chance for the rogue's poisons to resist dispel effects.\nHistory.\nDispel Capabilities.\nPrior to the ' expansion, dispel abilities were distributed differently to classes. As no specializations existed, dispels were instead class based. Magic effects could only be removed by priests and paladins, rather than all healers. This originally left the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with only one defensive magic dispel class prior to '.\nDispel Mechanics.\nDispels would fail to cast on targets that had no effects to remove, and would display an error message stating such. No mana would be consumed nor would the global cooldown be triggered, making it impossible to \"waste\" a dispel. In addition to this benefit, there were \"upgraded\" dispel abilities that featured passive dispel effects, providing certain classes a significant advantage over others. &lt;a href=\"Abolish%20Disease\"&gt;Abolish Disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abolish%20Poison\"&gt;Abolish Poison&lt;/a&gt; would dispel any further applied effects for 12 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Disease%20Cleansing%20Totem\"&gt;Disease Cleansing Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Cleansing%20Totem\"&gt;Poison Cleansing Totem&lt;/a&gt; would passively dispel any nearby ally for the entire duration of the totem, allowing a single shaman to dispel numerous effects with one press, thus saving them a lot of mana and gcds. Though these \"upgraded\" abilities didn't replace their original counterparts, they were nearly always used as they were undoubtedly superior. Blizzard considered dispels \"trivial\" due to these factors. \nAs a result, several changes were made for \"Cataclysm\" to better distribute dispels, increase their opportunity cost, and require more player input to use effectively."}

The dispel type tells you how the effect can be removed or &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;led. There are 5 main dispel types, 2 that are rarely used, and at least one that is present on tooltips but not targeted by any abilities.\nCurse.\nThe ability to curse their enemies is almost exclusively limited to &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, although &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; can also curse via &lt;a href=\"Hex\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Corruption\"&gt;Remove Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse\"&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/a&gt;, and shaman with &lt;a href=\"Cleanse%20Spirit\"&gt;Cleanse Spirit&lt;/a&gt; can remove them.\nDisease.\nThese are usually conditions like &lt;a href=\"Rabies\"&gt;Rabies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tetanus\"&gt;Tetanus&lt;/a&gt;, and the like and are usually caused by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. However, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s can cast &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Plague\"&gt;Devouring Plague&lt;/a&gt;, and certain &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; abilities cause diseases, most notably &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Plague\"&gt;Blood Plague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fever\"&gt;Frost Fever&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Cleanse\"&gt;Cleanse&lt;/a&gt;), priests (&lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Detox\"&gt;Detox&lt;/a&gt; and Mistweavers' &lt;a href=\"Revival\"&gt;Revival&lt;/a&gt;) can remove Disease-type effects from themselves and their allies. The dwarven racial ability &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; will also instantly cleanse the caster of all Disease effects.\nMagic.\nThe most common effects are Magic. There are Magic-type buffs (beneficial), as well as Magic debuffs (harmful). \n&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt;, shaman can use &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt;, and Protection warriors can use &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt; to remove Magic buffs from their enemies. Warlocks may use their &lt;a href=\"Felhunter%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Devour%20Magic\"&gt;Devour Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Mages can use &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; to transfer enemy Magic buffs to themselves.\nWith the appropriate talents, Holy paladins (&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Cleansing\"&gt;Sacred Cleansing&lt;/a&gt;), Restoration druids (&lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Cure%20%28druid%20talent%29\"&gt;Nature's Cure (druid talent)&lt;/a&gt;), and Restoration shamans (&lt;a href=\"Improved%20Cleanse%20Spirit\"&gt;Improved Cleanse Spirit&lt;/a&gt;) have the ability to remove Magic debuffs from their allies. All Mistweaver monks can remove Magic debuffs from themselves and their allies using &lt;a href=\"Detox\"&gt;Detox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revival\"&gt;Revival&lt;/a&gt;. The monk talent &lt;a href=\"Diffuse%20Magic\"&gt;Diffuse Magic&lt;/a&gt; removes Magic debuffs from the caster.\nPriests of all kinds can use &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; to simultaneously remove buffs from enemies and debuffs from allies. Priests can also use &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; to remove 1 buff from an enemy or up to 2 debuffs from themselves.\nSome Magic-type effects are classed as invulnerabilities, and cannot be removed by any of the aforementioned abilities; these include &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Only a priest's &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;glyphed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; or a warrior's &lt;a href=\"Shattering%20Throw\"&gt;Shattering Throw&lt;/a&gt; can remove these more potent buffs.\nPoison.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s are highly capable of causing &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;-type debuffs and DoTs, but many mobs do as well. &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; sting abilities are also considered poison debuffs. Druids (with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Corruption\"&gt;Remove Corruption&lt;/a&gt;), paladins (&lt;a href=\"Cleanse\"&gt;Cleanse&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"monks\"&gt;monks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Detox\"&gt;Detox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revival\"&gt;Revival&lt;/a&gt;) can remove these. Those with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; secondary skill can also create &lt;a href=\"Anti-Venom\"&gt;Anti-Venom&lt;/a&gt;s to cure poison, although these are very rarely used at max level. Dwarves can invoke &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse themselves of all Poison effects for free once every two minutes.\nTypeless effects.\nThere are also many lasting effects which do not have a dispel type; there are no general spells that remove these. However, there may still be hope: the ones that impose a specific &lt;a href=\"mechanic\"&gt;mechanic&lt;/a&gt; upon the target may be susceptible to removal by certain items and abilities that can remove this specific mechanic (for example, &lt;a href=\"Luffa\"&gt;Luffa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; can remove &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; effects, while &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soothe\"&gt;Soothe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shiv\"&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt; can remove &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20effect\"&gt;Enrage effect&lt;/a&gt;s). Some lasting effects, however, must simply run their course and expire with time.\nMost typeless effects can also be removed using the paladin's &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; or the mage's &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;.\nReading a Wowhead dispel effect.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;, a spell entry may include the effect \"Dispel\" followed by a number in brackets. That number indicates the type of buff or debuff the spell will remove:\nOn the next line, the number following \"Value:\" is the maximum number of effects of this type that will be dispelled. Spells that have the attribute \"Remove auras on immunity\" remove buffs and debuffs based on their \"&lt;a href=\"mechanic\"&gt;mechanic&lt;/a&gt;\" rather than their dispel type."}

We need you to collect a large number of scourgestones and bring them to High Priest Thel'danis. The high priest can be found guarding &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;, not far from here.\nOnly one with an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt; can hope to find scourgestones, so speak to &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Pureheart\"&gt;Officer Pureheart&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't already.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nWhat evil have you brought me?\nCompletion.\nThere is risk in dispelling the evil from a &lt;a href=\"scourgestone\"&gt;scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;, for it attracts the attention of undead for countless miles.

Be careful that you keep enough to turn in to &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thel%27danis\"&gt;High Priest Thel'danis&lt;/a&gt;."}
