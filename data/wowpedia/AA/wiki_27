The most feared of the death knight trainers of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Razuvious is accompanied by two (normal) or four (heroic) &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20Understudy\"&gt;Death Knight Understudies&lt;/a&gt;, who are used by the raiding party to defeat him.\nFor his appearance in the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; class, see the &lt;a href=\"%23Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; section.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nRazuvious also appears at , where he oversees the training of new death knights. He is involved in the following quests:\nSummary.\nInstructor Razuvious hits hard; too hard for any tank that isn't substantially over-geared for the fight. His understudies have a Bone Barrier self-buff capable of absorbing most of the damage. In the 10-man version these understudies can be mind-controlled through the Orbs of Domination by the stairs; a 25-man raid will have to bring enough priests to mind-control them directly.\nSuccessful strategies for defeating Razuvious require the raid to rotate tanking duties between mind-controlled understudies so Razuvious is always attacking the understudy currently protected by Bone Barrier.\n25-man abilities.\nInstructor Razuvious.\nInstructor Razuvious has approximately 10,100,000 hit points. His regular melee hits plate for about 30,000.\nDeath Knight Understudies.\nFour of these are pulled with Instructor Razuvious. They hit lightly and should be offtanked for most of the encounter. A priest will need to mind control one immediately and one should always be mind controlled through the encounter, unlike the 10-man version of the encounter there are no orbs to mindcontrol the understudies with. Healers will need to heal them through Instructor Razuvious' damage. After Instructor Razuvious dies these will take 1000% extra damage from players.\nNote: Compared to the original 40-man version, there is no longer a Mind Exhaustion debuff on the Understudies after you stop MCing them. This means a priest can mind control the same Understudy over and over. However the standard diminishing returns on repeated MC still exists.\n10-man abilities.\nInstructor Razuvious.\nInstructor Razuvious has approximately 3,349,000 hit points. His regular melee hits plate for about 30,000.\nDeath Knight Understudies.\nTwo of these are pulled with Instructor Razuvious. They hit lightly and should be mind controlled for most of the encounter. A player will need to use the orbs of domination to mind control one and at least one should always be mind controlled through the encounter. Healers will need to heal them through Instructor Razuvious' damage. After Instructor Razuvious dies these will take 1000% extra damage from players.\n25-man strategy.\nYou will need:\nBefore the fight begins, you must assign Mind Control Priests to specific Understudies. Two Priests are required for this fight, but three is safer, and four is if you do not want to bother tanking the extra fourth add. See &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros%20for%20priests\"&gt;Useful macros for priests&lt;/a&gt; for a convenient Mind Control macro.\nWhen the pull begins, the Tank should walk about 3/4s of the way down the steps until the Understudies pull. The Tank will not do any actions, just serve as a Damage Soaker for the first three seconds of the fight. The Tank may use an AoE Aggro, as long as it does not hit the Instructor. Razuvious will watch for three to five seconds, then he will join the fight, attacking the person with the highest aggro. It is the Main Priest's job to Mind Control one of the adds and Bone Barrier (6) + Taunt (5) the Instructor before he gets to the tank. Priests generally can stand at the base of the stairs and tank the Instructor at the closest part of the Green Circle. This should give everyone enough space to work with (Mind Control distance break), and allow enough time for the Priests to Re-Mind Control before they get back to them. \nAn alternative way of pulling is to have two paladins shield the two priests who go in first. This way they both have more than enough time to cast Mind Control and one of them to taunt the Instructor. \nAfter the initial pull from the Understudies, the two Mind Controlling Priests will alternate the use of their 'Pets' to Bone Barrier and then Taunt. It is extremely important to Bone Barrier THEN Taunt as the Instructor will cause massive damage to the add which tax the Healers ability to keep the add up. The switch will need to happen every 10 seconds (9 seconds to be safe) since Taunt/Bone Barrier Cooldown is about 18 seconds, but the effect is 10 seconds. Note that if Taunt falls off, or Mind Control falls while an Understudy is tanking, it is extremely easy for any player to pull aggro, and the Instructor will begin killing players.\nIf the two mind controlling priests change which Understudy they control, dropping their control and getting the new Understudy after Razuvious has been taunted off of them, they can then change which Understudy is tanking sooner than the 18 second cooldown on the abilities. Stand behind Razuvious to taunt him. This allows the other priest to see that you have started tanking Razuvious by the direction he turns.\nIf you are utilizing less than four Priests to Mind Control, the rest of the adds will need to be off tanked. They do not hit particularly hard. They may be needed if one of the Understudies die while tanking Instructor. \nAs for the DPS, once a MC Priest's add has control of the Instructor, all DPS may unload on the Instructor. Each Taunt lasts 10 seconds, and, as long as the Tanking Priest is spamming 'Blood Strike', and has 'Taunt' running it is impossible to pull Aggro from an Understudy, due to how the Understudies Effects work.\nHealers will need to focus on Healing the Tanking Understudies. The most mana-efficient heals should be used (such as a Priest's Greater Heal) for Understudies, since Understudies take massive amounts of damage. The raid should generally be kept at least at 90%, as Instructor will throw a knife randomly at a raid member which will generally bring them down to at least half health (Cloth wearers could be killed outright). To make sure that the raid stays up, one healer should be dedicated to healing players that get the Jagged Knife Debuff, healing the adds Tank otherwise. \nAnother strategy that has been brought to the raiding community is from the Dungeons and Raids forums on the main World of Warcraft Website. The title of the post is Razuvious Who Needs Priests? A guild on Azshara(US)&lt;Dungeon Team Extreme&gt; came up with the strategy of using 3 hunters in a triangle and doing a distracting shot rotation to make up for the lack of priests. This strategy can be viewed in the video on the forum post or at the bottom of this page in the video section. It is an alternate strategy there for guilds who seem to have a shortage of priests for their raids. As well as a strategy of using 1 priest and have a hunter taunt then feign between mind controls: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D14697550114%26amp%3BpostId%3D146960976053\"&gt;this article &lt;/a&gt;\n10-man strategy.\nThere are 2 and 2 controlling orbs in the 10-man version. The 2 orbs should be controlled by the tanks and the encounter is started by each tank selecting their own understudy, walking up to their orb and right-clicking it to control them. Razuvious will immediately aggro onto them and whichever tank is decided to tank first must immediately hit \"6\" on your new hotkey bar (pet bar) for Bone Barrier, then \"5\" to taunt. While tanking use the \"4\" key repeatedly to Blood Strike for holding aggro. Keep Razuvious tanked near the back of the circle where the understudies are located before the encounter starts, this way when you refresh your orb spell you will have plenty of time to re-control your understudy before he can run all the way to you. Bone Barrier lasts 20 secs so the 2nd tanking understudy must hit their Bone Barrier and taunt before the first tank's Bone Barrier runs out. There is a 30 second cooldown on the Bone Barrier. To help your healers and ensure the understudies always have Bone Barrier up, taunt closer to every 16 seconds, rather than 20. The tanks can see the Bone Barrier icon's 30 second cooldown timer on the pet bar. Once it goes past halfway, the tank should call out for a taunt. Calling out is helpful because when a tank has to dismiss and re-control an understudy, he can lose track of the timer. ALWAYS use the Bone Barrier ability BEFORE you taunt. This is all the fight is, the tanks trading taunts to ensure the tanking understudy has Bone Barrier up 100% of the time. Healers will need to help heal the understudies even with their Bone Barrier up to ensure both stay alive through the entire encounter.\nWhen clicking an orb to control an understudy you will see that your character is channeling the spell and the channel lasts for 1 minute. To make sure the channel does not break while tanking Razuvious, each tank should refresh the channeling spell every 2 taunt cycles. In order to do this after you've been taunted off of the second time IMMEDIATELY right-click the understudy's pet frame and select \"dismiss\". NOTE: you cannot use the \"leave vehicle\" button that shows up in the \"=\" of your hotbar, it does nothing, you must dismiss manually. Another option is to use a class ability that interrupts the channeling of mind control. A warrior can do this by using a shout, for example. This may be faster and easier than using the \"dismiss\" option. As soon as you have dismissed the understudy click the orb again to control him, this refreshes your channeling spell and will leave you with enough time for the 5 second cooldown on your abilities to be off before the current tank's Bone Barrier falls off.\nTips: Tank the boss in the far center of the green floor. Whenever you need to dismiss and re-control the add, move the add to the right/left, far-end of the room. This way, the add will come straight to you and because all melee players are in the center, you have clear sight of him to target. Even better, you can start the fight by using /focus on your add, and click on his portrait to target it whenever you need to take control of it again. Dismiss, click on portrait, wait 2\u20133 seconds for the \"uncontrollable\" buff to wear off, and right-click on the orb without moving to re-control him again.\nThis technique is sometime hard to explain to people, however there are a few things the main tank can do to aid the off tank. If your off tank has not taunted the mob off, you are able to tank a few hits, and with 3 healers in the group, you can heal through the damage if they focus (i.e. 2 priests and druid, spam healed for the entire fight and survived the 10-man version).\nMacros.\nThe following four macros are helpful for if you are Mind Controlling the Understudies.\nControl Understudy: Requires your assigned Understudy is your Focus Target. (/focus) This macro targets your assigned Understudy and casts Mind Control.\n /cast [target=focus] Mind Control\nBone Barrier and Change Target: Once you have an Understudy under your control, you can use this macro to change your target to Instructor and Cast Bone Barrier (once you are close to Instructor and ready to taunt). Due to the limitations of Global Cooldown and Targeting, it must be different from your Taunting Macro.\n /target Instructor\n /cast Bone Barrier\nTaunt and Notify: This allows you to notify everyone around you that you are taking Instructor. Make sure Bone Barrier is already up. If you are utilizing the four macros here, you will hit this immediately after the last macro (Bone Barrier).\n /yell Taunting!!!\n /cast Taunt\nRelease Understudy: The following macro allows you to dismiss your understudy allowing you to use the 'Control Understudy' Macro right after.\n /say Releasing Understudy.\n /script PetDismiss()\nWith these four Macros, you can effectively make this a four-button fight (with the exception of hitting the Attack Buttons).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

After that, it is a simple matter of killing any enemies left to be counted up and reporting back to Zaela to continue. \nIt is advisable to set yourself up in a manner similar to the standard 5-player dungeon group, as in the subsequent quest &lt;a href=\"Death%20to%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Death to Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt; you face off against fel orc Warchief in the flesh - and he has elite status; thus, your choices should be built around your character's role in a group, and bare in mind that Zaela will fight him with you as an extra DPS.

{"id": "16769", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16769", "title": "Intercept (Classic)", "text": "Intercept is a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; ability similar to &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, available only in &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nIntercept is the &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt; equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intervene\"&gt;Intervene&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its stance requirement, Intercept is generally favoured by &lt;a href=\"warrior%20talents%23Fury\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; warriors (who cannot use Charge without stance-dancing), although Protection warriors with &lt;a href=\"Warbringer%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Warbringer (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; may also use it. Arms warriors generally prefer Charge.\nIntercept uses a Charge-like animation and stuns the target for 1.5 second, but costs Rage instead of generating it, and causes some damage. Intercept, like &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged weapons&lt;/a&gt; has a minimum range as well as a maximum. Intercept will auto-target the enemy so you don't have to even be facing them. This is most useful for when a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blink\"&gt;blink&lt;/a&gt;s or when your opponent attempts to run away or otherwise get out of melee range. Unlike Charge, Intercept can be used in combat.\nA warrior cannot do much damage unless they are in melee range. Most other classes want to stay out of a warrior's reach. Because of this, Intercept is perhaps one of the most important warrior abilities. As it is only usable once every 30 seconds, the talent ability &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Fury\"&gt;Heroic Fury&lt;/a&gt; can be extremely useful, allowing you to reset Intercept's cooldown once every 30 seconds. Also, set bonuses for 4 pieces of level 70 PvP gear reduce the Intercept cooldown by 5 seconds.\nIntercept is also one of the few ways a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; has to interrupt spell casters. &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intimidating%20Shout\"&gt;Intimidating Shout&lt;/a&gt; are others, along with some possibilities created by talents. With these three abilities, you can effectively keep a caster from casting any long duration spell. Some casting mobs root you to the ground before stepping back and starting their cast: they'll usually go far enough to be out of melee range, but not enough to intercept them; therefore you may have to step back as soon as the root effect ends to get out of the minimum range and use intercept.\nTricks.\nIntercept can be used while being knocked back into the air. This can be useful to avoid fall damage and quickly return to your target.\nIntercept is very similar to Charge - see &lt;a href=\"Charge%23Tips%20and%20tactics\"&gt;Tips and tactics&lt;/a&gt; for some tricks, strategies and novel uses."}

They can be joined and left by typing /join or /leave (followed by the channel name). \nFull screen \nBy default, the game is in full screen, which in some occasions, can be a drag, if you want to look at a web site that describes quests or a city while playing.\nOn a PC:\nOn a &lt;a href=\"Mac\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Macro\"&gt;Macro&lt;/a&gt;s \nThe game provides the opportunity to develop macros. Macros can be used to either say something when you need help, are out of mana, or anything else you can think of, or to cast spells.\nTo start a macro, you just need to type /macro. This will open a box that will ask you to enter the macro name (limit it to a few characters), enter the macro command, and pick an icon for that macro that you can put in your tool (spell) bar. Note that you can pick any icon you want for that.\nTo say something that you want people to hear, you just have to select one of the voice commands (found in the help menu) and type /v followed by that voice command.\nTo say something that you want people to read, just type the sentence in the macro box.\nTo cast a spell, type /cast followed by the spell name and its rank. For example /cast sleep (rank 2). If your spell is at level 1, you don't need to specify the rank.\nMages find this command very useful, especially when they want to put a mob to sleep and tell the party what they are doing while casting. As sleep is not instantaneous, this gives your party members time to stop their attack before you cast the sleep spell, hence avoiding to break it and hear you curse them.\nFor example, a spell + warning macro could be\n/cast sleep (rank 2)\n\u00bb&gt;Sleeping %t\u00ab&lt;\nThe above sentence is whatever you want to put in it. However, the %t will automatically indicate the mob name and be seen by your partners as \u00bb&gt;Sleeping Murloc\u00ab&lt;. This will be displayed as soon as you start to cast the spell (launch the macro).\nOnce your macro is ready, just drag its new icon in your spell bar and you are ready to use it.\nScreenshots \nYou probably all know that you can take screenshots by hitting the \"PrintScreen\" key.

Well, if you are a caster (especially a Priest) and want to quickly cast a healing spell on a party member, this can be difficult, especially if that member keeps moving.\nTo select a member faster, you should know that each party member is assigned a Function key. You are always F1, and others (in the order they icons appear on the top left of your screen) are F2 to F5. You got it, to cast a spell on one of these players, just hit the appropriate Function key.\nNote: This is also useful to see what kind of buffs or spells are afflicting that player.\nE-Mail: &lt;a href=\"mailto%3ACoolantKing%40hotmail.com\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ()\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mac\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; key shortcuts added by .\""}

Only the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;s managed to elude capture. The triumphant humans, however, all but tore their Alliance apart on what to do with their defeated enemies. While &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; believed the orcs would one day lose their lust for conquest, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; demanded their executions. They effectively settled on a sentence of life imprisonment, although disagreement and anger over the issue remained entrenched as nations left the Alliance in various frustrations.\nA number of large internment camps meant to house the captive orcs were constructed in southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Guarded by both the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the veteran soldiers of the Alliance, the camps proved to be a great success. Though the captive orcs were tense and anxious to do battle once more, the various camp wardens kept the peace and maintained a strong semblance of order. The camps' authorities were based at first in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. However, Azeroth had yet to see the end of orcish aggression - the rift to the orcish world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; reopened, and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; waged a new war against the Alliance before returning through a new Dark Portal. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to Draenor defeated Ner'zhul and the rift was closed, but not before some of his clans escaped the impending destruction of Draenor by fleeing to Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; that were not trapped on Draenor were finally imprisoned by the Alliance, although &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; managed to evade capture. The camps' wardens soon re-established control over their brutish charges.\nAs time passed more and more orc prisoners were rounded up and placed within the internment camps. As the camps began to overflow, the Alliance was forced to construct new camps in the plains south of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The corrupt &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Trollbane as chief warden, and &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; became the new center for the camps. Orgrim Doomhammer, the former Horde Warchief, had by then escaped from &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and gone into hiding.\nLethargy of the orcs.\nAmidst the Alliance's turmoil, many of the camp wardens began to notice an unsettling change came over their orc captives. The orcs' efforts to escape from the camps or even fight amongst themselves had greatly decreased in frequency over time. The orcs were becoming increasingly aloof and lethargic. Though it was difficult to believe, the orcs - once held as the most aggressive race ever seen on Azeroth - had completely lost their will to fight. The strange lethargy confounded the Alliance leaders and continued to take its toll on the rapidly weakening orcs.\nSome speculated that some strange disease, contractible only by orcs, brought about the baffling lethargy. But Archmage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; posed a different hypothesis. Researching what little he could find of orcish history, Antonidas learned that the orcs had been under the crippling influence of &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic power&lt;/a&gt; for generations. He speculated that the orcs had been corrupted by these powers even before their first invasion of Azeroth. Clearly, demons had &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;spiked the orcs' blood&lt;/a&gt;, and in turn, the brutes had been granted unnaturally heightened strength, endurance, and aggression. Antonidas theorized that the orcs' communal lethargy was not actually a disease, but a consequence of racial withdrawal from the volatile &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magics that had made them fearsome, bloodlusted warriors. Though the symptoms were clear, Antonidas was unable to find a cure for the orcs' present condition. Then too, many of his fellow &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a few notable Alliance leaders, argued that finding a cure for the orcs would be an imprudent venture. Left to ponder the orcs' mysterious condition, Antonidas' conclusion was that the orcs' cure would have to be a spiritual one.\nAs their lethargy increased, the orcs became even more apathetic and resigned to their fates. Fights, whether between two prisoners or between prisoners and guards, decreased in frequency until they were virtually unheard of. The once fearsome race of warriors had become a pitiful people to whom even moving around didn't seem worth the effort, and many prisoners could be seen sitting in their own filth. Because the prisoners at the camps had gone so long without making trouble, security measures became extremely lax. Since nobody ever tried to escape, fewer and fewer guards were assigned to each camp and the walls were easy to scale if one were so inclined, which no-one ever was.\nFall of the internment camps.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, a young orc found and raised by Blackmoore in isolation from his own kind, escaped from his master and set off to find others of his kind, buoyed by rumors of free orcs still evading capture. During his journeys, Thrall visited the internment camps and found his once-mighty race to be strangely cowed and lethargic. Having not found the proud warriors he hoped to discover, Thrall set out to find the last undefeated orc chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstantly hunted by the humans, Hellscream nevertheless held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. Aided only by his own devoted &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, Hellscream continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of his beleaguered people. Unfortunately, he could never find a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. The impressionable Thrall, inspired by Hellscream's idealism, developed a strong empathy for the Horde and its &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; traditions.\nAlso un-imprisoned was the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, which had never been part of either Doomhammer or Ner'zhul's Hordes, and whose &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;former chieftain&lt;/a&gt; was Thrall's father. Under the tutelage of their venerable &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall studied his people's ancient shamanistic culture, which had been forgotten under &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s evil influence. Over time, Thrall became a powerful shaman and took his rightful place as chieftain of the exiled Frostwolves. Empowered by the elements themselves and driven to find his destiny, Thrall set off to free the captive clans and heal his race of demonic corruption.\nDuring his travels, Thrall found the aged Warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, who had been living as a hermit for many years. Doomhammer, who had been a close friend of Thrall's father, decided to follow the young, visionary orc and help him free the captive clans. Supported by many of the veteran chieftains, Thrall ultimately succeeded in revitalizing the Horde and giving his people a new spiritual identity. To symbolize his people's rebirth, Thrall, who Blackmoore had intended to use as a puppet to control the orcs for his personal gain, returned to Durnholde and put a decisive end to his former master's plans to by laying siege to the internment camps. This victory was not without its price: during the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;one camp&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer fell in battle.\nThrall took up Doomhammer's legendary warhammer and donned his black plate-armor to become the new warchief of the Horde. During the following months, Thrall's small but volatile Horde laid waste to the internment camps and stymied the Alliance's best efforts to counter his clever strategies. Encouraged by his best friend and mentor, Grommash Hellscream, Thrall worked to ensure that his people would never be slaves again.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; gathered in an internment camp and from there they continued to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; from which they left Lordaeron.\nIn Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", the orcs were forced to live in \"reservations\", rather than camps. Encircled and watched from afar by Alliance forces, the orcs had built their own homes and some semblance of infrastructure, but soon enough lapsed into lethargy and their villages became dilapidated. Their captors plied them with \"&lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt;\" to keep them pacified. It was mentioned by Blackmoore that the orcs from the reservation were used as slave labor by the Alliance.\nSome allies of the orcs, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, were also kept in these reservations.

{"id": "16676", "revid": "28055547", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16676", "title": "Interrupt", "text": "Interruption refers to slowing or stopping a target's spellcasting. \nThere are two main types of interruption:\nInterruption caused by damage (pushback).\nWhenever a damaging spell or ability hits a caster mid-cast, the cast time will be set back by a given amount, slowing and delaying the cast. In contrast, pushback foreshortens &lt;a href=\"channel\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;led spells, causing them to end earlier without having had their full effect, but does not slow or delay them. Pushback therefore reduces the speed of cast-time spells, while reducing the mana efficiency of channelled spells. \nIn general any melee attack (be it a normal or a special attack) or &lt;a href=\"Direct%20Damage\"&gt;direct damage&lt;/a&gt; spell will cause interruption. &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt; spells and most &lt;a href=\"channel\"&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;led spells will not cause interruption. The only channeled spell which does is &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nCompletely &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt;ed damage does not cause interruption; however, as soon as a part of the damage is not absorbed, it does.\nResistance to pushback caused by damage can be provided by spells, either for the caster (&lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Veins\"&gt;Icy Veins&lt;/a&gt;) for a chosen target () or for multiple targets (). Some equipment can also reduce pushback (&lt;a href=\"Battlecast%20Garb\"&gt;Battlecast Garb&lt;/a&gt; 2-piece set bonus (level 70)).\nCertain passives reduce pushback substantially, such as &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Focus\"&gt;Divine Focus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Soul%20%28mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Burning Soul (mage ability)&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterruption caused by specific abilities.\nNumerous abilities can be used to immediately interrupt spellcasting. When a player's spellcasting is interrupted, their cast is immediately cancelled, and their cast time bar will turn red and say \"Interrupted\". Cast-time spells that are interrupted mid-cast will not consume mana, and any &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; will be cancelled, allowing the caster to immediately cast another spell.\nInterrupt abilities.\nAbilities that specifically interrupt spell-casting are known as \"interrupts\". These abilities generally do not cause damage, are instant cast and unaffected by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, allowing their use at any time. If a spell is successfully interrupted, they also cause a counterspell effect, preventing the target from casting any spell from the same school as the interrupted spell for a number of seconds. Counterspell effects provide no visual debuff and cannot be dispelled. Interrupts are available to all classes and specs, with the exception of Holy and Discipline &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nInterruption can be prevented by certain abilities, such as &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Resolve\"&gt;Unending Resolve&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Silence%20effect\"&gt;Silence effect&lt;/a&gt;s and many forms of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Fear%20effect\"&gt;Fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Horrify%20effect\"&gt;Horrify effect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Incapacitate\"&gt;Incapacitate&lt;/a&gt; effects and &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hex\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to interrupt a target's cast. Proper use of these abilities can be very effective for interrupting spellcasting, although they lack the counterspell effect of true interrupts.\nSome abilities incorporate both silence effects and interrupts. This allows for interrupt functionality against PvE targets such as bosses that are immune to silence effects.\nThe following is a list of abilities that specifically interrupt spellcasting. Note that a few of these abilities only provide interrupts for non-player targets. All of these abilities cause a counterspell effect, although the duration is variable. The below abilities are also all instant cast, and are unaffected by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rebuke\"&gt;Rebuke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Freeze\"&gt;Mind Freeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spear%20Hand%20Strike\"&gt;Spear Hand Strike&lt;/a&gt; are all fairly similar abilities; all require melee range, have a 15-second cooldown and lock the school for 4 or 5 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Bash\"&gt;Skull Bash&lt;/a&gt; is very similar, but benefits from a 13-yard range and also increases the victim's mana costs. &lt;a href=\"Counter%20Shot\"&gt;Counter Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Lock\"&gt;Spell Lock&lt;/a&gt; are likewise very similar spells, although durations vary, and Spell Lock has the advantage of being usable at very long range and while the Warlock is stunned/silenced/incapacitated, since it is cast by the &lt;a href=\"Felhunter\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt; pet. &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt; has the best overall counterspell/cooldown ratio, improved further by &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Kick\"&gt;Glyph of Kick&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Shear\"&gt;Wind Shear&lt;/a&gt; is available the most frequently, being the interrupt with the shortest cooldown (and duration)."}

Once the disciple is defeated, the adventurers will be brought back to the hub area and presented with a &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Chest\"&gt;Corrupted Chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile a single vision need not take long to clear, if only the main objectives are sought out, searching every nook and cranny may prove bountiful.\nObjectives.\nWe stand at the edge of N'Zoth's vision.

Remind yourself that it is all an illusion.\nWhen you are ready, we shall sacrifice the vessel and continue our mission.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFurther runs\nBosses.\nThrall will gain one new ability, as well as a 10% health buff, from each of the bosses that have been killed. Killing the bosses will result in obtaining a chest for each one killed at the end of the vision. The vision automatically ends when Thrall is defeated.\nAltars.\nHorrific Visions have a scaling progression system that can be activated called Faceless Masks. Each Faceless Mask that is used will increase the health and damage done of all creatures in the Horrific Vision. All 5 Faceless Masks share this same effect. If multiple masks are active, their effects are added.\nIn addition to the above, each mask has a unique effect."}

He explained to Garrosh that it was still connected to the other pieces on Azeroth, and could be used to bring them and Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; back there. Kairoz gave the shard to Garrosh, believing he was incapable of wielding its power.

This information would later be acquired by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, hunting for &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who upon deducing her movements informed &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; who informed &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. This information was later shared with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the Horde to realize that they had allied with the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, enabling them to inform &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;. Faced with this knowledge, Talanji rallied the Zandalari for battle, while the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; did the same for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnaware of the sequence of events that she had started, Visrynn frequently served as a scout in the conflict against Bwonsamdi. She joined the final battle against Bwonsamdi at his &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; where her actions caught up with her as the loa received reinforcements from the armies of the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. While Nathanos was able to escape the battlefield, and Sira was captured and taken prisoner. Visrynn's fate is unknown.\nSpeculation.\nAt one point in the conflict, Sira was noted to have fought harder, becoming enraged at the passing of her kin. Thus, as a fellow undead kaldorei Visrynn could have been among the dead that fueled Sira's rage. Alternatively, Visrynn could have found a way to escape the conflict as Nathanos had."}

The human tinker mage &lt;a href=\"Allavan\"&gt;Allavan&lt;/a&gt; was well-known for his use of technological devices to aid his arcane casting abilities. He found, through much experimentation, that many of the disadvantages arcane casters suffered could be countered through the appropriate use of science. One problem in particular was that if he found himself silenced, he couldn't cast spell with verbal components\u2014that is to say, most of his spells. To deal with this eventuality, he developed the voice amplification modulator, a technological device that replicated sound as a series of vibrations. Although he never perfected the item, he did find that it worked well enough to suit his purposes.\nThe modulator is a blocky piece of metal that fastens around the neck with a leather strap. The device's inventor claims that the voice modulator transforms the user's voice into a series of vibrations that approximate sound."}

It is connected to a compass that was previously in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and is currently in the care of his son, Aramar. &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, having already had a certain history with the compass, and the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;, are looking for it as well. It is pointing to crystal shards across the world.\nThe compass.\nDuring Aram's journey on the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt; and throughout &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, the compass was pointing southeast and east, and he thought it was pointing towards &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt; gave the following description for the compass needle: \"It is a shard of pure starlight from heavens, imbued with the celestial spark. It means the crystal needle is not of this world.\"\nThe Voice first called Aram while aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\", revealing that it needs to be saved. While in Feralas, it appeared in his dreams several times, but Aram felt that he was always turning away from the Voice. When it last appeared, it did not do so in his dreams, but rather it appeared in a vision when he touched the glowing compass' sliver of crystal after the object had forced itself to the ground, discovering a new crystal shard and creating a small crater near the border between Feralas and &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the end of the vision, he felt that this time, he did not turn away from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa&lt;/a&gt;, one from his group, awoke Aram and he told them about the Voice. They decided to continue their journey to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and resolve its mystery.\nUpon finding and joining the second shard with the first one, the Voice told Aram that there are seven shards that need to be joined into one. The crystals are a part of the sword called the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; which was previously in possession of &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, but he had betrayed someone and forfeit the claim.\nThe naaru.\nIt was eventually explained that the crystal shards (what the compass needle is) of the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; hold the essence of a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru lent its grace to shield &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;. It, in turn, was protected from the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Highlord Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Order of the Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; who was assisted by his brother, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru bestowed Greydon the Diamond Blade to give to the one he deemed best. However, Greydon kept it for himself, infuriating his brother, who stole the sword and went to defeat the dreadlord. However, the dreadlord convinced Silverlaine to join his side. Upon returning to the order, he killed the naaru, and the weapon shattered, its crystal shards blasting across Azeroth.\nDespite its destruction, the naaru's essence survived in the crystal shards and guided, Greydon, and later his son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; through voices and visions to gather the crystal shards, reforging the blade and fighting the demon lord in his &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Deeming the human unworthy, Xaraax took it upon himself to collect the Diamond Blade that was nearing to him with Makasa. What the dreadlord did not expect was that when he started corrupting the blade, his demise would come when Malus took the demon lord's former fel sword and impaled him on it, tossing him into the Darkstorm. The threat of the Darkstorm still present with Malus, Greydon, the young heroes, and former Hidden successfully repelled the demons with Makasa ending Malus' life. With his demise, the Darkstorm withered, and the Blade was safe and reforged, and the naaru preserved."}

They created the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s as physical manifestations of the Void, in order to corrupt and transform the &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;s they infested into places of despair and death. Nevertheless, the Void itself is not necessarily \"evil\"; it is a primal force with its morality characterized by how it is wielded.\nPure Void cannot exist within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; but shades of it manifest as shadow magic (or void magic) and can be a source of terrible power, the kind of power that comes at a price, as the very nature of the Void is hostile to what the mortal know as life and sanity, and will do whatever it takes to drive them to madness.\nThe Void cannot fully see destiny, though neither can the Light, for neither are singularly responsible for creation. The Void seeks every possible path and sees them all as truth.\nOrigins and characteristics.\nIn the very beginning of time, before even the cosmos existed, there was only the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and the Void. Originally, only the Light existed as an unfettered, shifting ocean of living energy. However, as some of its energies faded and dimmed, pockets of cold nothingness were created. From the absence of Light in these spaces, a new power coalesced and came to be. This was the Void, a dark and vampiric force driven to devour all energy, to twist creation inward to feed upon itself. The Void quickly grew and began to move against the Light, and before long, the mounting tension between the two forces ignited a series of explosions that ruptured the very fabric of creation, giving birth to the physical universe. The most unstable energies coalesced into an astral dimension known as the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Light and Void collided and bled together at the edges of this realm, throwing it into turmoil.\nThe &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their servants have seemingly been locked in a perpetual power struggle with the other five cosmic powers of reality for eons. The Void and the Light, being opposite counterparts, have been locked in perpetual conflict since before &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; itself began, waging their massive battle across countless worlds and planets and affecting millions of lives, with the Void regarding the Light as voracious and stagnant, \"a force that granted them fleeting moments of peace in exchange for absolute obedience\". The naaru &lt;a href=\"T%27uure\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt; notably sacrificed herself in a massive &lt;a href=\"%3AHoly%20Nova\"&gt;:Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; to save an entire world &lt;a href=\"Karkora\"&gt;Karkora&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the Void's servants apparently regard the naaru as \"beloved brethren that lost the true path\" which will return to their embrace eventually, despite their war being of a scope which would apparently destroy most mortal minds, well predating both the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the entire history of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It has also attacked the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; in eons past with forces described as practically \"infinite\", inflicting massive damage against &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in particular, and would have purportedly destroyed all of the Shadowlands had the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;s not barely managed to stop them.\nThe very creation of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and their nearly successful corruption of multiple &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; worlds, including &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, at least at one point in its history, was ultimately to corrupt all existence and allow the void lords to manifest in the physical cosmos; the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; have both attempted to oppose the Void in different ways, with the former being responsible for the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the latter unleashing his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; against them. The Void-corrupted titan would have allegedly been unstoppable by any force in the universe, including the Pantheon themselves.\nIn one instance, the Void was able to attack and permanently destroy every demon on a small Legion prison world, dragging them through the Twisting Nether before butchering them; &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; described even the Legion's enslavement as far preferable to the horrors of what the Void-spawn endured. The naaru which Illidan encountered before his defeat on Outland, likely &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the Void was \"a more potent foe by far than the Burning Legion\", &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Skyriss\"&gt;Harbinger Skyriss&lt;/a&gt; insisted that no force in existence, including the Legion, being able to make the Void's servants, as \"countless as the stars\", bend their knee, and according to &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion's invasion is ultimately futile, as dreams and demons alike can be corrupted, and not even the extinction of all things would really save the Legion from the Void.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; have attempted to manipulate the void lords, the Void appears somewhat aware of their machinations, and regards &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; as \"the true enemy\" which seeks the death of all possibilities and all futures.\nVoid realm.\nWherever there is light, there is shadow, and it is this shadow that the Orc &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt; uses to see into places he cannot travel with a spell called Dark Vision. Wherever the slightest shadow is cast, the sight of the Necrolyte can enter and view. The effects of this spell are limited in size, for too much knowledge of the confines of shadow has been known to forever trap the caster within the realm of darkness.\nOn , using a &lt;a href=\"%3AVoid%20Lantern\"&gt;:Void Lantern&lt;/a&gt; allows seeing into the void realm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt; is a plane of existence visited by the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; that is related to the Void.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zuraal%20the%20Ascended\"&gt;Zuraal the Ascended&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; sent the adventurers into the void realm.\nRaces of the Void.\nCreatures of the Void are naturally chaotic. They are a necessary part of the universe, but they must be kept in check by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s were created by the malignant entities known as the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s, and they live only to transform the worlds they infest into places of despair and &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Physical manifestations of the Void, they are nightmares incarnate: mountains of blighted flesh and writhing tentacles that grow like cancers within the worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Their goal is to find and corrupt a &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a dark &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; that would annihilate the universe.\nMany of the Old Gods' minions make extensive use of shadow magic, and the terrifying dagger known as &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, which was used by dark priests during the height of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, uses powerful Void energies and mind magics to warp everything around it for nefarious purpose. In &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20Horror\"&gt;Faceless Horror&lt;/a&gt;s surround themselves with shadowy barriers and summon &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s to aid them in combat. Twilight magic is presumably Old God magic of the void branch.\nVoid lords.\nThe &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s are evil entities composed of pure shadow energy. These beings are cruel and merciless beyond mortal comprehension. Driven by an insatiable hunger, the void lords seek to devour all matter and energy in the physical universe. In their natural state, the void lords exist outside reality. Only the most powerful of these entities can manifest in the physical universe, and only for limited amounts of time. To maintain their presence in reality, the void lords must consume untold amounts of matter and energy. They instead created the eldritch Old Gods to find and corrupt a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; and turn it into an unspeakably dark being that not even the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; would be able to stand against.\nDark naaru.\nIt is exceedingly rare for a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; to fall into a void state, and even rarer for a fallen naaru to be brought back into the Light. A naaru's fall into the void represents a catastrophic loss for the naaru and for the forces of the Light, and it is the saddest, most heart-wrenching event for the naaru to witness. Conversely, a naaru being reborn into the Light brings renewed hope and sense of purpose to every naaru.\nThe few cases of dark naaru that &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt; knows of all involved mortals in some way, which he thinks carries fascinating implications.\nVoidwalkers.\n&lt;a href=\"Voidwalker\"&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s are seemingly the most common type of Void being. Enigmatic and emanating pure demonic fury, a voidwalker is sometimes the last thing someone encounters before crossing over into death. They do not fear pain, so they are popular with &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who do.\nOthers.\nThere are many different types of beings that originate from the Void. Although they aren't &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, they are often classified as such for gameplay reasons. In \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", most void creatures are classified as either &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"aberration\"&gt;aberration&lt;/a&gt;s (although the &lt;a href=\"void%20revenant\"&gt;void revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nhallish\"&gt;Nhallish&lt;/a&gt; is classified as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;).\nUses.\nShadow abilities are able to impart feelings like despair, doubt, and panic, while the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is often said to bring about feelings of a positive emotion such as hope, courage, comfort and the like. In a poetic sense, it can be said that the emotions which the Light brings about come from the \"heart\", whereas the emotions manipulated by shadow are often based on survival logic, and therefore affect the \"mind\". Shadow priests preach balance between &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and Darkness, for it is often too hard to find one's way back to the Shadow from the deepest reaches of the Void.\nShadow magic can be used to damage, drain, curse, &lt;a href=\"Corruption\"&gt;corrupt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Bomb\"&gt;weaponize&lt;/a&gt; the enemies' minds, notably by harnessing the shadows into &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;bolts of incendiary energy&lt;/a&gt;, or through the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Word\"&gt;Shadow Word&lt;/a&gt;s. It can be used to become &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;invincible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dispersion\"&gt;protect oneself&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Blades\"&gt;empower weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Purify%20Disease\"&gt;remove diseases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; behind someone, and to &lt;a href=\"Hungering%20Void\"&gt;weaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Vision\"&gt;see through&lt;/a&gt; a target's eyes. It can also deliver great amounts of immediate damage, or wracking pains that punish foes over longer periods of time. Drawing on their dark powers causes Shadow priests to accumulate &lt;a href=\"Insanity\"&gt;Insanity&lt;/a&gt;, which they use to fuel their potent spells of &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;psychic agony&lt;/a&gt;. They can assume the &lt;a href=\"%3AShadowform\"&gt;:Shadowform&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3AVoidform\"&gt;:Voidform&lt;/a&gt; - distinctive auras that increase their powers. They can even call down beings from the Void itself, conjuring &lt;a href=\"shadowfiend\"&gt;shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"mindbender\"&gt;mindbender&lt;/a&gt;s to assail their enemies.\nThrough the shadows, healing can be sacrificed to deal damage, and damage can be &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt; into healing. The Void can also be used to &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; the dead or in the case of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe void can be used to create &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28spell%29%23Lore\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; of teleportation. &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;Void elves&lt;/a&gt; can use their powers to create a &lt;a href=\"%3ASpatial%20Rift\"&gt;:Spatial Rift&lt;/a&gt; and instantly teleport on a short distance.\nDespite the risks, many have sought to harness this corruptive magic, and those who tried have fallen into madness. Determined to use this power for the good of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was the first mortal to succeed at defying the shadow's whispers, after being trained by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;. Coming to the aid of a group of her kin who nearly gave in to the darkness, Alleria trained these void elves to control the shadows within them, to keep control and fight the voices from the Void in their mind. This assault is relentless and the discipline needed to resist them is extraordinary.\nSome priests also pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one\u2019s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues, they dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies\u2014always exercising immense discipline to keep themselves away from the brink of insanity.\"\nEffects on beings.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, when the Void is invited into a heart, it ends in madness. Wielding its power creates a hunger for more power, which can be a trap. Once someone starts using the shadow, they will belong to the Shadow. When Alleria reached out for the Void, dark power flowed into her and she could feel the maddening whispers flooding her thoughts, giddy and raving. Wielders of this power can also receive terrible visions from the Void, including visions of the future which can seem true but are actually strong and intoxicating lies that lead to madness, as the Void cannot fully see destiny, and will do everything it can to shatter the will and sanity of its wielders, using their fears and loves to achieve its goals. The voices say many things, from lies, to things that are true from a certain point of view, things that sound true, and things that one would wish were true.\nThe Void can consume life or meld with it, but the latter often has unperceived consequences. Rumor has it that some beasts that were touched by the Void exist in a space between this world and the next. When a &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; is consumed by the Void, an echo of the soul is all that is left behind. Neither in the physical or spiritual sense of the word would these echoes be considered alive. The echo is merely a twisted reverberation of the anguish left behind by the soul as it is consumed. These twisted echoes of the dead are merely the distorted reflections of once noble spirits.\nThe &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are beings who have died and become trapped between life and death. One of the consequences of the involvement of Void in the undead's metaphysics is that they only feel faint sensations of pain or discomfort from most physical stimuli. This is also why the Light is so painful to their existence. The dark energy serves as a buffer that prevents the souls of the undead from properly joining their bodies. As a result, their souls are imperfectly attached to them.\nPractitioners.\nThe most common practitioners of shadow magic are called &lt;a href=\"shadowcaster\"&gt;shadowcaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadowmage\"&gt;shadowmage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShadow priests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s fully embrace the opposing polarity between the Light and the Void, their faith equally resolute as their holy counterparts\u2014but focused on shadowy magics and mental manipulation. Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship\u2014but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods. To truly understand such ancient, corruptive influence is to be driven mad. This is the state in which these dark priests thrive, embracing insanity and feeding off of the minds of their opponents to reach terrifying new limits.\nShadow hunters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20hunter\"&gt;Shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are masters of &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and shadow magic and were once the highest authority amongst &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, walking the line of dark and light in hope of saving the future of trollkind, doing whatever it takes to secure a future for their kin.\nRogues.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rogue%23Subtlety\"&gt;Subtlety rogues&lt;/a&gt; are the masters of the shadows. They don't have the lethal poison-tipped daggers of the assassin or the brawling prowess of the outlaw, but their acumen on the battlefield and ability to hide in plain sight are unrivaled. Some claim the art of subtlety looks like malevolent shadow magic\u2014but no matter from where their power is derived, they are capable of performing devastating assaults on their enemies, slipping away unharmed to strike again without detection. Most rogues train their entire lives to learn how to walk in the shadows\u2014subtlety rogues were born there.\nNecrolytes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s are a type of &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who use the dark energies of the Void, they are binders of souls and command the black powers that hold control over the earth.\nWarlocks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are magical practitioners who seek to understand darker, fel-based magics, including destructive spells. Warlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle. Their greatest abilities are fueled by the souls they've harvested from their victims and they exploit powerful shadow magic to manipulate and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They harvest the souls of their defeated enemies; those specialized in the ways of demonology use this life essence to tap into the Void, pulling all manner of abomination from the chaos of the Twisting Nether. Affliction warlocks are masters of shadow-touched powers, but unlike shadow priests\u2014deadliest when pushed to the brink of insanity\u2014these warlocks delight in using fel forces to cause intense pain and suffering in others.\nDark shaman.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; are spiritual guides and practitioners of the very elements, one way to become a &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; is to use the Void, as shadow magic is capable of dominating and enslaving them.\nOn , a group of dark shaman of the channeled Void energies near in , using the elements to channel the darkness of the void. The dark shaman also used &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Beacon\"&gt;Nether Beacon&lt;/a&gt;s, powered from within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; itself, to connect to the void, and hidden behind the veil of the Twisting Nether, the abominations of the void began marching upon .\nArakkoa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; are a collection of broken and flightless &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; who revere &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, and use &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt; similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Shadow\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s are followers of &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; that wield dark powers of the Void. They use special &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadow%20Sight\"&gt;elixirs&lt;/a&gt; to cross over into a realm of shadows, which is also where they sealed Terokk after he descended into madness.\nAges ago on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;, guided by tales of their god &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and his noble sacrifice, investigated the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. By carefully studying the cursed pools, they unraveled the mysteries of shadow &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and developed the unique ability to combine the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Embracing both Light and Void, the Apexis believed they were both natural parts of life. Two factions formed within the Apexis: the Anhar order studied holy magic, while the Skalax studied shadow and arcane magics. Both groups occupied the upper echelons of arakkoa society, sharing equal prestige and influence.\nDarkfallen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; are known for their guile and dark magic, particularly the manipulation of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and shadow magic.\nNaga.\nTransformed into &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the naga were once &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, members of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s court. During the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara pledged her allegiance to the Old God in order to survive the torrents that would drown them all. Since this moment, the naga have served the interests of the Old Gods for over ten thousand years and are therefore capable of manipulating shadow magic.\nNathrezim.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as dreadlords, are cunning, manipulative, and masters of the arts of shadow magic, for which they dedicated their existence to mastering it.\nVoid elves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; imbued with the Void's energies have been transformed into &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;. Under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her teacher, &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt;, the two known mortals who were able to successfully defy the Void's whispers and truly resist its corruption while wielding its powers. These ren'dorei, the \"Children of the Void\" have established a base at &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, and much like Alleria herself, have re-pledged themselves to their original faction, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoid elves gain new powers such as &lt;a href=\"%3AEntropic%20Embrace\"&gt;:Entropic Embrace&lt;/a&gt; to enhance their abilities with the power of the Void, while apparently retaining most of their previous abilities. They also have the ability to create &lt;a href=\"Spatial%20Rift\"&gt;Spatial Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing them to teleport through space and distance instantly. Void elves have a &lt;a href=\"%3APreternatural%20Calm\"&gt;:Preternatural Calm&lt;/a&gt;, which gives them an unwavering focus when casting spells even when in pain. Although having the power of the Void at their command has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. Void elves must constantly resist the whispers of the shadow that attempt to lure them into madness. The Void seeks to strip away the void elves of their flesh and their mortality so that they may become slaves to the shadow's all-consuming hunger. Furthermore, so long as the void elves pulse with void energy, they also become a beacon for other creatures of the void. If they cannot corrupt the void elves, they will use them to corrupt other powerful sources, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoid ethereals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Void%20ethereal\"&gt;Void ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s are ethereals infused with the power of the Void. Their energies are dark purple or red. They also hear maddening whispers that sway them to do the will of the Void. &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%23Nexus-stalkers\"&gt;Nexus-stalkers&lt;/a&gt; are a partially Void-based form of ethereals created by the rogue &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; faction, and are considered by the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt; to be aberrations. Though the Ethereum was initially dedicated to hunting down and taking revenge on Dimensius, their goal later changed to \"becoming void.\" To that end, they constructed a proto-accelerator which was used to manipulate the abundance of Void energy at &lt;a href=\"Manaforge%20Ultris\"&gt;Manaforge Ultris&lt;/a&gt;, bonding it with their own energy to transform into nexus-stalkers.\nThe physiology of a nexus-stalker is similar to that of a typical ethereal, albeit with hybrid bodies composed in part of Void energy. As such, they appear translucent and perpetually emanate a shadowy, purple miasma. Those that have been encountered have had the ability to drain their enemies' power.\nOrganizations.\nBlack Empire.\nThe prehistoric &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; formed and ruled by the Old Gods while they worked to corrupt Azeroth was, ultimately, formed in the name of the Void. It enslaved the elements and engaged in endless civil wars, seemingly for the amusement of its masters. Though toppled by the coming of the Titans, it continued to fester in the shadows of Azeroth as the Old Gods enacted their millennia-long plans to escape confinement. In the end, it re-emerged when &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; successfully escaped its prison and all of its servants, now consisting of corrupted mortals, as well as the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and aqir that originally formed its rank, wield Void magic. In areas that the Black Empire assaults, the sky darkens and resembles the Void as well.\nCult of the Void.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Cult of the Void&lt;/a&gt; is a cult of worshipers who covet the gifts of the Void. From high atop her temple within &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, they were led by a Void-twisted &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; who transformed her most devout followers into unstoppable horrors. It is unknown what remained of the cult after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight's Hammer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; is a nihilist quasi-religious sect, active across Azeroth, that fanatically serves and worships the Old Gods and seeks to bring about the end of the world. Originally founded by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; as a clan of &lt;a href=\"Pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orcs&lt;/a&gt;, the cult has been active since before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; but became a major worldwide after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; and the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that shattered Azeroth. A book of the sect named &lt;a href=\"The%20Twilight%20Apocrypha\"&gt;The Twilight Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; states that in the beginning there was shadow eternal and implies the elements were born from it and that the shadow is the \"world we know\".\nCult of Forgotten Shadows.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadows&lt;/a&gt; is a cult that believes that dark energy practitioners are just as vital to the survival of life and reality as wielders of the Light. The cult preaches balance, mandating that &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s must never forget the dangers of falling too deep into the dark energies they manipulate, for it is often too hard to find one's way back to the Shadow from the deep reaches of the darkness. The cult was created through the (re)discovery of the teachings of &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; priests in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the capture and refurbishing of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternate Shadowmoon clan.\nThe is &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; clan on . When the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; strong-armed the Shadowmoon clan into joining them, broke one of their ancient laws forbidding the use of the power drawn from the '&lt;a href=\"K%27ara%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Dark Star&lt;/a&gt;', and they became powerful wielders of the Void. The clan later tried to summon the Dark Star, the darkened form of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt;, to the surface of Draenor and wield it as a weapon. Their effort failed when used his &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;-force to purify K'ara. This didn't, however, stop the Shadowmoon from practicing Void magic. They retreated into their ancient burial grounds and continued to experiment on the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s and bones of the dead. Ner'zhul was eventually slain by adventurers, and the rest of the Void practitioners seemed to join in the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft I.\nWherever there is &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, there is shadow, and it is this shadow that the orc &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt; uses to see into places he cannot travel with a spell called Dark Vision. Wherever the slightest shadow is cast, the sight of the Necrolyte can enter and view. The effects of this spell are limited in size, for too much knowledge of the confines of shadow has been known to forever trap the caster within the realm of darkness.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Shadows are the dark, malevolent forces seeking the world's (or even the universe's) dissolution; the \"light\" includes the virtuous, heroic forces preserving order and goodness. Their deeds and the powers they wield make up the stuff of legends... if not myths. The Shadow Plane is an integral part of the universe, woven into every other plane of existence. It is from here that spells conjure shadow magic. The arcane and shadow magic appear to be tied together.\nThe shadow energy (aka Shadow Plane) is not limited to a single plane; it is instead an integral part of every aspect of the universe, woven into every plane. Thus, spells that call upon this energy, such as shadow conjuration, draw upon local sources rather than reaching to another plane. Positive energy remains associated with the energies possessed by living beings, and negative energy with the motive forces of death and the undead. Magical weapons that have effects wielding this energy draw upon energy bound into their own material, freed by enchantment. \"Shadow\" is a spell type common to many items and spells created by the Shadow Council and other such nefarious organizations. The arcane and shadow magic appear to be tied together. Shadow appears to be split into subcategories or is synonymous with \"Darkness\", \"Negative\", \"Death\", \"Destruction\", \"Chaotic\", \"Evil\", and \"Fel\". It is a damage type often found as a bonus type damage (enchantment or enhancement). In one example it's also a sub-school of the magic school of Illusion (illusions composed of a quasi-real, tangible shadow material with shadow bonuses, ex. Storm, Earth and Fire). Spells of shadow may derive their power from actual shadows &amp; darkness.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20ascendant\"&gt;Shadow ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s, followers of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of the Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, become one with this power as their physical form fades away. Some &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s revere these creatures as dark &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;."}

The versioning stub included in all Dongle libraries is called DongleStub, and is based off Iriel's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.iriel.org/wow/addondev/embedlibrary1.html\"&gt;embedded framework design&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than include DongleStub as a separate file in the distribution, the core Dongle libraries have the latest version of DongleStub included or built into the file distribution.

Typically the answer to this question is \"Yes\", and this is the purpose for profiles.\nWhen you initialize a database, you are able to supply a defaultProfile, which specifies the profile that will be used if the user hasn't already selected one. By default this is \"Charname of Realmname\", so each user will start off with character specific profiles by default.\nThe power of profiles is that another user can \"Select\" any profile in the system, and the options and data will be shared between those two users. This means you can configure Clique for one of your characters, log onto a second character, and select the exact same configuration on another character, without needing to set it up again.

We could also call /hellow Hello Azeroth! and it will instead say \"Hello Azeroth!\" in game.\nSlashCommandObject:InjectDBCommands(db, ... ).\nRegisters easy to use slash commands to manipulate or set profiles\nExample.\n local cmd = DongleObject:InitializeSlashCommand(\"Hello World\", \"HELLOWORLD\", \"hellow\")\n local db = DongleObject:InitializeDB( \"HelloWorldDB\", defaults );\n cmd:InjectDBCommands( db, \"copy\", \"list\", \"set\" );\nAdds /hellow profile copy, /hellow profile list and /hellow profile set to the list of slash command options.\nSlashCommandObject:PrintUsage().\nPrints the usage statement of the given slash command."}

However, Kazzak found an artifact to reopen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and traveled through the portal to Outland, where he now commands the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s war effort in Outland in the name of his master, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.

Engage Kazzak normally and watch the raid's HP. When he is about to enrage (usually at 15 seconds left),\nhave the whole raid move away from him, except for the main tank and the Paladins. Once Kazzak enrages, have the Paladins use their shields and start overhealing the tank. The shields should last until the enrage is gone. Then, the rest of the raid can move in again and continue DPS. Shamans should save Bloodlust/Heroism until this point. You'll have to kill him this time; it's not very likely that you will survive another enrage. If your Paladins are not very well-equipped, the main tank should use Shield Wall when Kazzak enrages. Still watch the raid HP and dispel twisted reflection.\nAlternatively, you can simply survive his Enrage, as the damage can be resisted and absorbed. Simply stack enough stamina gear and buffs to get everyone to around 9k and pop healthstones and/or potions during the enrage.\nQuotes.\nWipe:"}

The doomguard are utterly devoted to their &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; masters and revel in the destruction of worlds. They serve as commanders of the Legion front-line forces, and are versatile in the use of fire magic and dark curses, as well as melee attacks.\nHistory.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; freed them, the doomguard were the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;'s hounds forever enslaved to police the use of arcane magics. &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Sacrificial magic&lt;/a&gt; was considered the greatest violation of life and the doomguard were attuned to instantly punish those who delved into such sorcery. After freeing the doomguard, Sargeras recruited them into the Burning Legion as enforcers and shock troopers.\nThey arrived for the first time to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where the doomguard were used to keep the warriors in line. While flying above the ranks of every regiment, they watched for disorder, ready to correct their brethren with a quick flash of a whip.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, they participated in the invasions of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, they hunted &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; on orders of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and commanded &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nDoomguard are huge, winged figures with blazing green swords, molten armor, and cloven feet. They are taller and more intelligent than their demonic brethern, guiding them from above while flying with their wings of fire. The doomguard are cunning beings and can see through mist far better than their foes.\nWith their savage weapons and horrific faces, the doomguard is a terrible foe to confront and behold. These monstrous, fiery warriors are said to be nearly immune to magic and can defeat entire armies with their sheer strength alone. However, the \"War of the Ancients\" trilogy showed that they are indeed vulnerable to magic, as demonstrated by magic-wielding characters.\nNotable.\n Referred to as a doomguard but is depicted as a &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe doomguard, or doom guard, is a demonic &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurning Legion.\nWhen mortals recall the brutal terror of the Burning Legion's armies, they would likely think first of the doomguard. These ironfisted demons serve as the Burning Legion's captains and generals. Countless worlds have fallen to their brilliant and ruthless military tactics. A doomguard's prowess at commanding large-scale battles does not reduce the demon's hunger for personal combat. In any conflict, a doomguard brings their powerful demonic abilities to where they can do the most damage, viciously slaughtering enemy troops. While most doomguard remain unquestioning and loyal servants to the lords of the Burning Legion (nathrezim and pit lords, among others), some ascend to this tier of command themselves and are among the most powerful demons in the Legion. In fact, most demons that remain in Azeroth after the failure of the second invasion are now under the control of various doomguard lords, ruling from such places as &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fearsome doomguard once served as Archimonde's personal escorts. Although they were often called upon to perform a number of duties for the Legion, their loyalties lay with him alone. The doomguard were left to their own devices after Archimonde's defeat at the World Tree on Mount Hyjal. They now roam the universe serving as mercenaries for whoever will have them. They enjoy wearing large breastplates emblazoned with the symbol of Archimonde despite his defeat. They believe he will one day return to rule them once more. Despite their appearance and disposition, doomguard are sought after for service. These monstrous, fiery warriors are nearly immune to magic and can defeat entire armies with their sheer strength alone.\nCombat.\nDoomguard begin a battle by sizing up their foes. A doomguard generally uses shadow strike and unholy aura before entering combat, and focuses first on what it considers the most dangerous opponent, which is usually a spellcaster. It uses shadowburn or its quickened immolate to finish that opponent. After one enemy is down, the doomguard focuses on the second biggest threat, picking off each opponent one by one. It may also use area attacks such as rain of fire or hellfire, especially if the doomguard is accompanied by allies that are immune to fire damage, possibly showing concern for the survival of their allies. \nThey cast deeper darkness if they believe their opponents will not be able to see through it, covering their actions while they cast additional spells. Fire storm is their first choice against seemingly powerful opponents who might not be ready with abjurations against fire. A doomguard will even cast fire storm with itself in the area, taking advantage of its immunity to fire. Detect magic determines if greater dispel magic would be useful against particular opponents. Doomguard will cast immolation as soon as possible when facing multiple opponents who may not be immune to the flames or if opponents may try to use cold attacks against them. When there is enough time to prepare even more spells, doomguard cast unholy aura and dispel good on themselves. They follow these actions up by wading into melee.\nWhen two or more doomguard work together, one will engage in melee while the others cast cripple on potentially dangerous melee foes. After that, they prefer to split up and engage separate melee targets. They doom stomp when faced with two or more opponents in range who might be dazed and knocked prone by the effect. They almost always doom stomp when faced with four or more potential targets in range. If the battle is going poorly, a doomguard will cast demonic doom on a remaining melee foe. Doomguard usually try to teleport without error to disengage once injured enough. They cast spells from a distance while their allies continue the fight. Once all doomguard are injured enough they all teleport without error to escape. If the battle is going well, doomguard take their time finishing off opponents. They cast unholy blight to watch and be amused as their foes are sickened by the effect. The doomguard are often armed with falchions, but individual doomguard have also been known to also favor scimitars, longswords, or greatswords (most of them similarly enchanted).\nDescription.\nMost doomguard are members of the ered'ruin race, who once served as &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s personal escorts. Although they were often called upon to perform a number of duties for the Legion, their loyalties lay with him alone. The doomguard were left to their own devices after Archimonde's defeat at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. They now roam the universe serving as mercenaries for whoever will have them. They enjoy wearing large breastplates emblazoned with the symbol of Archimonde despite his defeat. They believe he will one day return to rule them once more. Whether or not this will happen is a matter of opinion, but the fact remains that thousands of Doomguard still serve the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s command. Unlike the felguard or many lesser demons, the doomguard have intelligence on par with most of Azeroth's major races, and are most often used as taskmasters to keep the &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s in line. A typical doomguard stands about 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,000 pounds, though some become much larger.

He stands beside the road leading out of the swamp to the south and warns travelers of the dangers of the Blasted Lands, which consumed him and his men.\nHistory.\nThe hero was a warrior of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; named Trebor who was specifically chosen to travel to the Blasted Lands with a group of assembled men. He learned of the horrors and the location of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; within the Blasted Lands and sent a scout back to &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; with this information. However, his orders were intercepted by an ambush of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s led by the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Talker\"&gt;Swamp Talker&lt;/a&gt;. After weeks of waiting for orders that never came, Trebor moved into the Blasted Lands to investigate; this proved to be unwise, as his troops were captured by the demonlord &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; and his henchmen. It is unknown how many of his men were tortured and who specifically, but it is known that at least his lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Kirith\"&gt;Kirith&lt;/a&gt;, was tortured along with Trebor himself.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Coil\"&gt;Serpent's Coil&lt;/a&gt;, their souls were used in experiments. Trebor escaped only to die shortly after. Kirith was not so lucky. His soul twisted, he now roams in the back cave of the Serpent's Coil as a huge &lt;a href=\"felhunter\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt;; you must kill him to free Kirith's soul. The rest of Trebor's men were forced to serve under &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Allistarj\"&gt;Archmage Allistarj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sevine\"&gt;Lady Sevine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grol%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Grol the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;. Trebor - now known only as the Fallen Hero of the Horde - remains near the entrance to the Blasted Lands, hoping to enlist adventurers to free his enslaved men and finish the mission he never received.\nQuotes.\n\"(For original quotes, see questline.)\"\nWould you believe that in my darkest hour, at the apex of my being, I failed.\nAs I fled from the wanton destruction of the forces that overwhelmed us, the only sounds I could hear were the screams of my soldiers and the rapid beat of my own heart.\nA short while later, I returned to the Blasted Lands in hopes of rescuing my men and restoring my honor. Instead I was captured and beaten until dead.\nWhat I found out during my inquisition and subsequent torture was horrifying.\nMy captors were cruel beyond measure, &lt;name&gt;. They would alternate between Lieutenant Kirith and I, torturing one while the other watched. During a lull in the activity of an especially brutal day, Kirith told me what had happened to my men and a plan he had been formulating to free them from their masters.\nThey suffered a fate worse than death, or even the pain Kirith and I endured.\nNeither you nor I could possibly imagine the pain an individual suffers when their soul is ripped from their body. They are not dead and by no means are they alive. Instead, they walk the land, servants of those that bind them to this world.\nLord Razelikh, demonic overlord of these lands, enslaved them all. Nine he took for his own, placing stones of binding near the Dark Portal. The remaining nine were divided up between his subordinates.\nThe archmage Allistarj of the Shadowsworn was granted three. Lady Sevine, warlock of the Shadowsworn was also granted three. The remaining three were given to Grol the Destroyer, lord of the Dreadmaul ogres of these blasted lands.\nYou see, &lt;name&gt;, without a soul, the body cannot be killed. The remnants of my men are now indestructible fighting units. Thankfully, they are bound in how far they can travel by the stones of binding.\nThey are exactly what you need to destroy in order to free the regiment! As I had told you earlier, Kirith had a plan.\nEach of the servants does have a weakness. Punish their physical form in proximity of their stones until they are near the state of disintegration. It is at that point, and that point alone, that the stones of binding are vulnerable to attack. You must hurry to destroy the stones, however, as once the enslaved regain their composure, they will be invulnerable to harm once more.\nI with it were true, &lt;name&gt;, but it will take more than you alone to overcome the forces of Razelikh and his subordinates.\nGather a suitable group of adventurers and would-be heroes and free my men of their eternal torture! Eighteen stones you must shatter.\nFight hard and die with honor, &lt;name&gt;.\nQuests.\nAfter the Shattering, he serves no purpose but before the Cataclysm, The Fallen Hero was involved in a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; quest chain, and a very long quest chain connected to the Blasted Lands. The initial quests for the Blasted Lands chain differs by &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, but the majority of the chain was &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt;. This quest line gave a large amount of experience if completed at level. The completion of the first 19 stages of the Horde side chain (&lt;a href=\"Fall%20From%20Grace\"&gt;Fall From Grace&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20the%20Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Return to the Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;) returned significant gold and experience as well as a trinket, the &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20the%20Splithooves\"&gt;Shard of the Splithooves&lt;/a&gt;, and an anti-demon piece of &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Azsharite%20Fel%20Weaponry\"&gt;Enchanted Azsharite Fel Weaponry&lt;/a&gt; used for completing the quest line."}

This trio of bosses is a &lt;a href=\"council%20encounter\"&gt;council encounter&lt;/a&gt; where they must be killed together.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and Shado-Pan guardians of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; were caught in the epicenter of the devastating blast that scarred the Vale, and torn apart by the dark energies. Their spirits linger in the place they once protected, confused and tormented by their failure.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Once we decided to permanently change the face of Pandaria by having the power unleashed by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; ruin the eastern half of the Vale, a natural query was what would become of the beloved Golden Lotus questgivers who had steadfastly tended to the Vale throughout the expansion. This encounter answers that question\u2014you may earn some epic items from the Golden Lotus one final time.\"\nOverview.\nPlayers battle the brewmaster Rook Stonetoe, the rogue He Softfoot, and the priest Sun Tenderheart, as the three Fallen Protectors assault the raid simultaneously. At 66% and 33% health remaining, each Protector performs Desperate Measures, manifesting spirits of fallen allies to bring new and powerful attacks to bear against the raid until those spirits are defeated.\nStrategy.\nThis is a two tank fight and can be two healed if geared and confident, but the enrage timer is generous so three healing is easily do-able, with an even mix of dps. \nRook is tanked facing away from the group to avoid the damage from his Vengeful Strikes. Dps and healers need to watch out for his Corrupted Brew. By itself the damage is negligible, but coupled with his Corruption Kick or Sun's Calamity the damage can ramp up quickly.\nSoftfoot is tanked on top of Sun to allow cleave damage until he activates Noxious Poisons at which point the tank pulls him away from the middle and kites him around the room till it expires, making sure to always turn away and run a short distance when he casts Gouge.\nSun does not need to be tanked and ranged and healers should be spread loosely to avoid the damage from her Sha Sear. Bane should be cleansed as soon as possible to avoid it jumping to additional targets. \nRook is targetted first to 66% at which point Misery, Sorrow and Gloom will spawn. The Rook tank picks up Misery (which is killed last), He's tank picks up Gloom (which is killed second), while Sorrow is burned down. Those marked with Inferno Strike should run into melee to split the damage. If there're not enough melee to compensate a meeting point can be designated. A dps which low cd interrupts should be assigned to help the He tank keep Gloom locked down to avoid having to burden the healers with Corruption Shock. After both Sorrow and Gloom are down, melee should jump on He, while ranged focus on Misery. This is to avoid any extra damage if people are slow in getting out of Defiled Ground. \nHe should be close to 66% at this point which will cause Embodied Anguish to spawn. Anguish marks a random player with inflicts 50k damage to it's target every second while also increasing their vulnerability to damage from anguish itself. If the marked person is one with strong personal cds (frost mage, DK, etc.) they CAN keep the mark for a period of time while the rest of the raid burns it down before passing it, but most times it is best to simply pass it off to the He tank as quickly as possible. Again the tank should position himself on top of Sun to keep damage on her. \nOnce Anguish is dealt with and He respawns next is Sun. Tanks need to watch their timers here as it would be bad to enter Sun's Dark Meditation field while Rook is casting Vengeful Strikes or He has Noxious Poisons active. The main focus of Sun's Desperate Measures is to stay inside her field as much as possible while aoeing down the adds Despair and Desperation send against you. Cd's should be used liberally if damage starts to ramp up (as if Rook casts Corruption Kick).\nFrom then it's just a matter of rinse and repeat with getting Rook, then He, then Sun to 33% then to 0%. Once you get past Sun's 33% Desperate Measures it is vitally important that everyone is aware of how much health each boss has. Once one hits 1% you have ten seconds to bring the other two down as well otherwise the currently defeated mob will heal to 20%.\nAchievement: Go Long.\nEarning &lt;a href=\"Go%20Long\"&gt;Go Long&lt;/a&gt; takes place during He's Deperate Measures phase (when the Embodied Anguish is active). At least five raid members (perhaps more) should stand in a circular shape and pass the Embodied Anguish between them over a total distance of 200 yards or more before passing it off to the He tank. The maximum range for passing Embodied Anguish is 40 yards, so it is doable with 5 raid members with careful planning.\nThe raid should however keep in mind that incoming damage will ramp up the more times that Embodied Anguish is passed, due to Shadow Weakness stacking up.\nSpeculation.\nThe bodies the Fallen Protectors use for their Desperate Measures adds clearly resemble the Golden Lotus forces, yet several of them, including &lt;a href=\"Ren%20Firetongue\"&gt;Ren Firetongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anji%20Autumnlight\"&gt;Anji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kun%20Autumnlight\"&gt;Kun Autumnlight&lt;/a&gt; all appear alive in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20Rise\"&gt;Ruins Rise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Setting%20Sun%20Garrison\"&gt;Setting Sun Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; later clarified that the Desperate Measures spirits are merely \"projections of negative emotions\" and not corrupted protectors."}

Intentionally doing so may be an &lt;a href=\"exploit\"&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also happen unintentionally due to &lt;a href=\"Bug\"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nFor various reasons, the player may fall through or under the game world, usually resulting in death after a long fall. The effect of dieing in this way is identical to falling off &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Release%20Spirit\"&gt;releasing&lt;/a&gt;, the player's &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; is moved above ground to make returning to it possible. In some cases, the corpse is not moved and the player is forced to resurrect using a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;. Because players are not expected to end up under the game world, &lt;a href=\"Zone\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt; are not accurately defined there. As a result, the player may find themselves very far from their corpse after releasing.\nCause.\nFalling through the world can happen as a result of intentional behavior or bugs beyond the character's control.\nA curious player may attempt to navigate out of regular zone boundaries. Upon doing so, they may find an unused area of the game, often flat and barren. This is where holes in the game world are usually found. Walking into such a hole will result in the player falling through the world.\nPlayer &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; that involve movement may also result in falling through the game world. For example, &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; will teleport the player through walls or terrain on rare occasions."}

Such acts of generosity on Arthas's part quickly earned Falric's genuine respect, forging a bond of companionship that was to last for decades to come.\nFalric was present when &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived at Capital City asking &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; for assistance.\nHe assisted Arthas throughout his campaign, from the investigation at &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; all the way to the icy roof of the world, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; itself. There, Falric managed Arthas's base camps and held the line against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. He did this with the assistance of two other lieutenants under Arthas, &lt;a href=\"Luc%20Valonforth\"&gt;Luc Valonforth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Arthas went in search of the ancient &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, Falric was left in charge of their encampment, repelling the siege by Mal'Ganis. Finally, Arthas returned with Frostmourne. When asked where Muradin was, Arthas told Falric that he was dead.\nWhen the final battle came, Falric fought alongside Prince Arthas against the last bastion of Mal'Ganis, claiming victory.\nArthas vanished into the frozen wastes with Frostmourne. Eventually, he emerged a changed man. Falric wandered off to find Arthas, but Arthas butchered him and raised him as his first death knight. &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; set off to find both Falric and Arthas, but Falric murdered Thassarian. Ultimately, Arthas slaughtered an entire regiment of soldiers from the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt; and raised them into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Falric was one of the first &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, Falric and Marwyn accompanied Arthas back to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They stood at Arthas's side as he walked into the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; and murdered his father. It was Falric and Marwyn who had the task of slaying the citizens of the city, raising them as undead using their newly gained powers.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nFalric, alongside &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, made his first appearance in \"World of Warcraft\" as a boss of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, third wing of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;. They both were killed by the adventurers of the Alliance and Horde.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Falric was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nCharacter division.\nIn \"\", most of the captain's lines from \"&lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Reign of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\" were attributed to Falric, but an unnamed captain spoke with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Emissary\"&gt;Alliance Emissary&lt;/a&gt;. In a \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, that captain was named &lt;a href=\"Luc%20Valonforth\"&gt;Luc Valonforth&lt;/a&gt;. , a galley winner, noticed that people might confuse Falric and Valonforth, and pointed out the issue to Medievaldragon of &lt;a href=\"Blizzplanet\"&gt;Blizzplanet&lt;/a&gt;. Medievaldragon contacted &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that since she finished writing the book before the release of \"Wrath of the Lich King\", she had not known about the flashback quest involving Valonforth. Medievaldragon contacted the editors and informed them of the possible inconsistency. The editors agreed to include Valonforth in the book to ensure the clear difference between his character and that of Falric. Thus it was confirmed that the captain from \"Reign of Chaos\" was divided into separate characters, though Falric retains the most lines and appearances and is the only one playable in-game."}

Formerly a Lordaeron captain serving at the right hand of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during his campaigns against the Scourge, he and his friend &lt;a href=\"Marwyn%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt; became powerful Scourge commanders when their prince turned to evil, and now defend his inner sanctum.\nFalric becomes active on the fifth wave of the gauntlet of ghosts (based on Human units, \"Lordaeron soldiers\", from &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;) spawned to block intruders, and must be defeated in order to continue the gauntlet to the final battle with Marwyn.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"This champion of the Scourge was among the first death knights created by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; after claiming &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Falric loyally followed his prince on a doomed campaign to Northrend only to be rewarded with betrayal by the prince he served faithfully all his life.\"\nBosstiary.\n\"Arthas' most trusted captains during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Falric and Marwyn, were dragged into damnation with the prince, and the two played a large part in the destruction of Lordaeron. Now among the foremost of the Lich King's death knights, they serve as staunch defenders of their master's private chambers.\"\nStrategy.\nFalric will begin by unleashing the four waves of adds, a random assortment of the following mobs, in increasing numbers each wave:\nThe trash proximity aggro on whoever is closest when the mobs become active. Thus, the easiest way to handle the waves is to stand in the entrance hallway or the alcoves with Falric with the tank on point so that the tank, and not the healer or squishy DPS, winds up with initial aggro. This makes it much easier for the tank to pick up the mobs. The priests should be taken care of first \u2013 Dark Mending heals for a very large amount if it is not interrupted, Shadow Word: Pain deals a good amount of damage, and Circle of Destruction and Cower In Fear can be very dangerous if they hit the heal;er, as they interrupt heals that could save the tank at the last second. The rest of the pull can be dealt with as the party sees fit, though rogues (mercenaries) are usually dealt with second because of their powerful poisons on the whole group and their stuns on the tank which lead to threat loss and sometimes aggro loss. Do not underestimate undead-capable crowd control if things get out of hand.\nAt wave 5, Falric will become active and attack. His Defiling Horror is very dangerous, and can easily kill someone if they are not healed to full or do not have enough health (16000 damage on heroic mode). Since it is a horror effect, it can not be dispelled by normal conventions, so the most can be done is just healing through it after the fear has gone off. Shadow resistance buff or aura helps mitigate some of the damage. Counteract the fear as much as possible and dispel the Impending Despair. Hopelessness will get stronger as Falric loses more health, so players dying to the fear is more of a liability than usual. After Falric dies, there will be a momentary pause before Marwyn begins the gauntlet again."}

Nevertheless, at the incentive of &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad continued to Khaz Modan. Later, with the help of a clan of &lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad reached &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and fought in the final battle there to free the Red Dragon Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Aerie Peak and the Wildhammer Clan, went to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad stayed in Aerie Peak to succeed him as the High Thane.\nWorld of Warcraft era.\nFalstad used to appear as a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located at &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; where he dealt with the encroaching forest trolls.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;'s takeover over, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad being said to be representing the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; returned from Outland around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Kurdran told him that he is not needed for the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; as Kurdran wanted to be the representative. Kurdran journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and while there he realized that Falstad was better person for this job.

Falstad forgave Kurdran for not trusting him and he became the Wildhammer representative in the Council of Three Hammers.\nCataclysm era.\nFalstad Wildhammer was relocated from Aerie Peak to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt;, ruling &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. He has a dwarf NPC named \"&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Fact%20Checker\"&gt;Wildhammer Fact Checker&lt;/a&gt;\" standing beside him. He learned about the attack on &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt; and thought that Moira was unable to control her people. Moira then found the traitor - &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;, working with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult - and she had him imprisoned.\nThe three rulers were visited by &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; who was looking for Magni. The Council could not help her and Falstad laughed at how rude Li Li was.\nBlood in the Snow.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;dwarven capital&lt;/a&gt; by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But what the King did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and Falstad declined to offer aid in Ironforge\u2019s defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the Dark Irons would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, then Ironforge will fall under siege. Only &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons will prove their loyalty to the Council, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nThe High King, his champions, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; worked together to save Ironforge. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nWar Crimes.\nFalstad, alongside other Alliance leaders received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; inviting them to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and was present in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jade Hunters.\nFalstad was in favor of combining &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt; as a team to help rebuild the Jade Serpent statue.\nFault Lines.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; awoke from his petrification and asked to see his former city, Falstad began to complain, saying that the dwarves were in an uproar and wondering about the future of the council, to which Muradin replied that they should let the former king take some time to get his head straight. The council then began to discuss the repercussions of Magni's return, with Falstad saying that the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt; would never kneel to a Bronzebeard king. However, Magni simply replied that he had not come to reclaim his crown. He then uttered a grave warning about the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return and set off to warn the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders.\nLegion.\nFalstad along with the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt; event. He commanded a wing of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;Wildhammer Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalstad attends the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and says the skies weep for him.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Falstad can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBefore the Storm.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad welcomed King Anduin Wrynn who had gifted &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; ten wagons of &lt;a href=\"%3ABarley\"&gt;:Barley&lt;/a&gt;. They celebrated the gift with a feast, but left with Muradin and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to let Anduin and Moira speak. Later on, he was one of the Alliance leaders summoned by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting. Falstad heeded Magni's plea for healers to heal Azeroth and Anduin's discovery of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Falstad noted that with enough Azerite, they could shatter the Horde.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFalstad and his gryphon &lt;a href=\"Swiftwing\"&gt;Swiftwing&lt;/a&gt; can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived to assist &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; in the war effort against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Shaw asked for him by name. He encountered &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Denyelle\"&gt;Dark Ranger Denyelle&lt;/a&gt; while clearing out any resistance and opening communication with the war back home.\nFalstad led a squad of Wildhammers as part of &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s mission to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to hunt &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt;. He saved the adventurer from a trap set by &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, and led a bombing run on Horde boats.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, the forces led by &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; began an operation to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; harbor's defenses. Falstad provided transport for &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; to plant bombs on the \"&lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Pa%27ku\"&gt;Breath of Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;\", and brought the adventurer aboard \"&lt;a href=\"Gral%27s%20Call\"&gt;Gral's Call&lt;/a&gt;\" when it discovered the Alliance base at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;. He and Shandris captured &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zalkran\"&gt;Captain Zalkran&lt;/a&gt;, who was captured and brought back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalstad also participated in &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, directing champions on various missions.\nHe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad was present at Stormwind where he learned that the armistice ending the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was signed. Though willing to give peace a chance, he vowed that while he can forgive, a Wildhammer never forgets.\nDragonflight.\nFalstad joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and visited the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nAs a follower.\nFalstad Wildhammer is a &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign%20followers\"&gt;War Campaign champion&lt;/a&gt; with the following abilities:\nIn the RPG.\nFalstad has had to lead the Wildhammer Dwarves in their conflict against local troll tribes. Falstad also noticed the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; just beyond the horizon, and knew that one day his people would have to make a stand against the undead as well. To this end, he sought to increase the Wildhammers\u2019 ties with the Alliance without actually joining, which put him in an interesting position. Since he had not officially joined the Alliance, he lacked their full support; but the Horde did not consider him an enemy either. He had to decide if joining the Alliance would be beneficial enough to risk the wrath of the Horde, but his people leaned more in that direction, especially with many of them working side-by-side with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; clan and the few remaining high elves. Eventually, the Wildhammer clan decided to officially join the Alliance.\nAs a member of the party that freed the &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Dragonqueen&lt;/a&gt;, and a personal friend of her mate &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, he is one of the most respected humanoids in the eyes of the red dragons. While he has yet to call upon their favor, Falstad considers flying to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; to ask for aid, or just to discuss matters with the dragons.\nDue to his fighting prowess against dragons, Falstad is often known as \u201cFalstad Dragonreaver,\u201d but his real last name is (like &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;) that of his clan: Wildhammer.\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Wildhammer can take ye anywhere ye need to go.\nRelatives.\n&lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; might have been his ancestor.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Jaruk suffers in silence as the draenei body count grows around him... but that all changes when he saves a little draenei girl named &lt;a href=\"Leena\"&gt;Leena&lt;/a&gt; and adopts her as his daughter. The battle that follows pits brother against brother, where the stakes are not just Leena's life, but Jaruk's very soul.\nPlot.\nAt least two times, Jaruk tries to help draenei escape, but is always thwarted by J'argg showing up to kill them, who already suspects his brother of what he deems treachery. When J'argg wants him to kill a small draenei girl, Leena, whose parents he has just slain, Jaruk instead attacks J'argg and blinds his left eye, escaping with the girl as the attack of a &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; distracts his brother.\nHeading into &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, the pair's travel is delayed by a &lt;a href=\"marsh%20beast\"&gt;marsh beast&lt;/a&gt;, allowing J'argg's raid party to catch up, but Jaruk is able to stir a hive of &lt;a href=\"fireflies\"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;, which attack the approaching orcs. With the help of Jaruk's worg mount &lt;a href=\"Fang%27gar\"&gt;Fang'gar&lt;/a&gt;, which has followed them as well, they are able to escape again.\nThis time, Jaruk and Leena seem to have found freedom. Jaruk adopts the girl and raises her, teaching her the old ways of his people. After some years, Fang'gar passes away, leaving Leena in tears of mourning. However, for her next \"birthday\" (anniversary of the day Jaruk rescued her) he gets her a young pup, which she names &lt;a href=\"Pebbles\"&gt;Pebbles&lt;/a&gt;. That very night, she takes her new pet out to hunt boars for breakfast, but is discovered by J'argg and his men, taking her as hostage and confronting Jaruk in the cave that was their temporary home. Jaruk charges at them, but is subdued and forced to finally drink the Blood of Mannoroth. His eyes turning to a red glow like the others', he is given a dagger to kill Leena, but instead pierces J'argg's throat, and then dispatches the rest of the enemies. But J'argg manages to drive his sword into Jaruk's back, until Leena finishes him. As Jaruk lies dying, the elements return to grant him one final vision: that of his daughter as an adult shaman, working together with draenei, orcs and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt; to restore the balance of the elements.\nSpeculation.\nThe spider that bites Leena is most likely a &lt;a href=\"Skittering%20Cavern%20Crawler\"&gt;Skittering Cavern Crawler&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe plant that Jaruk picks in Zangarmarsh to heal Leena from the spider bite might be &lt;a href=\"Dreaming%20Glory\"&gt;Dreaming Glory&lt;/a&gt; as, in-game, it slowly heals over time the one that has picked it. Additionally, it most likely acquired its name due to its tendency to make users drowsy which can be seen in the story as both Jaruk and Leena fall asleep after its use. However, the story seems to imply that the plant only grows in Zangarmarsh but Dreaming Glory can be found in all zones in-game."}

Fandral played a key role in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, but lost his only child. His planting of &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt; unintentionally induced the later appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the architects of the plan to create &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and believed that the future of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; demanded more expansionism and military planning. His radical beliefs and aggressive demeanor often led him to quarrel openly with the High Priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. After it was revealed that he had been corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; and had prolonged Malfurion's absence, Fandral eventually descended into madness and was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. He was later captured by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; on route to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and turned into the first &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druid of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the new &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20of%20the%20Firelands\"&gt;Majordomo of the Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, until he was killed during the final battle against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nAll &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s must sleep in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; from time to time, including Fandral. However, Fandral still managed to sire a son, &lt;a href=\"Valstann\"&gt;Valstann&lt;/a&gt;. While often abrasive and hot-tempered, he truly loved his son and took a paternal interest in him even as he reached adulthood and married. Valstann's wife was a night elf named &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt;. Fandral's mate died giving birth to Valstann, meaning that the young man and his wife were effectively the only family Fandral had.\nThe Curse of the Worgen.\n700 years after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, because of the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe's&lt;/a&gt; widespread &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; was created by Malfurion to regulate the misuse of druidism. Fandral was present for the founding.\nCreation of the Emerald Nightmare.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Fandral took branches from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, and planted them over &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to appear across the world, including a particularly large source of saronite in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Five of these became the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Trees\"&gt;Great Trees&lt;/a&gt;, and he named the World Tree he planted in the Grizzly Hills &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Crown of the Snow\". &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Cenarion Circle became furious upon learning that these branches had been planted without their approval. They did, however, agree that the plan seemed to have worked. For several decades, Andrassil towered over Northrend, and all seemed well. Yet in time, circumstances changed. Bloody battles erupted between the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s of Northrend, two races not known for their warring ways. The fighting was sudden and shockingly vicious, filled with barbarism and unspeakably vile acts. Word slowly reached the druids, and the Cenarion Circle launched an expedition to investigate the source of the violence.\nWhat the druids found chilled them to their marrow. Andrassil's roots had reached so deep into the earth that they had touched &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s subterranean prison. The Old God had infused the tree with its foul energies, and thus all living creatures in the area were slowly being driven to madness. The Cenarion Circle knew that, without the blessing of the Aspects, Andrassil was vulnerable to corruption. They were also aware that there was no way to spare the World Tree or ease its suffering. The Cenarion Circle decided that the only recourse was to destroy Andrassil. It was renamed Vordrassil, or \"Broken Crown.\"\nAlthough killing Andrassil had been a heartbreaking task, the Cenarion Circle was pleased it had stopped the growth of saronite. Yet unbeknownst to the druids, something dark had taken root in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Yogg-Saron had used the trees planted by Fandral as a doorway into the Dream - a doorway through which the other Old Gods could grasp the ethereal domain and well. Small seeds of corruption were spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. In time, these seeds polluted the dreamways. This marked the beginning of what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Shifting Sands.\n1,000 or so years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Fandral would come to know personal loss on a scale most of his people had not experienced since the Sundering. It began in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, the furthest southern extent of the night elves' territory at that time. For thousands of years, the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; had to rebuild their forces in the name of their dread god &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. It fell to the night elves to give battle, and it fell to Fandral to lead the kaldorei against the qiraji. With his son &lt;a href=\"Valstann\"&gt;Valstann&lt;/a&gt; at his side, Fandral proved an able and creative general. He was in fact so talented that the qiraji even gave him a name: Kar'sis, or \"Hand of Earth\" in their native language. Try as they might, the qiraji could not beat him and the night elves under his command. Although the qiraji &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; believed that the night elf defense was untenable and that they would eventually fall, his twin emperors &lt;a href=\"Vek%27nilash\"&gt;Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vek%27lor\"&gt;Vek'lor&lt;/a&gt; were not willing to wait for a victory of attrition. They ordered Rajaxx to find a way around the Hand of Earth. And after a time, Rajaxx perceived that Fandral only allowed himself one weakness, one deviation from his otherwise iron control of himself: his son was his one weak point.\nA diversionary attack on &lt;a href=\"Southwind%20Village\"&gt;Southwind Village&lt;/a&gt; lured the eager Valstann into a defense that proved to be a cunning trap. Valstann's forces were slain and the younger Staghelm brought to the front lines by Rajaxx. The General of the qiraji proceeded to brutally murder Valstann in front of his father. Stunned, Fandral lost the will to fight, and soon, the night elves were forced to retreat through &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro\"&gt;Un'Goro&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, where the arrogant qiraji forces staged an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; just as the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was in fact refusing to aid the night elves. This one attack would bring the remaining dragonflights together for the first time since &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal, ultimately ending in the sealing of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;.\nVictory could not console Fandral, of course. The loss of Valstann was a blow he was wholly unprepared for, one he could not absorb. He smashed the Scepter against the walls of the qiraji city and stormed away, disgusted with the entire world.\nCreation of Teldrassil.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves lost along with the world tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, their immortality. Shortly after that, Malfurion entered a deep coma, when Fandral Staghelm ambushed him in his barrow den. No one knew why, and no one knew how to wake him. His absence left the leadership of the druids to Fandral Staghelm, who became the new archdruid. Fandral was the primary contact between the druids and the High Priestess during the period when Malfurion was in the Emerald Dream.\nBefore his coma, Malfurion opposed Fandral's plan to grow a new World Tree. After Malfurion fell into his coma, Fandral met with the other druids from the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and, without Malfurion to argue against him, convinced them of the wisdom of creating the new World Tree. Together, the druids, most believing Fandral's claims, created &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Through these druids\u2019 efforts, Teldrassil was planted off the coast of northern Kalimdor, and the bulk of night elven society took up residence atop the new World Tree's mighty boughs. This act, however, was not blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; the way Nordrassil was. Fandral personally asked &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; but they refused. Teldrassil grew rapidly into a massive and majestic tree that towered over the northern shores of Kalimdor and became the new home of the Kaldorei, but all was not right with Fandral's new world tree. The night elves did not regain their immortality, and corruption soon began to spread through Teldrassil. &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt;s, and several other foul creatures made their homes in it.\nFandral, as the leader of the Cenarion Circle, soon proved an even more contentious and abrasive leader than would have been apparent from his past behavior. He clashed regularly with Tyrande Whisperwind, the chief priestess of Elune and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, the de facto military of the night elves. Believing in night elven superiority and the need for an aggressive military action against the invading orcs of Durotar, Fandral seemed almost to be regaining his old vigor and drive lost at Valstann's death. However, he also displayed a distressing sense of egotism and even outright disgust towards the tauren druids taught by &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, one of Malfurion's students.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nArch Druid Fandral Staghelm was a level ?? &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located at the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in the night elf city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, leading the Cenarion Circle. A vision from the past was shown during &lt;a href=\"A%20Pawn%20on%20the%20Eternal%20Board\"&gt;A Pawn on the Eternal Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the character responds to the archdruid's call for aid, they are first asked to bring a number of samples of the soil of Un'Goro back to an assistant. The archdruid then explains their program for researching &lt;a href=\"morrowgrain\"&gt;morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt;, which they know little about. By growing morrowgrain for the Cenarion Circle, the character is given a bag of various goodies - food, water, some potions, and elixirs. And the need of the circle for more morrowgrain for research is endless - provide them more, and they will give more of these goody bags.\n&lt;a href=\"Quintis%20Jonespyre\"&gt;Quintis Jonespyre&lt;/a&gt;, a druid found in &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, was concerned with why Fandral was using the name of the Cenarion Circle, as well as the Circle's resources, to procure vast amounts of morrowgrain. Quintis had heard that morrowgrain, under the right conditions, exuded qualities like other herbs used in primitive curses. Fandral himself, however, claimed to be researching the properties of the grain when grown in the soil found in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. Fandral seemed to regard his colleagues in Moonglade in low regards, calling them fools. &lt;a href=\"Mathrengyl%20Bearwalker\"&gt;Mathrengyl Bearwalker&lt;/a&gt;, his second, explained that there was a mistrust between Fandral and Remulos.\nFandral also ordered the elimination of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; because of their claims that night elves evolved from trolls.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nRecently, Fandral met the druid and his human companion . Broll had returned to Darnassus to report the cleansing of the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Staghelm suggested that since Broll planned further quests with his friends, the Idol would be safer with the archdruid. Bearmantle agreed, though Lo'Gosh expressed doubts about Fandral's trustworthiness.\nLater on, using the idol he summoned Broll through visions back to Darnassus.\nReturn of Malfurion Stormrage.\nAt some point in the months following the Lich King's defeat, Fandral gathered many druids to Teldrassil, unfolding a master plan to heal the giant tree. , and were among those he called. He intended to use the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this, against Bearmantle's better judgment. Before the ritual could be completed, however, Tyrande arrived, having been warned by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; that Malfurion's life was in greater danger than before. It was discovered that rather than purifying the tree, Fandral was, in fact, responsible for its being corrupted in the first place. He was the one responsible for grafting a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; onto Teldrassil and he was the one who led the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in feeding their powers to the World Tree, thus feeding its corruption. Fandral however, was no longer in control of his own actions. Rather, he was an unwitting pawn and puppet of the father of all satyrs, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, who had been transformed into a tree by Malfurion during the War of the Ancients.\nXavius, in his guise as the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;, servant of the entities behind the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;'s encroachment on the dream, had appeared to Fandral in the form of his son Valstann. Fandral had never been able to reconcile his failure to save his son, and the visitations played on his guilt and rage, eventually driving him to a kind of madness that blinded him to the truth. He chose to believe that Valstann had returned and that all of his actions at \"Valstann's\" urging were for the greater good. Using &lt;a href=\"morrowgrain\"&gt;morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt; to keep Malfurion trapped in the dream, grafting a branch of Xavius' nightmare form onto the young Teldrassil, anything and everything Fandral did he did believing it would fully restore his son to life.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; had discovered Fandral\u00b4s betrayal, Fandral silenced the three and had them imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. Only after Malfurion returned to free them was the truth finally revealed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; Fandral's delusion ended up being forcibly shattered, as the image of Valstann was destroyed and he fell into a state of near-catatonia. Malfurion managed to defeat Xavius, but Fandral was left a broken husk, forced to endure the loss of his beloved son for a second time. After the Nightmare's defeat, the druids brought Staghelm to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s former prison in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that he would recover, though many suspected that his mind was permanently broken.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough he was initially said to be moved to Moonglade, he was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt; began their assault the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Alysra\"&gt;Alysra&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; would wish to use him and his knowledge of the night elves for nefarious purposes, decided to have him moved to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; for security. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; was concerned with this action, believing it to be a poor idea. Ysera's fears were not unfounded. As it turned out, Alysra herself was an agent of Ragnaros, and delivered Fandral straight into the hands of the Firelord and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, they managed to restore Fandral to a state somewhat resembling sanity, and Fandral's fury over his beloved son's demise is reinvigorated - and Fandral sets out for revenge.\nHis vision appears in a series of flashbacks with his daughter-in-law &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt; and granddaughter &lt;a href=\"Istaria\"&gt;Istaria&lt;/a&gt;, such as visiting Valstann's grave near &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horde's assault into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; increased in ferocity, Leyara lost her and Valstann's child during the Horde onslaught. Fandral approached Leyara, herself disillusioned by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;'s neutrality with the Horde, and she accepts his invitation into the new order of corrupted druids serving &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;. He has acquired a number of powerful fire-based druid abilities, including various new forms.\nFandral himself became the newest chief lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, and has replaced &lt;a href=\"Executus\"&gt;Executus&lt;/a&gt; as the Firelord's Majordomo. Fandral later reappears before his &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;former mentor&lt;/a&gt;, and attacks &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; after he and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; arrive to assist the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Having deemed that the \"Twilight Prophet\" had declared Thrall a great obstacle, though unable to kill him, Fandral corrupts his bonds with the elements, shattering Thrall's essence into several raw emotions.\nNow empowered by Ragnaros as the new &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20of%20the%20Firelands\"&gt;Majordomo of the Firelands&lt;/a&gt; and the Archdruid of the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, Fandral seeks to bring ruin to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; rather than live in a world without his beloved child. During his time in the Firelands, Fandral would often grow bored and work shaping magic on the local flora and fauna.\nUltimately, Fandral makes his final stand in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged, he demands that his followers bring &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; to him - alive - though Fandral falls before the heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, closing the final chapter of the Staghelm dynasty. Years later, his creation, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, was burned down by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nA projection of Fandral appears in &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Maxdormu\"&gt;Professor Maxdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s history lesson about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemoved content.\nTactics.\nOne of the most difficult Alliance faction leaders, he appears to be a powerful Balance druid, using a 1 sec &lt;a href=\"Wrath\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt; (1100-1300 Nature damage), Force of Nature (summons treants), and his most powerful ability: casts AoE &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt; followed by an extremely potent &lt;a href=\"Hurricane\"&gt;Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;. Players who do not escape it as soon as possible will need serious healing to stay alive.\nIn the RPG.\nArchdruid Fandral Staghelm is among the most ancient of the remaining night elves, having been born about a thousand years after the Sundering (making him over 9,000 years old). Despite his relative youth compared to other night elves such as &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, Fandral rose to prominence in the Cenarion Circle. His enormous physical stature (standing well over 8 feet tall) and quick temper marked him as a physically dangerous, powerful druid, and while he often clashed with his mentor, he was considered one of Malfurion's most gifted students and top lieutenants.\nQuotes.\nIf you are here to waste my time, then you are wasting the time of the Cenarion Circle as a whole. For your sake, let us hope that you are not foolish enough to be doing just that.\nIn Hearthstone.\nFandral appears as for the druid class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"\"Always manages to mention \"Back when I was creating the &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;\u2026\" in EVERY conversation. Sheesh! Enough already.\"\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "13053", "revid": "30741107", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13053", "title": "Specialization", "text": "Specialization, commonly known as spec, defines a player's abilities, strengths and role in the game depending on their &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. \nAt level 10 each character is able to choose a specialization. Selecting a specialization will determine:\nDescription.\nChoosing a specialization is the most important choice a player will make after choosing their character's class. It can dramatically alter the character's playstyle, determine their role in combat, and grant them numerous powerful new abilities. Most classes have 3 possible specializations, the exceptions being Druids who have 4 and Demon hunters who have 2, with each representing a different direction in the character's training and a different approach to playing the class.\nEach specialization is designed to perform a specific combat role - &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, ranged &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; or melee DPS - and the active and passive abilities granted to characters of that specialization are designed to form a playstyle appropriate to that role. For instance, Protection &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s have numerous abilities to improve their defenses and draw the &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; of several mobs at once, making them perfect for tanking, while Holy paladins have a range of powerful healing and protective abilities, making them adept at healing and aiding their allies. While many abilities are shared by all members of a given class, the additional abilities provided by a character's spec make them capable of performing their determined role to a high standard.\nWhile many specializations are capable of assisting in roles other than that designated for them (such as providing additional healing, damage or off-tanking), a player's role is largely determined by their choice of specialization. For example, a Holy &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; has a number of damage-dealing abilities and can deal a fair amount of damage if necessary, but cannot compete with the damage output of a Shadow priest, while a Shadow priest is capable of providing emergency healing to teammates if need be, but cannot compete with the healing capabilities of a Holy priest.\nSome classes - sometimes called 'pure' classes - have the same combat role for all their specializations, while others - known as 'hybrid' classes - can perform a number of combat roles depending on their specialization. However, even for pure classes, each specialization has its own character and playstyle, different strengths and weaknesses, and offers a significantly different experience of the class. For example, all &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s deal ranged DPS, regardless of their spec. However, Affliction warlocks excel at &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; effects, cursing their enemies and slowly draining their health, while Destruction warlocks focus on demolishing opponents with fast, powerful direct damage spells.\nEach spec has its own strengths and will excel in different situations. For example, some specs are considered to be more desirable for PvE, while others may be considered better for PvP. Additionally, as each class shifts and evolves over the course of patch changes, so each spec changes in its relation to the class. There are often \"flavor of the month\" specs, that may perform far more impressively than other specs, while certain specs may be considered to be fairly weak. However, bear in mind that such details change rapidly and frequently, and the enjoyment gained from playing a given spec is usually far more important than its perceived effectiveness during the current patch.\nBy determining combat role, choice of specialization can also determine secondary factors such as which stats, gear and bonuses are favored. For example, healers may seek items that grant &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;, while tanks may choose to wield shields and may seek stats like &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. This often leads players to accumulate separate sets of gear for each spec they play. Similarly, for hybrid classes, choice of spec may determine which attribute is increased by that character's &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Specialization\"&gt;armor specialization&lt;/a&gt; bonus. The armor specialization bonus is a 5% increase of your primary attribute while wearing your correct armor class (plate, mail, leather or cloth) in all slots. Tanking specs will gain &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;; plate-wearing melee DPS specs will gain &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;; leather and mail wearing DPS specs will gain &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;; and healers and caster DPS specs will gain &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt;.\nChoosing a specialization.\nSpecializations become available at level 10. When a character reaches this level, they are able to select a specialization, and will be prompted to do so. Specialization can be chosen through the &lt;a href=\"Specialization%20%26amp%3B%20Talents\"&gt;Specialization &amp; Talents&lt;/a&gt; window. This can be accessed by clicking on the appropriate icon on the interface bar at the bottom of the screen, or by pressing the N key (if you haven't unbound it or bound the key to a different action). From this window, selecting the Specializations tab will list the specializations available to your class, and display some information about each.\nThe Specialization tab features a panel for each possible specialization. Each spec's &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt; are provided along with some flavor text; beneath this a few key abilities are listed, intended to give the player some insight into the specialization's character.\nChoosing a specialization is simple: just select your desired specialization and click 'Learn'. Choosing a specialization will cause you to immediately learn all abilities available to that spec at your current level, including passive abilities and any additional secondary &lt;a href=\"resource%20mechanics\"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormerly, when a character's specialization has been chosen, it could not be changed without visiting a &lt;a href=\"class%20trainer\"&gt;class trainer&lt;/a&gt;. Trainers would reset the character's specialization for a small fee. Unlearning a specialization will cause you to unlearn all specialization-specific abilities and bonuses. Changing your specialization is known as re-specialization, or 're-speccing'. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, you may now change between any of your specializations anywhere provided that you are not in combat. \nUpon reaching level 30, characters could train in &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Talent%20Specialization\"&gt;Dual Talent Specialization&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to switch back and forth between two 'specializations', each with its own specialization, talents, glyphs, and action bars. Note that, despite the name, these 'specializations' are not actual specializations: rather they are two alternate customizations of your character. Each of these 'specs' can be altered and re-specced separately, and may choose the same specialization if desired. This feature can be useful for allowing players to alternate between two sets of customizations without re-speccing, saving gold and time spent. For example, a warrior may choose to play dungeons as Protection (Tank), but prefer to quest as Arms (DPS); or a player may have a PvE build and a PvP build, even if both share the same specialization.\nAs of Patch 7.0.3, all classes now have a default specialization which is selected automatically at the beginning of the game (for example, a Paladin's default specialization is Retribution). This was reverted in Patch 9.0.1, where characters once again start with no specialization.\nWith the removal of Core Abilities tab of the &lt;a href=\"Spellbook%20%26amp%3B%20Abilities\"&gt;Spellbook &amp; Abilities&lt;/a&gt; menu in Patch 7.0.3, the core abilities are now displayed in the Specialization menu.\nClass specializations.\nBelow is a complete list of the specializations available to each class. For a full list of active and passive abilities granted by each specialization, click on the name of the spec, eg. &lt;a href=\"Priest%20abilities%23Specializations\"&gt;Discipline&lt;/a&gt;."}

You get a feel for the flows of power. You get a sense of the souls of the living and unliving.\"\nBackground.\nAs a mark of favor for professing his loyalty, Sargeras gifted Illidan with demonic eyesight. Sargeras shot forth twin tentacles of dark green flame through the Well of Eternity portal and poured it into Illidan's eyes (the soft tissue seared instantly). Supernatural fire continued to pour into his blackened sockets even after the last bit of the eyes had long burned away. The flames suddenly withdrew and there was no sign of the eyes. There now burned within twin flames, fiery balls of the same vicious hue as that which had wreaked havoc on the sorcerer. The fires burned wildly for several more seconds...then faded until they seemed but smoky remnants. The smoke, however, remained, neither dwindling away nor growing stronger.\nWhen his full consciousness returned, his world was suddenly filled with a maddening display of colors and violent energies. Recalling the words of Rhonin, he focused so that it all comes together. Illidan forced order upon matters. The colors began to organize, the energy to flow with regularity and purpose. Shapes began to form from the natural energies inherent in all things, alive or inanimate. &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; then offered Illidan an amber scarf, which he wrapped over where his eyes had been, and not at all to his surprise, the scarf in no manner inhibited his new abilities.\nIn the RPG.\nSpectral Sight is gained when using a demonic claw (or dagger, each case varies) to ritualistically cut out one's own eyes. The sight is comprised of a variety of dark and light shadings. Light reflects off of objects allowing the demon hunter to navigate unhindered. Beings (namely &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; users and demons) shine a radiant assortment of colors making them easy to detect even when disguised."}

{"id": "15701", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15701", "title": "Speed", "text": "In &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, speed usually refers to a couple of things:\nWeapon speed.\nSee &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapon%20speed\"&gt;weapon speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nMovement speed.\nBlizzard has been very careful to make movement speed an important element in World of Warcraft. Without any speed-modifying spells or abilities, no race has any advantage over any other in terms of speed. The fact that &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s run at the same speed is perhaps explained by the idea that tauren are actually rather slow-moving, but their large size makes up for it, whereas gnomes are short-legged but hyperactive little runners. At any rate, all other things being equal, nobody can automatically beat anyone else in a foot race.\nThere are, however, many items, spells and abilities that modify one's movement speed, and it is perhaps a testimony to Blizzard's attention to detail in regards to speed that their effect is so noticeable.\nTemporary effects that increase run speed include: Class abilities such as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dash%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Dash (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt;; item use effects such as &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Rocket%20Boots\"&gt;Gnomish Rocket Boots&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nifty%20Stopwatch\"&gt;Nifty Stopwatch&lt;/a&gt;; and consumables like &lt;a href=\"Swiftness%20Potion\"&gt;Swiftness Potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSustained effects that increase movement speed include: Class abilities such as a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; form; passive item effects like &lt;a href=\"Runeblade%20of%20Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Runeblade of Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Speed\"&gt;Minor Speed&lt;/a&gt; boot &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;. If you &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28gameplay%29\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; and become a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; (or a &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;), you will also move more quickly than you did when alive until you &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; (although this speed does not stack with any other effects).\nMany abilities exist to decrease the movement speed of enemy units temporarily, as this is usually a tactically useful thing to do. These abilities are usually called &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA standard ground &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; gives you a 60% speed increase, while an epic ground mount gives you a 100% speed increase. However, effects that give you movement bonuses while on foot won't help you when riding (although enemy effects that slow you down on foot can also do so while you're riding). Fortunately, there are also effects to help you ride faster, such as the ever-popular &lt;a href=\"Carrot%20on%20a%20Stick\"&gt;Carrot on a Stick&lt;/a&gt; trinket, &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Spurs\"&gt;Mithril Spurs&lt;/a&gt; that can be installed onto your boots, and the &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Skill\"&gt;Riding Skill&lt;/a&gt; glove enchant. At levels 69 and 70, the &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Crop\"&gt;Riding Crop&lt;/a&gt; is the best single speed booster, granting +10% speed (does NOT stack with other items/enchants), however, it does not work above level 70. These increase your movement speed when you're riding, but \"only\" when you're riding.\nBecause of &lt;a href=\"Racial%20Traits%23Night%20Elf\"&gt;Wisp Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; become wisps when they die, meaning that they can return to their bodies more quickly than any other race and thus resurrect sooner. This effect is more pronounced the farther the Night Elf is from the graveyard when he/she dies, however, because the Wisp gets farther and farther ahead of the regular ghosts the longer the run is. The only other effect in the game that can make your ghost move faster is the level 15 &lt;a href=\"Guild_advancement%23Guild_perks\"&gt;Guild Perk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Quick%20and%20the%20Dead\"&gt;The Quick and the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mathematics behind how movement speed effects stack with each other is debated, but appears to be actually quite simple. Most on-foot speed effects do stack with each other, and likewise mounted speed effects stack with each other as well. The highest rank of &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, for example, temporarily increases a Rogue's movement speed by 70% (that is, the Rogue is moving 170% of the speed of an unmodified character). If this Rogue got the Minor Speed enchantment on his boots, which gives an 8% speed bonus (allowing the Rogue to run 108% of the speed of an unmodified character when not Sprinting), he could then Sprint at 183.6% of the speed of an unmodified character (because 1.70 * 1.08 = 1.836). If a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; were then to cast &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shock\"&gt;Frost Shock&lt;/a&gt; on the rogue (which temporarily slows movement by 50%, among other things), she would then be able to either catch or run away from the rogue, who would now be moving at 91.8% the speed of an unmodified character (because 1.836 * 0.50 = 0.918). Most experiments seem to bear out the fact that movement speed effects stack by multiplying in this way.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Pursuit%20of%20Justice%20%28paladin%20talent%29\"&gt;Pursuit of Justice (paladin talent)&lt;/a&gt;, however, does not stack with other movement speed increases; this is explicitly stated in its tooltip.\nThe fastest sustainable land speed possible in the game pre-BC seems to consist of an epic mount (100% speed increase) in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Crop\"&gt;Riding Crop&lt;/a&gt; (10% mounted speed increase) for a total of 220.0% of the speed of an unmodified character (since 2.00 * 1.1 = 2.20). This same speed is achievable with the level 3 &lt;a href=\"Guild_advancement%23Guild_perks\"&gt;Guild Perk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Up\"&gt;Mount Up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; travel forms also exhibit this multiplicative stacking; the 15% increase they receive from the &lt;a href=\"PvP-Rare\"&gt;PvP-Rare&lt;/a&gt; set yielding a total SUSTAINED speed of 161%. The fastest sustainable speed on foot, not in a travel form, might consist of a hunter with a Runeblade and the Minor Speed enchant under the influence of Aspect of the Cheetah, which would lead to a total of 151.6%. As for the fastest temporary speed, it is even less certain\u2014it's possible to apply multiple speed-increasing effects, of course, but each one is subject to the global cooldown, so it would only be possible to activate a certain number of them before the first ones wore off. Imagine a Rogue with the Runeblade and Minor Speed, wearing Gnomish/&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Rocket%20Boots\"&gt;Goblin Rocket Boots&lt;/a&gt;, in a party with a hunter using &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Aspect of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, activating the &lt;a href=\"Nifty%20Stopwatch\"&gt;Nifty Stopwatch&lt;/a&gt;, then Sprinting. \nHowever, some speed enhancing effects will not stack together, even when it is not explicitly stated that they don't. For example, () and the Minor Speed Enchant are known not to stack, and the &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Crop\"&gt;Riding Crop&lt;/a&gt; also does not stack with any other mounted speed enhancers. Sprint also overwrites the buff from Swiftness Potions, preventing both from being used together.\nKnown speeds.\nWhen walking is enabled (vs. run), then all ground speeds are 2.5 yards per second (35%), both mounted and unmounted.\nWhen moving backwards, the speed is always 4.5 yd./s. (64%), unless on the ground and walking (2.5 yd./s.)\nMacro to show current speed.\nYou can use the following macro while in game to show your current speed.\n /script ChatFrame1:AddMessage(string.format(\"Player speed: %d%%\", (GetUnitSpeed(\"Player\") / 7) * 100))\nAnother macro to show current speed.\nHere's another macro written a bit differently and with some added speed conversions.\n /script x=GetUnitSpeed(\"player\") DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(\"Speed: %d yds/sec, %.1f kph, %.1f mph, %d%% normal run speed\",x,x*3600/1093.6133,x*45/22,x/7*100))\nTrivia.\nCharacters are extremely fast by real-world standards. The standard running speed is 7 yards per second, or a mile every 4 minutes and 12 seconds (2:37 per kilometer). That's the speed of an excellent collegiate runner, carrying no gear, on a track - and a character can keep this up indefinitely in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;very harsh terrain&lt;/a&gt; in full plate armor! A rogue using Sprint will run 100 meters in 9.2 seconds, while the current men's world record for that distance is 9.58 seconds."}

You needed to spend 21 points in Retribution to learn it. It was a staple of the Retribution specialization due to the offensive, DPS nature of the spec. Its presence typically indicated that the paladin was primarily oriented towards dealing damage and enhancing his party's as well, becoming something of a \"combat buffer\". This was removed from the game in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was re-added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; as a passive ability, granting 3% Versatility instead.\nTalent improvement.\n&lt;a href=\"Improved%20Sanctity%20Aura\"&gt;Improved Sanctity Aura&lt;/a&gt; increased damage of anyone affected by the aura by 1%/2%. This included physical as well as Holy damage. This was a base change to melee damage and an end-damage amplification to spells. (Note: Prior to Patch 2.1.0 this instead gave a 3%/6% bonus to healing done to party members.)\nTips and tactics.\nSanctity Aura was, for obvious reasons, \"the\" ret-spec aura and part of what separated ret pallies from the other specs. With the Improved Sanctity Aura talent, it benefited all other damage-dealing classes as well.\nSanctity Aura was very useful for shockadins (40/0/21 build), because it increased their Holy Shock and Seal of Righteousness damage by 10%. Smite Priests loved this aura because it provided a flat 10% increase to their DPS.\nPaladin tanks also liked Sanctity Aura in their group, as it helped their threat generation enormously."}

Because of this, it is possible to evade PvP combat by entering a sanctuary; for example, if someone is attacked by another player on their way to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, their attacker cannot continue attacking them if they cross the portal and enter the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;.

It serves as the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and as the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, led by their new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; since the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the order included members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; and other paladin organizations. Following the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;end of the invasion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Sanctum of Light remained under the control of the Order of the Silver Hand.\nBackground.\nAshbringer.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; and a very select few chosen received for mission to honor the fallen heroes of Lordaeron by not leaving them behind to bolster the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, a thousand of the bravest souls, notably the hero &lt;a href=\"Killoren\"&gt;Killoren&lt;/a&gt;, were exhumed through the graveyards of Lordaeron and moved in secret to the chapel, once more interred in sacred ground.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s death, some paladins separated themselves from what would become the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and formed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, they went deep into the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and made the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; their main base for their operations against the Scourge, and to protect the catacombs beneath.\nYears later, in order to claim the Sanctum and all its righteous souls, the lich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; led a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; assault against &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; was greatly outnumbered. The tide of the battle soon turned against the chapel's defenders, until &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; ran the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; through his own chest as a final act of faith and love to free his father's soul. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the spirits of the thousand heroes interred below the chapel also awakened and brought forth a reckoning against the Scourge then, decimating the undead with their vengeful fury.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter he woke up at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; rallied his troops to prepare the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, he sent the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; for a campaign in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, in order to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and to raise powerful soldiers for the Scourge from underneath Light's Hope Chapel.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Second Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the death knight &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; led the Scourge armies in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; who led the Argent Dawn and his paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to victory. The Highlord then explained to Darion that Arthas had sent them to be all killed by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, as he knew what \"lies beneath the chapel\". Following the arrival of the Lich King, Tirion managed to repel him with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, before he could kill them all and access to the Sanctum of Light.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, after his death at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion Fordring's body was then taken by Maxwell Tyrosus and buried in the Sanctum of Light. A memorial service was held in his honor, during which Tyrosus named &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the new wielder of the Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; as the new Highlord of the Silver Hand. The Sanctum of Light then became the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; for the restored &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, accessible by a trap door in the floor of the chapel itself.\nAt the Sanctum of Light, the recruitment of new troops is organized by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ansela\"&gt;Commander Ansela&lt;/a&gt;, a grizzled war veteran and seasoned teacher, and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Born\"&gt;Commander Born&lt;/a&gt;, a hard teacher who has trained some of the greatest paladin knights in the recent times. With other officers and superiors in their headquarters, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of coordinating the forces of the Silver Hand, thus they organize the missions, assaults, and investigations for the paladins, but also the meetings between leaders of the Order, the contact and recruitment of potential allies, all of this with the consideration of many logistics: communications, resources, weapons, armors, the creation of supply lines for foods and medicines, and many others.\nAt some point during the conflict, the chapel was once again &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. In order to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the Ebon Blade raised undead from Chapel's crypt and sent them to attack the sentries while Darion and his three horsemen entered the Sanctum. Inside, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; served as the paladins' last line of defense before Tirion's tomb, but she ends up being defeated. As the death knights began their ritual, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself interceded and defeated all the death knights, while Liadrin claimed that the Ebon Blade were fools to have taken this course, as not even the Lich King himself has power on this holy ground.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, and the departure of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, Spymaster &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his report that the Sanctum of Light is still active with the Knights of the Silver Hand present inside. Its halls have also been cleared to store many artifacts mostly recovered from &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The artifacts stored by the Silver Hand are far too dangerous to be stored elsewhere, and above all far too tempting for anyone to resist, which requires sacred protections. Among them, the most dangerous artifacts are the weapons and armor recovered from the body of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, which are the &lt;a href=\"Demonshear\"&gt;Demonshear&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Hammer of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Tyranny\"&gt;Crown of Tyranny&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Nathrezim\"&gt;Shroud of the Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Book of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther artifacts recovered by adventurers, who ventured years ago in the burning city to defeat &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, have also joined those in the Sanctum, among them the &lt;a href=\"Runeblade%20of%20Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Runeblade of Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bonescraper\"&gt;Bonescraper&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Rivendare\"&gt;Seal of Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.
