His parents killed by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s shortly after his birth in the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, he was found and raised by &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; who gave Thrall his name. Raised as a &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;, he later joined &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; in freeing the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, being named Warchief after Doomhammer's death. After leading the Horde away from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-claimed &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, he rescued and made allies of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall led the new Horde against their &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;former demonic masters&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently led diplomatic efforts at peace between the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, as well as accepted new members to the Horde, like the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the increasing elemental unrest heralding the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall stepped down as leader of the Horde, appointed &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; as Warchief, and joined with the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; to combat the rampaging elements, eventually aiding the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;downfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith his victory over the corrupted aspect behind him, Thrall had been forced to deal with the chaos his replacement had sown in his wake. The &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; Campaign clearly demonstrated Garrosh's unforeseeable madness and pride, leading to dissension within the Horde itself. Thrall stepped back in to defend the Horde and its allies from their increasingly ruthless dictator. &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Together&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the other disenfranchised leaders of the Horde, Thrall overthrew his ill-fated successor in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After Garrosh's capture, Thrall personally chose Vol'jin to hold the Horde together and pledged his allegiance to him, along with the remaining leaders of the faction. His mate &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; also gave birth to a son named &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall was a key member of the Horde expedition to an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate version&lt;/a&gt; of the orcish homeworld . In addition to aiding in many key battles, he met and befriended of that timeline and made allies of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that Garrosh was responsible for the events in the alternate Draenor, Thrall pursued him and was ultimately successful in &lt;a href=\"And%20Justice%20for%20Thrall\"&gt;killing Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; in their final &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. \nEventually, the weight of all the wars he had fought began to weigh more heavily upon the former warchief and Thrall's own abilities and resolve began to waver. During the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;latest invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, he passed both the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and the mantle of leader of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; down to a shaman &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, knowing the future was now in safer hands. With this, he retired with his family to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, where he established a small farm. This did not last, as he was called from retirement by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, who needed his aid in preventing &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin's successor after his death during the Legion's invasion, from tearing the Horde apart. Leading a rebellion alongside Saurfang, Thrall upheld his promise to Saurfang who perished during a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; with Windrunner, who then abandoned the Horde. Taking on a mantle of leadership for his people once again, Thrall became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced the warchief position, as the orcish representative.\nAfter the end of the war, Thrall was captured along other leaders of both factions by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, and was sent into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; where he was tormented within &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually rescued by &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and joined them in their campaign against &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and his forces.\nThrall serves as one of the main protagonists in the \"Warcraft\" franchise.\nBiography.\nYouth.\nGo'el is the son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, former chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in the year 1 in their new home in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the birth, Draka and the child accompanied Durotan to a secret meeting with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;. While in Loch Modan, Durotan warned Orgrim about the treachery of the warlock &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and his Shadow Council who used the orcish race as vassals to their ambition for power. Soon after, Durotan and his family were escorted by Orgrim's personal bodyguards on their way home to the north when in truth, the guards were actually assassins loyal to Gul'dan and brutally murdered Durotan and Draka while leaving the infant Go'el to die helplessly in the wilderness.\nGo'el was found amongst the bloody bodies of his murdered parents somewhere in the north of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s which held orcs after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Blackmoore gave him the name \"Thrall\", which was another word for \"slave\" in the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;human tongue&lt;/a&gt;, which would cling to the orc for the remainder of his life. Blackmoore returned to his fortress, &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, with Thrall, and raised him as a gladiator \u2014 with all the savagery of an orc, but with the keen strategic intellect of a human. He was trained and taught by many, wet-nursed by &lt;a href=\"Clannia\"&gt;a human woman&lt;/a&gt;, and grew to befriend her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall proved to be an excellent student and a phenomenal fighter. Thrall became a gladiator in Durnholde's arena and Aedelas' source of money. During one encounter in the arena, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; visited Durnholde Keep in order to watch Thrall in a fight.\nThrall's first encounter with other orcs was while training with &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20%28character%29\"&gt;Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; and several trainees at Durnholde. A cart of captured orcs was moving through Durnholde at the time, to be kept within the camps, and one who saw Thrall believed that (rather than it being a training exercise) he was being ganged up on by humans. The orc broke free of his chains and moved to save Thrall, yelling at him in Orcish to run away, but at the time, Thrall did not understand any language except Common and so had no idea what his would-be savior was shouting. The orc was beaten and killed right before the young Thrall's eyes.\nHe was clever, quick and enormous even by orc standards. Blackmoore's abusive beatings both in and out of the ring began to take its toll. Taretha began to write him letters and secretly delivered them to him in his cage within books, and he wrote back to her. Eventually, he wrote to Taretha that he wished to escape, following a series of fights where he fought bravely but did not finish the last round, and was consequently physically punished by Aedelas.\nTaretha created a diversion inside &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; which allowed Thrall to escape from his cell unnoticed. They met up outside the fortress by a cave, and Taretha gave him provisions and supplies. He then left Durnholde, hoping to never return.\nThrall was captured and taken to an internment camp run by one &lt;a href=\"Major%20Lorin%20Remka\"&gt;Lorin Remka&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that he met an old orc with glowing red eyes named &lt;a href=\"Kelgar\"&gt;Kelgar&lt;/a&gt;, who told him of the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and how the old ways had been so much better for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He told him that the only one still thinking of embracing this was the undefeated &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;. When another orc told Thrall that Blackmoore had arrived at the camp looking for him, Thrall escaped again and sought out Grom Hellscream.\nThe orcs.\nAfter Thrall had found the chieftain and proving himself, Hellscream took Thrall under his wing, teaching him the Orcish tongue, and telling him that\u2014based on the tattered swaddling cloth Thrall showed him \u2014 he was a part of the exiled &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;. After spending some time with Hellscream, Thrall decided to take his leave of them for a while in order to search out his roots in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter trekking to exhaustion, Thrall was rescued by the Frostwolves and taken to their camp. There he met &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, who told Thrall that he was the son of the chieftain of the Frostwolves. Once Thrall had found his place among the Frostwolves, Drek'Thar taught him the old ways of the Horde, before &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, and soon Thrall was accepted as a member of the clan. A &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolf&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Snowsong\"&gt;Snowsong&lt;/a&gt; eventually chose Thrall as her companion. It was some time after that choosing that he was called away by Drek'Thar, and came upon a quiet place where he had never been or seen before. Here he was to be initiated.\nIn one of the most spiritual experiences of his life, Thrall befriended the spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and the Wilds. He became the first new shaman since Gul'dan's vile corruption of the Horde. He returned to the camp a new orc and became fully immersed in the old ways and ancient rites of the shaman and his clan, learning how to wield the fury of the storms and earth, and embracing his role as son of the chieftain. This was a significant and symbolic event since Thrall was the first shaman to be accepted by the spirits since Drek'Thar's time. Not only did this mean Thrall would be destined to be one of the greatest shaman in orcish history, but it also meant that the spirits finally forgave the orcish race for consorting with demonic powers, and deemed Thrall as the first of a brand new generation of shaman.\nThe camp was soon visited by a wandering stranger. At first, Thrall spoke pleasantly with him but began to grow angry when the stranger accused the Frostwolves of hiding away in the mountains. His fury \u2014 and orcish pride \u2014 growing within him, Thrall informed the stranger that he would join with Hellscream and the Warsong and lay siege to the encampments. The stranger dismissed Hellscream as a \"demon-ridden dreamer\", and said that the humans were not worth fighting. Enraged, Thrall challenged the stranger to single combat. The stranger threw aside his cloak to reveal well-worn black plate armor and a massive warhammer. After a short but brutal contest, Thrall managed to disarm him but was prevented from throttling the stranger by some of his clan. It was then that the stranger revealed himself as &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the Warchief of the Horde. Doomhammer had been contacted by Drek'Thar about the return of the son of Durotan. The Warchief decided to provoke Thrall into a fight to see if Drek'Thar's praise was deserved \u2014 and it was. Not only was Thrall able to challenge Doomhammer's strength, he also was able to best him \u2014 a feat only once before accomplished by &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Thrall's father&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberation.\nDoomhammer named Thrall his second-in-command and explained his strategy for liberating the encampments. Per Doomhammer's plan, Thrall infiltrated the camps masquerading as one of the downtrodden, lethargic prisoners, and then riled the orcs up with shows of his shamanistic powers. With the downtrodden orcs revitalized by their restored heritage, they quickly overran the encampments. On the first three encampments, this proved to be an effective tactic. On the fourth, Thrall was too easily recognized, and thus they had to resort to the numbers of the new Horde \u2014 and the shamanistic powers wielded by Thrall \u2014 to liberate the encampment. At the fifth, they were even better prepared \u2014 knights from Durnholde had been stationed at the remaining encampments, so that whichever camp they attacked, there would be a greater resistance. During the liberation of this encampment \u2014 now the Horde outpost of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Doomhammer was killed, impaled from behind by a knight's lance. With his dying breath, he gave Thrall his black plate and &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;warhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and named him Warchief of the Horde. He made sure to restore, but not replace, the back plate pierced by the lance that took Doomhammer's life; and a symbol of the Frostwolf clan was added to the Doomhammer.\nThrall's first action as Warchief was to attack &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to dismantle the entire internment camp system. He secretly met with Taretha, asking her to leave Durnholde with her family, but she refused, hoping that it would never come to battle and fearful of the consequences if Blackmoore noticed her missing (Blackmoore had taken her as his mistress, an arrangement she had never been happy with). When Thrall arrived at Durnholde with the Horde at his back, he confronted a drunken Blackmoore and asked for a peaceful parlay in order to prevent useless bloodshed. Blackmoore went through a plethora of emotions \u2014 from amusement at Thrall's rise to power, anger at what the Warchief was demanding, and grief at how Thrall had supposedly betrayed him. Once again demanding that Blackmoore surrender or be killed; the master of Durnholde gave his response by tossing the severed head of &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; into the courtyard, screaming that this was what he would do with traitors.\nThe sight of the Taretha's decapitated head was so shocking that Thrall cried out tears for the first time in his life. She was the closest thing that he had of a family. The orc then screamed in rage and grief, the elements themselves echoing his fury, and he gave the command to attack. During the siege, Thrall cornered Blackmoore in his hidden tunnel and tossed a sword at the traitorous man's feet. Blackmoore had sobered enough to hold his own against the Warchief \u2014 who had been holding back to allow Blackmoore a fighting chance \u2014 but when he tried to explain, and asked for Thrall's aid to help him subjugate the Alliance. The Warchief's rage at Taretha's fate broke all barriers and struck him the mortal blow. As he lay dying, the master of Durnholde expressed pride in what Thrall had become \u2014 what Blackmoore had made him or so he thought.\nThrall emerged shaken from the castle to find his orcs victorious. Thrall gave a message to Blackmoore's second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Karramyn%20Langston\"&gt;Lord Karramyn Langston&lt;/a&gt;, to take to his superiors: to free the remaining orcs, and to cede land for their use. If the Alliance would let them be, they would not trouble the Alliance and would be willing to engage in cooperation and trade. If the Alliance chose to fight them, they would have made an enemy the likes of which had never been seen before \u2014 making the old warlock-controlled Horde shrink to insignificance. He then left Durnholde after allowing &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20%28character%29\"&gt;Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; and the surviving humans to walk away unharmed and he had Tari's necklace delivered to her parents. When they were gone he called upon the Spirit of the Earth to destroy the keep before leading his people to freedom.\nThrall later composed a \"&lt;a href=\"lok%27vadnod\"&gt;lok'vadnod&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"song of a hero\") to commemorate Taretha's sacrifice.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nAt some point during the liberation of orcs from camps, Thrall learned about the orc named &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and led an attack on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; where Eitrigg was about to be executed. However, Eitrigg was rescued by a human and brought to a forest outside of Stratholme where he was healed by the human. Thrall and his orcs followed the two and found them. Eitrigg reminded Thrall of Durotan. Eitrigg was allowed to join the &lt;a href=\"new%20Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the human, &lt;a href=\"Tirion\"&gt;Tirion&lt;/a&gt;, was astonished by Thrall who allowed him to leave because he had saved Eitrigg's life.\nReign of Chaos.\nFlight to Kalimdor.\nThrall and Grom spent much time gathering together the dispersed forces of the Horde. But it was some time later, when Thrall was with a small force in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, that he received a strange dream. He saw armies clashing, and fire raining from the sky, and a voice warning him of things to come.\nWhen he awoke, he realized that it was no dream, it was a vision, granted him by the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;mysterious Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, who enigmatically told him that he was not what he seemed, that he had abandoned his humanity long ago, and that he had foreseen the future with the only hope for the orcs' salvation was to leave &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;\u2014sail west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and there, they would find their destiny.\nThrall obeyed, and gathering the Horde, prepared to make their way across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s begun assembling and he constructed a base to give the Horde a place to stay. Grom turned out to have been captured by humans, and Thrall quickly stepped in to save him. Hellscream then got the idea, to steal the human ships so that they could leave the human lands forever. With the Horde assembled, they stole the ships, and left across the Great Sea to the forgotten lands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nExodus of the Horde.\nHalfway along their journey to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall's ships were beset by a fierce storm near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and forced to take shelter on a small island. There the orcs met the troll leader, &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who told them of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; outpost that attacked his tribe night and day on the island. Fearing for the Horde and the Darkspear Trolls' safety, Thrall and his warriors assaulted the human base. During his stay, he reactivated a Fountain of Health and discovered that the isle had active volcanos. Aided by the Darkspear trolls, the human leader, an &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;, was killed, but then many &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the Horde, the humans, and the Darkspear trolls. While the orcish and human forces were occupied with one another, the piscine monsters sought out sacrifices for their rituals.\nThrall was then imprisoned within the murlocs' fiery dungeon. He learned from a troll head hunter, with whom he shared a cell, that the murlocs planned to sacrifice them both to a &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, though the murlocs were strangely advanced, they were unaware of Thrall's shamanistic abilities, and the warchief was able to escape and free his warriors. One &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; was not in the cells \u2014 and that he was taken as the first sacrifice. Thrall raced to the altar but was forced to watch in horror as the murloc sorcerer killed Sen'jin. Thrall and his warriors were able to kill the three &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Guardian\"&gt;Murloc Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s maintaining the magic barrier which prevented their escape and the &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Murloc Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, but it was too late for the troll leader. The dying Sen'jin revealed a vision \u2014 that Thrall would lead the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe to greatness. Thrall then offered the remaining trolls a place in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for the kindness they had shown the orcs.\nThrall emerged from the cave and was confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;. She threatened vengeance for the destruction of her altar and worshipers. She placed a curse upon the warchief; that he and all his forces would be swallowed up by the sea. Upon returning to his base camp, Thrall discovered that his ships, damaged by the storm, were not yet ready to sail. He also learned that the island dormant volcano erupted and that the island had begun to sink. The Sea Witch, meanwhile, launched her &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;murloc forces&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde, thirsty for vengeance. Nevertheless, aided by the trolls, the Horde was able to hold off their attackers long enough to repair their ships and managed to escape before the isle sunk. The Sea Witch then told to Thrall that a \"Dark Tide\" would swallow them all and that there will be nowhere to hide.\n\"The sea witch's curse may have come true, depending on how close her island was to Kalimdor \u2014 because Thrall's force was shipwrecked. It can be assumed that other clans, such as &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt;, were not among those caught by the storm and driven to the island.\"\nKalimdor.\nThe ships had been scattered and many of those on board barely made it to the shores of Kalimdor alive. The clans were scattered, and Thrall slowly roamed the coast, collecting the orcs and trolls he came across as he did. But Grom could not be found. This new land held many strange new creatures, but the most brutal were the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, particularly in their treatment of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Thrall battled a group of centaurs who were attacking tauren, he was unexpectedly greeted by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by their fierce but noble behavior, Cairne offered to help him find the destiny of his people. Thrall told Cairne of the centaur army he had seen advancing to the north, and they quickly departed, as Cairne realized that his village was in danger. Thrall's forces followed Cairne back to their village, where they defended it from the centaurs.\nSince the centaurs had driven off all the game in the region, the Bloodhoof tribe would need to abandon their home and travel to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; if they hoped to avoid starving. Cairne agreed to tell the location of the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, who would help the orcs with their quest for destiny, if they would help protect Cairne's caravan to Mulgore. Thrall agreed to these terms, and helped the tauren on their lengthy journey, protecting them and their lumbering &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; beasts from marauding centaurs.\nCairne told Thrall of the mystical &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, who could help them find their destiny in these strange lands. Thrall, glad at having made a new friend in the foreign land, gratefully thanked Cairne, and they parted as allies.\nWhen Thrall arrived at the base of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, he was shocked to find &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; battling humans under the command of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Her forces had cordoned off much of the pass going up the mountain, and Thrall believed that hiring some &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to ferry them up the mountain in zeppelins would allow them to bypass any defenses. As Thrall tried to make his way stealthily up to the goblins, the impatient Hellscream unexpectedly attacked the humans, who retaliated by attacking to him and to Thrall's forces. Thrall was forced to stay their wrath by attacking their bases. Finally, he managed to acquire some &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s. Thrall confronted Grom, but Hellscream argued that \"a true warrior\" would have fought the humans without question instead of trying to sneak past them and avoid a battle.\nThrall, worried that Grom's impetuous bloodlust would lead to nothing but trouble, ordered his friend and his clan to head to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and collect wood for their future settlement while he made his way up the mountain to meet the Oracle. Grom reluctantly complied with Thrall's request. \nThrall made his way up the mountain and was surprised to find his path crossing that of &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; once again. However, the summit was heavily guarded by a nearby encampment, and they would need air support in order to destroy the human defenses. Cairne suggested that they ally with the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The wyverns were imprisoned by a group of vile &lt;a href=\"harpies\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, and after a short battle, they were defeated, and the wyverns, grateful, lent their services to Thrall and the Horde. With their help, Thrall was able to destroy the human encampment and entered the caverns.\nThrall and Cairne separated and searched the caverns themselves. After much time, they found the Oracle's chamber, but they also found Jaina Proudmoore and were about to battle when the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; appeared, revealing himself to be the Prophet that Thrall and Jaina had met in Lordaeron. He told Thrall of Grom's corruption, and that the orcs and humans must join forces or be destroyed. Reluctantly, Thrall agreed, desperate to save Grom.\nLifting of the Blood Curse.\nThey returned to &lt;a href=\"the%20Barrens\"&gt;the Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to find Grom in command of the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, and he moved against them as the demonic invasion of Kalimdor began. An epic battle took place between the Warchief and Hellscream's forces as the fire of falling &lt;a href=\"infernals\"&gt;infernals&lt;/a&gt; lit up the night sky. Thrall, with the help of Cairne and Jaina, fought his way through the ranks of blood-maddened &lt;a href=\"chaos%20orc\"&gt;chaos orc&lt;/a&gt;s, determined to reach Hellscream at all costs. Finally, after defeating Hellscream's army of orcs, &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, and warlocks, Thrall faced his old friend. Hellscream taunted the Warchief, revealing to him that the demons didn't forcefully corrupt the orcs, but that the orc chieftains themselves willingly chose to drink the demon's blood, in full knowledge that it would forever enslave them to the Legions dark rule. Enraged at this revelation and betrayal, Thrall charged at his old friend and the armies of Thrall and Grom along with a swarm of doomguard battled. After a long and desperate struggle, Thrall regained control of himself and managed to capture Grom's essence in a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; and returned it to a Ritual Circle, where with the combination of &lt;a href=\"orcish\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; magic, the demonic energy was purged from Grom's system. Grom, realizing what he had done, was instantly apologetic, and he and Thrall immediately set out to face Mannoroth in a canyon carved by the falling infernals.\nThrall put an initial assault against &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, but was subdued quickly, and would have been killed, had Grom not gathered his strength and made a devastating blow against Mannoroth, shattering his plate and driving &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;his axe&lt;/a&gt; deep into his belly. This was enough to kill the pit lord, but as Mannoroth died explosive energies burst forth from his body and hit Grom at point-blank range. The chieftain of the Warsong clan was mortally wounded. As the demonic, red haze lifted from the eyes of Grom Hellscream and his clan mates, Grom was told that he had freed himself. Thrall approached Grom telling to him that he had freed not just him, but all the orcs from demonic corruption.\nBattle of Mount Hyjal.\nThrall and Jaina went into Ashenvale but found a new threat behind them as well as in front. The night elves, cursing them for the killing of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, attacked them as they attempted to make a new settlement.\nThe demons and undead, orcs and humans, and night elves were all battling one another for survival, until finally, Thrall received a vision to bring Jaina to a grove at the base of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. There, he met the leaders of the night elves, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. They were surprised at finding each other there, until the Prophet appeared once more, and revealed himself to be &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the Last &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; of the Tirisfal. He convinced them that they must all ally against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; or they would surely and quickly be defeated.\nThough uneasy, Tyrande and Malfurion agreed, and they all allied against &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and his plethora of demonic and undead followers.\nAll the allied races collectively defended &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; with three fortified settlements going up the mountain, Thrall's base having &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, everyone doing their best to slow &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s ascend until the night elves' trap was prepared.\nAs Archimonde made his way up the mountain towards Thrall's base, he taunted Thrall by saying that his race wasn't worth bothering with and that the orcs were weak. Thrall replied that their spirit is strong and if they are to be defeated at least they are free, and struck out, attacking Archimonde and hurting him a little with a &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, before Jaina teleported him away. After a great battle, Archimonde was finally destroyed and the Burning Legion was defeated.\nFounding of Orgrimmar.\nFollowing the victory at Mount Hyjal and the defeat of the Burning Legion, Thrall gathered his people and resolved to find a place for them in the rugged, beautiful lands of the Barrens. Thrall led his orcs into the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; quilboar and claimed much of the land, founding &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, named after his heroic father. Its capital city was &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, named for &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. After many months, things began to pull together. The orcs were fleshing out Durotar, the tauren had gone into &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; had settled on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; off the coast.\nThrall was soon met by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, a son of the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt;, who had tried to save his scout &lt;a href=\"Mogrin\"&gt;Mogrin&lt;/a&gt; from a group of &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s, and delivered a message. Thrall read it carefully, saddened by Mogrin's death, and welcomed Rexxar to the newly crowned land. Rexxar considered staying but said that he would need to earn his keep. Thrall agreed and sent Rexxar to speak to various citizens of Orgrimmar and see what he could do to assist them in their tasks. He also asked &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; to assist Rexxar. The two were later joined by a wandering &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; brewmaster named &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who had been searching the area for ingredients to use in his new concoction. After Rexxar helped him find those ingredients, Chen tagged along with the troll and the Mok'Nathal, eager for adventure. Thrall waited in Orgrimmar, helping build the city.\nRexxar performed his deeds successfully, and Thrall began to respect the beastmaster. But soon he brought ill news that humans were amassing on the shores of Durotar. Thrall was troubled. The treaty he had made with Jaina had hoped to keep such incursions from happening. After several more encounters with human hostiles, there was a summit arranged between Thrall and Jaina. Rexxar encouraged Thrall to send him in his place, sensing a trap. Thrall reluctantly agreed. Sure enough, the \"&lt;a href=\"Emissary%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;emissaries&lt;/a&gt;\" were uninterested in talk and unsuccessfully tried to kill Rexxar and his friends, after expressing disappointment that Thrall himself had not come to be slaughtered.\nRexxar returned and told Thrall that there had been a deception. Unable to believe that Jaina would order such a thing, Thrall prepared a note for Rexxar to secret into &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to arrange a parlay with Jaina herself. Only by meeting face to face could they ensure any sort of peace between the two races.\nAfter hearing Rexxar's report of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival and intent against the orcs, Thrall realized that the only way to prevent yet another war was to assault Admiral Proudmoore's base and kill him. With Rexxar's help, Thrall enlisted the aid of his old friend Cairne and the tauren, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres. While preparations were being made to storm Theramore, Thrall was informed that the island was surrounded by a blockade of ships that the assembled force had no way of breaching. Thrall was frustrated by this news. Then Jaina teleported onto the scene. She assured everybody that she came in peace. She had known nothing of her father's plans and didn't know what to do, she said. Thrall was sympathetic but told her that her father's actions could destroy Durotar and that the only way to ensure the security of the new nation and his people was to kill Daelin.\nJaina understood and was willing to help, even if it meant the death of her father. She told Thrall the location of a nearby &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shipyard\"&gt;goblin shipyard&lt;/a&gt; which could supply him with ships to break through the admiral's blockade. She begged Thrall to spare as many of her men as possible in the coming battle; even though most of them were following her father, they were the only family she had left after the fall of Lordaeron. Thrall gave her his word that he would try to keep bloodshed on the human side to a minimum and advised Jaina to get to safety since the battle was about to start.\nUsing the ships acquired from the goblins, Thrall's forces were able to fight their way onto the isle, where they proceeded to engage Daelin Proudmoore's troops. Rexxar, Rokhan, Chen, and Cairne fought their way directly to Admiral Proudmoore himself and engaged him in combat. Before the battle was over Thrall tried to tell the admiral that this Horde was different from the one he had faced years ago, that they had no interest in conquest or murder. Proudmoore raged that Thrall's race was guilty of genocide, that they would never be able to atone for their rampage through Stormwind and Lordaeron that had left countless innocent people dead. He grimly vowed that he would never stop fighting the orcs, and thus fought to his death as Thrall had predicted.\nAs soon as Daelin Proudmoore fell, Rexxar shouted that the battle was over and ordered the human forces to stand down. They complied. Jaina fell to her knees near her father's body, asking him why he couldn't have listened. Rexxar tried to ease the sorceress' pain by telling her that her father was a proud warrior above all else, and that he should be remembered as such. Thrall proclaimed that the Horde had no quarrel with the surviving humans and that they would leave Theramore in peace. He then took his forces back to Durotar and left Jaina to her mourning.\nGrateful to Rexxar for all he had done, Thrall extended an invitation to the Mok'Nathal to stay and make a home for himself in Durotar. Rexxar politely declined, telling Thrall that he was a wanderer and his place was in the wilds. But he promised Thrall that he was part of the Horde, and that if his help was ever needed again he would be there. So Thrall said goodbye to Rexxar and resumed building Durotar. For the moment, all was well.\nLordship.\nThrall was warned by a shaman &lt;a href=\"Kalthar\"&gt;Kalthar&lt;/a&gt; about a strange anomaly in Kalimdor's mountains. Thrall sent &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaskal\"&gt;Gaskal&lt;/a&gt; to investigate this. The anomaly pulled Brox, Gaskal, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; into the past - 10 000 years ago. Though Gaskal died during transporting and Broxigar died in the conclusion of the War of the Ancients, his famous &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; was retrieved and delivered to Thrall by Korialstrasz to honor brave Broxigar.\nThree years passed, and Orgrimmar swelled. A series of minor incidents between the Durotar orcs and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; humans threatened the stability of the entire area. Thrall and Jaina desperately attempted to keep the peace, but the Horde grew out of his control when his chief warrior &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt; took an army of orcs and trolls to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the same keep Proudmoore used for his operations, and demanded they dismantle it. After the battle began, Jaina contacted Thrall with information that his Burx was working for the orcish end of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cult. Infuriated at the idea that an orc would once again serve the Legion (the demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; was pulling the strings of the cult), Thrall immediately stopped the battle (with some impressive aid from the Spirits) and denounced Burx. When the warrior protested that he was acting within the Horde's interests, Thrall smashed his skull with the Doomhammer.\nThe events prompted Jaina and Thrall to pursue a more official Horde/Alliance treaty. Despite the rise of tensions in the last year or so, their actions have halted, though not completely broken, the cycle of hatred.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThrall, proud Warchief of the Horde remained in his palace, located in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. He was considered the mightiest orc alive. He stood as warchief over the entire Horde, holding dominion over the Darkspear trolls and tauren tribes alike. His honor, cunning, and compassion have won him many allies over the years, even amongst the humans and night elves. Thrall lives to defend his people's freedom and ensure the safety of the extended Horde.\nThe members of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; that remained in Azeroth became an integral part of Thrall's New Horde. With the foundation of Durotar, and the Horde capital of Orgrimmar, the Shattered Hand has become the Horde's clan of assassins, training new rogues in the service of their Warchief. However, as with all rogues, the extent of their loyalty is unknown; one member, &lt;a href=\"Zando%27zan\"&gt;Zando'zan&lt;/a&gt;, states that he has foreseen the death of Thrall, but whether this is just a premonition he had of the Warchief's demise or that he or the Shattered Hand in Orgrimmar plans to kill Thrall remains a mystery. However, Wrenix the Wretched, Zando'zan's contact, does point out that he's not quite sane and that his words perhaps should not be taken seriously.\nDespite the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the elder Proudmoore, the Warchief's life is still far from dull. Threats to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; from outside and within force him to remain ever vigilant. At some point, Thrall received &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors who demanded to join the Horde. Thrall was unsure about them, but with the support of &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall was convinced to accept them. Thus, the Horde gained access to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; learned about the new Horde and sent runners to Thrall. Thrall was wary of the trolls at first, but he came to see that the Revantusk trolls were unique among forest trolls in a fundamental way. The Revantusk tribe had never had much in the way of the fighters or resources, and so it had instead decided to specialize in the trickier art of negotiation. By the time they spoke with Thrall, the Revantusks had acquired a reputation for trustworthiness that was well deserved. The trolls were impressed by Thrall and his dream. Even so, they remembered the recklessness and corruption of the first Horde. Thus, the Revantusks declined to rejoin the Horde, but they did agree to a pact of friendship and mutual assistance.\nAt this time of his tenure &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; were his advisors. Thrall tasked the latter to oversee new Horde recruits. He watched a growing danger within the caves of Orgrimmar and worked with the young horde members who he sent to spy on &lt;a href=\"Neeru%20Fireblade\"&gt;Neeru Fireblade&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall learned that he was the leader of the Burning Blade and worked with &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt; under Orgrimmar. Eventually, Thrall sent the adventurers &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;beneath Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the Searing Blade leaders. He also sent the orc &lt;a href=\"Gol%27dir\"&gt;Gol'dir&lt;/a&gt; and his three companions to Hillsbrad to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; problem. During the process, they were kidnapped but later rescued and eventually killed the Syndicate leader - &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Taretha%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Taretha's Necklace&lt;/a&gt; was also acquired from Aliden's mistress &lt;a href=\"Elysa\"&gt;Elysa&lt;/a&gt; and was eventually delivered to Thrall.\nAt some point, Thrall sent the &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Kargath Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; in order to explore a new land and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gor%27shak\"&gt;Commander Gor'shak&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he allowed himself to be captured by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in order to gather intelligence. Gor'shak learned that Princess &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had been captured. Though Thrall sought a strike team to liberate her in order to strengthen relations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, it was ultimately Alliance forces who entered the Blackrock Depths and killed &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor of the Dark Irons.\nDespite the political quarreling between the Horde and Alliance, Thrall does wish to establish true peace between the two factions. However, the Alliance still remembers the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s association with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. To differentiate his New Horde from its predecessor's dark legacy, Thrall sanctioned &lt;a href=\"Keldran\"&gt;Keldran&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the demon infestation in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. With such a grand display of hostility against the Burning Legion's agents, Keldran and Thrall hoped the Alliance would see the new Horde's sincerity and prevent a war caused by misunderstandings.\nHe also sent the warlock &lt;a href=\"Fel%27zerul\"&gt;Fel'zerul&lt;/a&gt; to investigate strange happenings at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in the past, Thrall tried to make contact with the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; of furbolg on behalf of the Horde.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall quickly came to an unprecedented agreement with &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Regent Lord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Horde and the Alliance would combine the might of their armies, as the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to strike back against the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Thrall learned from &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;history of the orcish race&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and started writing a book about this. For the first time, when Durotar and Orgrimmar were founded and built, Thrall and his orcs could participate in old orcish ceremonials, such as &lt;a href=\"Om%27riggor\"&gt;Om'riggor&lt;/a&gt;. Later, a human spy brought a message, that &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; crashed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and joined &lt;a href=\"the%20Alliance\"&gt;the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall was worried that with this joining, there could be no peace.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the Year 25, Thrall entered negotiations with &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; about joining the Horde. He openly opposed the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' methods, but recognized the Blood Knights' strategic value. Eventually, Thrall greeted the blood elven adventurers that proved their people's value and were sent by Sylvanas Windrunner to Thrall in order to formalize Quel'Thalas joining the Horde.\nA faction of orcs exists in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, who remained untouched by demonic corruption. These orcs call themselves &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;The Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, and are comprised of various orcish clans who chose not to join Magtheridon's legion of fel orcs and appear to have been completely unaffected by the corruption wrought by Kil'jaeden. Thrall sent the Horde expedition to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invade Outland&lt;/a&gt; in order to find and reconnect with the Mag'har. Upon hearing the news that the expedition found them, Thrall immediately made plans to journey to Outland and make contact with the Mag'har. Eitrigg urged Thrall to make the proper preparations, instead of leaving Orgrimmar and the rest of the orcs on Azeroth open to attack.\nLater on, Thrall alongside Drek'Thar made a brief appearance in Outland and met his grandmother &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt; and showed &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; his father Grom died a hero's death, and ended the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Curse&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; reveals Thrall's birth name: Go'el, son of Durotan \u2014 rightful chieftain of the Frostwolves.\nTheramore peace summit.\nAfter he returned from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall brought with him &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, to be his adviser. Later on the retired gladiator master &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; also became one of Thrall's advisers. Rehgar and Garrosh had a great discussion: while Garrosh wanted to destroy the Alliance, who he considers the Horde's enemies, and take Azeroth for their own; Rehgar wanted to remain open to diplomacy with the Alliance and conserve their treaty of non-aggression with &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Then suddenly Thrall received a call from &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; to meet at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. At their meeting, Jaina told him that &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; had returned and narrated to Thrall the history of Varian's abduction. With Varian's return and willing attendance, Jaina wanted to schedule another peace summit at &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of easing tensions between the Horde and Alliance. Though Thrall felt uneasy about leaving &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; during a period when the orcs were feeling restless with Thrall's passive tolerance with the Alliance, Thrall nonetheless agreed to attend the summit.\nWhen Thrall decided to go to a new meeting with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; King &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;, he brought with him his two advisers: Rehgar and Garrosh and some &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. Rehgar recommended Thrall not to bring Garrosh with them but the Warchief thought it would be a good idea as it would help Garrosh to re-think his attitude toward the humans.\nThrall traveled in a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to Theramore, where he had a peaceful discussion with an eye toward mutual gain. They first talked of their pasts and then discussed resource problems; like the Horde's war against the night elves for lumber. Varian offered to provide Thrall's people with lumber and in exchange the Warchief offered copper and exotic hides in return. Varian had to end the summit early as &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were reported to be under simultaneous distress by the Scourge. Thrall and Varian were about to depart amicably but upon exiting Theramore, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; invaded the city. The Alliance races of the Twilight cultists attacked the Horde representatives while the Horde races of the Twilight cultists attacked the Alliance representatives. After catching a glimpse of &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, Varian thought that Thrall had sent her to assassinate him as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had done in the past with &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;. After a time battling, the Twilight's Hammer's casualties began to rise. &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; then entered to protect his mother, and in seeing this, the cultists appointed their attention to the kidnapping of Med'an, while leaving Garona to die. Garrosh accused the Alliance of orchestrating the attack while Varian accused the Horde; specifically Garrosh. Thrall tried to calm down the heated parties and remind them to not jump to conclusions. Thrall tried to convince King Varian that Garona's unexpected assassination attempt was not of his people's making yet Varian remained skeptical of the honor of orcs. Rehgar and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; both were sure that neither Thrall nor Varian would stoop to an assassination tactic on neutral ground and tried to rationalize the surprising turn of events. Jaina and Thrall bid each other farewell, both sorry that any chance of a human-orc alliance was ruined. This attack shook the delicate human-orc tolerances, leaving both factions in distrust of one another. Shortly after, Thrall departed back to his home of Orgrimmar.\nThrall was later asked to join the New Council of Tirisfal but refused and in his stead, Rehgar Earthfury joined the Council.\nEchoes of Doom.\nThrall arrived to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; but the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; executed his plan and made a &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; was able to find a cure from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing this threat, Thrall met with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; in Orgrimmar to discuss what to do about the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter consulting Saurfang and the spirits, Thrall favored a more cautious approach to dealing with the Scourge: an advance scouting party to the frozen continent before committing troops, as well as meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to find out what the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were planning to do about the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh felt that dealing with the Alliance would put the Horde in danger and wanted to take the Horde's armies and conquer the humans and then march to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and crush the Scourge; advocating that the Horde should rule all of Azeroth. Thrall, irritated by Garrosh's recklessness and bold challenges to his authority, answered that the humans were not a threat and that he would not underestimate the Lich King by walking blindly into a Scourge trap. In order to make an example of Garrosh's impudence, Thrall then provoked Garrosh to challenge him to a duel by saying that he would not make the same mistakes as his father, Grom Hellscream. Frustrated with his leader's apparent lack of action and the insults to his father, Garrosh challenged Thrall to a duel in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to settle the matter. The two orcs fought for some time until it seemed Garrosh had gained the upper hand. He began to taunt Thrall, but the battle was interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Herald of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; threatening Orgrimmar with destruction. Hearing this, Thrall used &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; on Garrosh and both left the ring, with Thrall telling the younger Hellscream that they would settle their dispute later. The city was attacked by countless &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s and a few &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThrall and Garrosh led the forces of the Horde in repelling the Scourge attack, with the help of Saurfang, Sylvanas, Rehgar, the city defenders, and some &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. After the Scourge assault force had been dealt with, Garrosh asked to be sent to Northrend again. This time, Thrall agreed and ordered Saurfang to begin preparations for war.\nDeath knights adventurers freed of the Lich King's will visited Thrall in Orgrimmar in order to be accepted to the Horde and gave him a letter in which Tirion asked to have Eitrigg in Northrend. Thrall agreed.\nLegends: Fear.\nFleeing towards Northrend, &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; avoided his &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;kin&lt;/a&gt; and tried to slip past the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The corruption caused Trag to suffer from fits of violent thought, and he felt he would eventually succumb to the power of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrag encountered Thrall, who became aware of his presence through his shamanic magic. Thrall offered to help, but Trag lost control of himself and the two battled. Even after calming down, Trag warned him to run before Trag lost control of himself again. Thrall outright refused to fight him, nor abandon him to fight against the voice of the Lich King alone. Thrall then told of how he had once feared becoming the animal &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; thought him to be, of falling into bloodlust to escape that fear; but the truth is, bloodlust would have only hidden his fear, leaving it to eat away at him forever. By bringing peace into his soul (possibly by facing his fear and accepting that his past is part of who he is), Thrall conquered his fear, survived, and found his redemption. If Thrall could do it, if &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; could do it, so too could Trag if he would allow Thrall to help him. Trag denied that Thrall could do anything for him and warned him away once more. Thrall again refused, and when told that he would be struck down in accepting such a fate, he asked that Trag look him in the eyes \"as you do so I know my executioner\".\nTrag prepared to kill Thrall, only to see in his eyes that he truly does understand Trag's fear, a calm understanding that allowed Thrall to beat his own fear, and from which Trag now draws enough strength to deny the Lich King's demands to kill him. Thrall offered him shelter and safety with the orcs, which Trag turned down; he knew even better than Arthas that his fear would have turned him into a monster, but can't fully trust himself around others just yet. He decided to continue to Northrend and ensure for himself that he will never become one of the Scourge, even if that means self-destruction. Thrall told him that a Horde fleet of ships on the nearby shores of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; would be sailing north soon, and offered a small &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; mark should he need to contact orcs. Trag turned down the mark but thanked Thrall for the offer; he was kind to someone who might have killed him. Thrall admitted with a smile that he wouldn't have just stood there if Trag had tried, but had judged the tauren correctly. Thrall said he would ask the spirits to watch over Trag and to his surprise bid him farewell by name, even though Trag had not mentioned it.\nTrag stowed away on one of the ships and reached Northrend. Even though he was almost sure that he would fail, more so that he would die, Trag was determined to meet his fate...without fear.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBroken peace.\nAs the combined Horde and Alliance forces began their assault upon &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, an uprising broke out within the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and hordes of his demonic brethren overran the city, slaying all those who would not submit to their dark rule. Sylvanas herself was nearly killed in the coup, but managed to escape with a number of loyalists and fled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Determined not to allow the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlords\"&gt;Dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; a foothold in Horde territory, Thrall and Sylvanas planned an immediate counter-attack. In the midst of their planning, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived bearing terrible news: in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s death, King Varian was preparing for a possible war with the Horde. Jaina had been sent to elicit an explanation for the betrayal at the Wrathgate. Though Thrall and Sylvanas explained that the Horde was not responsible for Putress, Jaina had warned them that King Varian would most likely pursue retribution.\nThrall along with Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; led the assault into Undercity itself to reclaim it for the Horde. After fighting the Forsaken rebels and the demons within, the combined might of the Horde slew the traitorous demon Varimathras. The joy of victory was short-lived as Varian, having killed &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt; and hearing the orcish cries of victory, arrived on the scene. He confronted Thrall and declared that peace could never be achieved after discovering the horrors the Forsaken had created in Undercity. Just as the two forces charged at one another, Jaina stopped them from killing each other by teleporting Varian, herself and the Alliance army back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. As Thrall lamented on the broken peace between the Alliance and the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; arrived and reminded Thrall of his duty to lead their people. In order to ensure that no more Legion-aligned abominations crawled out of the Apothecarium, Thrall sent a legion of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; to guard the Undercity from threats outside of it and any that may remain within following &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;The Battle For The Undercity (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSecrets of Ulduar.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; learned that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; had escaped his ancient prison in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; he hastily informed &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, who asked Jaina to summon Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; for an emergency council. Correctly guessing the gravity of the situation, Thrall made haste to Dalaran with Garrosh. Upon arriving at the Violet Citadel, he was intercepted by Jaina, who was desperate to avoid a confrontation with Varian, who was already within. When Jaina told them what had happened, Thrall listened to Garrosh's doubt with irritation, then proceeded to Rhonin's chambers, where, predictably, Varian and Garrosh exchanged harsh words that eventually led to a fight.\nThrall was unable to stop the fight, but a frustrated Rhonin succeeded in doing so. Rhonin pleaded to all in the room to put aside their differences and work together against their common threat. Varian flatly refused, citing the events of the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; as a reason to never work with the Horde again and departed, while Garrosh offered the opinion that a true warchief would never partner with cowards. Thrall expressed disappointment at Garrosh's actions.\nHeart of War.\nAfter the events at Dalaran, Thrall and Garrosh travel to Warsong Hold. On the way, Garrosh contemplates the past events where Thrall first brought Garrosh to Orgrimmar. After defending Warsong Hold from an attack from the Scourge, Thrall witnesses a report given from Icecrown about the Horde forces flanking the Alliance during their assault at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Front\"&gt;Broken Front&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall watches as Garrosh deals with the situation, telling the commander from Icecrown, &lt;a href=\"Sky-Reaver%20Korm%20Blackscar\"&gt;Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar&lt;/a&gt;, that the Horde would fight with honor or not fight at all. Thrall, watching Garrosh, feels proud of him for his decision.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nThrall, accompanied by Garrosh Hellscream, attended the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival &lt;a href=\"Tirion\"&gt;Tirion&lt;/a&gt; greeted them personally.\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%23Alliance%20and%20Horde%20leadership\"&gt;heated exchange&lt;/a&gt; of words the two were escorted into the coliseum by their host.\nLater, he and Garrosh observe &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trials&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by a congregation of the Horde's representatives.\nWar Against the Nightmare.\nThrall, upon counseling with his most trusted shaman, gave Brox's &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Axe of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe whole of Azeroth was caught by the Emerald Nightmare and so was the Warchief. His wolf companion &lt;a href=\"Snowsong\"&gt;Snowsong&lt;/a&gt; felt mists of the Nightmare but it was too late. Orgrimmar with its inhabitants had already fallen to the mists. After the threat of Emerald Nightmare was over, Malfurion returned Thura to her Warchief and told him of her significance in the events. Thrall then sent a letter of well wishes to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and the archdruid. The bearer of the message was Thura. \nThrall also acted as a nightmare in Thura's dreams where he executed her for her failure.\nIn Thrall's nightmare, he was forced to continuously relive the moment of his dear &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;'s death. Though he tried alternate ways to save her life, Tarethra always ended up dying. Finally, Thrall attacked Durnholde with stealth and used Blackmoore's own tactics, he reached the bedroom and found Taretha alive. Blackmoore threw wine into Thrall's face and while blinded, Thrall killed Taretha. The nightmare ended with Thrall crying in his sleep.\nShaman (manga).\n&lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to seek Warchief Thrall's council on the matter of the rising division between the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s traditionalists and &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt;'s advocates of his modern and effective methods in dealing with elements. Thrall was unsure on the matter and told Muln that change is a natural part of life but it's only good if it's right for their people. He advised Muln to follow the guidance of the spirits. Muln later relayed his fears with &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; about Thrall's indecisive stance. Drek'Thar told him that it's his fault as his advice to Thrall has been useless lately. Drek'Thar told Muln that lately he's been seeing two futures and his visions have been less reliable for Thrall. Drek'Thar told Muln that a time will come when the Earthen Ring will become Azeroth's salvation or lead it to ruin. The Farseer suddenly became frantic and warned Muln about the \u201cfire that consumes all\u201d.\nThe Shattering.\nThrall's life would change in the events leading up to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers finally returned home from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall held a banquet in the young orc's honor and presented him with &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, also authorizing bonfires to be lit in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall held a speech of problems about the turbulence of nature and also of financial ones. It was decided that &lt;a href=\"Hamuul\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; would go to a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in order to get help for the Horde. Now, it was impossible to trade with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; due to estrangement. Unfortunately &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; had been suffering a very severe drought causing one of the bonfires to become a conflagration that destroyed several buildings. Thrall himself tried to calm the flames using his shamanic powers but found that the fire was hell-bent on destruction, resolving to snuff out the flames forcibly, an act he regretted. He realized that something was very wrong with the elements and that they were out of control, and pondered the situation.\nThere were other troubles, such as an orc attack on a group of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; which was in direct violation of the Horde-Alliance treaty. The Sentinels had been skinned and then chopped up into pieces, left for carrion feeders. Whether or not they had been alive when they were skinned was debatable. The skins of the murdered night elves were hung on trees that had painted Horde symbols depicted on them; written with elven blood. Since the night elves have ceased to allow Horde members into Ashenvale in protest of the incident at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, many orcs celebrated this attack. With the Horde's supplies almost depleted on account of the war with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the unusual droughts affecting Orgrimmar, many orcs viewed the night elves' exclusion of the Horde from their trade routes unfairly brutal. He received a letter from King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; demanding to denounce the attacks and turn over any attackers he could find to the Alliance for justice. Thrall refused to turn over violators of the treaty (he had his own suspects in mind, but lacked any proof, and he felt turning over the violates to face Alliance justice would hurt orc morale) and also refused to apologize for the thievery of the night elves' goods, the murders, or the brutal methods in which they were performed. Though he did express anger that the treaty had been violated, his unwillingness to publicly reprimand those who use brutal methods to assault Alliance members greatly weakened his popularity with Alliance leaders.\nAfter a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall decided that he was going to have to travel to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to converse with the elements there and try to discover why the elements in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were so out of control. Before setting out on his quest, Thrall appointed Garrosh Hellscream acting &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde and met with &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; who was against this decision, though Thrall was certain that he did the right thing. \nUpon his arrival, he met with his grandmother, who advised him to turn to the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; female &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; for shamanic instruction. Aggra wasn't particularly fond of Thrall and often made comments about and toward him bordering on the snide, sometimes referring to him as \"Slave\". Yet, she dutifully took him on a vision quest in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in order for him to become truly connected to the spirits, and a true shaman. While in Nagrand, Thrall used the &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shuk%27sar\"&gt;Shuk'sar&lt;/a&gt; for travels.\nThrall eventually met with the elements of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom except the &lt;a href=\"Fury%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Fury of Earth&lt;/a&gt; were unable to help Thrall understand what was happening in Azeroth. The Fury of Earth was able to help him after ingesting a small rock Thrall had brought with him from Azeroth, and the Fury told him that the elements were afraid of a shattering, a cataclysm akin to the one that had broken Draenor.\nAs Thrall prepared to return to Azeroth to attempt to prevent the cataclysm, Aggra revealed that she had secretly been growing more and more attracted to him and wanted to go with him to Azeroth, but only if he refused to be weak. Thrall welcomed her company, as he too had begun to slowly grow closer to her. That was when &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Garadar to tell Thrall all that had transpired on Azeroth - about Cairne, Garrosh and the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Thrall returned to Azeroth immediately, bringing Aggra with him. \nHe attended his old friend's funeral and bid his final farewell to his companion. His heart was heavy knowing how his last encounter with his most cherished friend consisted of harsh words. The former warchief took with him the smallest piece of his old friend's runespear to forever remember him. The fragment was etched with a single rune, whose meaning did not escape Thrall - \"healing\". It was there where he put off the armor of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; agreed to have it delivered to Orgrimmar.\nNot long after all this, a massive earthquake hit, which caused a tsunami to hit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, a sinkhole to appear off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the very ground to split beneath Thrall's feet. Thrall decided to make his way to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, which he sensed was the center area where the cataclysmic event was coming from, to attempt to calm the elements. Aggra agreed to go with him, and they set out together, sailing from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; to the Maelstrom on a ship named \"\"&lt;a href=\"Draka%27s%20Fury\"&gt;Draka's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nCataclysm.\n\"Thrall, the Horde's warchief, is a living symbol of nobility, strength, and unwavering courage. He led the orcs from the internment camps of Lordaeron into a new era of freedom and prosperity, and under his leadership the Horde has established itself as a major force on Azeroth. As a shaman, Thrall has a deep connection with the elements, and their wisdom has proven to be a great boon to the warchief. But although the Horde's faith in its warchief remains strong, some orcs who relish the tales of orcish ferocity and martial prowess are frustrated with Thrall's decisions. It remains to be seen whether his recent differences with Garrosh Hellscream are a one-time event or a hint at the shape of things to come.\"\nHe first appears on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; starting zone, where he helps bring the goblins into the Horde. As the storyline plays out, it is revealed that Thrall was captured by agents of while sailing towards the Maelstrom, and the goblins, having recently fled &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, play a part in rescuing him. In gratitude Thrall aids the goblins in their battles across the Isles, where after beating &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, he proclaims that the Cartel will join the Horde and have a home in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and allows Gallywix to remain as the Cartel's leader; sending goblin agents to speak with Thrall's successor &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs tensions within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; begin to rise in Thrall's absence, notably between Warchief Garrosh and Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall steps back into the picture to reassure the Darkspear chieftain that Garrosh was the right choice to keep their Horde united.\nAs one of (if not \"the\") pre-eminent shamans of Azeroth, Thrall steps away from his duties as Warchief to join with the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. He journeys to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the Great Sea, where &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; made his return to Azeroth from the depths of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. The corrupted Aspect's entry has shattered the barriers between Azeroth and the Elemental Plane, and Thrall lends his powers to stabilize the rift.\nThrall is also seen during a nightmare caused by Iso'rath. There, he desperately watches as his friends, Nobundo, Aggra and Muln are killed by the Aspect.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nFollowing Thrall's failure to delve deep into himself during a relatively routine ritual alongside the other mighty shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; begin to feel the strain of life at the Maelstrom. Despite the encouraging words of his good friends &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rehgar\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall finds himself at a loss as to how best to aid his comrades. Aggra outs this doubt to pertain to his longing for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which Thrall angrily denies. After some argumentation, Thrall leaves their sanctuary to clear his head and gain some clarity.\nElsewhere, events are being put into motion beyond Thrall's control. After the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly betrayed the Accord; destroying the sanctums underneath the temple and all of the unhatched eggs in the process. Distraught, the embittered Life-Binder officially disbanded the Accord and fled the scene. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, who was present to witness this, appears before Thrall in her kaldorei guise.\nYsera asks Thrall to undertake a journey - of seemingly minor proportions - to relieve a small druid camp in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; of a rampant fire elemental. Though Thrall is dubious as to why a shaman needed at the Maelstrom itself would be tasked with such a thing, he quickly accepts upon learning of his new companion's true identity. With Ysera's urging, Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Snowsong\"&gt;Snowsong&lt;/a&gt; set out to the find the camp and relieve its inhabitants. Thrall is surprised to see that the camp is inhabited mainly by night elf sentinels, though after some mutual hostility, Thrall converses with the fire elemental (its attitude reminiscent of those who had attacked &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; prior to the cataclysm) and convinces it to leave. Thrall's reputation with the gathered kaldorei increases immensely, and the former warchief spends the evening feasting and drinking with them as friends. \nHaving succeeded in his small task, an elf named &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; approached Thrall and urges him to come into the local woodland. After speaking with the relieved &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, Desharin reveals himself as a green dragon; informing Thrall that Ysera has a far more important task for him and him alone.\nDesharin takes Thrall to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, where they are admitted entry by the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s on Ysera's behalf. While there, the two are attacked by a mysterious human in eerily familiar armor. Desharin is beheaded by the assailant, and he and Thrall do battle. The figure is able to match Thrall's abilities with a strange mastery over time; cloaking his presence to deliver devastating blows upon the former warchief. The bronze dragons relieve the battle, and Thrall is instructed to flee through a time portal. As he makes his leave, Thrall cannot help but sense a strong aura of familiarity from the attacker.\nOn the other end of the time portal, Thrall finds himself at a late point in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt;. Though overwhelmed by the possibilities - such as meeting with Doomhammer - he remains mindful that the timeline must be preserved. He is mistaken as a warlock by an orcish patrol party, and taken to a neighboring base camp. To Thrall's astonishment, he catches a glimpse of none other than Doomhammer himself inside, along with his parents - both Durotan and Draka. After struggling to avert his gaze from them, he is approached by Draka (with an infant Thrall in tow), and after an awkward conversation with his mother, leaves to escort his parents to safety with the patrol who picked him up to begin with. This patrol party was none other than the one responsible for betraying his parents on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; - and Thrall is forced to watch his parents be killed by them, firsthand. Thrall throws himself into the fray as the violence ends, and exercises all of the restraint within him to let their sole surviving killer live, for the sake of the timeline.\nShattered, Thrall approaches the body of his father. He swears to a dying Durotan that his child will live, that their people would be redeemed, and that the orcs will have a land of their own. Durotan dies secure in this knowledge. Desharin's murderer makes a reappearance in this timeway - and attacks Thrall once more. He informs Thrall that his death is all that's on his agenda, and that killing him as a child will be far easier than his adult self. As approaches the infant, such as proper in the true timeline, Thrall grabs his attacker and hurls him into a neighboring river. The two struggle for a time, though after noticing a curious glittering of bronze scales, Thrall is taken to another point in time and his attacker disappears once more.\nThrall comes face to face with a slightly older ; embittered by what appears to have been a far harsher life. After convincing her that he is who he says he is (and showing her an identical necklace to prove it), Taretha informs him of some damning news - in this timeline, had died as a child. Blackmoore, robbed of his prized future-gladiator, did the unexpected: rather than fall further into drink and depression, he sobered up; conscripted mercenaries into his new army, and trained them all himself. Gaining huge support, Blackmoore led his army against Orgrim Doomhammer, and slew the Horde warchief in one-on-one combat. Rather than have the stunned orcs killed, Blackmoore engaged in a secret pact with them - to join him, and overthrow the Alliance. Blackmoore's personal army usurped the kingdom of Lordaeron and deposed House Menethil, during which King , and were killed.\nThrall can barely believe it, especially the thought of the pathetic, drunk Blackmoore taking down the mighty Orgrim in a fair battle. He and Taretha travel to Dalaran, where they are admitted to ' presence. Thrall grants him the ancient's acorn, and Krasus warily assists Thrall and Taretha in finding a way to break this false timeway. The three come to realize that not only is their \"timeline\" false; but rather, \"time\" itself was the illusion here. The understanding allows him to leave the timeway, and Thrall finally finds the Aspect of Time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting him.\nNozdormu begins to piece together the various events occurring in both the alternate the true timeline. To Thrall's - and the onlooking bronze dragons' - immense shock, Nozdormu informs him that the great Aspect's retreat from the world was in order to discover the cause of a dire event destined to happen in the future and to avert it. This event would be Nozdormu founding and presiding over the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu also admits that, as such, he was also responsible for sending the assassin after Thrall. At this point, Thrall comes to realize his mysterious assailant's identity - the missing Blackmoore from the false timeline. Regardless of this pressing matter, Nozdormu thanks Thrall for giving him clarity; setting him another task: to find and (hopefully) lift &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; from her grief over Krasus' demise, and to convince the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to set aside its differences with the others and join forces against the impending darkness.\nThrall and &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; set out to confront the bereaved Life-Binder, and the two find her in the barren wasteland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. Though Alexstrasza rebukes his comfort and banishes him from her sight, Thrall does not give up hope for the Life-Binder just yet. Thrall then makes the journey to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, and after an extremely cold reception, is admitted audience with &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Though Kalecgos goes out of his way to make his orcish visitor comfortable; conjuring scenery of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-designed indulgences to make him seem more at home; Arygos is on edge with the visitor and even goes so far as to suggest his death. Thrall learns that the blue dragonflight is in the process of electing its next Aspect, and that the two most likely candidates are Malygos' ferocious son, Arygos himself, and none other than Kalecgos. An event known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;\" is set to occur shortly; a time where the two moons of Azeroth meet in what cosmetically appears to be the form of a mother embracing her child, hence the name. This sacred event heralds a celestial time for the blue dragons, and their best chance of truly empowering a new Aspect for their flight. To Thrall's great relief, and to Kalecgos' great bemusement, Kalecgos is chosen as the new Aspect. The flight as a whole are pleased with this decision, and watch eagerly as their new leader is empowered by the titans' might. Arygos, enraged, curses the flight for fools; abandoning &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs the flight begins to celebrate its new leader's ascension, &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s interrupt the ceremony. Thrall leaps atop Kalec's back, and the two prove a formidable fighting force. After disposing of several of the creatures, the blues give chase to the fleeing remainder. They arrive at the Wyrmrest Temple, and catch sight of the semi-functional &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, the blues press on; fighting back the twilight dragonflight with efficiency. Chromatus - now awakened with the blood of the murdered Arygos - engages in the battle, and cuts a swathe of destruction through the blues. Thrall is hurled off Kalec in the ensuing chaos and finds his footing in the snow. As he calls upon the aid of the elements, he is granted a peculiar vision of Krasus' final moments, and resolves to inform the Life-Binder of the truth behind his demise. \nThrall is brutally attacked by a newly-arrived Blackmoore. Wielding the Doomhammer in tandem with his powerful elemental skill, Thrall catches his mortal enemy off-guard. Blackmoore is lambasted by Thrall's summoned wind-vortex and collapses on the floor before his former slave. As Thrall moves in to deal the final blow, Blackmoore begs for his life. Though Thrall takes no pleasure in the act, he refuses to relent; bringing the Doomhammer down upon Blackmoore and conquering the shadow he cast over Thrall's life for good.\nElsewhere, the blue dragons were beaten back by the powerful Chromatus. Kalec has Thrall rescued by one of his drakes, though the strain of leadership in the wake of their defeat begins to gnaw at the new Aspect of Magic. Thrall encourages Kalec to remain strong, and he leaves once more for Desolace.\nThrall finds Alexstrasza in an even more shattered state. He shares with her the vision he was granted, and in solemn silence, the two witness Krasus' heroic sacrifice to protect the Wyrmrests' unhatched children from being born as chromatic beasts. Reinvigorated and regaining her confidence, the Life-Binder travels to the Nexus to join forces with the new Aspect of Magic. \nBefore long, the red, blue, and green dragonflights are reunited with their respective Aspects. With their might combined, they leave to do battle with the murderous Chromatus and his ilk. After a vicious battle, Chromatus reaches his full potential - and overpowers all three of the mighty Aspects. The downhill fight is relieved by the arrival of Nozdormu and his bronze flight, and the Aspect of Time puts forward the notion that they will need to work together, in the most fundamental sense of the word, to defeat this creature that embodies all of their traits and powers. Chromatus has a head for each dragonflight, and there are no black dragons present to assist in this task - though Thrall, as a shaman, offers to take on that role. In their humanoid forms, the aspects open themselves along with Thrall to truly gain a sense of unity; and while he struggles to hold the ceremony together, Thrall succeeds in his role in Neltharion\u2018s stead. Knowing that he could never become as Aspect, he remains content with the notion that he could assist his allies in their hour of need.\nThe four Aspects launch a volley of powerful abilities at the stunned Chromatus, who cannot bring himself to counter the volatile new powers at their disposal. The chromatic dragon is blasted downwards; the Twilight Father in tow. \nChromatus' lifeless body is stored in a specifically-made arcane prison by the blue dragonflight, as it seems impossible to completely eradicate him. \nLater, the Aspects and Thrall meet on the top of Wyrmrest temple, where Nozdormu informs the group of a plot by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; To destroy the dragonflights. The hour of Twilight was fast approaching and the Dragonflights, thanks to Thrall's help, will now be ready to face it. Thrall is given both the thanks and a scale each of the dragon aspects; in return for assistance asking only for a way to travel back to the Maelstrom.\nTick takes him back to Aggra's side, where the two orcs overcome their past differences. Thrall acknowledges that he has been a slave to outside influences his entire life, though resolves to see that end. \nKnowing that greater trials still approach on the horizon, Thrall casts off his name; proclaiming himself as \"Go'el.\"\nRage of the Firelands.\nAt the Maelstrom, Thrall strains himself attempting to commune with the elements. Able to feel how broken the world is, and with the elements remaining silent for him, Thrall tells Aggra that he will have to work without limits to fulfill this task. As he ponders the meaning of this, his elemental calls are finally answered - by none other than &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros gives Thrall a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring him that its flames will engulf both the &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; and the world beyond it, showing Thrall's reinforced home of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; washed over in a tide of fire as the final &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; approaches. Stunned, Thrall falls to the ground, and the cackling Firelord dissipates. Thrall then begins his journey to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; with Aggra.\nAfter the druids and their allies thwarted the invasion of Hyjal by the Twilight's Hammer and Ragnaros, an air of peace settled on the sacred mountain. As new growth bloomed across the region, members of the Earthen Ring and Cenarion Circle, along with the noble Dragon Aspects, convened at the ancient World Tree of Nordrassil. Among the gathered heroes were the legendary archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, the former Horde warchief and accomplished shaman Thrall, and his strong-willed companion, Aggra. Together, this illustrious assemblage was to unite its wondrous powers and restore the World Tree for the good of Azeroth.\nYet this auspicious event ended in tragedy. The details are still unclear, but word has spread that an incredibly powerful Twilight's Hammer agent, shrouded to hide his identity, interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark magics... casting his spirit into the four domains of the Elemental Plane. If these terrible rumors hold true, the Earthen Ring\u2014indeed, all of Azeroth\u2014has potentially lost one of its greatest champions. While the Aspects concede that Thrall may be lost to the elements forever, Aggra believes that her mate can be saved and calls on the aid of adventurers of both the Horde and the Alliance to venture into the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; to rescue her beloved from an eternity of torment. Before adventurers can return Thrall's spirit to the natural world they must help him overcome his doubts, his willfulness, his desires and his rage before he is bound to his elemental cage.\nThe identity of Thrall's assailant is revealed to be none other than the former Archdruid of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; - now allied with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Noting that an individual known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Prophet\"&gt;Twilight Prophet&lt;/a&gt;\" had deemed Thrall the cult's final obstacle, Fandral goes about removing him from the picture - not with death, but turning Thrall's great bond with the elements against him; his raw essence scattered to their elemental domains. &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; is unwilling to give up on Thrall - and resolves to restore her mate's essence in its entirety.\nHis self-doubt manifests itself in the plane of wind, where Thrall expresses regret over his decision to pronounce Garrosh Warchief, noting that he will lead the Horde to ruin. He mentions that he has failed both the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and that he is unworthy of Aggra. He laments that he believes his own weakness has delivered Azeroth into the face of ruin. The plane of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; displays Thrall's desire, where he is seen laying down his weapon in front of Varian and making peace with his enemies. It was also shown that he desired to be free of the burdens of leadership and start a family with Aggra. Thrall's patience is viewed in the plane of &lt;a href=\"earth\"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt;, where he is frozen in stone to symbolize his patience and resolve.\nThrall's raw, unhinged emotion is seen in the various elemental planes - &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, where Thrall's hatred towards &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, for the murder of his parents is witnessed; &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;, for declaring war upon the Horde; &lt;a href=\"Blackmoore\"&gt;Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, for the act of forcibly enslaving another; and even Thrall's rage towards &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; for his role in &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;'s demise is seen.\nUltimately, Thrall's essence is restored. He stands before Aggra, as Go'el, son of Durotan. They returned to the world tree, where Thrall declared his love for Aggra, and the two became life mates. With his resolve renewed, Thrall overcomes his predicament, with the chains that had once bound him shattered\u2014all that he once was, and more.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nAs Thrall and the other Aspects, including the newly-elevated Kalecgos, debated on how to defeat Deathwing, the shaman's spirit communed with the earth and took an &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; form. It was there that he encountered Deathwing, using the power of the Old Gods to imprison his spirit within. The corrupted Aspect mocked Thrall, believing that the Aspects sought to replace him as Earth-Warder with the mortal shaman, and claiming that the \"gift\" he had been granted by the Titans - his charge to defend Azeroth - was, in fact, a curse, imprisoning him to his duty. To demonstrate, he allowed Thrall to experience what it was like to have the weight of the earth on his shoulders, claiming that this was what the Aspects wanted - \"to damn you to a life of eternal torment\", as Deathwing stated it. He then unleashed a series of scathing attacks against Thrall's earthen form; because the shaman had embraced Azeroth, and Azeroth embraced him, his \"wounds\" materialized in the physical world in the form of earthquakes. Finally, the Aspects called on the Earthen Ring and the Cenarion Circle to break Deathwing's hold, bringing Thrall back to himself.\nThe Aspects decided that in order to defeat Deathwing, they would have to acquire the Dragon Soul in its \"purest form\" - a period not long after its creation, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ten millennia earlier. As the Soul was imbued with a powerful enchantment to prevent dragonkind from ever using it, the Aspects called on Thrall to be the wielder of the Dragon Soul in the battle against Deathwing.\nHour of Twilight.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; secure and the &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;firelord&lt;/a&gt; defeated, Thrall is tasked by the dragon aspects with taking the place of the maddened Earth-Warder once more. To this end, the defenders of Azeroth acquire the much-coveted &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;pivotal point in the past&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, heroes of Azeroth are successful in both claiming the Dragon Soul and averting a &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;cataclysmic alternate future&lt;/a&gt;, woven by the corrupted aspect of time, &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragon Soul is delivered to Thrall, who makes his way to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat Neltharion for good.\nFighting his way through the snow-covered vestiges of an &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall does battle with a formidable &lt;a href=\"ice%20ascendant\"&gt;ice ascendant&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Arcurion\"&gt;Arcurion&lt;/a&gt; and a treacherous &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; contract killer known as &lt;a href=\"Asira%20Dawnslayer\"&gt;Asira Dawnslayer&lt;/a&gt;. After claiming victory, Thrall heals the drake she had slain and makes his way to the inner sanctum of the temple astride it. As heroes arrive to rejoin forces with Go'el, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Prophet\"&gt;Twilight Prophet&lt;/a&gt; (former Archbishop Benedictus) makes an appearance - and attacks Thrall in an attempt to take back the Dragon Soul. Like Asira before him, Benedictus falls before Thrall, and the son of Durotan leaves to make preparations for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Dragon Soul in hand, Thrall and the dragon aspects &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; prepare to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, while the united dragonflights and a group of mortal heroes fend off attacks from the forces of Twilight. Atop Wyrmrest, moments after the defeat of the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall unleashes the artifact's power directly at Deathwing, damaging his armor and causing the Aspect of Death to attempt an escape. Chasing Deathwing in an Alliance gunship, the adventurers leap onto the corrupted Aspect and remove his elementium plating, giving Thrall a big enough opening to blast Deathwing again. The Destroyer falls from the sky and crashes into the Maelstrom.\nThrall and the Aspects briefly rejoice at the end of the Destroyer, only for him to suddenly rise from the Maelstrom, his form melting into a molten mass of unfathomable power. The adventurers work alongside the Aspects, preventing Deathwing from bringing about the final Cataclysm, and giving Thrall the chance to fire the third and final blast from the Dragon Soul, completely obliterating Deathwing. Thrall feels the elements \"awakening\", relieved that the Cataclysm is over. Alexstrasza explains that the Aspects have expended their ancient power and fulfilled their duties. She then reveals that Aggra is pregnant, much to Thrall's delight.\nTides of War.\nAfter Deathwing's death &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; decided to make Thrall, who has seemingly decided to be called by his birth name; Go'el, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime afterwards, Thrall and Jaina meet in secret where they were discussing Garrosh. Jaina urged Thrall to return to the Horde and reign in Garrosh's warmongering. Thrall maintained that he has found a new path and his work with the Earthen Ring was too important to abandon. After changing the conversation to his new life mate Aggra, Thrall tells Jaina that he hopes that she will find someone like he has. In response, Jaina, who bitterly thought of both &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, told him that she made better friends than love interests.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sent a courier with a message for Thrall at the Maelstrom. Deciding that his fellow shaman deserved to hear the message, Thrall told the courier to read the message out loud in public rather than in private. The gathered members of the Earthen Ring were horrified to hear that molten giants were enslaved during the fall of Northwatch. They were even further distraught and horrified with the knowledge that Theramore was destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;. As all had assumed that no one survived the blast, Thrall believed that Jaina was dead. This unpleasant news caused &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; to inform Thrall that the Earthen Ring would understand if he were to go back to the Horde and that they could continue to heal the land without him. Thrall knew that nothing was greater than healing the damage done by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and so remained while remarking to himself that even if Jaina's ghost were to come to him and demand vengeance he would still reply no.\nLater on Thrall and several others noticed that their efforts in healing the damage at the Maelstrom seemed to have less of an effect. As Thrall and Aggra went to converse with Muln about the subject, Thrall was shown a vision of Orgrimmar being drowned and destroyed by water elementals. While experiencing the vision, water elementals informed Thrall that they did not want to carry out such an act and become enslaved for all eternity. When he asked where the person who was going to enslave them was, he was shown a vision of &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt;. When the vision ended, he informed his fellow Earthen Ring members about what he experienced. While Muln expressed the desire for all of them to help, Nobundo pointed out that Thrall was the only who received the vision and as such only Thrall should go. After Aggra told him that she understood the task was his alone, Thrall departed to Fray Island.\nUpon arriving, Thrall discovered to his joy that Jaina Proudmoore was alive. That joy soon turned to horror upon realizing that it was Jaina trying to enslave water elementals and destroy his people. While trying to reason and plead with her to spare those in Orgrimmar from her retaliation for Garrosh's actions, Thrall was stunned to hear that Jaina blamed Theramore's destruction on him as Thrall had put Garrosh in charge of the Horde and did not return when she tried to convince him to. While shocked at her words, Thrall admitted that he blamed himself and asked that Jaina need not seek vengeance for Theramore by killing his people. In response, Jaina retorted that &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;her father&lt;/a&gt; was right in believing that orcs were monsters and sent out a giant tsunami at Orgrimmar.\nCalling upon the Spirit of Air for aid, Thrall was able to keep the tsunami at bay and soon learned that Jaina had gotten hold of the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to reason with his old friend, Thrall told her that while her pain was justified, innocent lives should not be killed for Garrosh's actions. In response, Jaina attacked Thrall, not with the intent to distract him but with the intent to kill. While reeling from this revelation, Thrall found that he could not bring himself to try and kill Jaina. Unwilling to kill Jaina, Thrall continued to plead for her to see reason by claiming that she should fight Garrosh, not innocent children who deserved to have a future. Jaina bitterly retorted that those who died in agony at Theramore have no future and Jaina pushed with all her might to unleash the wave under her command.\nWhile Thrall found himself keeping the tsunami in check, he completely found himself at Jaina's mercy. Unwillingly to obey Jaina's order to release the tsunami, Thrall declared that she would have to kill him. Consumed by her quest of vengeance, Jaina began to gather energy in her hand but suddenly, the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; arrived. When both, the dragon and the orc, told Jaina in their own ways to stop or she would turn back on everything that was right, Jaina retorted that she was only doing what she knew to be right. To Jaina's complete shock, Kalecgos told her that Arthas believed that same during the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon further told her that Arthas did not react with hatred in his heart and then asked her if she wanted to be remembered as another Garrosh, another Arthas. Reeling from such knowledge, Jaina's hatred left her and she poised herself. Jaina declared that she had hundreds of elementals enslaved to her and that she would use them to protect the Alliance. She further declared that Garrosh and the Horde, for as long as Garrosh was its leader, were her enemies from now on.\nAs Jaina's tsunami fractured into water elementals, Thrall was freely able to move. Informing Jaina that her heart would be glad for her choice, he was told that he did not know her heart anymore. Realizing that the friendship held between them was another casualty of the destruction of Theramore, Thrall mentioned that the coming war would change Azeroth as much as the cataclysm. Thrall informed Jaina and Kalecgos that he has pledged to heal the world and mentioned that he wished he and \"Lady Jaina\" had departed in another way. Being told that Jaina felt the same but that wishes meant nothing, Thrall nodded and then departed back towards the Maelstrom.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nThrall, having finished his job at the Maelstrom, he wanted to resign from the politics and train young shaman in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and live in peace with his beloved &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and their newborn son &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;. He was soon roped into Garrosh's conflict after the Warchief attempts (and fails) to murder &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Narrowly surviving the attempt on his life with the help of &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and Horde heroes, Vol'jin has them contact Thrall and save the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; from Garrosh's tyranny. Thrall leaves to do so, reiterating what his vision of the Horde\u2014when it was simply an idea in the desert of Durotar\u2014had first entailed. \nThrall finds the isles under martial law, the Darkspear rounded up by Thrall's very own &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. After relieving the isles of their control, Thrall ponders how best to deal with Garrosh, concluding that simply challenging him for the right to the Horde would be ill-advised at this point. Instead, he takes up leadership of the isles in the Darkspear heroes' absence and plans to confer with Vol'jin before making any rash moves.\nEscalation.\nFollowing Vol'jin's return to Durotar, Thrall journeys to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; to reunite with his old friend and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Chen Stormstout\u200e&lt;/a&gt;. It is there where Vol'jin openly begins the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the forces of Sen'jin are aided by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes when the village comes under Kor'kron attack. During the attack, Thrall and Chen worked side by side against the Kor'kron, as the heroes help push back the invaders. With Sen'jin Village secure, Vol'jin proposes an attack on &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; that is briefly halted when the shadow hunter objects to Thrall's plan to journey to Orgrimmar. While understanding Vol'jin worries that Hellscream's forces would kill him if he entered, Thrall is adamant about finding dissidents against his successor in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After asking Vol'jin to look after his mate and son should anything happen to him, Thrall journeys to Orgrimmar.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nThrall alongside &lt;a href=\"Varok\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt; reached the gate to Orgrimmar only to be stopped by the Kor'kron guard and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim sent the Kor'kron away and allowed Thrall and Varok to enter but he had no guarantees for their safety. They entered the Underhold (probably learning about it from Eitrigg) where they faced the mantid. Varok was badly hurt and urged on Thrall to continue. Thrall entered a throne room in the Underhold and confronted Garrosh, who explained that his &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; had corrupted the land, making it impossible for Thrall to call upon the spirits. Thrall engaged Garrosh in melee combat but was soundly defeated. Garrosh himself was subsequently defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThrall attempted to execute Garrosh with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, but he was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that Garrosh's punishment was not for Thrall alone to decide. &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; said Garrosh should stand trial in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Varian and Thrall agreed and stood down. After Garrosh was led away in chains, Vol'jin told Thrall that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needed its true &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; back. After pointing out that it was Vol'jin who held the Horde together and preserved its honor, Thrall knelt before Vol'jin and pledged to follow his leadership.\nAfter the siege ended, Thrall intervened so that Garrosh's remaining &lt;a href=\"arcweaver\"&gt;arcweaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s were not executed for treason. He saw potential in orcs able to wield the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, an area where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; have always been dominant.\nWar Crimes.\nDuring the meeting to decide who would be Garrosh's defender, Thrall stated that he had admired the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; ever since meeting &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; thought this cannot be happening since Garrosh slew his father (due to &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; poisoning &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, causing Garrosh to inadvertently kill him), Thrall suggested Baine should be Garrosh's defender. Baine did, after some coaxing from &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, accept the responsibility of defending Garrosh and promised he would do his job to the utmost whatever his misgivings.\nOn the fourth day of the trial Go'el was called as a witness by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh's accuser. Tyrande questioned Go'el about his past up until the events of the Siege of Orgrimmar and his appointing of Garrosh as warchief of the Horde and, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, showed a vision of when Thrall appointed Garrosh warchief. Go'el realized after Tyrande's examination that, as grueling as Tyrande's had been, Baine's examination would be far worse.\nBaine started his examination with questioning Go'el on whether he believed Garrosh threatened his vision of the Horde and then proceeded to, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the Vision of Time, show a vision of when Go'el slew &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, but not before giving him a sword with which to fight so that he could die with honor. Baine then proceeded to ask Go'el why he would not treat Garrosh the same as he had Blackmoore and was ready to kill Garrosh in Orgrimmar after he had been defeated. Baine's question led to some disturbance in the courtroom and objections from Tyrande. When asked by &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; to make his point Baine had Kairoz show another vision, this one of when Go'el was captured by the Druids of the flame and his essence was scattered to each elemental plane. The vision showed Go'el telling of his regrets such as the death of Cairne Bloodhoof. Another vision took place straight after, this one of Cairne meeting with Go'el just before he left to go to Nagrand just before the Shattering. In the vision, Cairne attempted to convince Go'el that it was a mistake to make Garrosh the warchief but the conversation ended in argument as Go'el left for the Dark Portal. After the vision Baine claimed that Garrosh had also made mistakes and asked Go'el, if he could go back to the moment, would he still try to kill Garrosh in Orgrimmar. Go'el, surprised by his answer, said that he wouldn't. After Baine was finished with his questioning Tyrande stated that she had one more vision to show, claiming that it was a possible end had Go'el made a different choice. The vision was of the hour of twilight where everything was dead, the only living things being Twilight dragons, and Deathwing was impaled upon Wyrmrest Temple.\nWhen Garrosh was to be sentenced on the ninth day, he and Kairoz escaped through a time portal using the vision of time. Alternate copies of many of the people present then emerged from the portal, including one of Go'el. Pirates and Dragonmaw, led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; to cover Garrosh's escape also burst into the courtroom and joined in the fight. The alternate Go'el was wearing human armor and wore the tabard of Aedelas Blackmoore and was a version of himself where Blackmoore's plans had come to fruition and Thrall had never escaped Durnholde. The two orcs fought but the Go'el of the true timeline had the advantage as he had trained with the elements where the other had not. He and the others were able to defeat their alternate selves when &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; told them that they had to accept these alternate versions of themselves, which they did. Go'el realized that this alternate version of himself was a Thrall, in every sense of the word, and that name allowed him to realize what he had left behind and that he was now Go'el. After the battle Go'el went to find Aggra and embraced her.\nGo'el saw that the others had won their battles as well but was interrupted when Varian burst in carrying a mortally wounded Jaina. Jaina had been shot in the chest by &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; who had arrived with Zaela, and both Go'el and Aggra attempted to heal her. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande and Velen arrived as well but they were too exhausted and Jaina's wound was too serious. Go'el realized that Jaina would die his enemy and he could think of nothing worse than that. Aggra comforted him with an embrace and all had given up save Anduin who refused to stop trying to heal Jaina. &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, who was now hovering above them, responded saying \"And so, the student remembers the lessons of my temple\" as a wave of calmness, contentment and healing washed over them. Go'el looked down to see Jaina's wounds had healed and Jaina opened her eyes. She reached out a hand and Go'el took it. Jaina squeezed Go'el's hand and let go. \nGo'el, confused, asked why the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; were not more distressed at Garrosh's escape, as it was their duty to pronounce sentence. When asked by Taran Zhu what verdict they would have rendered they stated that Garrosh would live so he could continue to learn. They also said that Garrosh was not the only one on trial and Go'el realized that everyone there had been, and he accepted it completely. The Celestials also stated that they had all been judged and sentenced and that they now had to go back out into the world and do what they must. Eventually, all heads turned to Go'el, even though he was not in a position of leadership among them anymore. Humbly, Go'el spoke for all of them, stating that they would find Garrosh.\nThe Iron Tide.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; turns red, Thrall helps to stop the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and is located in the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Landing\"&gt;Shattered Landing&lt;/a&gt; along with the remnants of the now-occupied &lt;a href=\"Okril%27lon%20Hold\"&gt;Okril'lon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde soldiers. He sent adventurers to eliminate the Iron Horde numbers and machinery and then joined with &lt;a href=\"Okrilla\"&gt;Okrilla&lt;/a&gt; and began pushing the Iron Horde and their new allies - the Dreadmaul ogres. He ultimately assists the adventurers in killing one of the leaders of this attack, &lt;a href=\"Gar%27mak%20Bladetwist\"&gt;Gar'mak Bladetwist&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a report to the Warchief while he stayed there and continue the war effort.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThrall later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the first to enter the alternate of thirty-five years ago. He assisted in the battle with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; in Tanaan Jungle. Once the was disabled, he accompanied Khadgar and his group through the western camps, freeing the prisoner during the process, included. Once they escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Halls\"&gt;Umbral Halls&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall blessed and equipped the rescued Frostwolves and draenei, and went to fight against the Blackrock orcs and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the Worldbreaker. When the Portal was destroyed, he and the other attackers hijacked Iron Horde boats to flee.\nThe Frostwolf warrior was able to take the ship the Horde boarded to &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, although his poor navigating skills resulted in the ship crashing. Thankfully, it crashed on the shore of the intended destination. Thrall came in contact with , who gave the Horde a piece of land in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; there. Thrall had &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; summoned in order to build a garrison for the Horde. While building, Thrall confronted the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skog\"&gt;Skog&lt;/a&gt; in a nearby cave. Once the structures were built he and Drek'Thar went to &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt; to find Durotan. While in the main village of the clan, Thrall noticed a Shamanstone and felt that Draenor's elementals speak to him by a language he doesn't understand. Durotan decided to put an end to the ogre's threat thus Thrall assisted the clan in the taking of &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;Bladespire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Before the main building, he summoned a tornado to the attacking ogres only to have him weakened. When he caught his breath he rejoined the attack inside of the citadel. While the commander went to confront the ogre lord &lt;a href=\"Gorr%27thog\"&gt;Gorr'thog&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall stayed and healed the injured Frostwolves. Once the lord was killed, the citadel was completely taken by the orcs and he stayed in the throne room for a time alongside Durotan. Some time later, he returned to the Garrison and asked him about his mate. He answered that she stayed home with their newly born children. Draka was surprised by this and maintained that family needs to be together in times of war. The ogres weren't the only problem in Frostfire - the declared war to the Frostwolves. Thrall accompanied his clan to &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;Grom'gar&lt;/a&gt;, ancient home of the Thunderlords and from there he continued to the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where he assisted in the battle against the approaching Iron Horde. During the battle he destroyed a cannon and Drek'Thar noticed that he had to had a great teacher. Ultimately, he watched the sacrifice of Ga'nar.\nHe later journeys to &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; for the Battle of Shattrath but was only seen when Khadgar, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and Durotan planned their counter-attack for the harbor. He was next seen in in &lt;a href=\"Wor%27var\"&gt;Wor'var&lt;/a&gt;, this time accompanied by Aggra. Drek'Thar also traveled to Nagrand in order to commune with the troubled furies and Thrall sent adventurers to assist the shaman. Once the open threats of the in &lt;a href=\"Hallvalor\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt;, the ogres of &lt;a href=\"Mar%27gok%27s%20Overwatch\"&gt;Mar'gok's Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and the in were dealt with, he asked the commander to secure Durotan's help in the upcoming and final battle against Garrosh. Once the adventurer defeated the Warsong clan in &lt;a href=\"Lok-rath\"&gt;Lok-rath&lt;/a&gt;, Durotan promised to help the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the Horde attacked the home of the Warsongs. When the adventurer and Durotan attacked Garrosh himself, Thrall entered the fray and challenged Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh agreed and they met near the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, the location of &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in the main timeline, and started to fight. During the duel, Garrosh taunted and mocked him and even destroyed his beads. The tide of the battle turned when Thrall summoned his elemental forces that caught Garrosh in a stone fist and a lightning bolt ended Garrosh's life. After the battle, he was seen near the battlefield with Khadgar, Yrel and the others planning what to do next.\nBack in Frostwall, he asked the commander to assist Draka and Drek'Thar in &lt;a href=\"Farseer%27s%20Rock\"&gt;Farseer's Rock&lt;/a&gt; with their elemental problem. The trio entered &lt;a href=\"Magnarok\"&gt;Magnarok&lt;/a&gt; and freed the fury &lt;a href=\"Exurotus\"&gt;Exurotus&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall got there and witnessed the merging of the fury with Drek'Thar which he commented as the start of Draenor's greatest shaman. Right after that, he sent the commander to &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Zog\"&gt;Warmaster Zog&lt;/a&gt; to send Horde forces into the area.\nThrall was ultimately seen in the as he watched the elemental blessing passed on the Horde commander and their ring.\nLegion.\nThrall and Vol'jin led the assault on the Broken Shore and cleared the shoreline. They made their way to Sylvanas and Baine, who were holding off the demons. Along with the Alliance, they chased Gul'dan and took care of &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;. While the Horde covered an overlooking ridge, the Alliance reached the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and confronted Gul'dan.\nAfter the failed battle, Thrall reunited with Aggra and his son Durak in Dalaran. Thrall asked shaman &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to meet at the Maelstrom in an attempt to gather the remaining &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; members who survived the battle. Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; believed that they needed powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s in order to overcome the Legion threat. Unfortunately, the Legion led by the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord\"&gt;Fel Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Geth%27xun\"&gt;Geth'xun&lt;/a&gt; found them before they could form plans. The Earthen Ring were able to repel the demons' assault, but Thrall lost the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; during the fight, which fell into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; with Geth'xun. Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Mylra\"&gt;Stormcaller Mylra&lt;/a&gt; and the shaman adventurer immediately went after it.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall interrogated the other shamans of the Earthen Ring present, while Mylra went to &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth\"&gt;Stonehearth&lt;/a&gt; to see if the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; had seen anything. The adventurer went to &lt;a href=\"Therazane%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Therazane's Throne&lt;/a&gt; to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall warned the adventurer not to anger her as she was easily tempered with, then told Mylra to meet with the adventurer and him at the Throne when they found answers. Their endeavor was not successful, but the Stonemother did know where the hammer had fallen: the &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Depths\"&gt;Crumbling Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, they found Geth'xun, who had survived the fall as well. Though Thrall was severely injured, Mylra managed to distract Geth'xun while the adventurer picked up the Doomhammer, and then used it to defeat the demon. Thrall did not take the Doomhammer back, however. Since his battle with Garrosh, he felt as if it was a dead weight in his hands, he believed that the elements were silent to him. In reality, it was his guilt and internal struggle that were the reason for this. He gave the Doomhammer to the adventurer and told them that they now wielded powers even he never tapped into. Thrall then asked the adventurer to bring the Earthen Ring together against the Legion, before going his own way.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Thrall can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThrall and his family retired to a quiet farm near &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he crafted a new weapon\u2014an axe named &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and hid it in a secret compartment under the ground, because part of him knew that there would come a day when he would have to return to the fight. Although a world away and cut off from his connection to the powers of a shaman, Thrall felt the moment when &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;burned Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;: he heard a quiet, distant, collective cry and briefly tasted smoke on the air.\nMeeting with Saurfang.\nIn the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; sought out the former warchief and told him that the Horde had begun to fall apart under Sylvanas' leadership while Thrall had been \"hiding\". Thrall responded that he had left that life behind; he was no one's savior, and he would not lead the Horde again. Varok replied that he had hoped Thrall would at least fight for it. \nThrall turned around and headed toward his anvil, but in that moment the two orcs were attacked by a pair of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; assassins. After a brief fight, they managed to defeat their ambushers. Thrall was initially outraged, believing that Varok had been followed and endangered his family, but Saurfang revealed that he had been following the assassins, meaning they had been sent for Thrall. Varok told Thrall \"You and I... we don't get to hide\". With that, Thrall returned to his anvil and pushed it aside, revealing the secret compartment where he had hidden Dra'gora. He then pulled out and slung the axe over his shoulders, ready to fight for the Horde once more.\nRise of Azshara.\nSeeking to rescue &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang and Thrall made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; where they received aid from &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; who sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid them. As Saurfang, Thrall, and the Speaker ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; where they sought to minimize the spilling of Horde blood as they moved throughout the city. Amidst their quest, the group ran into &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, who had also come to rescue Baine at &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s request and after a brief moment, agreed to work together to save Baine. When things started getting heated between Saurfang and Shaw, Jaina and Thrall were quick to get them focused on the task at hand. Upon nearly reaching Baine, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Bloodstrike\"&gt;Rowa Bloodstrike&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed disappointment but not surprise by Saurfang's and Thrall's decision to rescue Baine. Unwilling to stand down the group was forced to kill Rowa and moved forward to Baine, who was surprised at their presence. While Shaw moved to liberate Baine from his chains, Saurfang remarked that it felt too easy and the group was then attacked by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to kill them and Jaina in particular in vengeance for the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the group was successful in liberating Baine from his chains, and Jaina teleported the group safely out of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the group looked over &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall thanked Jaina for saving Baine. He then remarked to her that he wished he could change it all (&lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;) and that sometimes he feels as if he did everything wrong. Following Jaina's comment about everyone having blood on their hands, Thrall revealed his belief that Sylvanas would now come for Thunder Bluff to burn it like she did &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Jaina reminiscent about how the Horde and Alliance united for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. However, Thrall was unmoved due to remembering all the times that the Horde and Alliance had come together and how they let it fall apart and asked Jaina what was different this time. In response, Jaina told him that they were different and then departed to let Anduin know of the mission's success.\nIn order to protect Azeroth and depose of Sylvanas, the Horde revolutionaries and Alliance planned to strike at Orgrimmar and to that end set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. While Thrall didn't know what the future would bring, he declared that he wouldn't hide from it and vowed to fight for the Horde. As part of Saurfang's plan to assault Orgrimmar, Thrall joined the forces in attacking Orgrimmar from the front gate. However, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of Thrall voicing his suspicions that he would die. Thrall was subsequently among the countless witnesses to the duel between Saurfang and Sylvanas, whereupon Saurfang gaining the upper hand caused Sylvanas to declare that the Horde was nothing, kill Saurfang, and abandon the Horde all together. In the wake of Saurfang's death, Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; carried his body into the now opened gates of Orgrimmar as the majority of Sylvanas's forces had declared for the revolution following Sylvanas's betrayal.\nIn front of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Anduin served as the speakers for Saurfang's memorial service and Thrall declared that Saurfang would be buried in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, as he would have wanted. Though admitting that he didn't know how to best serve the Horde, he vowed to fight for it to the bitter end. After Saurfang's funeral, Thrall appeared on the bridge between the &lt;a href=\"Drag\"&gt;Drag&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, looking over Orgrimmar. He acknowledged that much had changed for the Horde while he was away but promised to do his part to ensure its survival.\nAfter everything was over, Thrall would sometimes encounter &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the alternate universe's Durotan and Draka, while she was on her patrol route. They exchanged brief hellos with Geya'rah referring to him as Go'el.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nThrall continued his role with the rest of the leadership of the Horde as &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; returned from the depths of Azeroth to attempt at merging it with the realm of &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;. Within N'Zoth's visions, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Vision of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish leader became maddened by what he perceived as the whispers of the elements; in truth the dark voice of N'Zoth. Convinced that the Old Gods were the only method of avoiding a world-destroying catastrophe, Thrall aggressively took control of the Horde, forcing its members to drink the blood of N'Zoth; corrupting them to his will.\nOutside of this potential future, following the death of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created, with Thrall resuming his former role as leader of the orcs, as well as their representative on the council. Upon discovering that &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; had fled Orgrimmar with the rest of Sylvanas's inner circle, Thrall asked &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; to take over as leader of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. Gazlowe agreed and\u2014in the face of Thrall's concerns that Gallywix could still be funding members of the cartel\u2014promised to simply pay them more than the cheapskate.\nThough acknowledging that a new era stood before the Horde, Thrall believed that it was important for them to move forward together without forgetting the past, as they cannot learn from what is forgotten.\nShadows Rising.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; convened for a meeting, Thrall felt it ironic that as they were discussing &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken council seat was empty. He was subsequently relived when &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; returned and noticed how &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was watching Voss's every move, as if she might be tested on it later. In light of &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;wounds&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; pointed that acting rashly could threaten the armistice, something to which Thrall privately agreed with. As the council fractured into bickering Thrall called for the meeting to be adjourned and was approached by his old friend trusted friend, &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; who revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s had sensed a terrible disturbance in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the failed assassination attempt on Talanji, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, Thrall and the rest of the Horde leaders were forced into action. They empowered the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. While Zekhan traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; to carry out his mission, Yukha agreed to serve as Thrall's messenger to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who had relocated to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;'s rage had not lessened, she did agree on the meeting with the condition that Yukha inform Thrall that he \"must bring what is owed.\" A declaration that confused both orcs.\nWhen Thrall mentioned his intention to bring &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; with him to the meeting, Yukha grew concerned, believing that their presence would remind Tyrande of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in different ways. Thrall then cited that Baine despised Sylvanas, and how Calia wished to bridge the divide between the Forsaken and the kaldorei that were raised into undeath as reasons in order to ease his worries. In response, Yukha told Thrall that he felt that it was best if Thrall came alone but acquiesced to Thrall's wishes.\nUpon meeting with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall noticed their frosty, rigid silence. Thrall subsequently formally apologized to the night elves, pointed out how Baine sought to overthrow Sylvanas and remove her as warchief, and cited Calia as an example how the Horde to change by revealing that Voss now spoke for the Forsaken and how both women sought to reforge themselves anew, free of Sylvanas, free of her poisonous influence. When the meeting started to dissolve into an argument about &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall acknowledged the harm &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; had done in the war, while reminding them that he did not intend for Teldrassil to burn and was killed by Sylvanas. When Tyrande stated she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Yukha attempted to corral the Horde leaders out of the area, but Thrall shrugged him and promised to give Tyrande what she was owed; the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; causing her smile and declare, \"Do it, then, or never seek to speak with me again.\"\nAfter returning to Orgrimmar, Thrall was informed by &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, that they had requested to speak with the council, and that the pandaren wished to accompany him to said meeting. In return, Thrall pointed out how the negotiation will require a delicate touch in contrast to Ji's wisdom in generally acting as swiftly as possible, and the council may not vote in favor of it. Though acknowledging that Thrall had a point, Ji was insistence and remarked how popular or not a &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;previous rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; had almost cost his people the soul of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;their homeland&lt;/a&gt; and that the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; will forever wear the scars of Hellscream's cruelty. Thus, when the council meeting occurred, it was Ji who brought up a meeting with the Alliance, and in the end they voted unanimously in favor of Thrall and Ji to meet with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in hopes that it would aid in the hunt and capture of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde and Alliance subsequently met on a boat at seas off the coast Zandalar. In a show of open trust Thrall revealed that he had met with Tyrande, stunning both Jaina and Anduin. While Thrall was quick to smooth over Anduin's worries over the idea of the Horde of betraying the Alliance by allowing Sylvanas to have a refuge on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the information they received allowed the orc and pandaren to realize that the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were aiding the Widow's Bite. When Anduin mentioned how &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; was taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Ji reassured the young king that the Horde Council did not execute prisoners without trial. However, Anduin retorted that he wished to have Shaw returned soon, which made Thrall told them to give him two days. When the waves threatened to upend the boat, Jaina ported everyone to safety with Ji and Thrall being sent to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSafely emerging from the portal, the pair headed off to inform Talanji of what they learned only to be attacked members of the Widow's Bite within the city itself. They, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Rastari\"&gt;Rastari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, were able to deal with the attackers and revealed to Talanji the connection between their enemies. With their task complete, the pair returned to Orgrimmar, with Thrall rallying the armies of the Horde for war against their enemies. While heading towards &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; in battle, the Horde forces were approached &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, the former lieutenant of the Widow's Bite who had grown increasingly disgusted with Apari's tactics, especially those against children. She then defected to the Horde, with Thrall later noting that her aid proved instrumental in saving them from Blightcaller's traps.\nThrall then personally fought in the conflict that followed, where he captured &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;. Though vexed by the escape of Nathanos Blightcaller, Thrall was able to release Shaw and sent the spymaster with a gift to the night elves, what he considered a start to what was owed: the prisoner Sira Moonwarden. He then joined the rest of the Horde forces in celebrating their victory, where he proudly welcomed Talanji to the Horde Council and warmly accepted Tayo as her ambassador to the Horde. After declaring that the Horde was united with their purpose clear, he invited Talanji to join the hunt for Sylvanas Windrunner when she was ready. He then departed to Orgrimmar.\nAfter the Horde Council decided to send &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to look over the Horde holdings within &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde, Thrall personally sent them a letter informing them of their mission.\nDeath Rising.\nWhen the Scourge began to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; gone, Thrall was taken by surprise by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; and despite fighting fiercely it was not enough, and Thrall was captured and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nThrall later worked with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to hide from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; and escape the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, where he became injured. They were later joined by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After catching their breath, the group made their way towards &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Respite\"&gt;Forlorn Respite&lt;/a&gt; in order to use the cave as a refuge. However en route they were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Tariesh\"&gt;Tariesh&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to stop them. Upon Tariesh's death, Thrall and his allies successfully made their way into the cave.\nThrall, Jaina, and the champion soon after ventured forth to rescue &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, which involved killing &lt;a href=\"Phael%20the%20Afflictor\"&gt;Phael the Afflictor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Afflictor%27s%20Key\"&gt;his key&lt;/a&gt;, and rescue other souls from the Mawsworn. Following Anduin's liberation, the group returned to Forlorn Respite, where they discovered that a &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;Eroded Waystone&lt;/a&gt;, which could be the way out, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; could be found at &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Zovaal's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall was deeply troubled at the thought of leaving the missing &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; behind, with Jaina reassuring him that if there was a way out, then there was a way back in that could be entered to rescue her. While heading towards Zovaal's Cauldron, Thrall and his allies were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, who knocked them off the bridge in response to Thrall throwing his axe at her. He subsequently witnessed &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; throw Baine off a platform.\nAfter securing Baine, Thrall and the champion subsequently headed off to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20Blade\"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; to help mend his spirit and retrieve a new weapon for Thrall. With Baine restored, the group headed off towards the waystone, discovering the sheer size of the Jailer's army along the way. Thrall himself found himself in disbelief as despite all Sylvanas had done, he never thought she would be apart of something like this. Upon arriving at the waystone, they were confronted by the Jailer's forces, and though the champion was able to escape, Thrall and the others were captured.\nAfter being captured Thrall was sent to &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, where at some point he was dragged through in chains to a higher level. After being liberated, Thrall marveled at &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, calling it as a hope to contrast the darkest reaches of the Shadowlands. He expressed hope that the spirits of his ancestors were safe in realms of comfort and peace, and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; promised to send word to &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; of his recovery. After discovering that Sylvanas and the Jailer intend to turn Anduin into a weapon, Thrall called upon the Maw Walker to continue their efforts to undermine the Jailer, and vowed that when the time came, they would rescue Anduin.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of the Jailer, Bolvar felt a darkness calling to him within Torghast. Thrall learned from Bolvar that a new mourneblade was being forged within the tower and that the Jailer decided that the time had come for Anduin to become his agent, regardless of his choice. Thrall was quick to prepare himself for battle when the Jailer attempted to gain control of Bolvar through the Helm of Domination. After Jaina and the Maw Walker were able to sever the connection, Baine called for them to immediately attack Torghast and rescue Anduin. However, Thrall and Jaina countered that they had to hold back and rally the covenants. Bolvar agreed with their assessment and thus implored the Maw Walker to continue their efforts and declared that when the time came, they would claim victory.\nChains of Domination.\nWhen the covenants rallied together to defend &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Baine stayed behind in Oribos to defend the city and the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; from the Jailer's minions.\nThrall later once again donned the Doomhammer plate armor and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;. There, the soul of his mother &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had become a baroness of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; after her death\u2014was preparing to attack the fortress &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the Maw alongside a Maw Walker in order to deal with two of the Jailer's lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall asked to join them on their mission and accompanied the two to Desmotaeron. As they fought their way through the Mawsworn, Thrall and Draka asked each other questions about their lives, but when he tried to tell her that he was her son, she cut him off and told him to focus on the mission. During the fighting, Thrall asked the Maw Walker to help him retrieve &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt; from Helya's minion &lt;a href=\"Weaponmaster%20Hyrev\"&gt;Weaponmaster Hyrev&lt;/a&gt;, since the axe reminded him of his family and he wanted to feel its weight in his hands again. After summoning a series of death gates throughout the fortress, the trio summoned the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt; and allowed the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance\"&gt;united covenants&lt;/a&gt; to begin an assault on Desmotaeron. With the Mawsworn in lower Desmotaeron combating the invaders, Thrall, Draka, and the Maw Walker breached the upper part of the fortress and confronted Vyraz and Helya. Helya empowered Vyraz with her boon, but the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; of Maldraxxus teleported in and gave Draka his own blessing, allowing the group to defeat the baron and the Primus to banish Helya.\nAs they returned to Keeper's Respite, Draka called Thrall by his birth name\u2014Go'el\u2014revealing that she had known all along who he was. She asked him who he had grown to be since her death. He began telling her about his time as warchief and shaman, but she cut off him and pointed out that that was who he \"had\" been, not who he currently was. Thrall replied that he was uncertain about his future, and his mother gave him a lesson: to remember his past, but also to take pride in who he was. She expressed joy over seeing who he had become, assured him that he had much farther to go, and took him aside to hear more about his life. Thrall subsequently accompanied Draka to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, where the Primus promoted her to the rank of margrave. Thrall commented that this position and the challenges that came with it were not unlike those of a warchief. Draka replied that she'd have to rely on her allies to find victory, and added \"Perhaps a similar road lies ahead of you, my son\".\nSometime later, Thrall and his allies stormed into the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the Jailer, once and for all. However, despite defeating the likes of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nine\"&gt;The Nine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was able to stall them long enough for the Jailer to absorb the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in to his being. Thrall was then briefly controlled by Zovaal through the use of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic before he was released after Sylvanas, who realized that the Jailer never intended to not to break the system of Death and give everyone free will as she had believed, but to forge a new reality where all would be forced to serve him, attacked him. In response, Zovaal reunited Sylvanas with the missing fragment of her soul before leaving with the mind-controlled Anduin, and thus allowing Thrall and his allies to imprison Sylvanas.\nIn the aftermath, Thrall and Jaina came to &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; to inform the Primus over what had transpired. The pair further revealed that prior to departing with the Jailer, Anduin had intentionally dropped a compass, which Anduin had given to &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, which gave them both hope that Anduin was fighting against the Jailer. After Jaina sensed an enchantment upon the compass, the pair turned to Bolvar to examine it and discovered that a memory was contained within the compass. Upon reviewing the memory the group learned that Anduin felt increasingly hollow and empty as a result of being dominated by the Jailer, and his belief that both he and Sylvanas would be lost by the time Zovaal succeeds, and his hope that his friends remember him as he was and not what Sylvanas had made him into. After the memory ended, Thrall declared that Anduin did not deserve such a fate and that they must fight to save him.\nThe Primus subsequently collected the four reforged covenant &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s so that he could pursue the Jailer to his destination. Thrall stayed at the respite to talk to Draka and confided that he still felt responsible for the actions of Garrosh (whose soul had destroyed itself in the Sanctum). In response, Draka shared something that Durotan used to say: \"a wolf decides whether to come when called or to turn on its master\". She added that Garrosh had chosen his own path and that it had now ended, whereas Thrall's continued moving forward. Thrall agreed on this and thanked his mother for the advice.\nEternity's End.\nWithin Oribos, Thrall participated in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar, Jaina, and Baine about the comatose Sylvanas Windrunner. In this meeting, Uther revealed that Sylvanas's soul had been fractured from the moment of her death, that the Jailer had severed their bond, and with their reunion Sylvanas had been condemned to endlessly relive her atrocities as long as her soul remain divided. In response to this, Baine remarked that perhaps Sylvanas shouldn't be awoken. However, Bolvar countered that Sylvanas was the only one who likely knew the Jailer's plan and could be the key to saving Anduin. Though Jaina and Thrall echoed Baine's distrust of Sylvanas, the group ultimately let Uther mend the soul wound, which allowed for Sylvanas to rise and join the fight against Zovaal. Thrall later joined Sylvanas, Jaina, Bolvar, and Uther as they invaded the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and rescued Anduin, before retreating.\nSometime after Bolvar, &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker worked together to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Inscrutable%20Phrase\"&gt;Inscrutable Phrases&lt;/a&gt; from the language of the First Ones, and imbue them within the intact half of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a counter to Zovaal's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic. Once this task was completed the trio joined Thrall, Baine, Anduin, Jaina, Sylvanas, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Within the chamber, Thrall acknowledged, that while fighting for the Shadowlands was important that he missed the peacefulness of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; and the bustle of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. He further expressed his hope that they were nearing their final victory in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and was certain that he wasn't the only one who longed to see the stars of home.\nThrall then witnessed those who had overcome Domination in the past draw out the memories of their resistance and willpower and infuse it into the shards. After Bolvar declared that they had all the pieces they needed and that it was time for Primus to reforge the helm, Jaina directly opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; and the group used it to reach the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;. As the Primus began to reforge the helm, Thrall questioned what was to stop the helm from being used to enslave others, to which the Primus answered that it was \"to become something greater. An instrument of free will.\" Thrall subsequently witnessed the Primus reforge the helm into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, which was quickly used to ensure that the group was resistant to Domination.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Thrall was amongst those who attended the judgment of Sylvanas Windrunner. After the Banshee Queen submitted to the judgment of Tyrande Whisperwind, the night elf matriarch ordered that her penance was to scour the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for every soul lost in its depths, betrayed or condemned and to send them forth to the &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. After reflecting on how the journey into the Shadowlands taught him about his mother, himself, and the legacy that everyone leaves behind, Thrall personally witnessed Sylvanas entering the Maw to begin her penance.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nThrall and his family were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAs Thrall and his family were visiting &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, they were unexpectedly joined by &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; who had arrived to recruit Drek'Thar in their mission to bring back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. While Drek'Thar was quick to join in agreement about the festival, Aggra declared that they should offer more than just a return of the festival, that they should create a new rite of passage, one that teaches not just of the hunt, but what it means to be an orc, an &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt; - a rite of honor. The others quickly agreed and Thrall offered no objections when Eitrigg declared that the champion should be the first to complete the om'gora. After Drek'Thar declared that his old bones wouldn't make it to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall initially thought that he was to take Drek'Thar place as the one to preside over the Kosh'harg before the older shaman chose &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;. Thus as Aggra prepared for the festival, Thrall and Eitrigg sent off to gather the clans.\nAs the orcs gathered in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Thrall had personally invited the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27nathal\"&gt;Mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herezegor%20Flametusk\"&gt;Herezegor Flametusk&lt;/a&gt; admitting their surprise. Meanwhile, as the festival began, Thrall expressed his excitement at seeing so many familiar faces that he hadn't seen in years. When the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Thrall highlighted the strength of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, their life-long &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; companions, how they had hardy warriors and hunters, and hold a strong connection to the spirits of the elements and their ancestors. Upon the champion requesting to join the Frostwolf, Thrall expressed his pleasure. He subsequently instructed them with hunting tracking and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Thrall accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of his clan.\nAfter the om'gora was successfully completed, the orcs celebrated with a feast in the champion's honor, where Thrall feasted with his family. As the Kosh'harg drew to a close, Thrall thanked everyone for attending. He stated that while many of their ancient traditions had been lost when they came to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, it was time to remember the rites of old and build new traditions. After commending the champion for being the first to complete the om'gora, called for their footsteps to be followed for generations to come. As Aggra officially ended the festival, Thrall privately admitted to the champion that he hadn't seen the orcs this hopeful about the future since the &lt;a href=\"liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the internment camps&lt;/a&gt; and noted how others were preparing to complete the om'gora themselves, but Thrall vowed to be second orc to complete the rite.\nThe War Within.\nSome time later, Thrall begins receiving visions and hearing a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt; calling out to him. He is beckoned to the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, where he finds the missing &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Believing his &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is needed against a coming darkness, Thrall asks Anduin to come home, only for Anduin to lash out that he has no Light due to his actions while under the control of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall assures his trust in Anduin before they are suddenly interrupted by the voice, who exclaims \"Hear me\". This causes the pair to gaze up at the dormant &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, believing the mad titan was aiming at someone when he plunged his sword into the planet.\nTactics.\nThe most critical part of the strategy is to give the Horde as little warning as possible. Mainly since Horde players tend to feel more obligated and passionate about defending Thrall than any other WoW leader. The slightest mention of an attack on Thrall is enough to send a fair number of players to his side. Diverting attention can be done either by using a warlock to summon, or if you are careful, gathering across the bridge west of Orgrimmar, then riding to Thrall's room at full speed.\nApproaching from Ratchet may not be the best option because of the number of Horde leveling in the area, so the best option is riding by the river from Azshara, making good use of a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Path of Frost&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce on Thrall's room, use AoE spells to take care of the guards, then a simple tank and spank strategy on Thrall. Vol'jin may be offtanked at the same time, or Thrall can be taken down first by approaching from the left side of the room as you enter and Vol'jin may be optionally taken care of afterward. Two raids (80 people) are recommended.\nHe can be done easily with a 40 man raid if done right. With a well geared 40 man raid group you can drop him easily if summoned in and done without alerting many Horde.\nThe arena inside Orgrimmar is a great spot for summoning if you manage to successfully place a warlock and his summoning support in there. A decoy may be used as well, most likely a couple of rogues attacking the bank or some other crowded area as this will take the Horde's attention from the attack, having them to think it's just an isolated act from bored players.\nWith the advent of the Wintergrasp battleground, a new technique is to wait until Wintergrasp has initiated and then storm Orgrimmar. Note that success is limited due to it being predictable, after being used once, it will be expected later.\nHis death was originally the requirement for &lt;a href=\"Death%20to%20the%20Warchief%21\"&gt;Death to the Warchief!&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nGo'el, despite the usual brutish nature of the orcs, is wise beyond his years and a very honorable shaman. Go'el is seen as a kind and friendly person to his allies and will accept any visitors willing to help the Horde into his city. To any who try to harm his people, such as demons and the undead, he will end their lives without remorse. If someone under his leadership causes dishonorable and unnecessary bloodshed, or worse, consorts with demons, Go'el's policy is clear: a death sentence carried out by the Doomhammer.\nNames and titles.\nKnown as Thrall to most, it was revealed that his true name was in fact Go'el. Over the years Thrall was given many titles, including, but not limited to:\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nGossip.\nAll members of the Horde are equal in my eyes, &lt;name&gt;. We have all suffered many burdens, and if it were not for wisdom and honor, then we would be no better than the Scourge or my people while our blood was tainted by the demon Mannoroth.\nIt is your duty to aid the Horde and to defend our way of life. But it is also your duty to know when quarter and compassion should be given to friend and foe alike.\nUnderstand this well. This is the new Horde, not some demon-spawned army who lack freewill.\nIt would be wise to explain to you the depths at which our enemies will go to to hide themselves under our noses.\nKnow this first and foremost: our enemy is the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. No matter what task I give you, or who I ask you to act against, know that one simple fact.\nMany cults exist within the Council, but only to hide its actions against the foolish.\nGroups like the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt; are all tools of the Council. Consider them one and the same.\nThe Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Proudmoore's forces have bled to delay Archimonde and his Burning Legion, and now this grim task falls to us. Are you ready to stand with me against the onslaught?\nThe Burning Legion presses us hard, but our defenses hold. Every moment we keep Archimonde away from the World Tree brings us closer to victory.\nOutstanding! Kaz'rogal's death cry should strike fear into the core of the Burning Legion. They now know the power your forces possess, so expect the worst the Legion can offer.\nOutstanding! Killing a Pit Lord such as Azgalor is no small feat, my friend. If we had more time, I would love to hear the story of you and your companions. Archimonde will not give us that pleasure, however. My scouts have already reported that the Legion is amassing an immense force outside our camp, and Archimonde is very close to the World Tree. We are evacuating with the help of Lady Proudmoore. You should head to the World Tree at once. The fate of our world is still undecided.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nScourge Invasion.\nIt was only a matter of time before we would have to deal with the Lich King. He represents a threat to all of Azeroth, not just the humans.\nBut, the decision to go to war is one that must not be made lightly. We would be fools to rush into Northrend. The Lich King has surely anticipated such an action.\nOur options must be weighed carefully. Our armies are mightier than ever, but a tactically unsound decision could ruin us.\nIf only Garrosh understood...\nThe Horde needs you! Beat back the Lich King's forces!\nMists of Pandaria.\nIt is a good thing to spend time in a place like this. We must always remember what it is we struggle so hard to protect.\nDo me this courtesy, &lt;name&gt;, and do not share with Garrosh what has transpired here today. I could confront him directly, but I see now not all orcs share my view of the Horde.\nWho am I to command their allegiance if I must become another dictator to do so?\nWhat I can do is to aid the Darkspear in fortifying their home while their heroes are abroad for the war. When Vol'jin returns, we will plan our next move.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAzeroth has been invaded by a vicious enemy that seems bent on world domination. \nWe must act quickly if we are to put a stop to the chaos that is unfolding around us.\nWor'gol.\nI was raised on stories of Frostfire Ridge, the ancestral home of the Frostwolves.\nI never believed I would ever see the clan as they were in their prime, with Durotan as their chief.\nHe is... shorter... than I imagined. The burden of leadership weighs heavy on his shoulders.\nWor'var.\nThrom-Ka, commander.\nI'm glad you're here. I need you to take over our preparations to deal with the .\nWe will drive them before us, and we'll bring Garrosh to justice once and for all.\nLegion.\nOur defeat at the Broken Shore was a disaster. What's left of the Alliance and Horde are at one another's throats.\nShaman, heores like you may be our last great hope. Stay strong, and do not give up.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDurotar.\nMy mistakes have been many, &lt;name&gt;. And they have led me here once again.\n&lt;Thrall shakes his head.&gt;\nI do not know what the future will bring, but I will not hide from it. I will fight for the Horde.\nOrgrimmar Embassy.\nIt was not long ago that I wished for nothing more than to bury the past, but I know now that it is something I will always carry with me.\nAlthough a new era stands before us as champions of the Horde, we must move forward together without forgetting the past.\nWe cannot learn from that which we've forgotten.\nShadowlands.\nI will be glad for the day when this... place is behind us.\nAfter so many hard fought battles and wars for life, it is... interesting... to have so many questions answered about what happens after.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Thrall would have been the main character. Raised by humans in servitude, he escaped his shackles and began his journey to discover his heritage and reunite the scattered &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde and forging new alliances, for example with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; by killing &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Some notable differences are that he was depicted as having a more wise cracking personality, and learned how to use &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;dark magics&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. The story of the game was eventually adapted into a novel, \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe was going to be voiced by &lt;a href=\"Clancy%20Brown\"&gt;Clancy Brown&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting bit of trivia is that in , Thrall was armed with an axe that could have been the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Durotan\"&gt;Axe of Durotan&lt;/a&gt; from this game. In &lt;a href=\"Thrall%27s%20Vision%20%28WC3%20demo%29\"&gt;Thrall's Vision&lt;/a&gt; he is still armed with the axe.\nIn the RPG.\nFollowing the merge of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; into a singular entity, Thrall and Jaina held conferences to discuss the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; army on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome people in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; speculate that Jaina's relation with Thrall has taken a salacious turn. Some outspoken political opponents are on the verge of accusing Jaina of miscegenation.\nFollowing the death of Daelin, Thrall and Jaina found a human named &lt;a href=\"Rufus%20Montaine\"&gt;Rufus Montaine&lt;/a&gt; among the dead. He recognized him as his former mentor.\nThrall is a &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;, and a shaman.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nThrall is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOne of his skins, \"Hellhammer Thrall\", depicts an alternate reality in which Go'el was the fel orc Warlord of the \"Ashwolf clan\". The description reads: \"\"Go'el, the new Warlord of the Ashwolf clan, lifted the shattered &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; from the Blackrock chieftain's corpse. Of his father's betrayers, only &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; remained.\"\"\nAlternate timelines.\nA version of existed in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and which was entered by Thrall from the main universe during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\nBefore Thrall entered the Blackmoore world, Thrall and the alternate Aedelas entered yet another timeway at a point during the murder of Durotan and Draka. In contrast with the main universe, Thrall took his infant alternate self and held him for a while. Then the alternate King Aedelas came forward to kill the infant, an attempt interrupted by the main universe Thrall. The infant was then taken by Aedelas from this timeline. &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt;'s statement confirms that this infant was different from the one who died in the Blackmoore world.\nIn another timeline, Thrall was raised into obedient servitude of Aedelas, and fought with the main universe Thrall when &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; escaped his trial in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. He wore traditional human plate armor and a tabard with a black falcon. The two Thralls clashed. According to Baine, Kairoz selected the most broken and darkest versions. To send them back to their own realities, one was to accept the other self.\nIn yet another timeline, Thrall was unable to stop Jaina Proudmoore from destroying Orgrimmar which resulted in full war and many casualties.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, there are four versions of Thrall - Warchief of the Horde, Hellhammer Thrall as a Warlord of the Ashwolf clan, Master Thrall and Earthbreaker. If they are part of the Warcraft universe is yet to be revealed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Go%27el%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Draka%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

{"id": "36332", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36332", "title": "Thrallmar", "text": "Thrallmar is a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; town found in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded and now led by &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, commander of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s security, as an opportunity to gain resources and to have a decent control over what's going on in this demon-infested area. The residents of the town form a faction of its own; reputation is raised by performing quests for them. These quests generally involve killing &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town is made up of a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"kennel\"&gt;kennel&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; and an alchemy tower.\nReputation.\nReputation for Thrallmar up to Honored is relatively easy to earn. Even the easiest quests (those that take you from one quest giver to the next up the road, for example) can yield 75 reputation points, while those that require some effort to complete typically yield 250 reputation points or more. Some group quests that involve killing an elite can yield as much as 1000 reputation points.\nIf you do the bulk of the Thrallmar quests instead of quickly moving on to the next zone, you might expect to reach Honored after 1 or 2 levels of play. However, once you reach Honored, you hit an earnings barrier that you can only remove when you are level 68 and can start re-earning points in the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt; dungeon.\nNeutral through Friendly.\nReputation from mobs in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; stops at 5999/6000 Friendly, one point shy of Honored. One option is to grind mob rep via Ramparts and Blood Furnace to 5999/6000, before doing any Thrallmar quests outside the instances, as those continue to yield reputation up to exalted.\nAlso, the lvl 63 mobs outside Hellfire Citadel (on the path) and the Bleeding Hollow Necrolytes at Zeth'gor give you 5 rep each, but not beyond Friendly.\nFriendly through Honored.\nPlayers who enjoy PvP can gain faction halfway through Honored via the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Fortifications\"&gt;Hellfire Fortifications&lt;/a&gt;. It gives 150 reputation per completion and three &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Thrallmar\"&gt;Marks of Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to purchase PvP gear from the quartermasters in Thrallmar and near &lt;a href=\"Zabra%27jin\"&gt;Zabra'jin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. To start this quest you need to have done 2 prereq quests however. Also with patch 2.1 this quest can only be done once every 24 hours.\nHonored to Revered and Exalted.\nFrom this point on, gaining reputation through Exalted requires one of two things: \nBoth of these give reputation until you reach Exalted status. A full clear of &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt; nets you about 1700 reputation points, trash mobs generally yield 6 or 12 each, with up to 150 points from bosses. Heroic trash yields 15-25 points, with bosses worth more.\nYou can also continue to do the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Fortifications\"&gt;Hellfire Fortifications&lt;/a&gt; for 150 reputation per completion. While at level 70 the quest giver in Thrallmar does not show the yellow exclamation mark and the quest appears gray, you can in fact continue doing it for reputation.\nMaximizing Shattered Halls Runs.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar%20Favor\"&gt;Thrallmar Favor&lt;/a&gt;, which are purchased with five &lt;a href=\"Marks%20of%20Thrallmar\"&gt;Marks of Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; PvP tokens can reduce the number of &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt; runs required. Consuming one right when &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Nethekurse\"&gt;Grand Warlock Nethekurse&lt;/a&gt; is about to die will allow a decent speed group to go through to the end boss with the buff active. Doing this can net 3000 reputation points per run if you kill all of the trash without wiping.\nRepeatable Quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Fortifications%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Hellfire Fortifications (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest\"&gt;daily PvP quest&lt;/a&gt; given by Battlecryer Blackeye in Thrallmar:\nReputation grinding.\nKilling the &lt;a href=\"Shattered_Hand_Clan%23Fel_Orcs_of_the_Shattered_Hand\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s around the Citadel yields 5 points of reputation per kill until 2999 of 3000 at Neutral status. After that, run the instances (&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt;) until 5999/6000 at Friendly status. Repeat Hellfire Fortifications until you are maxed at 6000/12000(576 turn-ins. *See Notes above) (this method is now deprecated due to the new patch) then turn in all the quests you've saved up to this point and complete the newly unlocked quests. All the quests for the Hellfire Peninsula region total about 10k in rep. \nRewards.\nSee &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Hellfire%20Peninsula%20NPCs\"&gt;List of Hellfire Peninsula NPCs&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations and NPCs.\nThrallmar Inn.\nThe Thrallmar Inn features a mailbox outside; and a handful of vendors and profession trainers: \nOutside the wall.\nIn the town, there are 70 &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar%20Grunt\"&gt;Thrallmar Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar%20Marksman\"&gt;Marksmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bat%20Rider%20Guard\"&gt;Bat Rider Guard&lt;/a&gt;s protecting the town.\nThere are also 12 Thrallmar Peons doing various tasks such as working at the blacksmith, repairing wagons and catapults or shifting through supplies.\nFlight Paths.\nThrallmar's flight paths connect to: \nIt should be noted that you have this flight path by default. You do not need to talk to the Flight Master to obtain it."}

It is their sacred mission, one which was charged to them by the titans, to guard the caverns against the intrusion of mortals, whose interference would assuredly disrupt the flow of time. Recently, a mysterious force called the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has begun to meddle with time. The Bronze Dragonflight is recruiting adventurers to make sure that the events that took place in the past remain as they were. \nHistory.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; teleported to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s lair using an &lt;a href=\"Eon%20Rose\"&gt;Eon Rose&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragon Aspect was upset with this intrusion in his artifact collecting hobby.\nDeep within the Caverns of Time, the brooding dragon Nozdormu has awakened. Since the world was young, the bronze dragonflight has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is upheld.\nThe Timeless One sensed a threat to his beloved timeways. Shadowy agents have infiltrated the Caverns of Time, attempting to sabotage four key historical events: &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s escape from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, the monumental battle of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' culling of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. In the face of this overwhelming threat, Nozdormu is enlisting heroes to help him prevent the fabric of time from unraveling forever.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nDuring Thrall's journey during the events of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; ventured to the Caverns. Thrall learned about the timeways such as one, where he escapes from Durnholde. While they were meditating, an attacked them and killed Desharin. Thrall was then tossed to a portal by a bronze dragon and began his journey through the past and was able to release Nozdormu.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion%23Tanaris\"&gt;Legion invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Tanaris, the entrance to the cavern was sealed by a protective barrier and defended with the help of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon the invasion being successfully pushed back, the barrier was lifted.\nWorld of Warcraft anniversary.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%27s%20Anniversary\"&gt;Warcraft's 15th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, the bronze dragonflight invited adventurers in order to celebrate. Many dragons transformed themselves into &lt;a href=\"Reveler%20of%20Time\"&gt;Revelers of Time&lt;/a&gt; and danced, played volleyball or shot fireworks. The &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20Time\"&gt;Tavern of Time&lt;/a&gt; was transformed into a night club. The banner of every playable race was displayed on the way. &lt;a href=\"Sa%27at\"&gt;Sa'at&lt;/a&gt; handled a collection of &lt;a href=\"chronocrystal\"&gt;chronocrystal&lt;/a&gt;s that would display the memories of the &lt;a href=\"Videos\"&gt;most important&lt;/a&gt; moments of Azeroth's recent history. &lt;a href=\"Coridormi\"&gt;Coridormi&lt;/a&gt; handled the &lt;a href=\"Displaced%20Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;Displaced Scarab Gong&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Tauren%20Chieftain\"&gt;Elite Tauren Chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Blight%20Boar\"&gt;Blight Boar&lt;/a&gt;s provided music. Even &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; came to the party.\nAppearance and denizens.\nThe Caverns are littered with artifacts and buildings such as statues, weapons, the half-buried bones of a gargantuan beast, a &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bunker%23Dwarves\"&gt;dwarven domed building&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, dour &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; quarters, a stranded &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;, armor from the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20family\"&gt;first king&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and the statue of an elven &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; spent years gathering and cataloguing this mismatch collection of antiquities.\nThe caverns are not all sand \u2014 some former barren areas are full of lush forests and all around the Caverns there are huge dragon watchers, some on all fours and some on two legs, towering above everything else, and they wield huge axes. A few vendors and other humanoids exist throughout the Caverns, among them being frozen human warriors that surround towers of old &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and frozen citizens of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, an alcohol vendor, an enchantment materials vendor and a vendor that sells general goods. From the general goods vendor (who is called a ) you can buy new types of cheese and water. The frozen NPCs' eyes all creepily move and glance around.\nThe bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, who sits outside the gate, is labeled as a \"?? Boss\" but is not hostile at this point in time \u2014 although his companions &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chronalis\"&gt;Chronalis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Occulus\"&gt;Occulus&lt;/a&gt; do remain aggressive. It is not at all a risk to walk right into the caverns as they currently stand, so long as you don't get too close to any of the dragons other than Anachronos. \nThe caverns contain several instances with content culled directly from their previous \"Warcraft\" games or periods of the \"Warcraft\" history that elapsed between them. At one point Blizzard also discussed a battleground set in the past, but the project appears to have been shelved.\nInstances.\n&lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish internment camps in southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was a 19-year-old slave to human officer &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who intended to use &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as a puppet &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; to control the orcish Horde and thus gain power over his fellow humans. However, Thrall knew that he was destined for more, and so he made his escape from Durnholde to find others of his kind, eventually discovering the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt; and his place as Warchief.\nThis instance contains the entire &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; area as it appeared 7 years ago, before the Horde destroyed Durnholde, and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the magical &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, was possessed at birth by the evil Titan, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. It was Medivh who first contacted the corrupt orc sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, also in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Together they sought to bridge the dimensional gap between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, to facilitate the destruction of Azeroth. On the appointed day both Medivh and Gul'dan concentrated their considerable magic energies, forcing the collapse of the dimensional barrier. The setting of this event is the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers defend Medivh as he opens the portal.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the pinnacle of the second battle against the Burning Legion, it was clear to the races of Azeroth that the only way to achieve victory would be to unite their forces in a final, desperate push for victory. This battle took place at the peak of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, led by Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, united their forces against &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and the demonic forces of the Burning Legion in a massive, epic battle to defend Azeroth. Victory was narrowly achieved, even as Archimonde reached the World Tree and attempted to drain it of its energy.\n&lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next instance, included in the second expansion, is &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; several years in the past. Players join &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; in \"cleansing\" the city of plagued villagers, one of the final acts in a series of personal changes that culminates in Arthas becoming a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the first acts into his descent to madness. This was a level within \"Warcraft III\". &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; are seen in this instance briefly, as Arthas had a disagreement with his mentor before the culling of the people of Stratholme, and disbanded the order of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to which Uther belonged \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinal Push against the Worldbreaker.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Aspects that occupy &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; have a problem: They know that if they cannot destroy their fallen brother &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, he'll consume the world. There's only one artefact with the power to weaken the Black Scourge, but it has long since been destroyed: the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. To retrieve the golden disk the Aspects must charge the heroes of Azeroth with its retrieval from the depths of time. Deathwing first unleashed the power of the Dragon Soul to stop &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from entering Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. That means sending players to the Caverns of Time and Nozdormu. Upon arriving, the Aspect of Time will tell them that his ability to send them back to the battle at the Well of Eternity is being interfered with by an entity in the future. First then, players must go forward into the Endtime and kill &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. Within they'll witness a charred vision of the world should the plan to defeat Deathwing fail.\n&lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Murozond's defeat, players will be able to venture into the past and partake in the near-apocalyptic clash at the Well of Eternity. There, players will fight alongside such prominent characters of Warcraft lore as Illidan, Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande. They'll see the demon Mannoroth and the delusional Highborne queen, Azshara.\n&lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Dragon Soul is secured, players will return to the present and in the third instance will be charged with protecting both Thrall and the artifact as they make their way to Wyrmrest Temple in Northrend. In The Hour of Twilight, they'll discover the Temple is now under full assault by Deathwing and his myriad forces. It's a conceit that players will be familiar with from Wrath of the Lich King's patch 3.3, and it perfectly stages the final Cataclysm raid against Deathwing himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe raid picks up right where the final instance finishes. Thrall and the Dragon Soul are now nearby Wyrmrest Temple and raiders begin by attempting to relieve the beleaguered Aspects. Deathwing's host includes the Twilight dragonflight, Earth Elementals, servants of the Old Gods and the Twilight's Hammer cult. As players reach the summit of the Temple they'll encounter &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful Twilight dragons ever created. Once the Twilight dragon has been bested, Thrall is able unleash the charged Dragon Soul upon Deathwing. The raid then boards an airship in pursuit of the wounded dragon who is now flying for the Maelstrom and the safety of Deepholm. En route, Twilight's Hammer drake riders, led by the Twilight's Hammer Warmaster, will harry them. Having dispatched the Twilight's Hammer, players will then leave the airship and climb onto the back of Deathwing himself. Scrambling on the huge dragon, players will be tasked with prying up these huge elementium plates from his back to allow Thrall and the Aspects to shoot the Dragon Soul at him again.\nHuman Illusion.\nDue to lore reasons, primarily the absence of certain races at the time periods portrayed in the CoT instances, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; will place the spell &lt;a href=\"Human%20Illusion\"&gt;Human Illusion&lt;/a&gt; on all &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; player characters, turning them into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; forms of themselves - but retaining all of that character's actual gear on their new temporary model. Death knight players will still retain their echo voices and blue glowing eyes. Before &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.6\"&gt;patch 4.0.6&lt;/a&gt;, worgen players retained their usual human form but were unable to use &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;Running Wild&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight Elf Illusion.\nAll players appear as night elves in the Well of Eternity instance, similar to the Human Illusion in the Culling of Stratholme and Escape from Durnholde Keep instances.\nNPCs.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexston%20Chrome\"&gt;Alexston Chrome&lt;/a&gt; appears first; he appears to be a &lt;a href=\"Bartender\"&gt;tavernkeeper&lt;/a&gt; and operates an establishment named the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20Time\"&gt;Tavern of Time&lt;/a&gt; where he sells five varieties of alcohol.\nNext to appear is &lt;a href=\"Yarley\"&gt;Yarley&lt;/a&gt;, a dwarven armorer who sells ordinary blacksmithing supplies and can repair your gear. Not far is &lt;a href=\"Otela\"&gt;Otela&lt;/a&gt;, a vendor of toys.\nThe last vendors to appear are &lt;a href=\"Galgrom\"&gt;Galgrom&lt;/a&gt;, and his unfortunate brother &lt;a href=\"Bortega\"&gt;Bortega&lt;/a&gt; (who's voice has been altered due to the strain of &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;), orcs who have become stranded between some point in the past and the present. Galgrom sells various foodstuffs, including two new items, &lt;a href=\"Garadar%20Sharp\"&gt;Garadar Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, which restores 4,320 health over 30 seconds and requires level 55, and &lt;a href=\"Filtered%20Draenic%20Water\"&gt;Filtered Draenic Water&lt;/a&gt;, which restores 5,100 mana over 30 seconds and also requires level 55, as well as some level 65 foods and projectile weapons. Bortega, a poisons/reagents vendor, sells nothing new.\nSince it came out, &lt;a href=\"Filtered%20Draenic%20Water\"&gt;Filtered Draenic Water&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced, as it would not have been around at the time\nUnselectable NPCs.\nAlso, other factionless NPC's and they, like the vendors, are members of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; faction (with the exception of Alexston Chrome, who appears to be factionless).\nQuick Travel to Caverns of Time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"portal%20room\"&gt;portal room&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; contain portals to the Caverns of Time.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;World's End Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; can teleport characters who have at least reputation status with the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; directly to the entrance of the Caverns.\nRemoved quick travel.\nIn , players could use the portal located at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or speak to &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; standing in front of it. Unlike the transport from Shattrath, there is no reputation requirement. This portal was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1.5\"&gt;patch 8.1.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring , players could teleport to &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn%27s%20Gallery\"&gt;Aegwynn's Gallery&lt;/a&gt; (bottom floor of Chamber of the Guardian, the center of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;) and descend to the bottom of the room past the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to the portals. The portals in this chamber were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0.1\"&gt;patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIn the south, amid a mountain cluster, lies this mysterious place. Bronze dragons dwell here for reasons unknown. As Brann Bronzebeard and his guides led him close to the caves, the guides refused to enter for reasons that soon became clear. They saw, to their surprise, a dwarf coming out of the entrance who look a bit like Brann. He grew closer, then he gave a wave and a smile telling them that he entered the cave an hour ago to have a look around. That's when Brann and the dwarf both realized he was him \u2014 the caves sent Brann back in time! After an interesting conversation the present Brann headed in, and when he came out he had the exact same conversation with himself again, from the opposite side. The other Brann then went in \u2014 and since the present Brann had already come out, his little party went on their way.\nRumors say that Nozdormu, the bronze dragon Aspect and Lord of time, makes his home here. When Brann went into the caves he didn't see him inside, though. He saw multicolored walls, the occasional image of a piece of unrecognizable landscape, and a small bronze dragon who ushered him out of the place.\nRelics of past ages live half-buried in the sands near the entrance to this vast cave system. The bronze drakes of the mighty dragon Nozdormu patrol the borders, making sure that no mortals enter the sacred grounds at the cavern's entrance. Those who somehow slip past the drake guardians and enter the caverns have never returned quite the same \u2014 tales describe how some appear as old men, while others are reduced to infancy by the cavern's strange energies."}

That day, I adopted the name Caydiem, and began what has been quite the journey.\nA smile appears on my face anytime anyone mentions the end of beta event. Every time I play my Druid, I'm reminded -- fondly -- that it was the Druid community, their concerns and questions, that brought me to the class in the first place. During the casual vs. hardcore debate, I was raiding on a strict schedule with one guild and playing in a casual manner on an entirely different character. The community has not only been a natural part of my work day, but an integral part of my leisure time, as well; I love this game, and with it the many people that populate the worlds in which I play.\nIt is with a heavy heart, therefore, that I bear the news that I am leaving the Community Team. I am still remaining a part of the Blizzard family, but my position will be somewhat away from the public light. I'll still be playing the game, of course, and I'm sure I'll still read the forums from time to time. You can't get rid of me that easily. ;)\nThank you all for the engaging discussion and fun throughout my time here. Best of luck in the future!"}

Both of them quarreled with her only to remain mocked. After this Cedrick persuaded Erik to attack Kerri. However, Erik was overwhelmed and &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; tossed water onto Cedrick. Erik then attacked Silas, and &lt;a href=\"Burth\"&gt;Burth&lt;/a&gt; immediately went to protect his master but Silas stopped him. The brothers left threatening the faire.\nThe next day Erik was found dead and Cedrick was sure Kerri had committed the crime. Kerri was arrested but Silas did not believe this and investigated it. Silas visited Cedrick and found him in a company with a guard that had brought evidence to &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Redpath\"&gt;Marshal Redpath&lt;/a&gt;. With the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Thaddeus%20Paleo\"&gt;Professor Thaddeus Paleo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt;, Silas realized that it was Cedrick who killed his brother and the guard helped him with the body and planted the blood on Kerri's clothing.\nThe carnies started their plan to rescue Kerri and in the meantime &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hamelspot\"&gt;Peter Hamelspot&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=\"Yebb%20Neblegear\"&gt;Yebb Neblegear&lt;/a&gt; who was looking for the only witness of the murder. Together they found the marshal and told him the truth. However, Terrence Fallrook claimed that Cedrick was with him that night. Cedrick and Terrence returned home only to reveal that Terrence believed Peter, a long time and loyal employee. Knowing the kind of man Cedrick had grown into, but still unwilling to see his remaining son hang, Terence threw him some money and banished him. Right after this, Kerri ambushed Cedrick in the Fallrook's house, knocked him out and kidnapped him. When Cedrick awoke he was tied up in Erik's coffin, alongside his victim. The last thing he saw were the faces of Silas, Kerri, and the other carnies as Kerri slammed the coffin closed. He began screaming in horror as the carnies watched Burth begin to fill Erik's grave back in."}

When your health starts to get low, pop in a health potion, and keep &lt;a href=\"Evasion\"&gt;Evasion&lt;/a&gt; until your health is near 30% because he will spawn more and more adds. When he dies, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and move to the side to heal, then finish off the adds that are left.\nSolo Strategy - Hunter.\nHe can also be soloed by a hunter and his pet. Send your pet at Celebras and burn him down quickly. If your pet is being damaged too quickly by the adds, use multi-shot to pull some of them off and use freezing trap on one of them, then pop Deterrence if you have it. So long as you use rapid fire and all of your burst damage shots, you should finish Celebras off before you're in too much trouble. After you kill him, feign death and wait for the adds to kill your pet, then despawn."}

Each celestial offers a challenge:\nChampions should choose the challenge they are best equipped to deal with.\nDuring this quest, the surroundings of all temples except the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Phasing\"&gt;phased&lt;/a&gt;, with almost all NPCs and mobs removed. As such, the Xuen and Niuzao dailies and the Temple of the Red Crane chain in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds%20storyline\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds storyline&lt;/a&gt; cannot be completed while this quest is in your quest log.\nAfter speaking with the four celestials and completing one of the challenges, find Wrathion at &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mason's Folly&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Stair\"&gt;Veiled Stair&lt;/a&gt; at overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Thunderfoot%20Fields\"&gt;Thunderfoot Fields&lt;/a&gt; far below, and not inside the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn complete:\nBlessings.\nTemple of the Jade Serpent.\nWrathion stands at outside the main gate of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Temple%20Grounds\"&gt;Jade Temple Grounds&lt;/a&gt; proper.

{"id": "375729", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=375729", "title": "Celestial Blessings/Tactics", "text": "\"This article is about the challenge fights. For information about the quest as a whole, see &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Blessings\"&gt;Celestial Blessings&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nXuen's Challenge (Melee DPS).\nAbilities.\nYou will be fighting Wrathion, who will be blindfolded. He has 31M HP, but you will deal 250% extra damage by standing behind him when attacking. He will not melee you; his attacks come entirely from his special abilities.\nStrategy.\nStay behind Wrathion when attacking him, as he will take significantly more damage when attacked from behind. When he uses Crumbling Arc, get behind it to avoid taking damage. Interrupt Blood of the Deathborn to avoid damage, or if it does go off, get out of the void zone. When he uses Reign of Fire, simply watch and move out of the shadows to avoid damage.\nAbout every minute or so, Wrathion will spawn several adds that will gain a stacking buff that causes them to move faster and deal more damage. This is what typically causes players the most trouble. If you have very good gear and can DPS the adds down, do so. Otherwise, CC and kite them as best as you can.\nEventually, Wrathion will spawn many images of himself, all casting Inferno. Use AoE to destroy the images as quickly as possible until the real Wrathion is found. This will repeat 3 times in sequence. Once this phase is finished, the fight will continue as before.\nIf the fight is going badly, you can abort it by simply running out of the arena, thereby saving you the repair bill.\nBe advised that this particular challenge is considered by many players to be extremely difficult. If you have a tank or healing spec, it is recommended that you take Niuzao's or Chi-ji's challenge, even if your tanking or healing gear isn't as good as your DPS gear.\nYu'lon's challenge (Ranged DPS).\nAbilities.\nWrathion is a level-90 elite dragonkin with nearly 20 million health and the following abilities:\nStrategy.\nTry to stay behind Wrathion at all times to take advantage of Blindside. Being behind him will also help dodge the Crumbling Arc damage. He will frequently cast Reign of Fire, dropping fireballs from the sky, or summon a pool of Blood of the Deathborn, which acts as area denial. Several pools will be up at once, and he will always cast it on the position of the player, so take that into account.\nAnnoyingly, he will summon a handful of Neltharion's Tears, level 90 elemental blobs with 500,000 health that hit hard. The longer they're up, the faster they'll move, so aoe-kite them down quickly.\nEvery two minutes, Wrathion will split much like &lt;a href=\"Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; does. Each split only has 1000 health, so quickly take as many of them out as possible, as they all are winding up Inferno and will chain cast it until the real Wrathion's found or the player is dead.\nIf the fight is going badly, you can abort it by simply running out of the arena, thereby saving you the repair bill.\nClass Specific Information.\nHunter.\nIt is recommended that hunters take the level 90 talent &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20Toss\"&gt;Glaive Toss&lt;/a&gt; for dealing with adds.\nUse your basic single-target rotation to attack Wrathion when there are no adds up, and avoid his AoE attacks. When he summons adds, use &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; to take them down, then use single-target attacks to pick off the stragglers.\nWhen Wrathion splits into multiple images, use &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; to take lots of enemies with each shot, or &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; if it's off cooldown. Be advised that he splits 3 times in succession, with a short \"normal phase\" delay between each one. Take advantage of this time to build up focus with &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Shot\"&gt;Steady Shot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Shot\"&gt;Cobra Shot&lt;/a&gt; so you will have enough for the next split.\nChi-Ji's Challenge (Healing).\nStrategy.\nMost of the time, Deathwing will just melee Wrathion while spamming easily avoided traps around the room. If you're confident in your ability to soak damage, you can try tanking him yourself (taking care to avoid his frontal cone attack), but periodically he will &lt;a href=\"fixate\"&gt;fixate&lt;/a&gt; on Wrathion, so you will \"have\" to heal Wrathion as well as yourself. Simply use the same strategy as for single-target tank healing.\nKeep in mind that Wrathion is not a party member, so abilities that work on party and raid members (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Growth\"&gt;Wild Growth&lt;/a&gt;) will not work.\nPeriodically, a pack of slimes will spawn and pursue you. AoE them down quickly (if you don't, they'll keep following you and will easily overwhelm you). Casting heals during this encounter buffs your damage, so it should not be that difficult.\nPeriodically Deathwing will disappear, Wrathion will stand in the middle, and earth elementals at four sides will start firing spines at him. During this phase, you should intercept the missiles so they hit you instead of Wrathion (they do more damage to him than you). Even weak heals should be enough to heal yourself, so use this opportunity to heal Wrathion to full before Deathwing reappears and phase 1 begins again. When Deathwing reaches zero health, the challenge is completed.\nIf the fight is going badly, you can abort it by simply running out of the arena, thereby saving you the repair bill.\nThis is possibly the easiest challenge, so if you're a hybrid class with relatively good healing gear, you may want to try it first.\nClass Specific Information.\nMonk.\nThe usual tank healing rotation, that is, &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Mist\"&gt;Soothing Mist&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Enveloping%20Mist\"&gt;Enveloping Mist&lt;/a&gt; and the occasional &lt;a href=\"Surging%20Mist\"&gt;Surging Mist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life%20Cocoon\"&gt;Life Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;, works well here. With a high enough item level it is even possible to fistweave Deathwing in melee.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Spinning%20Crane%20Kick\"&gt;Spinning Crane Kick&lt;/a&gt; to quickly kill the slimes. For extra healing, you can kite them near Wrathion, so that you can heal both him and yourself when AoEing the slimes.\nRemember to use cooldowns. &lt;a href=\"Life%20Cocoon\"&gt;Life Cocoon&lt;/a&gt; on Wrathion gives you a much-needed break to heal him to full and regenerate some mana. &lt;a href=\"Revival\"&gt;Revival&lt;/a&gt; only heals yourself here, not Wrathion, so there's little reason to use it except if you're at low health for some reason.\nNiuzao's Challenge (Tanking).\nYou will be tanking a Vision of Deathwing (Humanoid form) while Wrathion acts as Melee DPS. Deathwing has about 10M HP and melees for about 30K HP per swing, and Wrathion has about 1.5M. To win, you have to kill Deathwing without you or Wrathion dying.\nStrategy.\nStart tanking Deathwing immediately, as he will attack Wrathion otherwise. It is important that you maintain aggro on Deathwing as much as possible to minimize the damage Wrathion takes.\nWhen Deathwing casts Eyes of the Destroyer, taunt him immediately to prevent Wrathion from taking damage. When he casts Blood of the Deathborn, it is very important that you interrupt him, otherwise Wrathion will likely take a significant amount of damage from the resulting void zone. When Deathwing casts Molten Arc, simply move out of the orange stuff and get behind Deathwing.\nDeathwing will also summon adds about every minute or so. These adds need to be killed quickly, but are much easier to deal with than the ones from the DPS challenges.\nEventually, Wrathion will be moved to the middle of the arena, and 4 images of Deathwing will appear in 4 directions from Wrathion, producing a cross shape. These images will shoot orange missiles at Wrathion that hurt him very severely, but do only minor damage to you. Stand near Wrathion and intercept the missiles by moving into their paths. After this phase is complete, Deathwing will revert to the previous phase and the fight will continue as before.\nIf the fight is going badly, you can abort it by simply running out of the arena, thereby saving you the repair bill.\nMany players have found the tank challenge to be significantly easier than the DPS challenges, even with only a partial or LFR quality tanking gear set.\nClass Specific Information.\nDeath Knight.\nIt is recommended that death knights take the following talents: &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Zone\"&gt;Anti-Magic Zone&lt;/a&gt; for magic damage mitigation, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Siphon\"&gt;Death Siphon&lt;/a&gt; for extra healing and attack, and &lt;a href=\"Remorseless%20Winter\"&gt;Remorseless Winter&lt;/a&gt; for extra damage and a stun.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Shield\"&gt;Bone Shield&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate damage. Heal yourself with &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Tap\"&gt;Rune Tap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Parasite\"&gt;Blood Parasite&lt;/a&gt;. Use your defensive cooldowns, such as &lt;a href=\"Icebound%20Fortitude\"&gt;Icebound Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dancing%20Rune%20Weapon\"&gt;Dancing Rune Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Zone\"&gt;Anti-Magic Zone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Blood\"&gt;Vampiric Blood&lt;/a&gt; if your health gets dangerously low.\nWhen Neltharion's Tears spawn, use &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Boil\"&gt;Blood Boil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt; to get aggro on them, then DPS them down quickly.\nWarrior.\nIt is recommended that warriors take the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Wind\"&gt;Second Wind&lt;/a&gt; talent for healing over time, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Roar\"&gt;Dragon Roar&lt;/a&gt; to help kill the adds, and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Bolt\"&gt;Storm Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, which will stun Deathwing and interrupt his Blood of the Deathborn ability.\nYou are likely to spend a significant amount of the fight a low health, but the healing from Second Wind should keep you alive. Use &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Barrier\"&gt;Shield Barrier&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate damage, and if your health gets dangerously low, use your defensive cooldowns such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;Last Stand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Banner\"&gt;Demoralizing Banner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rallying%20Cry\"&gt;Rallying Cry&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Neltharion's Tears spawn, use &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Roar\"&gt;Dragon Roar&lt;/a&gt; to quickly take take off most of their health, the finish them with your other attacks."}

He earned the sobriquet \"Bladefist\" after he cut off his left hand to escape &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; captivity, replacing it with a deadly scythe called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Bladefist%20%28level%2070%29\"&gt;The Bladefist (level 70)&lt;/a&gt;, and becoming the Chieftain of the Shattered Hand.\nBiography.\nSlavehood.\nKargath Bladefist was raised a slave by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He was imprisoned and held beneath &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; for many years. Striving for his own freedom, he became a gladiator fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; arena. The price to earn his own freedom was to take one hundred orcish lives while fighting in the arena. Having won every battle against his opponents, Kargath marched out of Highmaul, only to discover the promise of freedom to be a lie. Kargath was thrown in a dungeon beneath the arena, and desperately severed his hand, which was bound by shackles, in frustration and rage. The other orc slaves, seeing his resolve, followed in his footsteps and did the same. They followed Kargath in his uprising against the ogres and helped him slay the emperor. Kargath showed the severed head of the emperor to his followers, and they raised their severed hands, armed with blades, cheering at him. This moment marked the birth of the Shattered Hand clan.\nBefore the Horde.\nKargath led his new clan to establish a village within the dense, swampy forests of the Spires of Arak called Bladefist Hold. Much like the rest of his clan, he took great pleasure in causing pain to others, and to himself. Based on his alternate counterpart's actions, it can be presumed that the Shattered Hand's relations with the local arakkoa were... less than peaceful.\nRise of the Horde.\nKargath was present at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg celebration&lt;/a&gt; in Nagrand. He would later become one of the original members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, albeit as a non-warlock. As part of the council, he watched over the alliance with ogres and rebellious clans.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; ordered Kargath to exterminate the high &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; in his clan's territory, the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, for their &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;superweapon&lt;/a&gt; was a threat to the Horde. Kargath's army consisted of his Shattered Hand, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt;. They stormed the forests near &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; but were not prepared for the arakkoa's weaponry. The searing beam of fire that lanced across the forests incinerated dozens of orcs where they stood. Rather than mount another direct assault, Kargath sought out allies in the cursed &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; and struck a bargain: if the arakkoa infiltrated Skyreach and destroyed the weaponry, the orcs would join the fight and slaughter the high arakkoa. Then, the Outcasts could take Skyreach.\nEnticed by the offer, the Outcasts snuck into Skyreach and waged war on the city. What they lacked in numbers they made up for with their magic and destroyed the mechanism atop the city. A blinding explosion tore through the sky and set the heavens aflame. When Kargath and his forces finally arrived, they slaughtered the high arakkoa as promised and cast their bodies from the city. However, the battle-crazed orcs also turned on the Outcasts. Kargath saw them as a threat. Knowing they were cunning and intelligent, he assumed they would one day learn to wield the same powers the high arakkoa had and he could not take that risk. But in addition, he simply enjoyed betraying the wretches. Kargath's followers did not kill every high arakkoa they came across. Some were taken prisoner and cast into the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt; based on stories the Outcasts had told them. Kargath reveled in the sight of the last of the high arakkoa writhing in agony as shadow energy &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;transformed them&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Horde's assault on the Spires of Arak destroyed high arakkoan civilization and killed nearly all of the Outcasts.\nWhen the first wave of clans went through to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Bladefist begrudgingly stayed behind in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, under the uneasy rule of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; the Shaman, who only remained in power through his numbers \u2013 and the always-looming threat of the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; returned to Draenor many years later, Bladefist immediately volunteered to send his clan through to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to gloriously slaughter the humans to avenge his fallen or captured brothers and sisters.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nHe alongside &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; were the first to hear and join Ner'zhul's plan. Once the Alliance had invaded Draenor, they established a foothold and constructed &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they raided &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, thinking that Ner'zhul resided there. However, Kargath and Dentarg had been left there to distract the Alliance while Ner'zhul attempted to open the rifts to other worlds at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria's &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s killed the sentries of the citadel and opened the gates, allowing the Alliance to storm in and butcher most of Kargath's clan. Dentarg was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in that fateful battle. Nonetheless, Kargath understood that he had been left there to die, and managed to pull a few of his forces back and escape. Hoping to intercept the Alliance and continue his service to the Horde, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to convince &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; to lend him warriors. She refused his request, as the village was one of the sick. Angered, Kargath stormed off. Realizing that he had too few soldiers to make a difference, he instead decided to abandon the struggle and reclaim Hellfire Citadel one day in the future, when he was stronger and more prepared.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIt appears that at some point Kargath became a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and replaced his other hand with a sword-like weapon, as did many of his fellow fel orcs. Kargath fulfilled his promise to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, becoming &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, overseeing &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;. Now Kargath's prisoner, Magtheridon supplied &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; blood to create stronger fel orcs. When the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; started, Kargath found his reclaimed citadel &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;under&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; again. He eventually met his demise within the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt;. His prisoner and weapon, Magtheridon, &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;was slain&lt;/a&gt; as well, ending the threat that the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; posed under Kargath.\nIn Warcraft II.\nManual.\n\"A razor-sharp scythe setting in place of his severed left hand, Kargath is always willing to engage in frenzied combat.

At the battle of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, Kargath fought with &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Dentarg, and &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance to allow the orcs to reach the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to Draenor. However at the battle's end, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the Shattered Hand, Warsong, and their leaders by leaving them awaiting new orders from their &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the Dark Portal. Kargath and his forces were left stranded on Azeroth when the portal was destroyed.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled ', he was depicted as looking much younger than in '.\nAs this was prior to later retcons in \"\", Kargath was shown as stranded on Azeroth following Ner'zhul's betrayal and the destruction of the Dark Portal in the Black Morass. He and his clan were subsequently imprisoned in an &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;.

As members of the Iron Horde, Kargath and the Shattered Hand clan wield their cruelty with abandon. They don't just dominate; they spread agony wherever they can. In order to join the clan, new members must prove their zeal by demonstrating their readiness to cause pain\u2014including their own. The unbridled depravity of the Shattered Hand makes Kargath one of the least predictable warlords, and one of the most difficult to control. If he is willing to butcher his hand in exchange for freedom, imagine what lies in store for his enemies.\nBiography.\nLords of War.\nKargath Bladefist was raised a slave by the &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He was imprisoned and held beneath &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; for many years.

Kargath showed the severed head of the emperor to his followers, and they raised their severed hands, armed with blades, cheering at him. This moment marked the birth of the Shattered Hand clan.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nNow, he leads an army of sadists simply by being the most hate-filled orc to ever attach a scythe to the stump of his severed wrist. Initiates of Kargath\u2019s clan, the Shattered Hand, emulate their chieftain\u2019s vicious body modification, but it\u2019s only the first of many opportunities for new scars, both on their own bodies and in the sculpting clay of their foes\u2019 flesh.\nAfter the was disabled, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and his group entered an arena in &lt;a href=\"Kargathar%20Proving%20Grounds\"&gt;Kargathar Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt; where he wanted to have them kill 100 of his orcs. Near the end of the battle, Khadgar froze the orcs and ran through the camp, Kargath behind them. Azerothians entered a cave and the arcimage collapsed the entrance. Later, he was seen on the same cliff with Grommash Hellscream and the other warlords as Grommash ordered the combined might of the Iron Horde army to head after the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attackers.\nKargath is next seen in &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Hold\"&gt;Bladefist Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, where he is supervising a number of Shattered Hand gladiators. After the adventurer kills his men, currently channeling the spirit of , Kargath fights them himself, having a short skirmish with them that eventually ends with him grabbing the adventurer by the throat and forcibly disconnecting them from Terokk. The adventurer is however, quickly transported back to &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Terokk\"&gt;Veil Terokk&lt;/a&gt; before the Shattered Hand chieftain can do any further harm to them.\nHe is later seen at Warlord's meeting in &lt;a href=\"Mok%27gol%20Watchpost\"&gt;Mok'gol Watchpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nKargath later appears in the stands of the Gladiator's ring in &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; alongside , witnessing adventurers fight and quickly dispose of &lt;a href=\"Vul%27gor\"&gt;Vul'gor&lt;/a&gt;. Upon Vul'gor's demise, he drops down into the arena claiming the crowd deserves a superior gladiator (whether this was at Hellscream's request, as a favor to , or simply out of his own pride is unclear). As a result, he becomes the first boss in the instance. Fighting brutally and to his last breath in the ring where he was born, Kargath is killed by adventurers, his last words calling back to the arena brawl in Tanaan Jungle (the 100th kill being, ironically, himself). His blade-fist is severed after his death, and it can be &lt;a href=\"The%20Bladefist\"&gt;looted&lt;/a&gt; from his corpse.\nSpeculation.\nUnlike most uncorrupted orcs, Kargath has a rather pale grayish skintone, similar to the skintone of the orcs. Though Kargath had no clan, he may be descendent from Blackrocks.\nAlternatively, the gray skin may have been caused by him being imprisoned in dungeon as he is said to be raised as a slave.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The raid leader should assign three DPS with good mobility and AoE capability and one healer, preferably one with strong ability to heal on the move. The stands group also requires a tank, and there are two strategies for how to assign the tank and the strategy you select depends on how your tanks will manage Impale.\nThe first approach is to simply assign a tank to the stands group, which will cause the same tank to go up to the stands every time and the tanks will swap on one stack of Impale. If your raid uses this strategy, the tank that is \"not\" going up to the stands should be the one who pulls the boss and receives the first Impale. Alternatively, your tanks can swap on two stacks of Impale, and whichever tank has two stacks will go up with the group, which will lead to an alternating tank in the stands but the rest of the stands group will remain the same each time. If using the swap-on-two strategy, it is especially important that healers focus their heals on the tank during the second Impale and the tank use a moderate cooldown while taking the damage as the damage from the second Impale is quite high.\nThe Arena.\nThere are several different strategies for where to tank Kargath, all of which are acceptable. Some raid leaders will request Kargath be tanked in the center of the pit, while others will have him tanked in a particular corner or in his initial position.\nRanged DPS and healers should spread out at least 8 yards apart to minimize splash damage from Blade Dance. As they may be fixated by Berserker Rush, they should also stand next to or behind an active Fire Pillar whenever possible to ensure that if they are targeted they can break the fixate quickly and safely. Ranged DPS and healers need also to be careful not to fall into the tiger pits, as doing so will result in instant death.\nMelee DPS should be, as usual, attacking the boss from behind. When Kargath uses Berserker Rush, melee DPS and the tank need to be sure they are not in the fixate's path as if they are they will probably die. It is important to note also that anyone in melee will be knocked back a considerable distance when Kargath uses Chain Hurl, and melee DPS and tanks should ensure that they will not be knocked back into a tiger pit or into an active Fire Pillar.\nWhen Kargath uses Chain Hurl, the assigned stands group must run to Kargath and stand in melee range of him until he throws them into the stands. All other players should stay at range until the stands group is picked up by the ability, at which point they may move back into melee range if needed. While at range, any melee DPS that are not assigned to the stands group should use whatever ranged abilities they have at their disposal without allowing themselves to get too close to the boss that they risk being thrown up.\nFinally, throughout the fight the unkilled Drunken Bileslingers will throw Mauling Brew down into the arena which will create small green void zones on the ground that all raiders should avoid standing in.\nThe Stands.\nWhen in the stands, the tank should quickly pull as many adds as they can pull safely, paying particular attention to the Drunken Bileslingers and Iron Bombers. The Iron Grunts do not do anything to the group in the arena and can be mostly ignored. All members of the stands group should avoid standing in the bombs dropped when the Irom Bombers die and the tank should focus on facing the Drunken Bileslingers away from the DPS and healer as their Vile Breath will do significant damage and also stun them.\nAfter about 45 seconds in the stands, a pair of unkillable ogres will sweep through the stands, knocking the stands group back into the arena.\nMythic.\nThe Mythic mode of the encounter is quite similar to its Normal/Heroic version, but adds a new core mechanic called Roar of the Crowd. Roar of the Crowd represents the raid's favor with the spectators of the arena and is displayed by an extra energy bar that will appear on the screen after the fight begins. At higher levels of Roar of the Crowd, the raid will do more damage to Kargath, which is essential to manage effectively in order to meet the Mythic mode's significantly higher DPS requirement.\nThe primary way to gain Roar of the Crowd is through effective control of Berserker Rush. The raid will gain Roar of the Crowd for every second of the fixate that Kargath is unable to kill the character he has targeted. It is especially helpful to employ strong damage reduction cooldowns when possible as well as immunities such as &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; to maximize the length of the fixate while still ensuring that the player does not die. It is important to do this carefully, as if the fixated player dies all Roar of the Crowd gains from that fixate will be forfeited in addition to the player dying.\nThe other important Mythic change is that the Ravenous Bloodmaws are periodically released from their cages and will fixate on a random player. If they reach that player the player will die, making it necessary to kite them until they are killed. The Ravenous Bloodmaws can be stunned by kiting them into an active Fire Pillar, but it is important to do so sparingly, as the Fire Pillars will likely still be needed to interrupt Berserker Rush when immunities and cooldowns aren't available. When a Bloodmaw is released, ranged DPS should switch to it and help the fixated player kill it quickly.\nA small amount of Roar of the Crowd is also gained while killing Iron Grunts and a small amount of Roar of the Crowd is lost when Drunken Bileslingers and Iron Bombers use their abilities, but this does not affect strategy or execution in any way.\nLoot.\nLFR (640)\nNormal, Heroic, Mythic (655, 670, 685)\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Karkut is said to watch over fallen tuskarr so they do not lose their way. The tuskarr believe that Karkut's spirit is currently walking the earth, gathering the spirits of dead tuskarr. Karkut awaits the spirits of dead tuskarr as they pass on.\nSpeculation.\nIt is speculated that the tuskarr believe that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; is Karkut, as undeath is under the Lich King's dominion in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and he is often called the \"Death God\" by the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who serve him. This would fit in with the suggestion that the death knights bear his mark and that Karkut now walks the land collecting souls. On the other hand, the tuskarr also seem to believe that Karkut looks favorably upon them, which would make little sense if they thought he was the Lich King, unless of course it is because the Lich King failed to claim their souls for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Also notable is that &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ko%27nani\"&gt;Elder Ko'nani&lt;/a&gt; refers to the Lich King as \"the Dark One\".\nPerhaps more likely is that Karkut is an entity in the Shadowlands, or perhaps simply a tuskarr personification of the power of Death, which would be the 'mark' that death knight possess."}

He did not always agree with his master but was too much of a coward to say anything. Once, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; visited Durnholde and had a dinner with Aedelas and Karramyn. The prince immediately began to dislike the prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nWhen Thrall escaped, Karramyn was informing Aedelas when someone saw his pet. When the liberation of the orcs started, Karramyn was appointed with leading the fifth internment camp. However, he was not able to fight and Thrall managed to capture him. When the battle was over, Thrall questioned him and sent him to Blackmoore. During the final siege against Durnholde, in his heart Karramyn wanted to stop Aedelas in arguing with Thrall and surrender but was not able to say or act. When Blackmoore died during &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s assault of Durnholde, Langston was automatically in charge, but because of his lack of battle experience, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sergeant&lt;/a&gt; took command.\nAfter the fall of Durnholde, he was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, at Thrall's behest since Langston was the new commander of the recently fallen &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;, to say that the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were now free and would destroy all internment camps until all their brothers and sisters were released, and that the new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would be willing to start a cooperation policy with the Alliance in exchange for land and their imprisoned brethren's freedom.\nIt is unknown what happened with him.\nRelatives.\nLangston may or may not be related to the Langston family that runs &lt;a href=\"Pig%20and%20Whistle%20Tavern\"&gt;Pig and Whistle Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The enormous drakonid Karsh Steelbender toils in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Forge\"&gt;Twilight Forge&lt;/a&gt;, shaping weapons of war out of rare &lt;a href=\"%3Aquicksilver\"&gt;:quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;. Although Karsh's works are nearly unbreakable under normal circumstances, at high temperatures they become brittle as rusted iron.\"\nStrategy.\nHolding him in the central pillar of fire (or over Lava Pools in heroic) will make him gain stacks of Superheated Quicksilver Armor. He cannot be damaged until he has this buff.\nWhen he gains a stack, he deals an amount of AoE fire damage on the party proportional to the number of stacks. Each stack also increases the damage done by his melee swing, and increases his total damage taken. Get too many stacks, and you will be doing more damage, but the healer will be overwhelmed leading to deaths.\n5-6 stacks works easily enough.\nWhen the buff expires, the circular grate over the lava explodes and is pretty much insta-death to anyone standing on it.\nHeroic Mode:\nThere are two differences between normal and heroic mode: the damage done by the AOE pulse when Karsh gains a stack of Superheated Quicksilver is much more punishing, and when Superheated Quicksilver wears off three non-elite adds spawn.\nThe room must be prepared for the fight. Kill all the Troggs that surround the area Karsh patrols. \nSuperheated Quicksilver has a 17 second duration. The key to this fight is maximizing the time that Karsh spends with the Superheated Quicksilver debuff, while minimizing the number of AOE pulses he generates at a time. This should be done by attempting to add only one stack of Superheated Quicksilver at a time. The best way to do this is to have the tank kite him tangentially to the central pillar of fire, so he only dips his toe in for a moment as he walks past it. This will ensure that Karsh only pulses the AOE once, perhaps twice, making sure that the healer is not overwhelmed with raid healing. Skilled tanks can try to time Karsh's trips through the pillar of fire to occur immediately after he takes a melee swing; as the most common reason for Karsh getting multiple stacks of Superheated Quicksilver is him pausing to take a melee swing at the tank while in the pillar. This isn't necessary though; the healer should be able to handle two AOE pulses without much trouble. If Karsh ever gets more than two stacks of Superheated Quicksilver at a time, the tank has done something wrong.\nTanks should easily be able to handle 7 or 8 stacks of Superheated Quicksilver. More than that will depend on gear. When the debuff is allowed to wear off, Karsh will become invulnerable and three adds will spawn. Additionally, the outer ring will momentarily erupt with fire. The adds are non-elite and can easily be burned down; however when they die they will leave behind a pool of lava that persists for the duration of the fight. The pool of lava has the same properties as the pillar of fire; e.g. it will cause Karsh to gain stacks of Superheated Quicksilver. Adds should be kited by DPS to the outer part of the room and burned down (this is why Troggs should be killed before engaging Karsh). This will make sure that the party has plenty of room to maneuver when dealing with Karsh himself. The tank should just hold tight and wait to kite Karsh through the pillar of fire until all three adds are down and DPS is ready to resume.\nIt is also possible to complete the entire fight without the debuff falling off of Karsh, and therefore no adds spawning. To do this, the tank should kite Karsh along the edge of the pillar of fire so that Karsh gains one stack of the Superheated Quicksilver debuff. When the debuff is about to fall off, the tank should repeat this process, refreshing the duration of the debuff and now making it two stacks. Repeat this process each time the debuff is about to expire and Karsh will never spawn the adds. Depending upon damage output, it is possible to down Karsh at 10 stacks or less. If, however, an accidental second or third stack is added while pulling Karsh through the fire, it will most likely be necessary to allow the debuff to fall off in order to reset Karsh's damage buffs.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Kaskala is home to many of the carved stone statues that house the spirits of long-gone tuskarr elders, and that alone makes the invasion of the kvaldir more difficult for them to bear.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; met tuskarr who told them that one day, they'll take Kaskala back; as while they're not a vengeful people, they believe in retribution against those who have killed their kin.\nIn the RPG.\nKaskala is the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; homeland. At least that is what they say. It is a collection of villages, none of them more than 400 people but clustered so close together they create one larger unit. Tuskarr are extremely family-focused, and each village is a single extended family, all connected by blood or marriage. You could look at Kaskala as a single city divided into family compounds, but that is not entirely accurate because each settlement runs itself. The males of each village hunt and fish while the females raise the few crops that grow in the tundra, gather berries and roots, fashion and repair clothing, and tend to the homes and the children. &lt;a href=\"Tusklord%20Hrak%27kar\"&gt;Tusklord Hrak'kar&lt;/a&gt; rules the city.\nKaskala's oldest village is at least several centuries old, and the rest grew up around it as family members split off to start their own smaller families.\nDescription.\nTuskarr houses are solidly built structures of wood and stone, with thick, thatched roofs. They are only one story and sprawl rather than rise, which makes sense given the incessant wind. Heavy shutters cover the windows and short entry halls lead from the outer door to an inner one, which keeps heat from escaping and cold from entering. Their homes are radial, with a single large chamber at the middle and the sleeping quarters arrayed around it. They have large pits in the center, lined with stone, and keep a fire blazing constantly \u2014 it heats the entire house and has spits and trays for cooking food.\nTuskarr are fishers and whalers, and they use every part of the animals they hunt. &lt;a href=\"Whale\"&gt;Whale&lt;/a&gt; bones form support beams in their homes, and heavy &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;skins and other furs cover the floors and the doorways. They create dyes from various &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; inks and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; scales, and have colorful weavings on their walls. Their inner clothing is bright as well, under their thick furs and oilskins. When a tuskarr woman accepts a man as her husband she weaves him a vest and he wears that against his skin. She replaces it once they have children, and again if he becomes the head of their extended family. She repairs it when necessary but otherwise he never takes it off. When males die they are buried in their most recent vest, and the others are wrapped together to fashion a pillow for the body.\nEach village is one extended family and handles its own affairs. The eldest male of the family is the village chief, and dictates where they fish and hunt and who handles which tasks. His wife oversees the women's activities and the children's education. The different villages trade together, swapping excess items for things they need.\nEvery tuskarr takes part in guarding Kaskala and patrolling the area for danger, but &lt;a href=\"Tusklord%20Hrak%27kar\"&gt;Tusklord Hrak'kar&lt;/a&gt; decides the schedule. He spreads the tasks evenly so no village bears the brunt of any task or has too few men to bring in food. If one village has a poor week fishing, the others pool their resources and share their food. No one in Kaskala goes hungry or unclothed unless everyone does. That doesn't mean they share equally. If one village has more success at whaling than the others but everyone brings home enough to feed their own families, that one village keeps its spoils. Yet if someone is hungry, the village with the most is the first to share. Tuskarr consider it a mark of honor to help support their people."}

Katherine became the Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras after her husband's death at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, but later abdicated in favor of her daughter after the Proudmoores reunited both their family and their homeland after many years. From the capital of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine ruled &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nDaelin wrote Katherine a letter about Derek's death during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Jaina was young, Katherine moved heaven and earth to smooth Jaina's path. She had to fight Daelin to send her to train in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as a mage.\nWhen Jaina began to date &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, their parents discussed their relationship and tacitly permitted the courtship.\nReunion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Kul Tiras, Katherine gave a speech at the statue of her husband about how he had brought the Kul Tiran fleet to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; in search of Jaina after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, only to be betrayed by his own daughter as she stood aside while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; killed Daelin. Feeling betrayed by Jaina, Katherine felt that she forgot to teach Jaina humility or loyalty to her people.\nAfterward, Katherine was approached by &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Copeland\"&gt;Admiral Copeland&lt;/a&gt;, who came with news about the renewed conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Horde. Katherine dismissed it as Kul Tiras had left the Alliance after Daelin's death so the war was none of their business, but Copeland pressed the issue that the Horde would surely attack Kul Tiras and their ties with the Alliance should be renewed. Katherine declined once more, for she did not want to appear weak by begging for help. When Copeland proposed reaching out to Jaina for aid, both Katherine and her close friend &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; shot that down as well. Kul Tiras would protect its own.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina returned to Kul Tiras to ask them to rejoin the Alliance. Instead, Katherine, urged by her close friend &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, had Jaina labeled a traitor for her role in Daelin's death and had her taken away to face judgment.\nKatherine had heard the rumors about Priscilla just like anyone, but whether out of fear or loyalty she chose to ignore them. &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance brought evidence to her to reveal the truth about Ashvane's plans to usurp the Proudmoores; exposed in front of the people, Priscilla admitted to all of it and then escaped the scene by igniting a smokescreen. Although the attacking forces from the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; were dealt with, Priscilla herself ultimately got away by jumping into the sea when she seemed cornered. Afterward, Katherine apologized for the Alliance's treatment when they first arrived in Kul Tiras and, while she made no promises for any formal accords just yet, she did wish to parley with the Alliance leaders.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; retrieved the corpse of Katherine's son &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt; from the bottom of the sea, they put him on display to anger Katherine who sent the Kul Tiran fleet to retrieve his corpse. However not only did the fleet fail to do so, but the Horde had used Derek as a distraction while Horde agents infiltrated the city to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; artifact.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; would convince Katherine to repeal Jaina's exile and Katherine would agree as she realized she had allowed Priscilla's poisonous words into her heart. However, the problem was finding out where the Ashvane Company had shipped Jaina off to when she was exiled. When it was discovered that Jaina had been handed off to the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine feared that they had killed her until Genn reminded her that the pirates had been hired to transport her, not execute her outright. Taelia, &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer would eventually discover that Jaina had been sent to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt;, an island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; where the worst criminals and traitors are sent, never to be seen again. Only the &lt;a href=\"Tidesage\"&gt;Tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s can access it safely, and so Katherine asked an adventurer to ask &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; for aid.\nPike and the adventurer would discover that Jaina had been captured by &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, king of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, and pulled into his realm of &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt;, which explained the previous mystery of 'never to be seen again'. With the help of the Drust &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer discovered a way into Thros, through &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Inath\"&gt;Gol Inath&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and sent for Katherine via &lt;a href=\"falcon\"&gt;falcon&lt;/a&gt; to meet them there. She journeyed there accompanied by four of her honor guard but were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker creatures&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;, and the guards sacrificed themselves to save her.\nKatherine and the adventurer entered Thros to save Jaina. Within Thros Jaina was haunted by memories of her past, including Arthas at Stratholme, Varian at the Battle for the Undercity, and Daelin at Theramore. But Katherine, realizing that Daelin had lost himself, convinced Jaina to forgive herself for her actions. The two returned to Boralus in time to fight it off from an attack by Ashvane and the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing the city of enemies, Katherine gave Jaina her father's pendant, which she used to call forth the legendary Kul Tiran fleet, which until then had been captured in a magical storm by the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet, led by Jaina's brother &lt;a href=\"Tandred\"&gt;Tandred&lt;/a&gt;, proceeded to surround the Irontide ships. Outnumbered, Priscilla surrendered. Afterward, Katherine stepped down and named Jaina the new &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of Kul Tiras, their family as well as their homeland at long last reunited and reconciled after many years.\nTides of Vengeance.\nSome time later, Katherine was at &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt; with her family near the memorials of Daelin and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Tandred's which he told his mother he appreciated. The family briefly discusses how Derek's was being used by the Horde to taunt them. With Tandred, Jaina, and Katherine together again, Tandred couldn't help but wonder what Daelin and Derek would think of what the Proudmoores and Kul Tiras at large had endured. The family discussion was cut short when the Horde attacked &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglepoint Wharf&lt;/a&gt;. Katherine also briefly reunited with her first and oldest child, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who settled in &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt;, but he subsequently left his family and homeland once again after deciding to depart with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Rising.\nKatherine and her daughter hosted &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, as they had come at &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;'s request should &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; discover nothing on the Zandalari coast in regards to their hunt for &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. They were soon interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, who reported that Shaw had been taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When her guest jumped to the conclusion that Sylvanas was working with the Zandalari, Katherine witnessed her daughter tell them not to add fuel on an already kindling fire and risk the treaty. She then watched Jaina's declaration that she would use the treaty itself before turning to the blade.\nQuotes.\nDialogue.\nBoralus Patch 8.1 dialogue.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; is seen speaking with &lt;a href=\"Tiran%20Blackwood\"&gt;Tiran Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Tiran Blackwood walks away.

He was eventually tricked into possessing &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, becoming imprisoned in Meryl's body, but during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; he broke free to threaten the Council once more, leading to the reforming of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nNavane.\nKathra'natir was the last dreadlord to wield the ancient nathrezim blade known as &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon passed to him during the Burning Legion's invasion of a planet known as &lt;a href=\"Navane\"&gt;Navane&lt;/a&gt;, home to a handful of intelligent races. Though they shared a history of enmity, they put aside their differences to form a tenuous alliance against the Legion. Disguised as one of their own soldiers, Kathra'natir walked among Navane's resistance forces and whispered rumors of betrayal in every ear while Apocalypse clouded the defenders' ability to reason. Old hatreds and rivalries resurfaced, and the defenders began to fear each other as much as the Legion. In one night of wanton bloodshed, Navane's army went to war with itself as Kathra'natir admired his handiwork from a distance. By sunrise, not a single soldier remained to oppose the Legion's conquest of the planet.\nWar of the Ancients.\nKathra'natir participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, but was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. His history and description was eventually recorded in the &lt;a href=\"Compendium%20of%20Terrors\"&gt;Compendium of Terrors&lt;/a&gt;, a record accessible to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends: The First Guardian.\n2,610 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Kathra'natir infiltrated the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. He spread plagues and disease, and used Apocalypse to warp the minds of the non-&lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; civilians, turning them against the magocratic rulers of the city. He stole the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Waters\"&gt;Amulet of Waters&lt;/a&gt; from the Council, and through it he was able to control and corrupt &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. He was later banished by &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and the Council of Tirisfal. When he was banished, his sword Apocalypse was left behind.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nMeryl thought he was gone, banished, too weak to trouble &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; again, but he returned when &lt;a href=\"Vendellin%20Soulfire\"&gt;Vendellin Soulfire&lt;/a&gt;, hired by &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, cast the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Mark of Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to possess her.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;'s rescue at &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, he managed to get free and get control of Valeera to fight &lt;a href=\"Cho%27Gall\"&gt;Cho'Gall&lt;/a&gt;. Later, when Meryl teleported them away, he tried to possess Med'an; but &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; offered himself in his place, taunting him about his abilities. The demon fell into the \"trap\" and possessed Meryl instead, becoming contained once again.\nSince then, the dreadlord has been inside Meryl, forced to do his bidding, and sometimes helping him with his own abilities. Eventually, Meryl thought the influence of the demon too much for his relationship with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; and he left.\nMeryl Winterstorm later went to &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to help Med'an and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle Meryl absorbed the fel energies that had tainted the &lt;a href=\"Base%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Base of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt; so that Med'an could wield the greatstaff, but the influx of power gave Kathra'natir the strength he needed the break free. His spirit immediately went after the source of Med'an's power: the council members channeling it into him from within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. He effortlessly slew the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dalynnia%20Wrathscar\"&gt;Dalynnia Wrathscar&lt;/a&gt; and drained her magic into himself, but was ultimately defeated and chained within Meryl once more. Meryl, knowing that Kathra'natir could break free again, exiled himself rather than place the council at risk again.\nLegion.\nDespite Meryl's best efforts to subdue Kathra'natir, the dreadlord managed to break free. He is one of the many demons summoned by in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to attack the forces of Azeroth in the climactic, disastrous battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Kathra'natir later attacked the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran, and with the aid of a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and the spirit of Alodi, Meryl fought Kathra'natir off, but Kathra'natir escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; before he could be killed. Meryl and Alodi gathered the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, and within the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; Meryl reformed the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;--a group of magi used by the Council of Tirisfal in the absence of a Guardian--and declared that its goal was to hunt Kathra'natir down.\nHe later possesses &lt;a href=\"Vargoth\"&gt;Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; and uses the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; along with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to drain Meryl of his power, which manifests as a sickness that puts Meryl out of commission.

For this, he is unwilling to forgive him when they are reunited in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The storyline varies depending on the player's decision during &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Direction\"&gt;A New Direction&lt;/a&gt;. If they choose Kayn as their second-in-command, Altruis will depart, and vice versa. The following describes the storyline for players who choose Kayn. For the Altruis version, see &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt;'s article.\"\nKayn sent &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; to find the demon hunter to report to him immediately at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. To find the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, he and the demon hunter went to the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; guarded by &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Alturas\"&gt;Warden Alturas&lt;/a&gt; to not permit anyone to enter the prison. By Khadgar's trust, Alturas had no choice but to let them in. He told them that the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; will not be responsible for any sacrifices taken. Kayn stood guard to let the demon hunter confront an eredar named &lt;a href=\"Taldath%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Taldath the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; to get answers of where &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; is. Eventually, the demon spilled out the information without warning and Kayn told the demon hunter to finish him off. &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; is where he and the artifact is at and got a bat ready for the demon hunter. &lt;a href=\"Lyana%20Darksorrow\"&gt;Lyana Darksorrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; were to accompany the demon hunter regardless of the outcome. Kayn warns the demon hunter that Varedis is a cunning adversary. Upon arriving at Felsoul Hold, the demons spotted the bats and Kayn told them to fly to a landing site quickly. Losing both Darksorrow and Ravencrest, the demon hunter leaped into the fray and punish them for their hubris.\nKayn sent &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; to find the demon hunter to report to him immediately at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. To find the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt;, he said that &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had something called a &lt;a href=\"Crystallized%20Soul\"&gt;Crystallized Soul&lt;/a&gt;. They will die in their master's name as will &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon returning to the prison world of &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; to make it their new home, Kayn addresses to the Illidari of the accomplishments of the demon hunter by obtaining the artifact. With the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" in their control, they can plan out every aspect of their assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nKayn was met by the adventurer and Khadgar at &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Stand\"&gt;Illidari Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Surprised and really impressed of the artifact the champion wielded, he told them to assist Allari and Jace as best they can to maintain ground against the demons there. He instructed the champion, &lt;a href=\"Cyana%20Nightglaive\"&gt;Cyana Nightglaive&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; to attack from within the legion camp ahead. Unfortunately with the betrayal of Cyana as an end result, for the Illidari cannot afford to lose even a single demon hunter in their ranks. It was right to put her down and should meet up with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that reside at their &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; as they can be prove to be a powerful ally in the war against the Burning Legion.\nKayn was the first to become the champion's cause in their campaign. After collecting essences to communicate with their master, it was time to seek out other allies. If Kayn is chosen to lead as their second-in-command, they later go on to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt; instead of continuing to talking to &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Fel Hammer\" then jumped to the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; to take out the &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; siblings. With their mission successful, he announced the demon hunter to slayer and told them that their artifact can awaking great potential when the time came.\nKayn participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Asha%20Ravensong\"&gt;Asha Ravensong&lt;/a&gt;.\nKayn and Altruis were both aboard the \"Fel Hammer\" when the Slayer obtained the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%27s%20Felbroken%20Shrieker\"&gt;Slayer's Felbroken Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWe must eliminate the Legion threat on this ridge so that you can bring the rest of our forces in from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;Name&gt;, we must take the fight to the Legion here in the volcano.

Adventurers of the Horde and Alliance entered a time pocket of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Kaz'rogal was a lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the orc base, but was killed by adventurers from the future, aided by troops of the Third War and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nKaz'rogal returns with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; to and is seen in . He is defeated by the adventurers of the Horde and Alliance.\nRaid setup and equipment.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29%23Tips%20on%20Bosses\"&gt;MH Boss Tips&lt;/a&gt; for general info, only one tank required. It may be possible for &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; player characters to melee Kaz'rogal from outside the range of his warstomp, due to their slightly larger melee range.\nAll mana users should wear some &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20resistance\"&gt;Shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear, because the Mark of Kaz'rogal and all of its effects can be resisted. The whole raid should have the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; buff from priests. Due to their low mana, protection paladins should take extra care not to hurt others when they AoE from the Mark emptying their mana pool.\nHorde NPCs.\nIf Thrall and his NPCs, particularly the tauren warriors, are all up they can do about 15% damage on their own. This can be very important near the end of the fight - there are reports of Kaz'rogal first kills with only one surviving raid member watching while the NPCs brought down the last 7% or so.\nIn order to speed things up its possible to have the MT kite Kaz'rogal through the two groups of NPCs, but it's just as feasible to wait until they enter the fight by themselves (which they usually do in any case). Kiting is detrimental to raid DPS, so it should be done only if the NPCs do more damage by their early entry than is lost due to aggro problems by the raid.\nMana management.\nMana users need to do anything they can to keep their mana up. &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Might\"&gt;Blessing of Might&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Mighty%20Restoration\"&gt;Flask of Mighty Restoration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Sporefish\"&gt;Blackened Sporefish&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Superior%20Mana%20Oil\"&gt;Superior Mana Oil&lt;/a&gt; should all be in effect. &lt;a href=\"Shadowfiend\"&gt;Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Evocation\"&gt;Evocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Mana Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shamanistic%20Rage\"&gt;Shamanistic Rage&lt;/a&gt;, etc must all be available. Mages may use &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; and Paladins may use &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; before (or immediately after) being afflicted by Kaz'rogal's Mark, thus avoiding one completely. &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; can be used early (but not too early, watch aggro) so that the high mana cost can be recovered before the first mark, or can be used late, when death is inevitable anyways. Resto Druids can shift to cat or bear forms in order to avoid death from the mark. Innervates should best be used on Shadow Priest(s). &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt; should be avoided as much as possible in order to avoid additional strain on raid healers' mana. Toward the end of the fight when the debuff is cast more often [around every 15 seconds or so], many hunters choose to leave it on Viper until Kaz'rogal dies. When a mana user runs low, it's a good idea to burn the last mana quickly, and then move to a safe spot, not to harm others.\nBattle rezzes (Soulstone, Ankh etc.) are only of limited usefulness because raid members are rezzed without buffs and less than a full mana bar, therefore they usually die again on the next Mark. Nonetheless, if used right after a Mark, a rez can mean one-half mana bar of nukes (or heals on the melee group), which can make the difference in a tight fight.\nEnrage.\nThe first Mark of Kaz'rogal is cast after 45 seconds. The time until the next Mark is cast is reduced by 5 seconds each time, so that the 2nd mark happens at 1:25, the 3rd at 2:00 and so on. In the end, it's cast every 10 seconds. This works in effect like a soft enrage, after about four minutes mana users inevitably start to die. After some time all healers are dead, the last surviving raid members are usually rogues or DPS warriors, who must stay out of melee range and hope the NPCs bring the boss down.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The reward for completing it is the &lt;a href=\"Brazie%27s%20Sunflower%20Seeds\"&gt;Singing Sunflower&lt;/a&gt; pet.\nUpon the release of \"\" came a new daily quest allowing one to continue playing the mini-game once per day.\nPlants vs. Ghouls.\n&lt;a href=\"Brazie%20the%20Botanist\"&gt;Brazie the Botanist&lt;/a&gt; is having problems with undead attacking his farm. He blames the warden at the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt; for his problems. But that's something to worry about later. For now, he needs help defending against the zombies.\nBecause we don't want zombies on the lawn.\nThis is a tutorial of the basic elements of the chain. You need to defend a single row against zombies. You need to plant a couple of Spitters to ensure the zombies don't reach the house (and eat Brazie's brains). Completing this quest unlocks the Sunflower.\nMore zombies come. You only need to defend the middle three rows, not the entire board. For this quest, you have to plant enough sunflowers to generate more Solar Power, so you can plant more spitters. During the quest, a zombie will drop Freezya seeds, letting you slow zombies down. Completing this quest unlocks the Rocknut.\nYet more zombies approach. This time, you have something that can stop them... for a while. The Rocknut. You continue to Brazie's house, and during the process find Strangler Vine seeds dropped by one of the oncoming zombies. Completing this quest unlocks the Pumpkin Bomb.\nYou now have a full suite of tools against zombies. Having successfully defended Brazie so far, Warden Stillwater sends the toughest foes yet! Abominations!\nAnd worse, you have to survive two massive waves of zombies.\n&lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; himself appears, and sends wave after wave of zombies after you. And you? You must defeat him ... with plants.\nAgainst all odds, you and your chlorophyll-laden friends defeat the monsterous Warden Stillwater!\nBrazie awards you a packet of your very own sunflower seeds, and your choice from among a couple of things that would help you with your own garden.\nRewards.\nOne of these:\nPlants vs. Ghouls tutorial.\nWhen you start each of these quests, you go into an individually phased state and point of view. You are given a &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;vehicle interface&lt;/a&gt; with which to plant seeds, and are given a progress bar to show how far you are in the quest.\nNote that if you die (presumably from dots) during the quest, you immediately exit the phased state and 'vehicle'.\nThe elements.\nThe \"field\" is a 5 x 8 grid of lawn squares. Zombies of various sorts will appear at the right side, and walk to the left. If they reach the house, you lose.\nEach row of the field has a forsaken sprayer (Fertilize-o-tron 2000) on it, providing you with a . The first time (for each row) that an undead goes past the left-most column, the sprayer will be sent out across the lawn, killing all undead on that row.\nEach square of the board can hold a single plant. If the plant gets destroyed, the space is freed, and another plant can be placed there.\nEach plant type requires a different amount of Solar Power in order to be placed on the field, which is subtracted from the amount you have currently.\nEvery now and then, a Solar Power orb will drop on the field. This appears as a glowing yellow ball. You collect these (by right-clicking on them) to gain Solar Power. Orbs that remain uncollected will disappear after a time. You may start the quest/game with some of these already on the board. If so, you should collect them to provide you with an early start.\nThe plants.\nYou gain access to more plant types as you progress through the quest chain, and even in the middle of quests. Once you gain a plant ability, you can use it thereafter.\nTactics.\nGeneral tactics.\nThe quest starts slowly, giving you time to start planting and gathering energy. While not as important on earlier quests, from &lt;a href=\"Ghouls%20Hate%20My%20Grains\"&gt;Ghouls Hate My Grains&lt;/a&gt; onwards, you will want to have up to 10 (two rows) \"sunflowers\" as early as you can. Keeping them as far to the left as you can lets you keep producing Solar Energy for as long as possible.\nYour next priority is to create some offense. A row or two of \"spitters\" will do that. You will likely have to plant some spitters to ward off wandering zombies before you finish planting all the sunflowers you want.\nYou may need to plant a \"Freezya\" or \"Rocknut\" in order to delay the undead long enough for you to get spitters (or even more sunflowers) out. Remember, though, that they buy you time. They don't put the foes down themselves, so you have to have them supported by \"spitters\" or \"strangler vines', depending on what you have available and can afford.\nSave your Pumpkin Bombs for when you can take out foes you can't stop short of the house - like when abominations show up. Be sure to let the undead you want dead advance at least one column in, so you can catch the ones following them at the same time. If you need to replant part of that row, the pumpkin bomb may give you the space to do so.\nSpecific quests.\nBasic Botany.\nIt is hard to lose this one, unless you fail to catch on about the Solar Power orbs. You only face zombies, you only have one row to defend, and you only have one plant you can use. You will eventually need more than one Spitter in the row, to ward off the \"massive wave\", but once you catch on to the basic mechanics, it is really pretty easy.\nFlower Power.\nYou have to defend 3 rows this time. The basic strategy of \"plant lots of sunflowers first\" works well. Since the outer rows are not being attacked, you can even plant your sunflowers there and not worry about them. You CAN plant just 3 sunflowers and survive, but there's no reason to limit yourself to three.\nMidway through the quest event, you should find the Freezya plant seeds. And just in time, as you will also face Ghouls. While a single spitter can take down a slow moving zombie, ghouls are both too fast and too tough for that. Add Freezyas to your defense on each row as energy and time permit.\nWhen you have spare energy, adding more spitters can't possibly hurt.\nGhouls Hate My Grains.\nYou start off with the Rocknut, in addition to all the previous plants you had available.\nStart off, again, planting as many sunflowers as you can get away with. You will face those fast moving ghouls early on, though, so your first priority for defense might be to place a rocknut to block them. Cheaper than a freezya. ... but you'll eventually have to put down spitters and freezyas anyway. The rocknut will last a fair while against a single zombie, but you'll want to get a spitter out fairly soon if it is blocking a ghoul or two.\nOnce you get Strangler Vines, you can place them pretty much at need.\nSomeone Setup the Pumpkin Bomb.\nFoes come thick and fast in this quest. Much the same strategy as for the previous quest, but you have strangler vines from the outset now. You most definitely need two columns (or the equivalent) of sunflowers to generate Solar Power as fast as you will need.\nConsider using Strangler Vines to halt Abominations long enough for your spitters to get some hits in on them. Twice as expensive as Rocknuts, but they do (often) distract the abomination long enough for you to hit it with something else. And hey, they do take out the occasional zombie or ghoul while they're waiting.\nWhile Pumpkin Bombs are expensive, they can also clear out a large chunk of the mobs in three whole rows. Take advantage of that when you can, by planting them at least one row or column in from the edges. The cooldown time on them ensures that if you pop one side as soon as you can, the other side will be pressing against your defenses by the time you get the chance to do it again.\nLawn of the Dead.\nWarden Stillwater adds three new elements to the scenario. First, your objective is to defeat him. You can beat on zombies until you are blue in the face, but until the Warden is defeated, They Just Keep Coming.\nSecond, the Warden will occasionally throw pots of scourge goo into the field. These will kill any plants that get caught in the goo. He favors throwing them way in the back, which means you will need to replant your sunflowers often. Possibly also some of your other plants as well.\nThird, he sets up Obelisks, which do for him much of what your Rocknuts do for you: Ward off hostile fire. Spitters will eventually chew through them, but Strangler Vines will pick them up and bash them about. ... and all the while the vine has them, they aren't doing the warden any good.\nThe standard strategy that you've developed over the last three quests should continue to server you well: build up sunflower power as fast as you can, set up spitters and freezyas to take down the zombies and ghouls, and put rocknuts up to give them the time to do so.\nWhen you have breaks between abomination bashings, throwing a pumpkin near Warden Stillwater, in the right-most column, will help take him down. And unlike the previous quest, you should have a few such breaks available.\nTrivia.\nTwo hidden feats of strength existed, and were accessible via macros, until they were removed entirely in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Bloom%20and%20Doom\"&gt;Bloom and Doom&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Want%20No%20Zombies%20on%20My%20Lawn\"&gt;Don't Want No Zombies on My Lawn&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their reign was incredibly harsh and brutal. Mogu taskmasters forbade their slaves to carry weapons. During these dark times, many pandaren tried to lift the spirits of their beleaguered brothers and sisters. They were the storytellers, the brewmasters, and the healers who helped knit their oppressed society together in the midst of darkness.\nAs the mogu empire began to fray, the pandaren saw an opportunity for a revolution. Because they had no weapons, they trained common people to fight with their unarmed fists and feet. They mastered the use of positive energy - or '&lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt;' - to empower themselves. These unarmed resistance fighters would become the first &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlliance.\nHumans.\nThe humans of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; have shown to have monks in their ranks since \"&lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;\". These &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monk\"&gt;Scarlet Monk&lt;/a&gt;s used their strength to battle the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and invaders alike. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Korloff\"&gt;Brother Korloff&lt;/a&gt;, apparently learned martial arts from the pandaren. \nHorde.\nOrcs.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s have been shown to use unarmed combat in a manner similar to that of the monk. On , &lt;a href=\"Forgemistress%20Flamehand\"&gt;Forgemistress Flamehand&lt;/a&gt; fought using both fire and her bare hands to defend her warlord, . &lt;a href=\"Ma%27ra%20Grimfang\"&gt;Ma'ra Grimfang&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, claiming she used her power as a monk to slay many &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; foes. Many of the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull Orcs&lt;/a&gt; also show skill in fighting unarmed or with fist weapons, though they tend to be classified as &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther races.\nOver time the pandaren have taught the ways of the monk to other &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s, and are apparently quite willing to share this powerful knowledge with their friends and allies.\nLong before the emergence of Pandaria from the mists, the pandaren of &lt;a href=\"Tian%20Monastery\"&gt;Tian Monastery&lt;/a&gt; were teaching other races including the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; the ways of the monk, and would teach anyone who wished to train, regardless of race. \nWhen the pandaren of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; made their way into &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and joined forces with their respective &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s, the monk trainers among them began to teach &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Horde members the ways of the monk. As well as residing in the factions' &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; cities, individual &lt;a href=\"monk%20trainer\"&gt;monk trainer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; to train young members of each race.\nWhen the mists parted, and the Alliance and Horde discovered Pandaria anew, the &lt;a href=\"monk%20trainer\"&gt;monk trainer&lt;/a&gt;s of the land were happy to instruct these newcomers further in their burgeoning training. \nMojo Stormstout.\nOne exception is the pandaren monk trainer &lt;a href=\"Mojo%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mojo Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. First featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", Mojo was introduced to \"World of Warcraft\" with \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\". According to lore he was wandering &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; crashed. In response to his offers of help, he was invited to begin teaching fighting skills to some of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile there were no monks among the playable or Exodar-bound draenei until \"Mists of Pandaria\", Mojo's presence would mean that the draenei would have had access to pandaren monk teachings several years before the other races, although this was never evidenced. Note that the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Monk\"&gt;Auchenai Monk&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; did not travel to Azeroth on the Exodar, and so could not have been taught by pandaren (see &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20types%20of%20monk\"&gt;Other types of monk&lt;/a&gt;, below).\nSpeculation.\nMojo's introduction seems likely to be a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;. Given the disparate timelines between the different zones by the time of \"Mists of Pandaria\", it would not be possible to have a monk trainer for draenei players without having that trainer exist on Azuremyst Isle immediately following the crash of the Exodar. Since it is necessary to provide new monks with a trainer, it was likely necessary to introduce Mojo retroactively. For more, see &lt;a href=\"Mojo%20Stormstout%23Speculation\"&gt;Mojo Stormstout#Speculation&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Monk%20trainer\"&gt;Monk trainer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pao\"&gt;Pao&lt;/a&gt; describes the blood elves as \"well-suited\" for the ways of the monk, and states that they have taken to it quickly.\nOther types of monk.\nThe term 'monk' has been used before in \"World of Warcraft\", long prior to the introduction of the playable &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; class. There is some speculation regarding the origin of &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; monks, which has never been fully explained. However, no evidence currently suggests a connection between the pandaren monks and these other types of monk. It seems likely that similar class types could have developed separately, much as &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s have been found in many races with effectively identical abilities, despite presumably separate origins."}

The idea is that the monsters will then attack the victim, who will be overwhelmed by sheer numbers and will die as a result. The term is often used as a verb (\"ex: \"I just got MPKed in the Plaguelands.\"\").\nEthics.\nMPKs are considered &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; or harassment, as they lead to at the very least a serious problem for the victim suddenly being thrust into combat when they were unprepared. More often than not, they result in the death of the character subjected to them. They are also notoriously difficult to successfully prove.\nGame Mechanics.\nNormally, when a player flees from mobs, the mobs will return to their spawn positions after a short pursuit. However, during the course of their pursuit, if the mobs see another player who is fighting their friend, instead of returning to their spawn position, they will go assist their friend. \nDue to the difficulty in predicting when mobs would give up their pursuit, MPK is normally difficult to execute for most players. However, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; can drop aggro at will with &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmeld\"&gt;Shadowmeld&lt;/a&gt;.

These huge avians are bred within the bounds of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; itself, and are often seen patrolling the skies above the city. The &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; regularly sends daring fliers to &lt;a href=\"Fires%20Over%20Skettis\"&gt;bomb the monstrous kaliri eggs&lt;/a&gt; before they can hatch, thus preventing the possibility of losing any more of their numbers to them.\nSuggestion.\nYou can avoid their attack by flying up and right or left at the same time as soon as they aggro on you, if you can do so before you're dismounted (or if you're a druid), they end up looping up next to you as you move upward and are unable to attack. \nAnother method is to fly up and straight until reaching maximum altitude, then going into a steep dive. Usually, by the time you go into the dive, you'll be at the edge of their chase range. This works because even rare flying mounts can climb faster than the kaliri.\nIn case you actually want to hunt these creatures (e.g. for the &lt;a href=\"Revenge%20is%20Tasty\"&gt;daily cooking quest&lt;/a&gt; , you will need to draw their aggro. You cannot attack them from the ground as they fly too high, and cannot attack anything while flying, so the only option is to fly close enough to one to make it attack you. It's handy to be over water while doing so, in case the attack dismounts you. When your level gets to be higher than the kaliri's the aggro radius becomes quite small, and drawing the aggro can become difficult.\nTrivia.\nThe Monstrous Kaliri are one of the most hated mobs in all of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; by players. When this beast first appeared, players got seriously frustrated by them, causing many protests of \"NERF MONSTROUS KALIRI\" or \"Get rid of Kaliri\". People still hate them to this day. This gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Kaliri%20Stew\"&gt;Kaliri Stew&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, since &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; replaced being dazed off your mount with the \"knock-back effect\" they pose a smaller threat.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Missions\"&gt;garrison mission&lt;/a&gt; known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Kaliri%20Nuisance\"&gt;The Kaliri Nuisance&lt;/a&gt;\" makes a reference to the Monstrous Kaliri. The description of the mission reads: \"A reduced kaliri population would be greatly appreciated by virtually every hero moving about the skies, for all time.\""}

Monstrous spiders come in three general types: hunters, webspinners, and spitters. Hunters and spitters rove about, while webspinners usually remain immobile and attempt to trap prey. (Hunting and spitting spiders can spin webs to use as lairs, but cannot use their webs as weapons the way webspinners can.) A monstrous spider has a poisonous bite (and poisonous spit, in the case of spitting spiders). All types of monstrous spiders often wait in their webs or in trees, then lower themselves silently on silk strands and leap onto prey passing beneath. A single strand is strong enough to support the spider and one creature of the same size. A monstrous spider can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web. A monstrous spider can detect and pinpoint any creature or object within 60 feet in contact with the ground, or within any range in contact with the spider\u2019s webs."}

Before the former Trade Prince &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; left the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe was the official &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; leader of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, a major neutral port in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-occupied territory of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he held no allegiances to either Horde or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, tending to prefer neutrality as the most profitable course of action. He would even actively defend this neutrality with force when needed. While Gazlowe holds no special love for the Alliance, he holds no hate for them either, and regards their gold as he would anyone else's. He worked as the Horde's chief engineer for a time, and he's since retained strong relations with them. This is further reinforced by one of his prized possessions being a \"liberated\" spy cloak.\nGazlowe is four feet tall with bright green skin, bloodshot yellow eyes, a prominent chin, an impressive nose, and long pointed ears. He is about forty by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, so he is about 52 in . Gazlowe's favoritism towards the Horde was shown multiple times, having been the main architect for the Horde's &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, as well as forming &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Greasemonkeys\"&gt;Gazlowe's Greasemonkeys&lt;/a&gt; to work for the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. When approached by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to lead the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe finally threw his lot in with the Horde fully, becoming the cartel's new trade prince. This led to him becoming seated on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; as the goblin representative.\nGazlowe is a rare example of a fair goblin employer: allowing &lt;a href=\"Greasemonkey%20Union%20Rep\"&gt;unions&lt;/a&gt; among his employees, willing to give them days off and full pay and convinced that a good boss has to respect his crew in order to get their own respect back. His workers are given hazard pay, but he is not willing to see good crew die. For the lost, he gives insurance to their families, with full value and no haggling. Gazlowe expects the best from his crews, so he pays them what they're worth and treats them well. In return, he has the best goblin crews on the planet, and they are not going over to any competition.\nBiography.\nThe Founding of Durotar.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe was contracted by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;'s Chief Engineer. His task was to secure a reliable source of water for the newly constructed city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Gazlowe's expedition dugs tunnels outside the city in search of underground well, where they accidentally tunneled into a den of &lt;a href=\"kobolds\"&gt;kobolds&lt;/a&gt; who immediately flooded into the caves and drove the goblin miners out. Gazlowe sent the yet-unproven &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Tunnels\"&gt;Orgrimmar Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s that would collapse the breaches into the kobold dens. When Rexxar succeeded Gazlowe rewarded him with magical items.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHaving been paid well by Thrall for his and his workers' aid in constructing the city, Gazlowe decided to establish the port town of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt;, sometime after Orgrimmar's completion. He sent one of his employees, &lt;a href=\"Rezlak\"&gt;Rezlak&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to continue helping the orcs.\nIn the past, Gazlowe helped the goblins of &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; to build a rig, and he continued to support their team further. He promised &lt;a href=\"Pozzik\"&gt;Pozzik&lt;/a&gt; a new prototype fuel regulator, but it got delayed when Baron Revilgaz had troubles with retrieving its blueprints.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, they settled on the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;Merchant Coast&lt;/a&gt; from where they were causing problems to the goblins of Ratchet. Consequently, Gazlowe sent adventurers of both factions to deal with the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s and retrieve his stolen goods.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; sent a bottle of &lt;a href=\"99-Year-Old%20Port\"&gt;99-Year-Old Port&lt;/a&gt; to Gazlowe as a gift, but it was nabbed by the menace &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Magglish\"&gt;Mad Magglish&lt;/a&gt; after a crane accident in Ratchet. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent by &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Operator%20Bigglefuzz\"&gt;Crane Operator Bigglefuzz&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it, and who later brought it to Gazlowe.\nFunding reconstruction and revolution.\nFollowing the devastation in Orgrimmar caused by rogue &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, Gazlowe was approached by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild the city; even after lowering the price, it was still a tremendous amount, but nonetheless Thrall agreed to pay it to rebuild his shattered capital. Shortly afterward, the former Warchief departed for &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in the Orgrimmar arena, and the insurrection of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; that followed, Gazlowe was approached by the shaman &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, a Grimtotem defector who sided with Cairne's son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;. Baine's plan called for massive amounts of explosives and other weapons, the technical and martial skill of mercenaries, and three &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s to transport troops into &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Stormsong gave Gazlowe an enormous sum, borrowed from the coffers of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;: one large payment, and an extra, smaller payment to make it a rush job. Atypically for a goblin, Gazlowe (albeit a little reluctantly) only accepted a fistful of the extra gold as a gesture of respect to Cairne and his son and provided the armaments requested in four days.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe provided a vessel, \"&lt;a href=\"Draka%27s%20Fury\"&gt;Draka's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\", for Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;'s voyage to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, complete with provisions.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it was apparent that Gazlowe wanted to remain neutral in the factions' conflict. However, he could not bear to be robbed of profit, and when he felt that &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral%20Hartley\"&gt;Rear Admiral Hartley&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; wanted to prevent the Horde from trading at the port of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe was severely irritated by this action, and proceeded to secretly enlist the aid of Horde adventurers to destroy &lt;a href=\"Bellipotent\"&gt;|Hartley's ship&lt;/a&gt; and cargo.\nHe promised &lt;a href=\"Wharfmaster%20Dizzywig\"&gt;Wharfmaster Dizzywig&lt;/a&gt; a promotion if he were to deal with the pirates on &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt;. He also sent the adventurers to the captured &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Longshore\"&gt;Baron Longshore&lt;/a&gt; to find his stolen supplies.\nTraveler.\nAfter the Cataclysm, he performed several salvage operations in the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Deep\"&gt;Shimmering Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAs Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition reached &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, the archmage opened a portal and brought in personnel and supplies to construct a &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;. Gazlowe served as chief architect because of his history in helping construct &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Gazlowe, his personals, Lady Sena, Skaggit, and peons immediately began working on the garrison in Frostwall. During early developments, he worked with the commander giving him tasks to prepare the land for construction and continued to work with him when expanding the garrison. The adventurer could learn &lt;a href=\"blueprint\"&gt;blueprints&lt;/a&gt; and construct buildings at his table. Gazlowe seemed to be taking great pride in his work to the point of vanity. He also provided plans for constructing outposts across .\nUpon establishing a building in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Vol'jin's Pride&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe showed up to hurry his workers up.\nGazlowe accompanied the commander and the Frostwolf leaders, and in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, their machinery and supplies. He also managed to get and function a robot that was used against the enemy force stationed in . He then accompanied the Horde to the entrance of to meet Khadgar. When the counter-attack started, he and &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; found an Iron Star, functioned it and the commander used it to eliminate the numbers of orcs.\nSome time later, the Iron Horde renewed their machinery near &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt; and Gazlowe agreed to investigate... for a sum. With the help of the adventurer, he deactivated the enemy drill but was eager to find out about who was responsible for the machinery and what else they've got in the mountains. They entered the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Siegeworks\"&gt;Iron Siegeworks&lt;/a&gt; and started eliminating the enemies and examining the gadgets. He eventually found out that the mastermind behind the armory was captured dwarf Thaelin Darkanvil with whom he has a friendly rivalry. They found and freed the dwarf and killed a leading orc on whom the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had set a bounty, thus he gained an extra profit. Afterward, he returned to Frostwall.\nHe is ultimately seen with the Horde leaders near the Gates of Tanaan after Warlord &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka&lt;/a&gt; was killed, as Warchief Grommash challenged them to enter Tanaan.\nAfter took over the Iron Horde, Gazlowe sent a team of goblins with the Frostwolf orcs and the Horde to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt;. He later provided Durotan a siege machine that destroyed the Tanaan Gate.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Burning Legion's invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe defended Ratchet in his &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Shredder\"&gt;own custom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe led a Horde band known as &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Greasemonkeys\"&gt;Gazlowe's Greasemonkeys&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s. The team comprised himself and his assistants from &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sena\"&gt;Lady Sena&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skaggit\"&gt;Skaggit&lt;/a&gt;. The group could also be found idling in the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter hearing rumors that &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; was alive, &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; would hire Horde adventurers to hunt him down and ensure he was dead. Unbeknownst to Gallywix, Gazlowe would give them a higher offer to ensure that Grizzek stayed alive. Thus, the adventurer started in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; by repairing &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt;, following the mechanized parrot, and finding Grizzek with &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Saffy and Grizzek promised to give Feathers to the hero in exchange for telling everyone that they had died. With that, the couple drove off on Grizzek's bike. While Gallywix was convinced, Gazlowe saw through the adventurer's lie and was happy that Grizzek still lived.\nMechagon.\nGazlowe later caught wind of &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; leading an Alliance operation to the now opened vault within the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Junkheap\"&gt;Abandoned Junkheap&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. While he dismissed Overspark's belief that the vault had a connection with &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; as a fairy tale, Gazlowe was very interested in acquiring any tech within the vault. To that end, he rallied a team together and secured the vault. Seeing the machinery was broken, Gazlowe quickly got it back up and running, triggering a projection of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; who then attempted to purge the goblins from the vault. Though unable to save all of the crew, Gazlowe's quick thinking in using a captured gnome saved the rest from King Mechagon. Surprised by Mechagon's actual existence, he quickly voiced desires to obtain the King's tech. Gazlowe immediately directed the expedition to Mechagon, as he didn't want to lose another good crew on his watch.\nWith his crew established and having no misconception about how King Mechagon would greet them, Gazlowe had the group quietly arrive to the island on a submarine. After the group arrived in Mechagon, he told &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; not to be fooled by the grass on the island. He pointed out that bots on the shoreline and the constant buzz of machinery and smog in the air revealed that Mechagon is a technological gold mine.\nAcknowledging that King Mechagon's cruelty ensured he would have enemies, Gazlowe and the Speaker headed off to find allies and subsequently allied with the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt;, King Mechagon's own son. At the Prince's request, Gazlowe fought against the King's forces side by side with Tinkmaster Overspark and later joined with the Prince in &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt;. As a show of unity, Gazlowe vowed to keep his nose clean, while he discretely asked for Horde adventures to collect unfinished prototypes before the Alliance could get their hands on them.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;'s termination, Gazlowe remarked that the partnership with Overspark wasn't half bad and that it reminded him of how profitable working with the Alliance can be.\nGazlowe joined &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolution against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked with Tinkmaster Overspark in creating a machine to clear the tunnel path from &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Gazlowe attended Saurfang's funeral. He admitted that he was going to miss Saurfang, and he vowed that he wouldn't let the job he started go unfinished.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20Ralinza\"&gt;Auctioneer Ralinza&lt;/a&gt; refused to allow a &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Former Banshee Loyalist&lt;/a&gt; to use the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe stepped in and reminded Ralinza that the Horde needed to unite if it wanted to survive and that Sylvanas had conned a lot of folks into following her.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nGazlowe was among those to attend the private auction for the &lt;a href=\"X-52%20Personnel%20Armor\"&gt;X-52 Personnel Armor&lt;/a&gt;. After Gallywix takes &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Grapplehammer\"&gt;Hobart Grapplehammer&lt;/a&gt; hostage to get the armor for himself, Gazlowe joins the battle against Gallywix. After Hobart is freed and Gallywix beaten, the armor falls into the possession of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gallywix's old rival&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created. In light of Gallywix fleeing &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of Sylvanas's inner circle, Thrall turned to Gazlowe to take over as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. Remarking that \"under new management\" was just another way of saying that \"opportunity's knockin\", Gazlowe agreed to Thrall's request, thus becoming the Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel and their representative on the council. In the face of Thrall's concerns that Gallywix could still be funding members of the Cartel, Gazlowe simply promised to pay them more than the cheapskate.\nWith his ascension to Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel, Gazlowe couldn't help but comment that the Horde itself was about to go through a \"management restructuring.\" Though the goblin promised that there wouldn't be any complaints from him as long as the checks didn't bounce.\nShadows Rising.\nWhen a Horde Council meeting was derailed by a failed assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, Gazlowe and the rest of the Horde leaders were forced into action. They empowered the young &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. After Zekhan sent word that another assassination attempt was made by a war party, Gazlowe provided &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; that the troll used to bring him to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. Gazlowe felt that Thrall should just tell the humans to stay off their lands and stated that if they wanted &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; freed by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; then the Alliance should give the Horde something first. After his fellow council numbers voiced support for a meeting, Gazlowe decided to vote in favor hoping that it could lead to the capture of Sylvanas. His hope being that if Sylvanas was captured, then they could focus on Horde problems. Thus, a unanimous vote was reached for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde rallied to aid the Zandalari against the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe gave Thrall goblin seeker bots and joined &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; to sail to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to prevent any possibility of retreat by sea.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to send &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and Zekhan to look over the Horde holdings within &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde. Consequently, Monte wrote them a letter as a pass for any goblin they might encounter on their journey, on which he indicated that he \"owns\" whoever read it, their Steamwheedle boss, their Bilgewater cronies, and their shoes, and that the duo can therefore go where they want just like him on his property.\nHe then wrote a letter to &lt;a href=\"Krendle%20Bigpockets\"&gt;Krendle Bigpockets&lt;/a&gt; and had Zekhan deliver it, as part of his search for lost funds from the era of &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;. He also warned them to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe was among the Horde leaders to convene with the leaders of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. While desiring to rescue his friends, Gazlowe knew that he couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission. In light of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s hostility when &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; encouraged the Alliance to do the same, he prepared himself for battle but stood down when Bolvar called for it. He then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and watched as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even Tyrande Whisperwind enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas. Gazlowe subsequently departed from Icecrown.\nQuests.\nSince \"Cataclysm\", he gives all-new quests, unique to either faction:\nQuotes.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nGossip.\nWe're ready for construction!

Through adventuring, he gradually managed to make enough money to begin legitimate business, and proved to excel at it.\nNow, at the age of 40, Gazlowe resides in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; as the manager of the port's trading operations. He runs one of the largest and most successful port towns in Kalimdor \u2014 if not the entire globe. While Gazlowe's city operates under the watchful eyes of the trade princes, he has considerable free reign, and proves effective because of it. A well-respected member of the goblin community, he also has a good heart, and is willing to help someone for little in return on occasion \u2014 but he wouldn't mind payback later, of course. He ships and receives to and from &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;. This goblin's smile looks almost friendly, but for his sharp teeth.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Gazlowe was a pilot and &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; who built his own &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and flew it in over ten missions. The young &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; helped him foil the \"ground-breaking\" engineering plans of a group of nearby &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt;s that Gazlowe wanted to stop. In thanks, Gazlowe helped him travel around the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; in his zeppelin.\nThe machinery of this zeppelin contained a &lt;a href=\"%3Asamophlange\"&gt;:samophlange&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nGazlowe appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

Various cultures may have different names for them, but usually they play on a mother-and-child theme, as the white moon is much larger than the blue one. Once every four hundred and thirty years, the two moons come into perfect alignment in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth moons are invoked in the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Sailors%27%20Memorial\"&gt;Lost Sailors' Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a prayer to the White Lady for protection at sea and to the Blue Child for comfort to the writer's family should they die.\nThe White Lady.\nThe larger, bright and silver moon is known as the White Lady or the Mother. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; know and worship it as &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; refer to it as &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, the left eye of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. One Azerothian legend titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Embrace\"&gt;The Embrace&lt;/a&gt;\" claims that the White Lady has existed since the dawn of time and is responsible for watching over Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;slumbering world-soul&lt;/a&gt; and her inhabitants during the night, while the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; holds the same duty during the day. According to the story, the Lady sleeps during the day, and she walks into the sky each night and back to her rest each morning on bridges created by the magic of twilight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; dies in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the White Lady eclipses the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; briefly to seemingly take Ysera's soul. Later, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; invokes the power of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the White Lady permanently turning from a full moon to shadowed (as in a new moon) within &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; but similar to the solar eclipse in Val'sharah.\nThe Blue Child.\nThe smaller, blue-green moon is known as the Blue Child or the Child. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; refer to it as &lt;a href=\"Lo%27sho\"&gt;Lo'sho&lt;/a&gt; and believe that they were born from one of the Earth Mother's tears to be raised by Mu'sha and &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, while \"The Embrace\" claims that it is the daughter of the White Lady and that she was born out of the Lady's love for Azeroth and her people. According to the latter story, the Child is curious and adventurous, much like Azeroth's inhabitants, and sometimes leaves Azeroth to explore other worlds in the universe. However, she always returns to her mother's side, causing what mortals call the Embrace.\nWith the addition of weather effects to the game in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.10.0\"&gt;patch 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt;, the Blue Child vanished from the game, likely due to graphical errors. Though it was missing from the game, it still existed in the lore as seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Twilight of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonwrath%2C%20Tarecgosa%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest&lt;/a&gt; quest chain. It returned to the skies in-game with the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, prior to '.\nRed moon.\nAccording to \"The Embrace\", the White Lady turns a dark crimson color when she is angry. The two &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; have repeatedly been associated with a red moon. The White Lady is not visible at Bwonsamdi's &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, where it is instead replaced by a permanent red moon. Likewise for much of the game's history, Hakkar has been associated with a red moon as well in art. Notably, during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi summons the red moon before resurrecting countless &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; warriors and various beasts to defend the city. There is also &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmoon Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; both summons &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and turns some into &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDraenor and Outland.\n as seen in \"\"'s alternate timeline has two moons. &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the main timeline's shattered version of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; has the same two moons, with the other celestial bodies visible in the sky likely being far away worlds.\nOnce every five hundred and forty-seven years, a celestial event involved three of Draenor's &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt;s alongside one of its moons. An occurrence of such event happened during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, leading to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; gathering enough energy to cast his &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;Spell of Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; and accidentally tear the planet apart.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Rock\"&gt;Lunar Rock&lt;/a&gt; fell into , able to be used for a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pale Lady.\nThe Pale Lady is one of the moons orbiting around the shattered &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and the unshattered in the alternate timeline. The Shadowmoon clan have always derived their magic from the earth and moon.\nThe orcs used to refer to the Pale Lady in a respectful way, as to a feminine entity of some importance, thus recalling their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic heritage (significant since the storyteller is supposed to be the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;).\nSmaller moon.\nDraenor also has a second, smaller moon. It appears closer to the planet than the Pale Lady, but is far darker.\nOther celestial bodies.\nBoth the sun and moon are recurring motifs in both &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; cultures.\nThere is a reference to a certain \"bloodmoon\" in the first ', when &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; tells about the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"As the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s began their incantations to access the power of the rift, a howl began - low at first, then rising in pitch like a darkwolf baying during the bloodmoon\")\nIt likely refers to the red color a fullmoon can take, but it is unclear whether the moon she refers to is the Pale Lady of Draenor, or the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, or another one of the celestial bodies that appeared over Outland after it entered the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; - perhaps just the \"rosy sphere\" mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\". Other spheres now exist as well, including a \"rosy one\", and a smaller, \"light blue one\". These may, however, be other planets, seen through \"windows\". There is also the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Moon\"&gt;Blood Moon&lt;/a&gt;, tied to &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; used by the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; in both its main and &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; versions, which can be summoned to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The Pale Lady is not visible when near the summoning platform in &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27Gol\"&gt;Zeth'Gol&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther moons.\nThe destroyed planet that was named &lt;a href=\"Fanlin%27Deskor\"&gt;Fanlin'Deskor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; had four unnamed moons.\n&lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, had dozens of miniature moons.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The order was established long before even the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and its members included talented spell-casters who dedicated themselves to upholding the peace and security of the Kaldorei nation. Owing allegiance to no noble or lord, save for &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself, the Moon Guard played an active role in the War of the Ancients, operating from the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Night elves born with golden eyes were recruited into the Moon Guard.\nIn more recent times, during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Moon Guard has once more become active and was involved in a brutal conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving members seek to restore the organization.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nIn ancient times, the rise of magic in night elf society brought with it a variety of new abilities and concerns. Given the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed obvious that combat skill alone would not suffice to counteract magical attack. Only a few scattered soldiers were found to possess magical skills, and such abilities were minor at best.\nThus, a number of magic-based fighting organizations sprang up, each of them meant to defend a critical population center. Spellcasters of sufficient strength and ambition sought out the capital city of the night elf civilization, hoping to earn favor with some heroic deed. Eventually this particular group gained the monarchy's official sanction, and they were named the Moon Guard. Loyal only to the ruler of the night elves, the Moon Guard soon regarded other spellcasters with disdain and expected them by default to possess inferior magical ability. \nWar of the Ancients.\nNevertheless, they believed that Lord Counsellor &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; was the influence behind the Highborne's envy and not &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 whom they worshipped. Before the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Moon Guard served Queen &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, but when the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; came, it joined the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; along with the noble class against the Highborne. The Kaldorei Resistance, including the Moon Guard, were commanded by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. After the assassination of Lord Ravencrest, Lord &lt;a href=\"Stareye\"&gt;Stareye&lt;/a&gt; took up the leadership of the resistance until he too was killed by the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;. The Kaldorei Resistance, however, regrouped under the famous &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and became victorious against the demons.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was once the personal sorcerer of Ravencrest, and later led the sorcerers of the Moon Guard when they fought against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After Illidan's supposed defection, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; took over. Despite being a foreigner, the Moon Guard treated him with respect for his power and leadership. When the Well of Eternity imploded, the Moon Guard lost the greatest part of its power. In addition, the war and its catastrophic consequences led to widespread condemnation of arcane magic. Thus, the organization was disbanded, and its surviving members renounced the sorcery that had once been their primary purpose.\nDissolved.\nSome of them turned instead to &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism, seeking to redress the imbalance their magic had caused. These former sorcerers consequently became some of the first students of Malfurion Stormrage. As a result, the druidic arts were long viewed as a man's purview. After the Great Sundering, the night elves dissolved all organizations that made use of such magic, including the Moon Guard.\nLegion.\nDespite being dissolved in mainstream night elf society, some of the Moon Guard remains active on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard%20Stronghold\"&gt;Moon Guard Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; near the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. However, they have come under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;. They were slaughtered hours after the shield over Suramar fell. The betrayal was not instantaneous, and books were lent to old friends. The &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s who make it their home continue to defend it, unable to accept that the Moon Guard is no more. The final three survivors of the Moon Guard - &lt;a href=\"Thalrenus%20Rivertree\"&gt;Thalrenus Rivertree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrana%20Starweaver\"&gt;Syrana Starweaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lothrius%20Mooncaller\"&gt;Lothrius Mooncaller&lt;/a&gt; - travel to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebellion based there.\nInsurrection.\nLothrius Mooncaller joins the united nightborne, night elf, blood elf, and high elf army, wanting to pay the Nightborne of the city back tenfold for what they did to the stronghold. He is notably a part of the Nightborne camp, separate from the night elves from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the downfall of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining survivors believe it will be possible to revive the Moon Guard.\nIt's unknown what became of the Moon Guard after the nightborne joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nTradition dictated that only night elf men be permitted into the Moon Guard's ranks. Moreover, sorcerers who sought to join the Moon Guard were required to demonstrate considerable talent in wielding arcane magic.\nIn the RPG.\nMoonguard crafted &lt;a href=\"Frostfathom\"&gt;Frostfathom&lt;/a&gt;."}

After being razed by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, then rebuilt following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the rampant &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdom brought the town under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Without the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; to protect them, the Defias drove out the citizens and used the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters. After years of tyranny, the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;People's militia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s liberated Moonbrook after they killed the Brotherhood's leader, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; caused a financial crisis in the kingdom, and a high population of homeless came to settle in Moonbrook. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; made a resurgence and its leader &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; encouraged the anti-Stormwind sentiment among the people of Moonbrook. After the attack on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance heroes entered once again the Deadmines, where they wiped out all the new Defias leadership. In the following years, the town was once more supported by Stormwind, which protected it from &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw pack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;demonic invasions&lt;/a&gt;. After his coronation, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms and aid to Westfall extinguished the spark of the revolution in the town.\nAlthough the town itself is devoid of vendors, the nearby camp of the Westfall Brigade to the northwest has a flight path and vendors.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; that found prosperity through the farmsteads which dotted the surrounding fertile region. Over the years, as its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably Moonbrook in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, which became the breadbasket of the kingdom. Prior to the coming of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;' gold deposits beneath Moonbrook accounted for a third of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s treasure reserves.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Moonbrook and its sister town &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; were the final two towns to fall to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; prior to the razing of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, these attacks were intended to sever the lifeline between &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn I&lt;/a&gt; and his people, making him a figurehead waiting to be lopped off. Following the victory of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the town was rebuilt with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Supreme Commander Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw the efforts to repatriate the kingdom's citizens\nPrior to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; decided to live in Moonbrook after he finished his journey outside of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. After a few days, he found myself tutoring the local children from the nearby farmlands, and the lessons went so well that the mayor at the time commissioned him to run the newly built &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook%20Schoolhouse\"&gt;Moonbrook Schoolhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Defias.\nBecause of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s political machinations in the kingdom, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; ordered the guild &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; disbanded, and it turned into a heated dispute, which resulted in riots that led to the murder of &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, knowing Varian's anger would never fade, were forced to hide in the rural areas of Westfall to escape prosecution. From the shadows, Lady Prestor used her influence to stoke their rage by cutting off supplies and support to the region. In time, they became the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, and under &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, they turned to &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;ry and murder.\nDue to the lack of military protection in Westfall, the Defias made Westfall their new refuge and sowed anarchy and terror, easily taking control of the poorly defended farmlands. As they needed a secure location to oversee the construction of a massive &lt;a href=\"Juggernaught\"&gt;Juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;, their weapon to destroy &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; from the sea, Edwin VanCleef chose the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; as his base of operations, the abandoned mining network hidden beneath Moonbrook.\nFollowing the rise of the Brotherhood, &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; was forced to abandon his post as headmaster of the town's schoolhouse and took up temporary residence in the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; of Goldshire.\nJourney of Brann.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; traveled south from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; to survey the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When he came to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, he was surprised at finding only abandoned farms and countless acres of abandoned cropland. Later, he arrived at Moonbrook and felt he was being watched by figures in the shadows. He was then attacked by three agents of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"harvest%20golem\"&gt;harvest golem&lt;/a&gt;. Once he defeated them, he decided to leave the town, hoping to one day return to find how and why these thieves scared away the farmers of the region.\nBloodsail Buccaneer.\nAt some point, the town was invaded by &lt;a href=\"Jerias%20Bloodvein\"&gt;Jerias Bloodvein&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; crew. The &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; captain hoped to enact vengeance on &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, as the latter had once taken from him the wife he desired, his gold, and his life by a good measure. However, while many Defias were massacred in the town and the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, Jerias was killed by &lt;a href=\"James%20Blackridge\"&gt;James Blackridge&lt;/a&gt; before he could confront VanCleef, and the pirates left Moonbrook after the loss of their leader.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Miners%27%20League\"&gt;Miners' League&lt;/a&gt; was partly in charge of the Deadmines under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Thistlenettle\"&gt;Foreman Thistlenettle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wilder%20Thistlenettle\"&gt;Wilder Thistlenettle&lt;/a&gt;. However, one day the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; attacked them during their work and the mine tunnel collapsed. Only Wilder managed to escape, while the rest of the company died and began to roam as restless &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaced with the oppression of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, only the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; rose up to stand in their way. In their efforts to defend the people of Westfall, their leader &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; recruited the young heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and sent them to eliminate large numbers of Defias spotted by his scouts across the region, notably in Moonbrook. Once they found that the leaders of the Brotherhood were hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; beneath Moonbrook, Stoutmantle called upon the heroes of the Alliance to destroy the Brotherhood and &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; at their head. With support from Stoutmantle's soldiers, the heroes succeeded and Westfall was safe once again.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Knight\"&gt;the Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; claimed to be descended from the &lt;a href=\"Cooper\"&gt;Cooper&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent family from Moonbrook who manufactured barrels and lived in a residence in the western part of the town. Doubting the veracity of this story, &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Rhydalla\"&gt;Crusader Rhydalla&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the residence, where they discovered that it was only a false cover for the infiltered agent of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many people living in Westfall became homeless and bankrupt. Moonbrook was then inhabited by passing passengers, homeless citizens, and vagrants, most of whom became hostile to the armies of the kingdom, holding the &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; responsible for their misfortune. While many wandered aimlessly in the town, the rest of the homeless took shelter in the Deadmines. Consequently, a small outpost of the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; has been established at the edge of the town, where &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alpert\"&gt;Captain Alpert&lt;/a&gt; and a company of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; troopers were sent by &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; to monitor and protect Moonbrook.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; made a resurgence, primarily due to growing resentment of Stormwind's leadership among the people of Westfall. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; took the leadership of the Brotherhood and had been encouraging the anti-Stormwind sentiment among the people of Moonbrook, recruiting new allies to help them get revenge. From their outpost, the Westfall Brigade noticed a rise in violent acts amongst the homeless of the area, and that a group of thugs came handing out propaganda pamphlets. The citizens later gathered for a meeting in the town, where Vanessa denounced the kingdom's leadership for the toll the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; had taken on the people of Westfall, and then incited the masses to rebel against Stormwind.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground by the Brotherhood, a force of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; entered once again Moonbrook and the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, where they wiped out all the new Defias leadership. Eventually, they confronted Vanessa, and faced with defeat, she detonated a series of explosions that essentially blew up her and the ship, ending her plans and the activities of the Brotherhood in Westfall.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted Westfall as one of their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt;, and the area fell under the demons' control, while some &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; enslaved its inhabitants. The town was successfully defended by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor his street magic shows in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;The Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt; usually ordered crates of &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s from Moonbrook. However, his last order led a &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; to enter his &lt;a href=\"Akazamzarak%27s%20Hat\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt;, thus he announced that he no longer wanted to order from the town.\nDragonflight.\nIn the years that followed the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the death of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; made it hard to carry on old grudges, while &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms allowed more aid and resources to arrive at Westfall, which caused the spark of revolution to fade.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; discovered that her father took the amulet to Moonbrook, where he had been off \"doing business\". When they arrived, the town was deserted, except for a few &lt;a href=\"Clessington%20Attendant\"&gt;attendants&lt;/a&gt; sent by Count Clessington to get rid of those who would get in his way. At Cecilia's request, the adventurer eliminated them in order to liberate the town.\nWorried about not finding her people, Vanessa and the hero went to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;. There, they found Count Clessington using the artifact's powers of manipulation, and the help of a cruel bandit named &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt;, to convince the Defias to march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of using it as a staging ground to pillage &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. Seeing how easily a noble turned the Brotherhood against her made Vanessa realize that she was no longer one of them.\nOutside the mines, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Rebel\"&gt;remaining Defias&lt;/a&gt; loyal to Vanessa came to see her, refusing to follow Ratsbon down the path of banditry for banditry's sake, as they didn't join the Brotherhood to steal from innocents. However, Vanessa asked them to return home to their families, as this fight was no longer theirs, and that they should help the people of Westfall in other ways. Accepting her last request, they returned to Moonbrook after thanking her for all she had done.\nPhasing.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Dawning%20of%20a%20New%20Day\"&gt;The Dawning of a New Day&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Heritage\"&gt;Lion's Heritage&lt;/a&gt; questline, the area of Moonbrook is phased."}

The specialization also grants access to specific tailoring recipes. Of the three cloth wearing classes (priest, mage, and warlock) specialization is geared more towards priests as it makes items with spirit and set bonuses to help healing.\nBecoming a Mooncloth Tailor.\nTo specialize in Mooncloth Tailoring, a tailor must complete &lt;a href=\"Becoming%20a%20Mooncloth%20Tailor\"&gt;Becoming a Mooncloth Tailor&lt;/a&gt;, given by in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain this quest you need to have 350 proficency in Tailoring. While you can learn 350 Tailoring as early as level 50, the quest requires at least level 60.\nTo complete the quest, travel to the &lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt; located at Cenarion Refuge in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; and use the provided quest item, then travel back to Shattrath City to complete the quest. \nEarlier entries stating that this quest can be completed at any &lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt; are incorrect. The Sample piece of cloth clearly states in the item tool tip to go to Zangarmarsh. Any attempt to craft the sample at another &lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt; will result in an error message. \nYou don't need any mats to complete the quest, and it won't start the cooldown on Primal Mooncloth crafting. Immediately after completing the quest you may travel back to the moonwell to craft your first two pieces of Primal Mooncloth.\nChanging Specialization.\nSince patch &lt;a href=\"2.1.0\"&gt;2.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, you may now re-specialize. It will cost to unlearn the current specialization.\nCrafting Primal Mooncloth.\nCrafting Primal Mooncloth is not exclusive to Mooncloth tailors, but the specialization will always produce 2 pieces of Primal Mooncloth with the mats for a single one.\nThe materials are:\nA tailor must be in any Moonwell area to craft Primal Mooncloth. \nThe cooldown on the crafting used to be 96 hours (4 days), and wasn't shared with the cooldowns on the other types of specialized cloth, namely &lt;a href=\"Spellcloth\"&gt;Spellcloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowcloth\"&gt;Shadowcloth&lt;/a&gt;. This cooldown has been removed.\nExclusive Patterns.\nMooncloth Tailoring gives exclusive access to the following patterns:\nThese patterns require the specialization to be obtained, and the items are Bind on Pickup, meaning only Mooncloth Tailors could ever have the crafted items.\nThe Primal Mooncloth Set is arguably the best Holy &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; equipment attainable before the 25-man raid instances. It nicely complements the Whitemend Set ( &amp; ), because it uses different equipment slots.\nMaterial cost to construct set.\nTo make the complete set you'll need:"}

Here, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; coexist peacefully, united by their reverence for the spirit of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;. Conflict between the races in Moonglade is not tolerated by the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade%20Warden\"&gt;Moonglade Warden&lt;/a&gt;s stationed throughout the main town of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt;, who will respond to any violence initiated against individuals with a favorable reputation with the Circle.\nMoonglade's reflection within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; is the most sacred place in the entire realm. The &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt; is located here in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;'s place.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt; sleeps at the depths of the central lake, awakening every year around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;, after which he is routinely put to rest. The Lunar Festival itself is also based in Nighthaven. The &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Festival\"&gt;Moonkin Festival&lt;/a&gt; also occurs in the area.\nHistory.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius dwelled within the sacred Moonglade. As the war on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; progressed and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's&lt;/a&gt; numbers swelled, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; realized that the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; could not prevail alone. He convinced &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; to accompany him to the tranquil Moonglade. They beseeched Cenarius for aid. Following the Great Sundering, the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from the secluded Moonglade and ventured into the world. Moonglade was considered sacred for &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; druids, with kaldorei society devoting itself more to nature worship and protection. Cenarius himself has remained here.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; called several druids to here to establish a new druid organization called the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; force led by &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; laid waste to the woods near the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; trying to get to Malfurion's body. Arriving near the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade%20Isle\"&gt;Moonglade Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, her &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s and several dryads fought against a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; base and the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Guardians\"&gt;isle guardians&lt;/a&gt; and retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; which she used to wake Malfurion from his slumber. Despite the Scourge presence, the land of the Moonglade was not shown to have been befouled.\nYears after the Third War, Moonglade was opened to all druid races. &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; became Moonglade's new guardian.\nMore recently, the peace in Moonglade itself has become threatened as bizarre creatures from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; have found a way into a wing of the Stormrage Barrow Dens.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the Moonglade was wholly shrouded in dark mist, giving it more the appearance of a graveyard. For a brief time, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; taught &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt; how to control his unique abilities here.\nShortly before the Cataclysm, after &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; usurped the tauren leadership, the tauren of the druidic stronghold Moonglade began their rebellion, and false rumors reached her that Baine had taken refuge there. &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, two high-ranking Cenarion Circle leaders, were unable to convene their druidic meeting in Moonglade, regarding re-opening trade links between the Alliance and the Horde, due to a wary &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently insisted that they meet initially in Ashenvale due to the potentially explosive nature of their political affairs, but he was willing to allow a second meeting in the Moonglade should their Ashenvale meeting prove successful.\nIt was in Moonglade where Malfurion Stormrage was first made aware of the return of the Emerald Nightmare into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. This news would prompt the Archdruid to return to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"doom%20guard\"&gt;doom guard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metreon\"&gt;Metreon&lt;/a&gt; rallied the &lt;a href=\"Jadefire\"&gt;Jadefire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; to lead an assault on Moonglade itself. The attack was successfully defeated by the forces sent from the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;. On another occasion, the satyr managed to take the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; and cause problems during the &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Festival\"&gt;Moonkin Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nMoonglade is a hilly forest region dotted with countless mounds, beneath which lay the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20den\"&gt;sanctums&lt;/a&gt; of other druids. The lush forest is untouched by corruption, ancient and strong, and it is surrounded by tall mountains, sheltering it from the outside world. The sacred &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;, named for &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; herself, can be found in the glade's center. The only land route to the Moonglade runs through the southwestern mountains via &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The entire valley is a haven for druids of both factions, a neutral zone where those in training can learn from the masters and the animals of the forest.\nInstances.\nThere are no dungeons of any sort and no battlegrounds in Moonglade.\nResources.\nThough the area is extremely fertile and full of life, there are oddly no useful &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s here, nor any &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; to speak of. As the creatures inhabiting the zone are all critters (with the exception of the wolves assisting &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, see \"&lt;a href=\"%23Wild%20creatures\"&gt;Wild creatures&lt;/a&gt;\" below) there is not much for &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinners&lt;/a&gt; to gather either. In contrast, the waters of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt; are plentiful in &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"%3AGreater%20Sagefish\"&gt;:Greater Sagefish&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D38\"&gt;Topographic map of Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nMoonglade is home to several characters of note. At Nighthaven, &lt;a href=\"Dendrite%20Starblaze\"&gt;Dendrite Starblaze&lt;/a&gt; aids young druids in obtaining the power to attain the bear form, the aquatic form, and to cure poisons. &lt;a href=\"Rabine%20Saturna\"&gt;Rabine Saturna&lt;/a&gt; enlists experienced heroes in the battle against the silithid, and at the Shrine of Remulos, &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; attempts to cleanse the taint that has affected the four emerald dragons of the Dream. &lt;a href=\"Loganaar\"&gt;Loganaar&lt;/a&gt; is the sole &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Trainer\"&gt;Druid Trainer&lt;/a&gt; here. Even &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself has been known to make an appearance in spirit here.\nQuests.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, Moonglade has no quests of its own that would be classified directly as Moonglade quests. However, some quests send players to Moonglade as a stopgap in larger quest chains (e.g. &lt;a href=\"The%20Keeper%27s%20Favor\"&gt;The Keeper's Favor&lt;/a&gt; and /). It is also involved in the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt; world event.\nGetting there.\nAlthough Moonglade is a mostly peaceful and safe zone, it is hard to reach for lower-level characters. To enter it by foot, you first need to go through the entire stretch of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, a level 45-50 zone, starting in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nDruids can learn to themselves to Moonglade at level 14, which makes it very easy for night elf druids to access &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; when they need to. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; druids can teleport there as well, but they are considerably farther away from friendly territory than their Alliance compatriots; even flying straight back to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; takes seven minutes.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"To%20The%20Dreamgrove\"&gt;To The Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; is completed, &lt;a href=\"Dreamwalk\"&gt;Dreamwalk&lt;/a&gt; sends druids to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, where a Moonglade portal is located.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;, anyone can teleport to Moonglade after completing a quest and can get the flight path for later.\nYou can also use a trick to travel there from &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. If you keep swimming far north from the northern end of its coast, the atmosphere will change to green hills and your zone will be 'Moonglade'. You can enter the land, but not climb the mountains. Enter the water again, but take care that you do not reach 'The Veiled Sea', you must pass through 'The Veiled Sea' however on your way north. Drown yourself, and you will be in Moonglade.\nThere are also flight points for those who have managed to get to Moonglade previously, granting easy access in the future.\nThere are also neutral flight masters inside Nighthaven who can transport night elf druids to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; and tauren druids to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; for free. Non-druids cannot use the services of these flight masters.\nWarcraft III.\nThere is a non-campaign map named \"Moonglade\". The tileset is called \"Ashenvale\";\n\"\"These marshlands have been untouched by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; so far. A tribe of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; live here, but they do not welcome interlopers.\"\"\nIn the RPG.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; ran rampant over the land &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20ancients\"&gt;in ancient times&lt;/a&gt;, the Moonglade remained untouched. After the war, the druids went into deep meditation in the secure caves of the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, sending their minds into the plane of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; built the town of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; in the north.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was created, the Moonglade housed the majority of the night elven population, surrounded by the old forest trees and the ancients, preferring solitude over communion with other races. The Moonglade ranges east of Felwood, just north of Winterspring Grove along the lower slope of Mount Hyjal. The Moonglade is a magical, sylvan forest draped in perpetual night. The moon stays high within the ebon sky, illuminating the woodland below with a silvery glow. The land never suffers the extremes of weather, thriving in a warm, endless summer eve. Considered holy to the night elves, the Moonglade is home to the night elf race and its powerful druids of the wild. Indeed, the druids had long rested in meditation under the glade, until the return of the Burning Legion awakened them. They remain awake, vowing to protect nature and heal the fractured continent from its war wounds.\nThe sacred forest of the night elves is home to many beasts both dangerous and friendly. The Kaldorei themselves live in cautious harmony with the wildlife, such as the black tigers and the bears that prowl and hunt in the woods. The elves often capture and tame the proud saber cats to use as mounts, but encountering one in the wild is dangerous. Less harmony is enjoyed with the forest's more dangerous denizens. Satyrs - cursed, deranged night elves - also lurk here and plague the night elves' solitude frequently. Some furbolgs--driven feral by drinking the foul waters of Felwood--will attack travelers as well. Fierce dire wolves and hippogryphs have also been reported in the area. In addition to these animals are the ancients: sentient trees that act as protectors of the forest. Treants--the smaller tree-men cousins to the ancients--roam the Moonglade. These beings act as fierce protectors of the forest. They do not hesitate to unleash their might upon any who would damage trees or otherwise harm nature. Many ancients live in the forest near Nighthaven. These sentient trees once had the vital task of channeling forces of the land to sustain the night elves' immortality. They now aid in the elves' warrior training and help protect their village. The Keepers of the Grove are powerful druids said to be the direct offspring of the demigod Cenarius; they roam the Moonglade as ever-vigilant protectors.\nThe night elves send these patrols out, though they focus primarily on defending Nighthaven and the Barrow Dens. The vast forests and vales of the Moonglade are sparsely populated. The sole settlement of any size is the night elves' capital, Nighthaven.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; once ran all the way to Moonglade and Nighthaven from the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; far to the south, but with the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; it became very isolated as strangers are no longer tolerated by the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw\"&gt;Timbermaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Prior to the hold's construction, he warned &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gar%27dul\"&gt;Warlord Gar'dul&lt;/a&gt; not to build it on top of the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; colony in the area, but was ignored. He has since taken it upon himself to dealing with the silithid threat to the hold, becoming the local \"silithid expert\".\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nCrawgol has been with &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt; since its construction, and while the main threat to its mission remains the nearby &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;, he deals mostly with the local silithid presence. His main method of dealing with the insectoids is sealing their tunnels &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20Burning%20Pitch\"&gt;burning pitch&lt;/a&gt;, and he recruits &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the area to aid in this effort.\nCrawgol's extensive dealings with the silithid in Desolation Hold has presumably led him to become highly knowledgeable on the creatures. He would later pen a &lt;a href=\"Crawgol%27s%20Silithid%20Field%20Guide\"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, though its literary value left much to be desired.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and following the death of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Bloodhilt\"&gt;Warlord Bloodhilt&lt;/a&gt;, Crawgol was promoted to Warlord and given control of &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt;. He was targeted by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces when they launched a large assault on the hold.\nQuotes.\nI told &lt;a href=\"Gar%27dul\"&gt;Gar'dul&lt;/a&gt; not to build a fortress on top of a &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; colony.\nDid he listen to Crawgol? No!\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Our%20Fort%20Was%20a%20Triumph\"&gt;Our Fort Was a Triumph&lt;/a&gt; states that the Alliance force was sent to Desolation Hold, but the mission's location is stated to be &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;. It could be speculated that Crawgol and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; actually held the conquered Fort and were encountered while en-route to Desolation Hold. Alternatively, the location information could be a mistake and was meant to be Desolation Hold instead."}
