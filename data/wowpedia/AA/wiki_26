She goes into the future again to ask if something had been going on lately. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; speaks about undead at the Ruby Dragonshrine. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; speaks of ley-line disturbance at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt; speaks about ancients being unable to rest at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.

These contain between 1-4 Sands of Time. \nReputation.\nEvery mob killed gives reputation with Chromie, which is required in order to unlock all of the talent tree.\nScenario.\nOutside in Dragonblight.\nNear each of the Dragonshines (and Wyrmrest Temple) are five rare elites. While you are not required to fight them, it is advised you do so. They have small health pools, their damage is low, they always spawn and they drop between 1-4 &lt;a href=\"Sands%20of%20Time\"&gt;Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; each. \nObsidian Dragonshrine.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must kill &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst time.\nIf this is your first time, you must first make your way through the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in the far north. Go into the cave, up the ramp, across the interweaving path, kill the &lt;a href=\"Charredbone%20Goliath\"&gt;Charredbone Goliath&lt;/a&gt;. After this, run back outside and turn left while exiting. &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt; is on the right side of the entrance if the goliath has already been slain.\nLore.\nIt all started when Chromie noticed Wrathion going to the Obsidian Dragonshrine. She didn't know why but decided not to follow.\nIt is revealed that a demon, named &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt;, has raised the smoldering undead as a distraction in order to release a clear shot spell at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to kill Chromie.\nInterference.\nAn adventurer and past Chromie appear and ask &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to explain. He told them that an unknown demonic force has occupied the abandoned Obsidian Dragonshrine. While his father was evil, he told them that he would never partner with the Burning Legion. The adventurer and Chromie go deep in the cave and after facing &lt;a href=\"Smoldering%20Geist\"&gt;Smoldering Geist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smoldering%20Skeleton\"&gt;Smoldering Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smoldering%20Construct\"&gt;Smoldering Construct&lt;/a&gt;, they come face to face with a &lt;a href=\"Charredbone%20Goliath\"&gt;Charredbone Goliath&lt;/a&gt;. With its defeat, the dreadlord reveals himself, telling his master that he only needs a clear shot. The two of them search outside the dragonshrine and found him hiding. They kill him and one of Chromie's assassins is taken care of.\nRuby Dragonshrine.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must kill &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Icechill\"&gt;Talar Icechill&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst time.\nIf this is your first time, you must first acquire &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Crystal\"&gt;Soul Crystal&lt;/a&gt; to reveal Talar Icechill. To achieve this you must combine three &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Crystal%20Fragment\"&gt;Soul Crystal Fragment&lt;/a&gt; to create it. These fragments are obtained from Talar's lieutenants; &lt;a href=\"Earlis%20the%20Deathrider\"&gt;Earlis the Deathrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alyndriel%20Graveborn\"&gt;Alyndriel Graveborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Festerbloat\"&gt;Festerbloat&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen obtained, go inside the tree and Chromie will summon Talar.\nLore.\nAt the Ruby Dragonshrine, &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Guardian%20Xerestrasza\"&gt;Sanctum Guardian Xerestrasza&lt;/a&gt; is leading the defense against the undead. She explains that while a ghoul or two attack the dragonshrine daily, today was different. An army of undead marched on them and their leader hid himself inside the middle tree. \nIt is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Icechill\"&gt;Talar Icechill&lt;/a&gt; is ready to launch an attack on Chromie. The lich will cast a necromatic spell that will hit &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and kill Chromie.\nInterference.\nAn adventurer and past Chromie appear and ask Xerestrasza to explain. They both agree to help defend the dragonshrine and find out who is behind this. They kill the attacker's lieutenants and create a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Crystal\"&gt;Soul Crystal&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the Lich. They kill him and one of Chromie's assassins is taken care of.\nEmerald Dragonshrine.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must kill &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst time.\nIf this is your first time, you must kill &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Lasher\"&gt;Emerald Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Skytalon\"&gt;Emerald Skytalon&lt;/a&gt;s. They drop &lt;a href=\"Emeraldine%20Plume\"&gt;Emeraldine Plume&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Fiber\"&gt;Twisted Fiber&lt;/a&gt;s which if you have 6 plumes and 10 Fibers, you will create a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare-Catcher\"&gt;Nightmare-Catcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you have one of the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare-Catcher\"&gt;Nightmare-Catcher&lt;/a&gt;s, you can go to the sleepless ancients &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Aldera\"&gt;Elder Aldera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloombeard\"&gt;Bloombeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barkhyron\"&gt;Barkhyron&lt;/a&gt;. Once there activate the Nightmare-Catcher, you must kill the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Tormentor\"&gt;Dream Tormentor&lt;/a&gt;s. Each ancient will give you a clue to Chromie murderer. You must put all three to rest before you can summon &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt;. Once you are at the skeletal dragon's claw, Chromie will summon Thalas Vylethorn. Kill him and Chromie is saved. \nLore.\nIt all started when &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt; learned of the ancients at &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn't know why and entrusts &lt;a href=\"Nishera%20the%20Garden%20Keeper\"&gt;Nishera the Garden Keeper&lt;/a&gt; to figure it out. \nIt is revealed that a demon named &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt;, has been behind the ancients restlessness from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. He plans to release a clear shot spell at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to kill Chromie.\nInterference.\nAn adventurer and past Chromie appear and ask &lt;a href=\"Nishera%20the%20Garden%20Keeper\"&gt;Nishera the Garden Keeper&lt;/a&gt; to explain. She says that the ancients can't sleep anymore. They agree to help Nishera find the cause of this problem. They started to kill &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Lasher\"&gt;Emerald Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Skytalon\"&gt;Emerald Skytalon&lt;/a&gt;s in order to get &lt;a href=\"Emeraldine%20Plume\"&gt;Emeraldine Plume&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Fiber\"&gt;Twisted Fiber&lt;/a&gt;s to create a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare-Catcher\"&gt;Nightmare-Catcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey do this three times and go to the ancients &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Aldera\"&gt;Elder Aldera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloombeard\"&gt;Bloombeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barkhyron\"&gt;Barkhyron&lt;/a&gt; and ease them by killing their &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Tormentor\"&gt;Dream Tormentor&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The three ancient reveal the location of the one responsible for the ancients unrest. A &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt; is behind the attack. The two of them search around the dragonshrine and found him hiding under a dead dragon's claw. They kill him and one of Chromie's assassins is taken care of.\nAzure Dragonshrine.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must kill the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst time.\nImmediately rush to the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; and start killing &lt;a href=\"Leyline%20Elemental\"&gt;Leyline Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ley%20Wyrm\"&gt;Ley Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s. Kill enough of them until you are able to loot 50 &lt;a href=\"Darkened%20Scrap%20of%20Vellum\"&gt;Darkened Scrap of Vellum&lt;/a&gt;. Combine the pieces to create a &lt;a href=\"Voidcallers%27%20Scroll\"&gt;Voidcallers' Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. \nFly to the top of the right floating platform and wait for Chromie to summon the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt;. Start moving and dodging when he casts the Shadow Zones, as they deal high damage. Kill the void lord and you win.\nLore.\nIt all started when &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; notices the &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;Ley line&lt;/a&gt;s acting strangely. He didn't think much of it as it is normal for Ley lines to be a bit unstable at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is revealed that a &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt; is planning to use the Ley lines to release a clear shot spell at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to kill Chromie.\nInterference.\nAn adventurer and past Chromie appear and ask &lt;a href=\"Cyrrigos\"&gt;Cyrrigos&lt;/a&gt; to explain. He tells them that while it is normal for ley lines acting strangely, he believes that something is disturbing them for their own purpose.\nThe adventurer and past Chromie go down on the grounds of the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. After killing &lt;a href=\"Leyline%20Elemental\"&gt;Leyline Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ley%20Wyrm\"&gt;Ley Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, they gather 50 &lt;a href=\"Darkened%20Scrap%20of%20Vellum\"&gt;Darkened Scrap of Vellum&lt;/a&gt;. \nCombining them together they created a &lt;a href=\"Voidcallers%27%20Scroll\"&gt;Voidcallers' Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. They fly to the top of one of the platforms and summon the one who had been causing the confusion in the ley lines, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt;. They kill it and one of Chromie's assassins is taken care of.\nThe Well of Eternity.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must rush through the Well of Eternity and defeat &lt;a href=\"Grolethax\"&gt;Grolethax&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Well of Eternity is a race against time. It is a long run that will require you to get to Grolethax and kill him as soon as possible. On the grounds of the well, there are many mobs with slow down ability that will slow you down to waste your time. After you made it to Queen Azshara's Palace, mount up and rush to Grolethax. The demon is located at the place where you fought the first boss in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have Tyrande's Moonstone, this may take a while.\nLore.\nBefore the heroes arrive to claim the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie arrived early and was burned by felfire (presumably by Grolethax). Her dying body is discovered by her present-day Chromie and an adventurer. In order to save herself, Chrome needs to get her past self through the portal which Nozdormu opens to retrieve the Demon Soul. However, a demon named Grolethax is trying to prevent the dragon from leaving so she can die in the past.\nChromie and the adventurer rush to the demon and kill him, allowing her past self to be saved.\nThe Burning of Mount Hyjal.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must survive five waves of monsters.\nChromie needs to be defended in this portal. On the first wave, you must take out a &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Overlord\"&gt;Searing Overlord&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Hound%20%28The%20Deaths%20of%20Chromie%29\"&gt;Flame Hounds&lt;/a&gt;. On the second wave, you must take out a &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Overlord\"&gt;Searing Overlord&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Pyrelord\"&gt;Seething Pyrelord&lt;/a&gt;s. On the third wave, you must take out a &lt;a href=\"Firelord%20%28The%20Deaths%20of%20Chromie%29\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. On the fourth wave, you must take out ten &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Phoenix\"&gt;Blazing Phoenixes&lt;/a&gt;. On the last wave, you must take out a &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Behemoth\"&gt;Fiery Behemoth&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Beacon\"&gt;Brimstone Beacon&lt;/a&gt;, you will be forced to fight through the waves. \nLore.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers were sent to &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; take out &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;large fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie was one possible follower who would appear. \nRegardless of how events transpired, Chromie has been beaten and just before a &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Behemoth\"&gt;Fiery Behemoth&lt;/a&gt; appears to finish the job, an adventurer from the future comes by and gives Chromie enough time to gather her energy and hearthstone away. \nBattle for Andorhal.\nIn order to save Chromie, you must destroy the \"opposite\" faction's &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Siege%20Cannon\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Siege%20Cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you don't have the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle%20Documents\"&gt;Cenarion Circle Documents&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to destroy the cannon yourself. However, initially attacking it is a waste of time.

Following the reclaiming of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; he, alongside other prominent Forsaken, created a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the governing body of their people.\nHistory.\nBelmont first appears within &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20High%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken High Command&lt;/a&gt;, having sent &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Rane%20Yorick\"&gt;Deathstalker Rane Yorick&lt;/a&gt; to scout information on the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;'s movements within &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; territory. Following Yorick's mission compromise and subsequent death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, Belmont has her report handed over to the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Banshee Queen&lt;/a&gt; - revealing an uneasy alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; pack.\nBelmont and the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthura\"&gt;Arthura&lt;/a&gt; later relocate south to the Forsaken command post in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, where intensive fighting was going on against the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. They leave shortly before a besiegement by the Bloodfang - now also supported by the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Emberstone%20Village\"&gt;Emberstone Village&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; fight their way to the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, whom Lady Sylvanas has plans for. Arthura and the player make their escape with his corpse, while Belmont remains behind, confident that he can make it back to the basecamp. However, during the flight back, a large number of howling worgen are seen overlooking the lone Belmont.\nDespite his apparently grisly fate, Belmont was able to escape his predicament, and following the Forsaken victory in Silverpine is out for revenge - on the treacherous Lord Godfrey, who had &lt;a href=\"Cities%20in%20Dust\"&gt;shot Lady Sylvanas from behind&lt;/a&gt; in his absence. Belmont, along with a regiment of Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt; troopers and blightspreaders, now resides inside &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, keen to show Godfrey the wrath of the Banshee Queen.\nAfter clearing the dining hall, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; appears, and \"reminds\" Belmont that use of the fully powered plague is forbidden. Belmont quickly assures him that this version serves as little more than a worgen repellent, though tells the player that \"unsurprisingly\" they are not going to pay much heed to Cromush's opinion on the blight, and thanks them for \"keeping quiet\" about its true potency. He later finds Cromush, who is wounded by Godfrey's poison, and ensures nothing interferes with the battle against Godfrey.\nBelmont gives the quests to kill &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Springvale\"&gt;Commander Springvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Lord Walden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nBelmont is seen within the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in the secret &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. He is found at the bar talking with &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Mary%20Smitts\"&gt;Wailing Mary Smitts&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBelmont fought in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. He first confronted &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and an Alliance adventurer at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, but Maiev slew his forces and drove him off. He later encountered &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; herself, now the avatar of the &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Ashwood%20Depot\"&gt;Ashwood Depot&lt;/a&gt;. While he taunted Tyrande that the entirety of Darkshore would soon bolster the Forsaken's armies, Tyrande slew Belmont's forces then froze Belmont in place with Elune's magic and left him to rot.\nBelmont was later held captive by the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Branch\"&gt;Druids of the Branch&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt;. He was freed by the Horde and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde controls &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nSometime later he joined the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in mustering in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as they sought to reclaim as much as they could of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Belmont was disdainful and distrustful when &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid them. Belmont, alongside other influential figures that had risen to prominence among the Forsaken, joined Calia in a meeting to determine their next of course of action. While &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; wanted to directly focus on dealing with the plague in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Belmont questioned what they should do about Calia, only for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; to declare that they should focus on the blight. She then turned to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; and questioned if he had more plague eaters, only for him to reveal to Calia and the others that he only had one left, and that while he could make more for them to be effective, they must be formulated to survive the plague. This in turn inspired Calia to point out that they might be able to turn to the plague-lords of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; for insight. When Faranell revealed that he required an undiluted sample of the plague from deep within its reaches, Calia vowed to acquire it for him, but both Faranell and Belmont were skeptical of her being able to acquire it and survive. Calia then called upon the light and with the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; by her side, she ventured into the plague and successfully acquired the plague sample, which greatly surprised Belmont. With the sample in their possession, Calia, Voss, the champion, and the plague eater went to Maldraxxus.\nIn time they returned with the empowered plague eater, where Calia informed Faranell of how the blight sample became a living manifestation, to which Faranell was quick to declare it ingenious, as it would be easier to kill. This plan was ultimately successful as the plague manifested as an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt; and was slain, liberating the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from the plague. Following this, Voss declared that the Forsaken have many points of view and should be led by a council, not a single ruler, a motion accepted by the other Forsaken leaders. While Belmont had his reservations about having a Menethil on the council, Calia was quick to declare that she had no desire for a throne, that her place was amongst them, with a vow to serve all their people. Thus a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; composing of Voss, Calia, Belmont, Faranell, and Velonara was created to lead the Forsaken. In the aftermath Belmont declared that nothing would stand in the way of the Forsaken and that Calia could continue, as her presence amongst them could be a powerful shield against the worst of the Alliance.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Forsythe\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Forsythe&lt;/a&gt; seized control of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, they used it as a staging ground to strike against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Belmont led the defense of the southern wall of the Ruins of Lordaeron, where in time he met with Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. When questioned as to the Scarlet Crusade's continued existence, considering their many defeats, Belmont explained that while many have given up and joined less fanatical orders, there were those who just wanted to destroy the living dead under the belief that they were abominations meant to be destroyed. Belmont then sent them rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; for their plan of counterattack, while he defended the wall with a few &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;deathguards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark rangers&lt;/a&gt;. After the crusade's defenses on the isle were weakened, he aided in the assault in order show them the might of the Forsaken. In the aftermath, Belmont returned to the Ruins of Lordaeron, where he and the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; declared that the champion represented what it meant to be Forsaken.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nOur mission is clear.

Ultimately, this served no purpose, as he would continue to lay there doing nothing for the rest of the instance. However, he could sometimes stay at 1\u00a0hp flagged, and every hit causing him to say, \"Arrgh!\" as long as people attacked him.

The fact that they are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; helps them immensely in their role as assassins. As Forsaken; they have no need to sleep or even breathe air. They possess tremendous willpower. They can remain submerged in water indefinitely without any need to rise, and can wait as long as it takes for their target to arrive. They can even pose as corpses, since by all means, that is exactly what they are. &lt;a href=\"Executor\"&gt;Executor&lt;/a&gt;s are seen to held an authority on the Deathstalkers, sending them on various missions.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Deathstalkers were originally led by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. The group became an elite unit of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and also the bodyguard of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;. They spied on &lt;a href=\"Andron%20Gant\"&gt;Andron Gant&lt;/a&gt; for clues of betrayal and others, like &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Adamant\"&gt;Adamant&lt;/a&gt; were deployed to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; while the Yorick siblings were doing reconnaissance through northern &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; about the Scourge threat. One agent with the help of the adventurers also infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; and killed its &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt;. They also spied on the humans of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. They were collecting data on the Scarlet Crusade outside of Stratholme for Nathanos.\nRogues among the Forsaken who newly gained their free will from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; were introduced into the Deathstalkers after completing certain tasks. These tasks were often very dangerous and could mean the potential Deathstalker's death.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nSome Deathstalkers joined the group called &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;The Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; which went to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. During an attack on Lich King in Dragonblight, leader of the Deathstalkers, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, raised a revolt wanting to summon the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth. Since the organization still exists after Varimathras' defeat, it can be assumed that most Deathstalkers remained loyal to their Queen.\nCataclysm.\nThe Deathstalkers participated in the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; has become the commander of the assassins in Silverpine and Gilneas.

Before he became Forsaken, he was a farmer struggling to survive on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron City&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the first to die during &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of the continent. He remembers plowing a field, and turning to face a pack of ravaging ghouls. He woke up to a dark night, lying on blighted soil. At first, he was frightened by his new life, but then he met &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;. No one knows what she said to him, but from that moment forward he became one of her deadliest slayers. Deathtouch learned the arts of the spymaster to further his usefulness to the Dark Lady. Unknown to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Deathtouch has assassinated a high-ranking noble in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and slowly gains political power, impersonating the noble and controlling his lands. While his servants are beginning to suspect their master, the damage has already been done, and Deathtouch has increased the length of the Forsaken's arm all the way to Stormwind."}

Ages ago, Neltharion was empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; with dominion over the earth and the deep places of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, driven mad by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, he turned against the other Aspects during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, eventually abandoning his title of Aspect of Earth in favor of being the Aspect of Death. Becoming one of the greatest terrors of the known world, his name too became one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt among both mortals and dragons. He was perhaps the most powerful servant of the Old Gods.\nThe black Aspect involved himself in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, adopting the form of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; Lord Daval Prestor in order to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from within. As a human, Prestor was said to be tall, with a slim figure, black hair and clean-shaven hawklike features that were the subject of gossip among the ladies of King Terenas' court. He also had a quick mind and a friendly, engaging manner that endeared him to all involved in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;Alterac crisis&lt;/a&gt;. It was said that he even got a smile out of &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, the normally dour king of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeathwing also managed to turn his greatest enemy, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into a slave of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, with which he later allied himself. After a series of setbacks culminating in his defeat at the hands of the other Aspects, Deathwing retreated to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to recuperate. From the depths of the earth, deeper beneath &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, he observed his former mate &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;'s experiments with the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and later continued his late consort's work.\nThough believed dead by many, Deathwing returned in spectacular fashion after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Entering Azeroth through Deepholm fractured the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, causing the Elemental Plane to start collapsing onto Azeroth. This &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; reshaped the entire world of Azeroth and unleashed widespread destruction. As the world reeled, he appeared and brought flame to various regions of Azeroth. His ultimate goal was to bring about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; - the liberation of the Old Gods and the end of all life on the planet. Deathwing was aided by powerful allies also minions of his masters, such as the warped ogre-mage &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tol%27vir\"&gt;Neferset tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniting their powers, the remaining Dragon Aspects sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to brave the unstable paths of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient artifact crafted by Deathwing himself 10,000 years earlier and destroyed shortly after the Second War, for it was believed to be the only means of defeating him. With the weapon secured, the Aspects took the battle to their corrupted brother, with the orc shaman &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as the wielder of the Dragon Soul, now imbued with Deathwing's essence - the very essence of the earth itself. After the siege of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and unleashing his most powerful minions, Deathwing took to the skies until he was blasted with the Dragon Soul into the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. His body at last giving way to the corruption within, Deathwing made his final stand in the raging torrent of the Maelstrom, where he was at last destroyed by the combined powers of the Aspects and the Dragon Soul.\nDeathwing was the secondary antagonist in ', and the main antagonist of '.\nBiography.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nIn Azeroth's ancient past, the Dragon Aspects were &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. During this time Neltharion did not seem to be the good-natured wyrm he would become as an Aspect, taunting the other proto-dragons for fearing Galakrond.\nWhen a blue-white proto-dragon named &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt; and two other proto-dragons, Neltharion helped to fight them off. He was impressed by Malygos's power, declaring them brothers in blood. Malygos noticed something in the hills nearby, but Neltharion couldn't see it. As he flew off, the land moved - a ripple no larger than a tall human.\nLike the other proto-dragons, Neltharion rallied under &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt; by accepting her as alpha in order to deal with the threat of Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;, though he did not trust her. During this time Neltharion and Malygos quickly became fast friends with &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. While not agreeing with all of Ysera's beliefs Neltharion was rather stunned at Talonixa's deception of herding the bitten into a cave and then collapsing it on them, which eventually killed all the bitten who had begun to act like Galakrond.\nNeltharion later found himself as part of Talonixa's proto-dragon army that moved to combat Galakrond. Before the proto-dragon army engaged their enemy in battle Malygos devised a plan in which the army would fly higher in the air where Galakrond could not fly. Quickly informing Talonixa of his plan, Malygos was relieved that she was considering it. However, hearing his sigh Talonixa took it as a sign of Malygos's satisfaction of her bowing to his wisdom and engaged Malygos in battle. While Nozdormu and Neltharion were quick to help Malygos, Talonixa was helped by her two lieutenants. Despite Nozdormu encouraging a retreat, Neltharion openly called for Malygos to fight Talonixa and became the new alpha an action that enraged Talonixa and brought more of her followers to join her, which caused the trio to flee high into the air.\nUsing his not-living Galakrond was able to lure Talonixa's army into a trap where he erupted from the ground when the army was in position and swiftly shattered it. After killing Talonixa, Galakrond was unable to devour the fast of the army due to the actions of Malygos, Nozdormu, and Neltharion. As Malygos broke off to find Ysera and Alexstrasza, Galakrond ended engaging in battle against the future aspects only to be driven off by &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; after being stunned by his hammer.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a mountain range to the north and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the octagonal artifact before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond's slumbering place, which &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would later note in his visions was nowhere near &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the octagonal object on Tyr's belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr's hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true dragon.\nIn the battle, Tyr's hammer and the strange artifact were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the artifact, just as Galakrond's massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr's hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger. An unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. After being attacked by two not-living Ysera and the others found they could not find Tyr where they left him, concluding that some beast must have taken him for food.\nAfter recuperating, Neltharion and the others decide to hunt down Galakrond in order to kill him once and for all or die trying. Nozdormu along with the others would be stunned to learn that Galakrond had begun to devour the not-living in order to feed his hunger and shortly after would engage in battle with the behemoth. During the battle, Neltharion would work closely with Malygos and the pair would ultimately kill Galakrond after they forced a boulder down his throat.\nAfter killing Galakrond, Neltharion and the others were approached by two other watchers, who revealed that they had taken Tyr to help him. As the proto-dragons were acknowledging the offer, Nozdormu noticed Neltharion staring off toward the mountains, as if he were listening to something. Agreeing to protect Azeroth with his friends, the two watchers were joined by two others and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s acted through the keepers to transform Neltharion and the others into the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. One of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that titans created them from Galakrond, to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nAs a Dragon Aspect.\nNow the caretaker of the continents of Azeroth, with domain over the earth and the deep places of the world, Neltharion used his power with wisdom and benevolence, forging mountains and rivers for the benefit of mortal races. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;His lair&lt;/a&gt; was located in a mountainous region near the night elf city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, where he stored one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic, cave-dwelling &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; served him. He also had two seats of power on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from which he and the black flight defended the isles, and his underground laboratory &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; where he conducted his experiments.\nIn peaceful times, Neltharion was renowned for his wisdom and power and became known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, a great protector of the land. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, now the Spell-Weaver and the Aspect of Magic, was his closest friend. They often had friendly banter.\nTwenty thousand years ago, Neltharion created the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. Concerned at the rift between the Dragon Aspects and &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion knew a war was coming even though Alexstrasza thought she could soothe tensions with only words. The &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; were slow, and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; fragile, but Neltharion saw potential in the mortal races that had begun to emerge across the world. He created the dracthyr as \"ideal soldiers,\" combing the essence of dragons with the traits of mortal races. Neltharion used a titan artifact, a gauntlet called the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; which he wore in his human form, to use &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; magic to keep the dracthyr under his control. &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leaders of the Primalist rebellion known as the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, attacked Neltharion and his dracthyr army at the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and during the fighting destroyed the Oathbinder. Seeing no other way to stop the Primalists, this was the moment that Neltharion gave in to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s that had long haunted him, and used their power to seal Raszageth away.\nWithout the titan relic which he used to control the dracthyr, Neltharion deemed them a risk. He contacted Malygos, beside himself and telling Malygos everything was falling apart and the dracthyr needed to be contained. He ordered them into creches beneath the Forbidden Reach, and asked Malygos to put them into stasis with his magic. Malygos left behind a contingent of blue dragons to watch over them. They would slumber there, forgotten, for 20,000 years. Many years later, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; would come to believe that Neltharion still had a purpose for them, and put them into stasis so that one day they could choose their own destinies.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nWhen fallen &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; instigated the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies fought on the earthen's side. However, when Tyr realized that they could not win against the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; alone, he called upon the Dragon Aspects for aid. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead titan-forged. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn's iron ranks.\nMuch as they had done in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspects worked in unison to overwhelm and decimate the vrykul army. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. Neltharion raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in entombed cities across northern Kalimdor. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\nAt some point, the vrykul &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; convinced a raiding party of fellow warriors to accompany him into &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. They waited until they saw the Dragon Aspect leave his mountain, and then they went inside. They were attacked by the lair's defenders, and none but Magnar himself survived, the vrykul also managing to get away with &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Earth-Warder\"&gt;one of Neltharion's scales&lt;/a&gt; despite facing the Aspect himself on his return.\nCorruption.\nAlthough he was revered as a Dragon Aspect, Neltharion silently chafed at what he felt was a burden that had been inflicted on him; though he could command the entire weight of Azeroth itself, that same weight constantly pressed on his body every waking moment, the load making him feel suffocated to the point that he felt his very spirit unraveling. Neltharion believed that he must bear this burden alone, but ultimately found it to be too much, and began to resent the charge placed upon him. The belief that the titans viewed Azeroth as an experiment only fueled his bitterness. During his conversation with Thrall millennia later, he admitted that he served the Old Gods largely because he believed that they would free him from this burden.\nThen came the madness that destroyed Neltharion's mind, changing him and his kind forever and leading to the creation of the powerful item known as the Dragon Soul, later the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The inner-voices of the Old Gods convinced him that he could have power beyond his imagination if he served them. The voices made him paranoid of even his own &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion began to yearn for a world dominated by his black dragonflight \u2014 a world in which the other dragonflights ceased to exist and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would be his petty slaves for mating. The Old Gods convinced Neltharion to create the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; servants led by &lt;a href=\"Meklo\"&gt;Meklo&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion created a simple golden disc made of his blood and forged in the goblins' cauldrons and anvils deep beneath the earth. Empowered by Neltharion's magic, the simple disc was magically shielded so that the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s could not see within it. There was an evil within the disc, some taint of the Old Gods, though its exact nature is not known.\nNeltharion had the drogbar experiment with ways to merge the elements into a &lt;a href=\"Elementium\"&gt;binding ore&lt;/a&gt;. He believed it would be the ultimate tool in his rise to power. There were at least fifty attempts.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion saw the opportunity to complete his Dragon Soul. Guided by the voices of the Old Gods, he first captured demons of the Burning Legion and added their powers to the Dragon Soul. Neltharion then convinced &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; to help him with the other Dragon Aspects. All of them agreed to give a portion of their powers to the Dragon Soul, including all dragons of their dragonflights. Neltharion proposed that the Dragon Soul disc could be a weapon of great power to destroy the demons of the Burning Legion. Unknown to the rest, Neltharion was the only one who did not give of his powers to the Dragon Soul.\nNeltharion, the Dragon Aspects, and their dragonflights flew toward &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; held the demons at bay. The dragons awaited Neltharion's first attack. He grabbed the Dragon Soul and by channeling his destructive power through it destroyed thousands of demons with one swing of radiant magic. The Dragon Aspects watched in horror as Neltharion also killed hundreds of night elves and other allies along with the demons.\nNeltharion revealed the depths of his betrayal at last. Now with the disc at his command, he wanted all races and the demons to see his power and to bow to him. The Dragon Aspects attacked Neltharion in an attempt to take the Dragon Soul from him and to reason with him in hopes of determining the cause of his perfidy. Malygos' blue dragonflight surrounded Neltharion, but with a swing of the Dragon Soul, most of the blue dragons perished. The next swing of the Dragon Soul paralyzed all dragonflights and the Dragon Aspects in mid-air, rendering them unable to move or speak. Neltharion then struck out at the Dragon Aspects and their dragonflights, destroying many and scattering them far across the land.\nNeltharion's betrayal struck a great blow to the Aspects, and their fear of being destroyed like the blue dragonflight kept them in seclusion. In desperation, the Aspects shielded themselves and hid to become undetected even by each other.\nRise of the Destroyer.\nThe growing corruption in Neltharion's heart warped his body, as the angelic dragon began taking a more demonic appearance, similar to how &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; changed to a more demonic form after his corruption. Neltharion's body cracked open, revealing his molten heart, and magma and fire flowed off his chest. His eyes became aflame in red, demonstrating the magnitude of his power and the depths of his evil. Thus was Deathwing the Destroyer born, and the Dragon Soul was renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeathwing returned to his lair in what would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. His proximity to the Demon Soul was ripping his body apart, so goblin smiths forged an armor of &lt;a href=\"Adamantine\"&gt;adamantium&lt;/a&gt; steel to serve as a vessel to contain Deathwing's raging powers and keep them in check, which were then placed on his body by the drogbar, whom he had enslaved. Only the adamantium plates bolted to his spine kept the power from destroying his body.\nThe Old Gods had manipulated Deathwing into creating the Demon Soul, but their true intention was that the demons would inform their lord Sargeras of the great power of the weapon used against them. Sargeras would no doubt want the Demon Soul to power the gateway that would let him enter Azeroth. By using the Demon Soul to amplify the gateway, the three Old Gods hoped to escape their prison beneath the planet.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to find Deathwing's lair and stole the Demon Soul from the black dragon, who tried to pursue the thief in vain. &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt; captured Malfurion and took the Demon Soul back to &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;, the general of the Legion's armies. It was used to power up the portal that would allow Sargeras to enter Azeroth.\nDeathwing tried one last time to recover the disk when it was being used by both Sargeras and the Old Gods, and actually succeeded in reaching it. Deathwing was almost destroyed in the attempt, but after he got the Demon Soul, an enormous surge of power made him lose his grip on the disk and sent him spiraling far away from the portal. Shortly afterward, an incarnation of Nozdormu from millennia later prevented the Soul from falling into the Well below and brought it with him back to the future.\nAfter the Burning Legion was defeated, and the Demon Soul returned from the future, the Dragon Aspects sealed the artifact with their energies, so that Deathwing should never be able to manipulate the Demon Soul. The artifact was hidden in an undisclosed location by Malfurion at the request of the Dragon Aspects. No longer in possession of the artifact and now unable to use it, Deathwing vowed to destroy most life and to wreak havoc on the planet. With his powers over earth, Neltharion caused volcanoes to rise along with the destruction already caused by the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;'s implosion, sinking most of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; below the ocean. He himself chose Deathwing as his title, to better show his contempt and intentions for the lesser creatures around him.\nAfter the war, Deathwing retreated to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt; near his lair in the mountainous region, which had recently been renamed &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; living there in honor of the hero &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. Huln and an uprising of Deathwing's drogbar slaves battled the Earth Warder, and with the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; Huln banished Deathwing from the land, sending him to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Deathwing returned to Azeroth, he settled into a deep slumber. He needed time to recover from his wounds caused by the Demon Soul and to regain his strength. During his long slumber, the other dragonflights would hunt his corrupted black dragonflight to the brink of extinction.\nFirst War.\nTen thousand years later, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; between Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was opened by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. The incredible amount of magic roused Deathwing from his slumber. He watched with fascination as &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fought, and he became convinced that the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would be the means to restore his flight to its full glory. However, he knew the other Dragon Aspects and the mortal races would oppose him if he came out of hiding. If the Horde could break Azeroth's kingdoms, Deathwing could devote his full attention to fending off the Aspects. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's Old God masters urged him to take small steps to aid the orcs. He did nothing drastic, for fear of attracting the Aspects' attention, yet the Old Gods saw Deathwing's intervention as a way to engulf the world in chaos.\nThe first thing Deathwing did was take the guise of a noble human from Stormwind and travel to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He charmed the aristocracy, and when stories of the Horde invasion finally reached Lordaeron, Deathwing openly scoffed at them. He told Lordaeron's nobles that the tales were fabrications meant to hide growing problems with rebels in Stormwind, and his lies were much more convincing than Stormwind's desperate pleas for help. To win over those who stubbornly believed the reports, Deathwing subtly influenced the minds of Lordaeron's nobles with his magic, preventing them from taking any action against the Horde.\nDeathwing did not only involve himself with human affairs, either. Once he was certain Lordaeron would not send aid to Stormwind, Deathwing moved south. He took the form of a &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orc and lived among the orcs for months, examining their society from the inside. He had easily sensed the hidden power driving the Horde's actions, and before long Deathwing maneuvered himself into the good graces of several individuals. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; believed Deathwing's orc disguise to be a loyal follower, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; believed him a proud Blackrock orc, and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; believed he was a stalwart ally. When Blackhand fell to Orgrim, Deathwing did not see it as an issue. As a servant of the Old Gods, he saw the shattering of the Burning Legion's hold on the orcs as a good thing that only served to make them more vulnerable to his own masters.\nSecond War.\nBut there was a problem with Deathwing's plans. The Horde had been weakened by the First War, and if the rest of the human kingdoms were to unite, the orcs would not have the means to destroy them. Even if they could, they would awaken too many enemies in the meantime - if the Dragon Aspects learned about the Horde, the orcs would stand no chance. However, Deathwing's Dragon Soul was still out there, having been hidden after the War of the Ancients. It contained the power of all the Aspects except Deathwing, and so could be used against them for destruction or control. And although the weapon had been enchanted after the war so that no dragon could wield it, orcs could.\nDeathwing granted visions to &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. He was bombarded with vivid dreams of his clan taming and riding dragons. His clan had once ridden &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s on Draenor, and to once again soar in the sky was an idea that could not be resisted. Once the hook had been set, Deathwing coaxed Zuluhed to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragon Soul was hidden deep beneath the mountains, protected by wards and the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Orastrasz\"&gt;Orastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, untouched for ten thousand years. Dozens of Dragonmaw orcs died against Orastrasz, unfamiliar as they were with dragons, but they succeeded. Zuluhed ordered his clan's greatest warlock, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the Dragon Soul. Sensing the dark power within, Nekros renamed it the Demon Soul. Far from the Redridge Mountains, Alexstrasza sensed the wards breaking and grew concerned when she heard no word from Orastrasz. She and several of her red dragons hurried south, though she believed that some mortal had found the disc and Orastrasz was currently hunting for it and that it would be easy to help him retrieve. In truth, they were heading right into Deathwing's trap.\nDeathwing taught Nekros how to use the Demon Soul through dreams and visions. With it, the Dragonmaw clan was able to enslave Alexstrasza shortly after the Horde assaulted &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. He could not use it on the other dragons as he had to focus on her, but by lashing out at Alexstrasza with the disc's power whenever her dragons tried to intervene, Nekros was able to get them to do as he ordered. The Dragonmaw took control of the long-abandoned dwarf city &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and forced Alexstrasza's dragons to accompany them by threatening their queen. While the Dragonmaw began to ride their captives as battle mounts, Alexstrasza was imprisoned within Grim Batol and forced to lay eggs so the Dragonmaw could raise loyal dragons from infancy. From afar, Deathwing rejoiced in Alexstrasza's imprisonment. He continued to subtly advise Nekros on how best to use the Demon Soul to control the red dragons. Not only would making the Horde stronger help his plan to restore the black dragonflight, but he also knew that seeing her children be used as tools for war would make Alexstrasza's heart suffer. And Deathwing would relish every moment of Alexstrasza's torment.\n&lt;a href=\"Kryll\"&gt;Kryll&lt;/a&gt;, a goblin servant of Deathwing, was sent to infiltrate the Dragonmaw clan and to serve Nekros Skullcrusher. Nekros ended up being manipulated by Kryll into doing Deathwing's bidding. The goblin served as an \"advisor\" to Nekros, whispering ideas to the orc in order to further Deathwing's aims.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nEventually, the Horde lost their war and were forced to retreat to Draenor with the Dark Portal closed behind them. After &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; reopened the portal several years later, his forces were approached by Deathwing. He offered his own children for assistance in exchange for safe passage to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They agreed and Deathwing helped them prepare for several key battles to steal two artifacts from the Alliance in order for Ner'zhul's newly reformed Horde to create new portals to other worlds. They then fled back to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to Draenor. Deathwing believed the world would be a relatively safe haven for his offspring and secreted away a cache of black dragon eggs there. However, the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; did not take kindly to Deathwing and his black dragons trying to take over their territory and conflict arose between the two races.\nSome time after Deathwing invaded his territory, &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt; was met by the lost heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. They were after the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; which Deathwing possessed (he demanded it as payment from Ner'zhul). After that, Gruul and his ogre minions, along with the heroes, challenged Deathwing from his perch in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 killing his eggs and impaling his lesser black drakes on the mountain spikes. Infuriated by this act, Deathwing landed on top of them and attacked Gruul. Although clearly no match for the mad &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;'s power, Gruul was saved by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s miraculous spell when he disassembled some of the adamantium plates that were holding Deathwing's unstable body together resulting in Deathwing's retreat.\nHaving escaped back to Azeroth, Deathwing ended up in a fight with some of the archmagi of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and feigned defeat, falling into the sea, where most of the council assumed at the time that he died. He was not dead, however, and he took a human guise, pretending to be a heroic noble named Lord Prestor in an effort to be declared king of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, where he could manipulate the Alliance from within.\nSoon after &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; recklessly opened multiple portals on Draenor, the magical stress tore the planet apart. The energies released in this catastrophe altered Deathwing's eggs, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt;s: partially corporeal and partially ethereal dragons who possess the ability to shift between the astral and physical planes. Without Deathwing's guidance, these otherworldly nether drakes are just now finding their own way among the blasted ruins of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Daval Prestor.\nDeathwing, posing as Lord Daval Prestor, managed to make himself popular with &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and the kings of the Alliance nations, and for a while had a strong influence in the decisions of state.\nLord Prestor was a minor noble, dispossessed and without backing, who came from the north. He came from one of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;most mountainous and obscure regions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after his tiny domain had been destroyed during the Second War by a dragon attack. He and a handful of his close family traveled by foot \u2014 no mounts, not even any servants or guards \u2014 to the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron, where he presented himself to King Terenas. Lord Prestor soon became an integral part of Terenas' inner circle. When debating on what to do with Lord &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, the treacherous king of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, right after the Second War ended, Prestor advised Terenas to depose Lord Perenolde and declare martial law in the Alterac region.\nAlthough no one had heard of him prior to five years before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Prestor claimed bloodlines in the &lt;a href=\"Perenolde%20family\"&gt;royal house&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac ensuring he was a distant cousin to &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;King Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; debated what should be done with Alterac, protesting Lordaeron's continued presence there. Greymane supported &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Perenolde's nephew&lt;/a&gt; in his claim for the throne of Alterac. Trollbane advocated dividing it between Lordaeron and Stromgarde. Realizing that neither situation was acceptable and that Lordaeron could not simply annex it, Terenas \u2014 telepathically coerced by Prestor \u2014 believed that a strong leader trusted by the Alliance leadership should be put in place as King of Alterac, and he declared Lord Prestor as his choice to take that position. Terenas was even prepared to give Prestor the hand of his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Princess Calia&lt;/a&gt;, in the coming years as part of a marriage alliance between the new king of Alterac and the king of Lordaeron.\nDeathwing's ultimate goal was to obtain a high level of power and influence within the Alliance, so he could destroy it from within. He had begun his campaign against the Alliance by pitting the kingdoms of Lordaeron, Stromgarde, Gilneas, and Kul Tiras against the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; - who Deathwing considered threats to his new identity. Because of that, the Kirin Tor of Dalaran had their misgivings. The red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in his guise as Krasus, a member of the Kirin Tor high council \u2014 attempted to penetrate the chateau of Lord Prestor, setting off a very powerful spell-trap known as the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Hunger\"&gt;Endless Hunger&lt;/a&gt;. The powerful energies maimed him, but Krasus was able to discover who he truly was. Two other members of the high council, &lt;a href=\"Drenden\"&gt;Drenden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt;, saw that Prestor was a complete blank magically, implying that he possessed great power \u2014 \"possibly almost as powerful as &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;\", as Modera put it. The fact that the Alliance leaders, including the normally stubborn Greymane, had given Prestor their support, and the fact that King Terenas appeared to be leaving Dalaran out of the loop entirely, increased the Kirin Tor's suspicions about this unusual man.\nThe battle of Grim Batol.\nThe orcs of the Dragonmaw clan at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; kept their hold over Alexstrasza, even though the bulk of the Horde had already been defeated. Deathwing tried to frighten the Dragonmaw orcs into believing that the humans were attacking Grim Batol, so that they would move Alexstrasza and her eggs north to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;; this left her eggs vulnerable. Deathwing hoped to steal Alexstrasza's latest cache for himself to create a new dragonflight; though bearing the crimson scales of the Dragonqueen, they would be raised by Deathwing and carry his hatred for the mortal races.\nDeathwing used his pawns to manipulate the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, who had been sent to Grim Batol by Krasus, as part of a plan to free Alexstrasza. He saved the young mage several times and helped him reach Grim Batol, hoping that his appearance inside the mountain fortress would further convince Nekros to flee from it. Though the orcs were convinced and began leaving Grim Batol, Deathwing's attack on the caravan, however, failed. Nekros tried to use the Demon Soul on Deathwing but was unsuccessful due to the disk having no power over the black dragon. He then sent &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, old and sick, to stop the Deathwing, but he failed and was killed.\nAt the behest of Krasus, the three remaining free aspects, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, grudgingly decided to come out of their lairs and attack Deathwing. However, due to the power they had given to the Demon Soul, they were no match for the black leviathan. But Rhonin was able to steal the Demon Soul from Nekros, freeing Alexstrasza in the process. Furthermore, the mage discovered the artifact's weakness: a scale from its draconic creator, a scale that Rhonin happened to own in the form of a talisman that Deathwing himself had given to him. Cutting the Demon Soul across its surface with the scale, Rhonin finally destroyed it, releasing all the powers of the dragons who had given their power ten thousand years earlier. Deathwing was sent retreating with four very angry, fully-empowered &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; on his heels, though he managed to elude them in the end.\nShortly after the battle of Grim Batol, Lord Daval Prestor vanished under unusual circumstances when Deathwing was forced to go into hiding, with his chateau abandoned and his servants gone. Deathwing's influence over the nobles disappeared along with him. Deathwing returned to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, to recuperate. When he arrived, the native &lt;a href=\"stone%20dragon\"&gt;stone dragon&lt;/a&gt;s flocked to his side, easily swayed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;-amplified power of the Aspect of Earth. For a while, Deathwing did not upset the balance in Deepholm; he had stayed there before, and the earth elementals knew him. \"The shift\", as &lt;a href=\"Kor%20the%20Immovable\"&gt;Kor the Immovable&lt;/a&gt; puts it, did not truly begin until he was joined by the fanatical &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the absence of their father, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, offspring of Deathwing and masters of the black dragonflight, have tried to control the world. Onyxia followed in her father's footsteps by taking the Prestor name to attempt to manipulate the Alliance. She posed as a human counselor named Katrana Prestor for the new child King of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian, meanwhile, posed as a human named Lord Victor Nefarius, Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. He was able to enslave the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs who served him on the top of the mountain, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurning Crusade.\nIn a brief dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Deathwing survived the events of the Battle of Grim Batol, and sought the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt; eggs to continue Nefarian's experiments.\nNight of the Dragon.\nDeathwing's consort &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; serves as the primary antagonist of &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Night of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, carrying on Deathwing's experiments of creating twilight dragons. Deathwing himself does not appear until the end of the novel, where it is revealed he is using the research of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; and consort to perfect the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Some time after Sinestra's death, Deathwing retrieved her corpse and used the power of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; to reanimate her for the sole purpose of creating more eggs to turn into twilight dragons. She would later serve as the &lt;a href=\"Sinestra%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, inside &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing appeared in his visage form and under his original name, Neltharion. He was featured along with all the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in a flashback that depicted the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, ten thousand years earlier.\nCataclysm era.\nHidden away inside the &lt;a href=\"Stonecore\"&gt;Stonecore&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing waited, recovering from the wounds of his last battle against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As he bided his time until he could reforge the world in molten fire, the Twilight's Hammer toiled over him, forging a new armor of &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; plates that were then hammered to the Dragon Aspect's skin to hold his tormented body together. The raw elementium had been dug up by a massive &lt;a href=\"gyreworm\"&gt;gyreworm&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Corborus\"&gt;Corborus&lt;/a&gt;, enslaved by Deathwing himself for this one task.\nIn recent years, the whisperings of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s had gotten worse; the Old Ones' dread power steadily increased as &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; stirred from their ancient slumbers, and the growing influence of the Old Gods magnified Deathwing's power ten-fold. From within his lair in the elemental plane of Deepholm, Deathwing awoke from his slumber and literally erupted into the world. His explosion into Azeroth was so powerful that it tore a rift between the Elemental Plane and Azeroth and caused earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods, reshaping the very face of the world. Very few lands have remained untouched in the wake of the devastating &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; got its share of the destruction when Deathwing swooped into it and crashed down on the city gates. The entire &lt;a href=\"park\"&gt;park&lt;/a&gt; was blown away, and his searing heat caused the towers where he landed to glow red until they were fully repaired. Afterward, he took the head of Onyxia and flew off, something which puzzled the city guards as they were certain he would have been able to destroy the entire city if he wanted to. This also caused all the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Rat\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; to beat a hasty retreat from the city. He also flew over &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; causing the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, marking &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; uninhabitable and forcing the remains of the entire &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; to evacuate their side of Kezan for Kalimdor.\nFollowing his explosive escape from Deepholm, Deathwing cast a deadly shadow over the people of Azeroth. Deathwing randomly chose zones to attack; a reddened sky was the only warning before every living creature caught in his approach was consumed by his terrible fire and killed. Dying in this manner rewarded the &lt;a href=\"Stood%20in%20the%20Fire\"&gt;Stood in the Fire&lt;/a&gt; achievement. Deathwing continued strafing random zones \"until his ruinous reign was brought to an end\" (until the end of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3\"&gt;patch 4.3&lt;/a&gt;)\nThe Badlands.\nThe main storyline quest of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; in \"Cataclysm\" is centered around &lt;a href=\"Rheastrasza\"&gt;Rheastrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her research of the black dragonflight and of a way of purifying them. She has captured the black dragon, &lt;a href=\"Nyxondra\"&gt;Nyxondra&lt;/a&gt;, and forces her to lay eggs for the experiments. She feels pity for the black dragon but knows it is for the greater good. After succeeding in creating a purified black dragon egg, she constantly moves around to avoid being found by agents of the black dragonflight, who want to destroy the egg. In the quest &lt;a href=\"Rheastrasza%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Rheastrasza's Gift&lt;/a&gt;, she is killed by Deathwing, who was after the egg. The egg he destroyed, however, was not the purified one, but Rheastrasza's own egg. The real egg, purified by a titan device an adventurer acquires during the quest chain, hatches into &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is also a minor quest chain involving &lt;a href=\"Theldurin%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Theldurin the Lost&lt;/a&gt; and his friends telling rather tall tales about how each of them defeated Deathwing.\nMount Hyjal.\nAt the beginning of the storyline, Deathwing summons the Firelord, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; along with his fire elemental servants into the world of Azeroth, aided by his mortal followers, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult with the ultimate goal of destroying &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nUldum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; storyline it is revealed that Deathwing enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and his air elemental minions to do his bidding. The &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset tribe&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;, native residents of Uldum, have also joined his ranks as they have been seduced by the promises of power and removal of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Al'Akir, as well as mortal forces led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Schnottz\"&gt;Commander Schnottz&lt;/a&gt;, also sought to gain control of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; superweapon capable of wiping out all life on Azeroth.\nThe Twilight Highlands.\nDeathwing is later seen in the Twilight highlands quest chain. After beating back his Twilight dragon minions, the player along with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her son &lt;a href=\"Calen\"&gt;Calen&lt;/a&gt;, use a sanctified circle of life to lure Deathwing to their location so Alexstrasza can destroy him once and for all. The plan quickly falls apart as Deathwing proves to be more powerful than they realize. After a quick dialogue, Deathwing and Alexstrasza face each other above &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, shadowing the events of Day of the Dragon.\nAfter a long battle, Alexstrasza and Deathwing spiral out of sight, with Deathwing spitting a stream of magma. Alexstrasza, severely wounded, lands near the entrance and tells the player, along with Calen, that Deathwing was dead. Soon after, however, Deathwing rises above the hillside, wounded, but not nearly as bad as Alexstrasza. The player then flees with the near-dead Alexstrasza as Calen distracts Deathwing long enough for them to escape. Deathwing then leaves as, according to Calen, he was wounded more than he let on and needed time to heal.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nIt was revealed that once, long ago, Deathwing had been warned that an orc named &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; would rise to challenge and possibly defeat him. Consequently, Deathwing sent out the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; to kill him. He also sent from an alternate universe in an attempt to assassinate Thrall, but the plan failed when Thrall killed Blackmoore. After the Aspects defeated the Twilight\u00b4s Hammer forces in Wyrmrest Temple, Deathwing allowed the Twilight Father, who in fact was &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, to return to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nRage of the Firelands.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Blue Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was torn between two possible new leaders - &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, it was revealed that Arygos has entered into an alliance with the Blue Dragonflight's original despoiler, Deathwing, in order to become the new Aspect of Magic - and Deathwing, though eager to see him overthrow Kalecgos, warned him not to repeat the mistakes of his father.\nHowever, their plot ended in failure, as &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed herself to save Kalecgos from Arygos' assault, and Arygos fled &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; - swearing that Neltharion would destroy them all.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nAs Thrall and the other Aspects, including the newly-elevated Kalecgos, debated on how to defeat Deathwing, the shaman's spirit communed with the earth and took an &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; form. It was there that he encountered Deathwing, using the power of the Old Gods to imprison his spirit within. The corrupted Aspect mocked Thrall, believing that the Aspects sought to replace him as Earth-Warder with the mortal shaman, and claiming that the \"gift\" he had been granted by the Titans - his charge to defend Azeroth - was in fact a curse, imprisoning him to his duty. To demonstrate, he allowed Thrall to experience what it was like to have the weight of the earth on his shoulders, claiming that this was what the Aspects wanted - \"to damn you to a life of eternal torment\", as Deathwing stated it. He then unleashed a series of scathing attacks against Thrall's earthen form; because the shaman had embraced Azeroth, and Azeroth embraced him, his \"wounds\" materialized in the physical world in the form of earthquakes. Finally, the Aspects called on the Earthen Ring and the Cenarion Circle to break Deathwing's hold, bringing Thrall back to himself.\nThe Aspects decided that in order to defeat Deathwing, they would have to acquire the Dragon Soul in its \"purest form\" - a period not long after its creation, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ten millennia earlier. As the Soul was imbued with a powerful enchantment to prevent dragonkind from ever using it, the Aspects called on Thrall to be the wielder of the Dragon Soul in the battle against Deathwing.\nThe Hour of Twilight.\nAccording to Alexstrasza, Deathwing had been so twisted by the Old Gods' power and would simply regenerate from any physical damage, no matter how immense. He could not be killed even if every living mortal in the world faced him at once. The only solution was to completely \"unmake\" Deathwing, to unravel his very essence, using the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, the future is shown if Deathwing is not defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; at last falls - a charred Dragonblight in Northrend, with all life extinguished forever. Deathwing is shown as a burnt-out shell of his former self, his powers having, at last, destroyed him from within. His lifeless corpse is impaled at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, his lava-like blood seeping from his mouth. To prevent the Hour of Twilight, the bronze aspect &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to go ten thousand years into the past, to the War of the Ancients, and retrieve the Dragon Soul - having been completely obliterated by &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the Shattering - so that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; could invoke its power to defeat Deathwing, though his past self tried to jealously defend the talisman from the adventurers - but it doesn't work. Once the artifact was retrieved, the adventurers escorted Thrall to Wyrmrest Temple and protected him from Deathwing's minions, so that the weapon could be secured for the final battle.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers worked together to defeat Deathwing's commanders in order to buy Thrall and the Aspects time to charge the Demon Soul. Deathwing's forces were killed over several weeks. After the adventurers took a short trip to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to activate the &lt;a href=\"The%20Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing officially disowned &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; and then unleashed his ultimate creation, &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, upon the temple. When the twilight dragon fell, Thrall unleashed the Demon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing fled, attempting to return to the relative safety of Deepholm, through the Maelstrom. Thrall, the Aspects, and the adventurers gave chase, riding the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;The \"Skyfire\"&lt;/a&gt; after the Aspect of Death, battling his personal escort along the way. The battles against Deathwing lasted \"a few terrible hours\".\nAfter catching up, the adventurers leapt out of The \"Skyfire's\" bomb bay to parachute onto &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's back&lt;/a&gt; and began prying the elementium plates from his back, eventually making a big enough opening for Thrall to blast the dragon with the Demon Soul. Deathwing was blasted out of the sky, and crashed into the Maelstrom. The defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoiced at having rid themselves of the Destroyer, but Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom. Without his armor, his molten form began to mutate, granting him &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;a form far more terrifying&lt;/a&gt; than before (somewhat resembling creatures like &lt;a href=\"Iso%27rath\"&gt;Iso'rath&lt;/a&gt;). The final battle for Azeroth began in earnest, as Deathwing continuously attempted to finish the job he started by bringing forth a second Cataclysm that would end the world. Each time, the Aspects step in and use their power to stop him until one final blow from the Demon Soul completely obliterated the corrupted Aspect, leaving only the remnants of his shattered armor. Portions of his metal jaw were brought to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Western Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate his defeat.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;'s history lessons, Deathwing made two appearances through illusions. At first, when he explained that the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; had seen a vision a great armored dragon clenching the world with his ferocious jaws, but that &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; did nothing of the coming of this &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Lorewalker Cho then established that his visions did come to past and that &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; was no more. Then, Deathwing could be seen alongside &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; when Lorewalker Cho explained the notion of legacy.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;council of the six greatest warlocks&lt;/a&gt; eventually sought the powers their defeated foes wielded, including Deathwing.\nDuring the trials to obtain the blessings of the four &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; wanted to let &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; face his past and summoned a &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Vision of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and Wrathion defeated the black aspect, and Niuzao and Chi-Ji told Wrathion that he was nothing like him.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's banishment from &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; was witnessed in visions during &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;'s trials to become High Chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, his vision for &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; was to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion%2C%20the%20Black%20Emperor\"&gt;corrupt him just as he had Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, with Wrathion ruling the revived &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; under N'Zoth's command. Ironically given Deathwing's status as the Old Gods' most powerful servant, it would be his scion Wrathion who would play a key role in N'Zoth's final defeat by coming up with the plan to use the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, as well as using &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; to open a hole in N'Zoth's &lt;a href=\"Carapace%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;carapace&lt;/a&gt; and allow heroes to begin the final battle.\nAn illusion of Deathwing appears during the final battle with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;N'Zoth the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, raining fire down on the heroes.\nShadowlands.\nA vision of Deathwing fighting the Aspects appears within the nightmares of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nYears after his death, Deathwing's legacy continued to haunt dragonkind. In the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, his ancient &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; creations reawakened and came out into the world. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; set out to reclaim their lost legacy. Of all the dracthyr who learned of Deathwing's history after they were sealed, only &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Vigil\"&gt;Adamant Vigil&lt;/a&gt; learned the truth.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; sought to claim the Earth-Warder's throne at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. A Deathwing-worshiping cult called the &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt; can also be found, formed by an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; Twilight's Hammer cultist who convinced groups of black &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; that Deathwing would one day return.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, the Sundered Flame discovered a stone at &lt;a href=\"Nelthazan%20Ruins\"&gt;Nelthazan Ruins&lt;/a&gt; that belonged to Neltharion called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Locus\"&gt;Black Locus&lt;/a&gt;, which can control lesser dragonkin and make them hear whispers.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Observatory\"&gt;Obsidian Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; uncovered Neltharion's records from when he first decided to make the dracthyr.\nSarkareth's search led him to Neltharion's ancient laboratory, &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as the second raid of the expansion. His &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Neltharion%20%28boss%20tactics%29\"&gt;echo&lt;/a&gt; serves as a penultimate boss encounter.\nPersonality.\nWhile Deathwing was once a benevolent entity, the whispers of the Old Gods have corrupted him into a being driven by hatred. He harbors a hatred for all mortal races and wishes to see them dead. He's also been driven utterly insane by the whispers plaguing him, especially when in possession of the Demon Soul. Deathwing was so attached to it that, even when warned by the goblin alchemists who made his first armor that the Demon Soul's energies would kill him if he kept it with him too long, he only agreed to part with it temporarily after being reminded that it would likely be stolen from him if he were to die.\nIn spite of this insanity, Deathwing does display a degree of cunning. Although he hates mortals, he is apparently willing to tolerate them if it can prove of any help in his plans, though inevitably he will do away with them when they have outlived their usefulness.\nDespite Deathwing's overall loathing of mortals, he has a sense of respect for &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps even a fear of, as he stated in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" that the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; was the only human he had ever respected and that he would have never willingly face him in combat, though this might have technically been fear of the portion of Sargeras that was locked inside Medivh. He viewed Thrall in a similar way; when the Twilight Father expressed disbelief that Thrall could triumph, Deathwing made it clear that he planned to take no chances.\nHe also showed genuine loyalty to the Old Gods due to his belief that they could free him from his burden. He viewed the responsibility the titans gave him as a burden, a weight too heavy for him to bear, but also felt that he had to bear it alone instead of asking the other Aspects for aid. The weight of Azeroth that he had to bear pressed down on him, so much so that he felt as if he were suffocating and his spirit unraveling. He began to resent the titans for placing this charge on him, and the Old Gods promised to free him of his burden, which is why he agreed to join them.\nAs a young proto-dragon, Neltharion was a lover of combat. He taunted those afraid of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; for being weak, and got himself involved in a fight between &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt; simply to show off his own strength. It was Malygos's power that led to Neltharion sparking their friendship.\nNames and titles.\nHe is usually referred to as \"Deathwing\" by the majority of beings. Only a few mages, night elves and dragons still call him \"Neltharion\". However, over the years Deathwing has been given many names, including, but not limited to:\nDesigning and appearance.\nDeathwing was originally simply described as a dragon having adhered plates of adamantine steel to his body. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" described him as a winged behemoth as black as night with a noble bearing. Narrow veins of actual silver and gold streaking from front to back accented his spine and sides, while gleaming flashes between the scales hinted at diamonds and other precious stones embedded naturally in his hide.\nOne of the big questions during the \"\" development was \"what does Deathwing look like?\". Deathwing had been established in lore for a long time, but he had never been depicted in that much detail other than some images from Chris Metzen and Warcraft II. But to have a really comprehensive design for Deathwing was an early top priority. The developers wanted Deathwing to have a unique, nasty, and aggressive look, but also wanted to have the preexisting World of Warcraft dragons look as if they were part of the same family. They headed into the idea that Deathwing's rage manifests itself literally as the boiling lava inside him and he actually needs metal plates to contain them. In their search for a unique signature that would set Deathwing apart from the other dragons, the development team experimented with his jaw. So they replaced his jaw on an early sketch with a metallic one and made it bigger, giving him a very unique silhouette. When they showed it to the game team the immediate reaction was extremely positive.\nDeathwing's &lt;a href=\"visage\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt; form was that of a handsome &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;. Tall, slim, and well-built, with lustrous black hair, a clean-shaven face, and strong yet elegant hawklike features, this shape was introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as Lord Daval Prestor. He usually wore fine clothing, and took care of not sullying them, being so meticulous about his visage appearance because of the marred flaws of his own draconic body, though during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; he eventually stopped caring and had a visage matching his real, monstrous appearance.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; had visage shapes that had features similar to those Deathwing sported in his own human guise.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nWhen he succumbed, Neltharion ceased to exist, taking up a new name and a bitter purpose. He became Deathwing and his subjects were placed beneath the iron rule of a tyrant. Upon his irrevocable shift to evil, he turned against his destiny, and his mind unwound, causing suffering wherever he could. Certain legends surrounding Deathwing claim that as the Earth-Warder, Deathwing shaped the land so the races would not go to war over land and resources. When he went mad, Deathwing lowered the mountains and allowed the races to intermingle. He ruined fertile land and destroyed other terrain so that the races would be forced to fight for food. Deathwing's efforts gave birth to an occupation that has remained with all races since then: war.\nCombat.\nDeathwing is a terrifying opponent who is as cruel as he is vicious. He cares nothing for honor or nobility, striking with whatever weapons and cunning he has at his disposal, reveling in causing earthquakes and ripping open volcanic fissures. He often sends his minions into combat while he surveys the battlefield, striking at whatever weaknesses he discovers.\nDaval Prestor.\nHe was a young human diplomat and noble that joined the high council of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonblight.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing returned to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and landed in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. He announced that he is close to death and wishes to end his life there with the others already present. Many of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s were furious that their ancient enemy would claim such an honor there. Others admired his willingness to set aside the past. The non-dragons were simply excited at the idea that such a powerful dragon was there. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; wants to corrupt him and make him &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s want to enlist him in their cause and unleash him upon the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; before he dies. Scavengers want his bones and flesh and treasure-hunters want his skin and claws and any items he carries. The heroes will have to keep this situation from escalating into a multi-sided war.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nDuring the canceled \"\" game, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; would have met with Deathwing in order to match wits. Deathwing had his lair in upper &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and Thrall had to kill him in order to gain &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s trust. Thrall killed him by closing shut his fire-breathing organs from inside his very body with a metal trap, leading to the evil dragon exploding when trying to use his fire breath against the orc.\nThe fact that Deathwing was seen smoking a hookah was blamed on a \"miscommunication\", but Blizzard chose to keep it anyway.\nDeathwing was said by Alexstrasza to be one of his sons. He was served by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s which had mottled and grey skin, a fact that might have inspired the description of the trolls later said to have served him during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe even the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nDeathwing is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBefore being added, Deathwing was one of the heroes most frequently requested by players. In April of 2017, a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/BlizzHeroes/status/855798378902429701\"&gt;short Twitter teaser&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUgJLvtx5PzI\"&gt;Hanamura Showdown&lt;/a&gt; cinematic led a number of players to believe that Deathwing would be added as a hero in the near future. However, once the cinematic released, it was revealed that the new hero was actually the \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20franchise\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" character and the teaser had merely been hinting at 's presence in the cinematic. This became the subject of various memes which were later referenced by Blizzard when they added the Deathwing-themed skin, followed in 2018 by a \"\" spray referencing the original teaser. When Deathwing was eventually announced as a hero in October of 2019, Blizzard again paid homage to the meme by preceding the announcement with a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/BlizzHeroes/status/1186326286328827904\"&gt;teaser image&lt;/a&gt; mimicking the original Hanamura Showdown teaser.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

However, there is still a large scar bisecting the continent here, separating the southern regions of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; from the northern ones.\nInitially, Deathwing would emerge here and have made his way to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, where he would bisect the mountain (currently seen from within the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol%20%28instance%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, but not externally).

However, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance forces needed the Skull to destroy the Dark Portal, so they stormed Deathwing's isle, and one of the levels ends with the defeat of Deathwing by the hands of &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar and a group of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDeathwing is also present in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\". Most people thought he was dead, but he resurfaced and is defeated by the other &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; who was just rescued by a group of Alliance heroes. He eventually escapes.\nThe backstory in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" manual, and the official &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20%28from%20official%20site%29\"&gt;Timeline&lt;/a&gt; published few months before the release of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, states that Beyond the Dark Portal takes place before \"Day of the Dragon\". However, this actually creates lots of new problems.\n\"Day of the Dragon\" describes the last war against the Horde, but the characters only speak about &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and say he and the Horde were defeated \"a few months ago\". Yet Ner'zhul's forces actually began other wars a few months after Doomhammer's defeat, and no character speaks about it. On the other hand, \"Beyond the Dark Portal\" makes an open reference to \"the liberation of the dragon queen Alexstrasza\". The Horde needed Deathwing precisely because the orcs needed other dragons to fight for them. According to both the book and the game, Day of the Dragon actually takes place before \"Beyond the Dark Portal\". \nOne possible explanation is that Knaak wrote in his novel that the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; was the end of the war against the Horde, which was correct, since Doomhammer and Ner'zhul's forces were two distinct groups. People that wrote the timeline may have incorrectly thought it happened after all the wars between humans and orcs.\nNone of this has ever been confirmed or denied."}

It is an effect that while it persists hampers the target in some way. Among other effects, debuffs frequently lower &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, hinder the effectiveness of the target's actions, or cause &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes the term \"debuff\" is also used to describe the act of removing &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s on hostile targets, but it is usual to refer to such an action as a &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cure\"&gt;cure&lt;/a&gt; after the common spells that remove such effects. Another popular name for removing debuffs is \"decurse\".\nDebuffs come in many varieties and most of them are race/class specific spells or abilities.\nDebuffs are also color coded per the table below.\nLimitations.\nThere is no effective limit on the number of debuffs that may be applied to a creature at one time. Prior to the release of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, a single target could have at most 40 debuffs at one time.\nSimilar debuffs generally do not stack with each other. One prominent exception is &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; debuffs (DoTs): multiple copies of the same DoT will generally stack when applied by different players, and when applied by the same player to different targets (&lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Living Bomb&lt;/a&gt; is a partial exception). As well, many boss monsters can stack several copies of the same DoT on the same player.\nCombating debuffs.\nClasses listed below have abilities to remove certain kinds of debuff, but each can usually only remove certain types of debuff.\nNevertheless, certain &lt;a href=\"Encounter\"&gt;encounters&lt;/a&gt; introduce unique debuffs that are impossible to remove even if they would ordinarily be countered by the classes below.\nUnclassified debuffs.\nSome debuffs are not classified in any way, and as such can not be dispelled by any class. There are some exceptions to this - some &lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; effects, which are unclassified, can be cured by using a &lt;a href=\"Luffa\"&gt;Luffa&lt;/a&gt; or the Dwarven racial ability &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s can dispel nearly \"any\" debuff on themselves by using &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, as can &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s by using &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is believed that both Spirit and Decay influence the soul's creation of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Spirit, which is used to communicate with the elements and/or heal, Decay binds the elements to one's will, forces them into servitude and weaponize them.

Have a tank either bind all the guests to him by using his AoE taunt or have all decently armored damage dealers in your raid each pick one or two of them from the pull to spread out the damage and build up some minor aggro on them before initiating the AoE fire a few seconds later. Starting the AoE too early causes all guests to gang up on one player which often results in certain death for the poor lad.\nDespite being all named the same, the Phantom Guests have different and random abilities which are not discernible prior to the pull. Since some of them can be healers, capable of completely restoring the health of one of their fellow guests, nuking them down one by one with focus damage can be a tedious and risky undertaking.\nThe Phantom Ghosts sitting on the largest table in the banquet hall in front of &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; are two separate groups that can be pulled individually from each side of the table.\nWhen pulling, always make sure that no patrol (&lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Waiter\"&gt;Skeletal Waiter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Servant\"&gt;Spectral Servant&lt;/a&gt;) is near.\nThese mobs are stunable.\nReward.\nReputation: Provides 3 reputation with &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Eye\"&gt;The Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;."}

If you wish the Imp to stay phased, set it to Passive mode.\nThe Imp will still take damage from environments that cause damage (such as lava) while under phase shift. Whether this is a bug or intended by blizzard is still unknown.\nPhase Shift can be set to &lt;a href=\"auto-cast\"&gt;auto-cast&lt;/a&gt;; when this is turned on, the Imp will automatically go into Phase Shift at the first opportunity when combat is over.\nPhase Shift does not prevent the use of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pact%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Dark Pact (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;; in fact the two make a very beneficial combination, ensuring that the Imp's master always has a ready supply of mana.\nPhase Shift prevents raid buffing to your Imp before fights.

For example, if a player has completed &lt;a href=\"Return%20To%20Angrathar\"&gt;Return To Angrathar&lt;/a&gt; (the Wrathgate quest line), they will see &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; before the Wrathgate, and the surrounding area on fire. However, players who have not completed the quest will not see those things even though they are in the same location. These are different \"phases,\" and players affected by this are sometimes referred to as \"phased.\" However, moving just outside the Wrathgate area allows phased players to see one another.\nPlayers in different phases cannot see each other unless they are in the same &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Party%20Sync\"&gt;party sync&lt;/a&gt; is enabled.\nHistory.\nUsage before &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Wrath of the Lich King, phasing was used in stealth and invisibility mechanics. Events such as the opening of Ahn'Qiraj and the taking over of the Isle of Quel'Danas were simply different realm databases adding game objects and NPCs for all players.\nPhasing was invented as a bug fix for the climax of the &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; introduction quest chain in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Soulgrinder\"&gt;Into the Soulgrinder&lt;/a&gt;. It was later used for the Blade's Edge &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; daily quests: &lt;a href=\"Intercepting%20the%20Mana%20Cells\"&gt;Intercepting the Mana Cells&lt;/a&gt;\u2020 and &lt;a href=\"Maintaining%20the%20Sunwell%20Portal\"&gt;Maintaining the Sunwell Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King\", Blizzard has made full use of this system. The most well-known examples are , which looks different to the character depending on his progress through the DK questline, and the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; line of quests, which end with &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;The Battle For The Undercity (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance characters and &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;The Battle For The Undercity (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; for Horde characters.\nTo characters having completed the questline, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; is located in front of the Wrathgate and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed along with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, will no longer be in Undercity. For players on certain steps of the quest, the Undercity will also be inhabited by demons. Another example is the existence of Alliance NPCs in front of the Undercity which are not visible to players in a different phase of the quest.\nPhasing is also used in (not by far a complete list):\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to \"\", phasing was unable to change the base terrain of the world. This means that the normal ground could not change in texture or positioning. An example would be the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; having burnt ground prior to being burned by the Red Dragonflight.\n\"Cataclysm\" changed those limits. Terrain became able to phase, land could sink beneath the waves as well as rise above them. A raging fire was able to expand further along as time moves forward. Whole mountains crumbled and fall leading the way to new lands. With this technology, you could see, for example, a harbor built before your eyes, without the use of in-game patches.\nPhasing plays a huge role in \"\", and not just in the newly made zones, but a good amount of the revamped zones as well. A few of the known phase changes are that of the starting areas for the newly announced races of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, in much of the same way the Death Knight starting zone was handled, except with the new terrain phasing feature.\nComparison to similar tools.\n&lt;a href=\"Sharding%20%28term%29\"&gt;Sharding&lt;/a&gt; is distinct from phasing. Sharding is used solely to alleviate player overcrowding, unrelated to the story or quests. But similar to phasing, players in different shards cannot see each other.\n&lt;a href=\"Layering\"&gt;Layering&lt;/a&gt; is the same as sharding, but affects an entire &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;, covering \"all\" zones, unrelated to the story or quests. Layering was used to alleviate overcrowding at the launch of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Classic\"&gt;World of Warcraft Classic&lt;/a&gt;, but was later removed.\n&lt;a href=\"Cross-realm%20zones\"&gt;Cross-realm zones&lt;/a&gt; are designed to prevent \"under\"-crowding. If a zone on a realm has very few players, the game automatically merges players across multiple realms into the same \"instance\" of the zone. It is also unrelated to the story or quests."}

Since the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; she has been living in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. She is described as having large, expressive eyes and a small button nose.\nBiography.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhen she was a little kid, she would sometimes get her father his supper when he was working late or even assist him in the library.\nShe was about age 15 during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. She was born in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and her most beloved toy was her teddy bear &lt;a href=\"Brownie%20Bear\"&gt;Brownie Bear&lt;/a&gt;, a gift from her father when she was born. Her father was a historian in Lordaeron during that time and both her mother and her father were casualties of the attack. Having left Brownie at home for fear of forgetting it on the trip back, she was visiting her extended family in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; the day the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; sacked Lordaeron and was supposed to return the day after. Parqual was subsequently raised as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The orphaned Philia's visit became permanent, and it seems she was taken in by at least an uncle.\nWhen King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sent out missives looking for those willing to meet their Forsaken family and friends, Philia was one of the few willing to meet them. Prior to this, she assumed both her parents were dead.\nWhen Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; interviewed her, she told them her uncle did not want her to meet her Forsaken father but she felt she had to see him, if it really was her father. Because of the sheer emotion, she displayed when speaking about her past regarding her father, she was deemed a non-threat and was allowed to attend.\nWhen she attended the Gathering, she showed no prejudice when she was reunited with her father. When &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; called her name, she ran straight towards her father and stopped just short of touching, both smiling largely at each other, and she remarked: \"It's really you!\". Her father had brought her old, tattered Brownie Bear to the Gathering and she wished to hold the bear, but her father had to refuse, stating that Anduin had to first deem it safe. She also wished to hug her father, but he regrettably said his skin couldn't handle the bear hugs he remembered and so she compromised by simply holding his hand gently.\nAs the Gathering went on, her father attempted to flee towards &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces were stationed, and defect into the Alliance so he could be a part of her life again. As he did so, he was shot in the back and killed by Sylvanas's &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark rangers&lt;/a&gt;, who were ordered to kill all Forsaken on the field.\nWhen Anduin commissioned tombstone carvers and gravediggers to return with him to the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;bury&lt;/a&gt; the Forsaken lost in the bloodshed, Philia was one of the many human attendees who agreed to go back for the bodies of their family and friends. She comforted &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Felstone\"&gt;Emma Felstone&lt;/a&gt; by saying that they would help each other after Emma had commented that all her sons were gone and that she was now alone. She had a personal message inscribed on her father's tombstone, \"Always In My Heart\", and left Brownie Bear next to it.\nShadowlands.\nShe can be found in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, having a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Ol%27%20Emma\"&gt;Ol' Emma&lt;/a&gt;. She requested that the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; keep Emma ignorant of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, as she believes her heart couldn't take it."}

These vials of liquid phlogiston serve as the fuel for many devices.\nA phlogiston collector running at full speed can collect 40 vials of liquid phlogiston per hour, though collectors running on mountaintops (such as the collectors at Khaz Modan) collect a bit more than collectors at seaside.\nPhlogiston collectors are temperamental and require constant supervision. If they collect too little phlogiston gas, the water content of the liquid phlogiston is too high and devices won\u2019t operate properly. If too much phlogiston gas is collected, the crucible inside may start to react with the gas, burning white-hot until the entire collector melts into slag and the collected gas explodes."}

{"id": "20020", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20020", "title": "Phoenix", "text": "Phoenixes are powerful, bird-like &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s summoned by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. They burn with such intensity that they damage both themselves and nearby enemies. When a phoenix dies, it creates an egg that will hatch into a new phoenix. The phoenix is the most powerful spell able to be cast by a potent &lt;a href=\"blood%20mage\"&gt;blood mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile fire hatchings are born from the ashes of a phoenix, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20phoenix\"&gt;dark hatchlings&lt;/a&gt; emerge from their shadows. Phoenixes grow very slowly; a &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Hatchling\"&gt;phoenix hatchling&lt;/a&gt; obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; was still a hatchling by the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"molten%20phoenix\"&gt;molten phoenix&lt;/a&gt;es on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Some act as &lt;a href=\"carrion%20bird\"&gt;carrion bird&lt;/a&gt;s, others are tamed by the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. They do leave a smoldering feather behind once killed, before rising again.\nIn Warcraft III.\nPhoenixes are encountered as wild creatures in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nIn the RPG.\nThe phoenix is a natural predator of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. The wondrous bird is about 18 feet long with a sleek, feathered body that dances with bright flames. Its colorful feathers range from yellow to orange to red. A crest of spiky feathers runs down the center of its back, and its wingspan stretches out 30 feet. From birth to death, it spends its life hunting through the air - in fact, it lacks any legs that might enable it to land. Even after death it often rises again from its own ashes to continue the hunt.\nThe phoenix is a fearless, aggressive predator of aerial prey. Its only direct form is a vicious bite, but the secondary damage from its flaming aura and ability to burn help to bring down its prey quickly. A phoenix prefers to attack from above and behind with surprise, but follows up its initial attack by remaining close to burn its victims while continuing to strike with its beak.\nSummon phoenix is a unique spell that Kael developed to summon fire elementals. It is similar to other \"summon monster\" spells, except it can only summon fire elementals. Kael invariably uses it to summon phoenixes, hence its name."}

The Phoenix-Hawk that pats the west side of the room only needs to be pulled if you are heading to Void Reaver (or Kael'thas), \nand the one that pats the east side of the room only needs to be pulled if you are heading to Solarian (or Kael'thas).\nPulling can either be done by a dps with a 36+ yard range, or by a tank body pulling. You must be careful that the one pulled is not close to another Phoenix-Hawk, \nand make sure no Phoenix-Hawk's will be passing the ramp until your target is most of the way down it. \nThe Phoenix-Hawk's have a large aggro range and can unnecessarily aggro a 2nd if you're not careful.\nFighting them is much like fighting the Lava-Surgers in Molten Core. Everyone should group up on top of it, and have an off tank far to soak the Charges. Their Charge ability has a minimum range of 8 yards, so Hunters can shoot them from about 5-6 yards away without risking of being Charged.\nThis is a very mana-intensive fight, so mana regen and intellect is recommended over + to heal. Not so much for healing but because the Dragon-Hawk's AoE Mana Burn will make healer's mana pools drop to nothing in about a minute and a half. Also for this reason, dpsing them down fast is extremely important, since dpsing too slowly can mean the healers may run out of mana."}

{"id": "17490", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17490", "title": "Pick Lock", "text": "Pick Lock is a level 14 &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; ability that allows a rogue to open locked &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"junkbox\"&gt;junkbox&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"lockbox\"&gt;lockbox&lt;/a&gt;es. A rogue's Pick Lock skill is equal to their character level. Rogues can verify their current Pick Lock skill by viewing its tooltip.\nHistorical.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; rogues began with a Lockpicking skill level of 1 and were required to actively train it by picking locks. The maximum skill was capped at 5 times your character level. For example, at level 16 you could train your Lockpicking skill from 1 to 80; in order to train beyond 80 you would need to reach level 17, at which point you could raise your skill level to 85. Like profession recipes, locked items were color-coded to indicate the probability of a skillup upon being unlocked (the colors are still in the game, but are purely cosmetic).\nAlliance players could obtain the quest &lt;a href=\"Alther%27s%20Mill%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Alther's Mill (quest)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and begin training their lockpicking using the &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Lockbox\"&gt;Practice Lockbox&lt;/a&gt;es that spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Alther%27s%20Mill\"&gt;mill&lt;/a&gt;. Horde players had a similar quest, &lt;a href=\"Plundering%20the%20Plunderers\"&gt;Plundering the Plunderers&lt;/a&gt;, which gave them to opportunity to practice on &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%27s%20Strongbox\"&gt;Buccaneer's Strongbox&lt;/a&gt;es aboard a ship off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt; rogues could pick up &lt;a href=\"Greed%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Greed (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, which tasked them with unlocking &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Chest\"&gt;Burial Chest&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. All these quests still provide &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Tools\"&gt;Thieves' Tools&lt;/a&gt;, which were required to pick locks prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, but now have no use. Instead of venturing to questing areas, rogues could also begin their training using &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Lock\"&gt;Practice Lock&lt;/a&gt;, crafted by &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt higher skill levels rogues were generally required to find chests and doors to train on, which were often guarded by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Rogues could talk to their &lt;a href=\"rogue%20trainer\"&gt;rogue trainer&lt;/a&gt; for recommendations of areas containing &lt;a href=\"footlocker\"&gt;footlocker&lt;/a&gt;s corresponding to their skill level. Rogues could also &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Pocket\"&gt;Pick Pocket&lt;/a&gt; mobs and unlock any &lt;a href=\"junkbox\"&gt;junkbox&lt;/a&gt;es they found. Alternatively, a rogue could offer free lockpicking services to other players in the hopes of leveling it, and some even paid for skillups.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Leather%20Gloves\"&gt;Dark Leather Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, crafted by &lt;a href=\"leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt;s, used to increase lockpicking skill by 5, but they no longer seem to provide this benefit."}

{"id": "17489", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17489", "title": "Pick Pocket", "text": "Pick Pocket is a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; ability that allows a rogue to pilfer money and/or items from a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;'s pockets while &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;ed.\nNotes.\nTypically the rogue will be able to pilfer a small item such as a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"junkbox\"&gt;junkbox&lt;/a&gt;, various junk items and a small amount of money. Although multiple attempts on a given mob are possible, only the initial (successful) attempt will yield any results.\nJunkboxes themselves may contain some &lt;a href=\"Potion%23Restoration\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; items such as &lt;a href=\"Spinesever%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Spinesever (weapon)&lt;/a&gt;. Poisons do not start to appear until you start pickpocketing level 30 mobs.\nThe rogue must be &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;ed and within 10 yards of their target to use this skill. If it is successful, a loot box will appear, allowing them to choose which items to take; typically, this is a handful of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;coins&lt;/a&gt;, with a small chance of odd monster-specific items or gems. If the skill is resisted, the monster immediately detects the rogue and attacks. Failure rates depend on relative levels, but the base failure rate seems to be around 5%.\nMany monsters have no pockets, and thus cannot be pickpocketed. Typically &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; types will have pockets and beasts won't, but there are numerous exceptions. If a rogue attempts to pickpocket a monster who doesn't have pockets, the monster does not aggro. Enemy players cannot be pickpocketed.\nThe items received from picking pockets are not subject to group looting rules, so you always get all the items and 100% of the money. The money and items picked up with this ability are extras, in addition to the monster's normal loot when it is killed, so a rogue picking pockets is not depriving his companions of loot. Each monster has only a few items in their pockets when he spawns; if one rogue goes through an area, picking all the monsters' pockets but killing none of the monsters, then the next rogue through the area may find that all the monsters' pockets are empty. Monster pocket loot does get refilled eventually, even if they are never killed. The loot respawn rate seems similar to that of the monsters themselves.\nTrivia.\nPick Pocket is in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". The flavor text reads: \"He'll pick anyone's pocket, except a gnome's. He'd never stoop so low.\""}

Advertising your desire to form or join a group on &lt;a href=\"trade%20chat\"&gt;trade chat&lt;/a&gt; is a popular way of \"pugging\" outside of using the Dungeon Finder.\nNote that the word \"group\" refers to the literal meaning of a group, i.e. players having a common objective, and is not limited to five persons (a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt;s with pick-up players are still called a pug, despite being a raid. \nPickup groups are usually less organized than a group formed from people of the same &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; or guild alliance because the players are less familiar with each other. Pickup groups are usually susceptible to a &lt;a href=\"loot%20ninja\"&gt;loot ninja&lt;/a&gt; or incompetent players that have most likely failed at joining a higher level guild, and are looking for this kind of group for this exact reason.\nMany guilds refuse to use pickup groups for instances due to the chance that one or more of the players will wipe the group, ninja loot, or just be insubordinate in general. These experiences usually result from a very small but very horrible group of players, or players who aren't very experienced (it's quite possible to go all the way to the maximum level of 85 without ever entering an instance).\nHowever, many pugs are very successful, especially at higher levels when all the members are familiar at least with the group dynamic even if they're not familiar with the instance or area. Successful pugs are effective at picking up innovations that other players have developed, and developing your own innovations that improve your overall abilities as a member of your class and as a leader of future runs.\nThe most important elements of a successful pug are positive attitude, cooperation, clarity (including marks for each crowd control spell), and experience that the leader has. While all but the most dysfunctional pugs can get through a 3-player group quest that requires killing a single weak elite mob, running instances still requires some sophistication from everyone in the group.\nBring all you can to the group.\nGoing a bit extra can get you invited back to good groups and even lead to future invites for raiding guilds."}

(Each quantity that goes into this sum may be modified, however; such as by a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt; self-buff, a priest's &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Resolve\"&gt;Silent Resolve&lt;/a&gt; talent, or a player whose cloak is enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Subtlety%20%28enchant%29\"&gt;Subtlety&lt;/a&gt;.)\nGenerally, whichever unit has the highest raw threat against an NPC becomes its primary target, and raw threat percentage simplifies this comparison.\nHowever, most NPCs are designed to maintain some degree of target focus -- so that they don't rapidly switch targets if, for example, a unit other than the primary target suddenly reaches 101% raw threat. The amount by which a unit must surpass the primary target's threat to become the new primary target varies by distance from the NPC. \nThus, a scaled percentage value is given to provide clarity. The rawPercent value returned from this function can be greater than 100 (indicating that unit has greater threat against mobUnit than mobUnit's primary target, and is thus in danger of becoming the primary target), but the scaledPercent value will always be 100 or lower.\nThreat information for a pair of unit and mobUnit is only returned if the unit has threat against the mobUnit in question. In addition, no threat data is provided if a unit's pet is attacking an NPC but the unit himself has taken no action, even though the pet has threat against the NPC.)\"\nExample.\n /dump UnitDetailedThreatSituation(\"player\", \"target\")\nYou have 100% threat on the targeted NPC.\n &gt; true, 3, 100, 100, 15\nYou have partial threat on the targeted NPC: 66% threat on the mobUnit, 73% threat relative to the primary target, threat value amount of 25.\n &gt; false, 0, 66.363632202148, 73, 25"}

It is put in the global table as the os module is not available.\n date ([format [, time]])\nIt returns a string or a table containing the user's machine's current date and time (or the &lt;a href=\"API_time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; represented by codice_1), formatted according to the given string codice_2. If one wishes to supply your own format string, then it uses the same rules as strftime() (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fe06s4ak.aspx\"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/strftime.3.html\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;). The special string codice_3 tells the codice_4 function to return a table.\nThis is a mirror of the Lua function &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html%23pdf-os.date\"&gt;os.date()&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the default format returned when calling the date() function with no parameters will be different depending on whether the game is running on a Windows or a Macintosh computer. If you want your addon to be compatible with both systems, you should therefore not use date() without parameters, instead, use\n date(\"%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S\")\nto display the date in the default Windows format\n-or-\n date(\"%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y\")\nto display the date in the default Macintosh format.\nBe aware that if you use an incorrect format string, including any format specifiers not supported by the C library used in WoW, you will get the error message, \"format too long\". The error has nothing necessarily to do with the length of the format string; it is simply imprecise error wording in that version of Lua.\nCompatibility.\nThe Windows and Mac versions of strftime() accept different format specifiers. Attempting to use one OS's exclusive specifiers on the other OS will throw the \"format too long\" error mentioned above.\nThere is, however, a common subset of specifiers that work on both Windows and Mac (those specified by the C89 standard). This subset consists of all of the Windows specifiers except %z and the # flag. The safest thing to do is refer to C89, or use a web-based tool like &lt;a href=\"http%3A//strftime.net/\"&gt;strftime.net&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that %z can be used on both OSes, but it will have a different meaning on each one (alias of %Z in Windows, time zone offset on Mac)."}

If your table has all its values between [1] and [n] for some n, with no nils in that range, the # operator will return n. Otherwise its result may be unclear.\nNote:\nThe reason the returned values are different is because the tables are different. For indexed tables, or tables that start with index values like 1,2,3 for keys, use tinsert and tremove to change the contents.

During the release of World of Warcraft, the level cap was 60. The level cap has been raised for each successive &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; it was increased to 70, and in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; it was further increased to 80.\nFinally, \"cap\" or sometimes \"soft cap\" may be used when referring to gear itemization. For example, players &lt;a href=\"theorycraft\"&gt;theorycraft&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"hit\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; cap, the &lt;a href=\"expertise\"&gt;expertise&lt;/a&gt; cap, the &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; cap, the &lt;a href=\"spell%20penetration\"&gt;spell penetration&lt;/a&gt; cap, and others. \nA \"hard cap\" is a point beyond which a stat becomes useless. For example, 1400 armor penetration rating bypasses 100% of all armor, so more rating has no effect. A spellcaster with 17% increased chance to hit will never miss a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;, so this is the hard cap for hit rating for casters.\nA \"soft cap\" is either the point at which a stat stops providing a particular benefit but continues to provide others, or the point beyond which a temporarily active &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; will push the stat over a hard cap. For an example of the first, a &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; rating of 689 is sufficient to eliminate the chance of a boss getting a critical hit against you, so further defense will not have any effect on your chance to be critically hit, but will still increase your chance to parry, dodge, block and be missed by attacks. For an example of the second, a character with a &lt;a href=\"Needle-Encrusted%20Scorpion\"&gt;Needle-Encrusted Scorpion&lt;/a&gt; will occasionally get 678 bonus armor penetration rating. If the character has 732 base rating, this will be sufficient to temporarily reach the hard cap of 1400 noted above. Further base rating will cause some of the Scorpion's bonus to be wasted. However, the additional rating will still provide a benefit when the Scorpion's proc is not active.\nSoft and Hard Caps at Level 80.\nThe following is an overview of some of the rating caps at level 80. It should be noted that caps are often augmented by extraneous factors, such as buffs, talents, or racial abilities. One should therefore consult the main articles for an overview on what the cap may be in any given raid or PvP situation.\nArmor Penetration.\nThe armor penetration hard cap against a raid boss is 1400, which will remove 99.99% armor.\nBlock cap.\nBlock cap refers to when a warrior or paladin tank has enough combined miss, dodge, parry, and block chance to push regular hits off the attack table, meaning that all suffered attacks will either be missed, dodged, parried, or blocked. In The Burning Crusade, this was a vital mechanic for tanks in order to remove crushing blows. In Wrath of the Lich King, raid bosses no longer perform crushing blows, but removing regular hits entirely may still be sought after by tanks. The block cap is against a raid boss is 102.4%, meaning a tank must have a combined 102.4% chance to dodge, parry, block or be missed to push regular hits off the attack table.\nCritical Strike.\nThe crit cap against a raid boss depends on the amount of hit and expertise rating a player has, because higher hit and expertise lessens the chance of an attack missing, or being parried or dodged, thus opening up more room for the attack being a critical strike. Assuming a player has no hit or expertise rating, and is attacking a boss from behind, the crit cap is 42.5% for dual-wield attacks and 61.5% for single-wield attacks. As a player obtains more hit and expertise rating, the cap number increases, but it may never exceed 71%, as there will always be a 24% chance of a glancing blow, and a 5% chance of a crit supression. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow.com/2009/11/11/encrypted-text-armor-penetration-and-the-crit-cap-demystified/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Special attacks may not produce glancing blows, and will as such have an even higher crit cap.\nDefense.\nThe soft defense cap for being uncritable against a raid boss is 540 defense skill, which requires 689 defense rating for a warrior or paladin which is at 400 defense skill with no gear bonuses. Death Knights may attach runes to their weapons which give them defense skill, lowering the required number of defense rating for a Death Knight to reach the soft cap. Uncritability may also be achieved through 5.6% resilience, which requries a resilience rating of 460. Additionally, resilience and defense may be combined to achieve uncritability. Note that defense rating, unlike many other ratings, does not become useless once the cap has been reached, as defense rating will always increase the chance of a block, parry, dodge, or miss.\nExpertise.\nThe soft expertise cap against a raid boss is 26, which is obtained through 214 expertise rating. For heroics and other 5-man instance, this number is lower. The cap number may also be augmented by talents, glyphs (for paladins), and/or orcish, dwarven, or human racial bonuses. For melee dps, the soft cap should be enough, assuming they are attacking the raid boss from behind. Generally only tanks need to worry about the hard cap, which will make them unparriable. The hard expertise cap against a raid boss is 56, which is obtained through 460 expertise rating.\nPhysical Hit.\nThe hard hit cap against a raid boss for all single-wield attacks, ranged attacks, and special dual-wield attacks is 263. The hard hit cap for a dual-wield auto-attack is 886. For heroics and other 5-man instances, this number is lower. The cap number may also be augmented by talents and/or the presence of a Draenei in the raid.\nResilience.\nThe current resilience soft cap in PvP is 1415, which will reduce damage from a critical strike by 33%. Exceeding this number is not wasted, however, as higher resilience will reduce the chance of being critically hit. \nSpell Hit.\nThe hard hit cap against a raid boss for all spells is 446. For heroics and other 5-man instances, this number is lower. The cap number may also be augented by talents, debuffs on the target, and/or the presence of a Draenei in the raid."}

The city was built by the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;ian nobles at the time in which the kingdom was fracturing, and became the city-state and capital of a kingdom based in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; that emerged after the fall of the Arathorian Empire. The city was the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the center of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity before its fall during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nDuring the decadency of the &lt;a href=\"Arathorian%20Empire\"&gt;Arathorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding lands were settled by the disenfranchised lords of the empire capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, who were part of a group that left the city because they were desirous of the verdant and fertile lands to the northwest. They named their new home Lordaeron, after the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;surrounding region&lt;/a&gt; which itself had been named after the great Arathorian general &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt; who had once lived there. It was also home to deeply religious ascetics who believed in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Many people traveled to the city-state seeking wisdom, enlightenment, or cures for their ailments. As it grew into a proper kingdom, the noble families renamed its heart Capital City.\nThe city was first an industrial center for the nation, but later, most of the industries were moved east to the new cities of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, so Capital City became solely an administrative center and was largely remodeled as a wonder of human architecture. But despite its beauty, the city's walls were also sturdy and well-defended, and no foe ever breached them until modern times.\nSecond War.\nThe city was the center of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and so prospered as the effective capital of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. It provided the most soldiers of any kingdom to the Alliance and successfully repelled the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that renegade &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and sailors were interrogated and revealed the treachery of their kingdom. The city itself was later &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; during the war.\nCapital City also had its own cathedral, where &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; met for the first time.\nThird War and aftermath.\nWhen Prince Arthas killed his father, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas II&lt;/a&gt;, the city fell into turmoil. At Arthas' command, &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into the city and killed its inhabitants. After the massacre of its citizens and its destruction, the city soon came to be called the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral months after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, detachments of the surviving &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the rubble of the Lordaeron to form a resistance against the Scourge and to protect those who fled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, recaptured by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Force\"&gt;Crippling Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Defenders of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Circle of Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; guarded the ruined &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20palace%20gardens\"&gt;Lordaeron palace gardens&lt;/a&gt;, respectively under the command of &lt;a href=\"Dagren%20the%20Orcslayer\"&gt;Dagren the Orcslayer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halahk%20the%20Lifebringer\"&gt;Halahk the Lifebringer&lt;/a&gt;. However, their combined efforts were not enough, as they were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; on their return from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the Scourge to murder the survivors and destroyed the resistance. After his victory, Arthas ousted the dreadlords of the ruined city and named himself &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;King of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; recalled Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar took control over the city once again. The combined forces of Grand Marshal Garithos and Sylvanas Windrunner defeated Balnazzar, at which point Sylvanas betrayed her &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; and took the city for herself. The &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, which lies beneath the ruins of the city, became the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; until it was plagued and made uninhabitable during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Siege of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;."}

The captain-rank are also used within many militaristic organizations serving as the commander of some sort of troop unit, especially in navies. In rare cases the captain is even the leader of an entire organization.\nIn \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II%20ranks\"&gt;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", it is a rank that can be achieved by the player. Likewise, \"&lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28title%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Knight-Captain\"&gt;Knight-Captain&lt;/a&gt;\" are titles that players can achieve in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nList of captains, by organization.\nThe following list includes all organizations who are known to have employed captains of any kind, with descriptions of their distinct roles in each organization. Note that the named captains listed here are added to the organization in which they served as captain, not necesarily their current affiliation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt;, and other land soldiers of the human kingdoms (most notably the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;) were commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;captains&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom accompanied crown prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance navy consists of both aerial and naval forces - every vessel is under the command of a specific captain, holding authority over &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, ensigns, &lt;a href=\"sailor\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"deckhand\"&gt;deckhand&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;s. Air ships are controlled by sky captains, while the captains of the aquatic fleet are simply called captains. The captains are sometimes, but not always, under the command of an &lt;a href=\"admiral%20%28rank%29\"&gt;admiral&lt;/a&gt;.\nValiance Expedition.\nThe captains of ground forces in the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; seem to be among the top secondary leaders in the expedition. The sub-organization &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; is even led by a captain. The High Captain is a Sky Captain presumably granted expanded authority, responsibilities, and resources for their disposal.\n&lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaptains of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; include members of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt;, as well as captains working outside the city, but within the borders of the kingdom. The title of Watch Captain is a unique promotion for Guard Parker.\n&lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Gilneas employ Knight-Captains and ordinary Captains in the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20military\"&gt;Gilnean military&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe captain of Stromgarde propably leads the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Militia\"&gt;Stromgarde Militia&lt;/a&gt;, and presumably answers to the King of Stromgarde.\n&lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20of%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Admiralty of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nKul Tiras associate the title with both ship-commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; and commanding figures in the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Admiralty\"&gt;Proudmoore Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; and the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt;. When a Kul Tiran becomes captain of their own vessel, they are gifted a spyglass worked with precious gems.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIronforge Captains are commanding land units.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomeregan Captains are commanding land units.\n&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Telmor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;'s guards are commanded by a Captain of the Guard.\n&lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Captains of the Sons command land units\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Orgrimmar captains of both land forces, aerial and aquatic vessels share the same title, simply \"Captain\". Raider Captains presumably command &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the Dragonmaw Clan seem to call &lt;a href=\"netherwing\"&gt;netherwing&lt;/a&gt;-riders \"Captains\".\n&lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilgewater Cartel captains command &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; transport vessels for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while Labor Captains are in charge of gathering ground ressources.\n&lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; seem to have both Captains and Ranger Captains in their ranks.\n&lt;a href=\"Undercity%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; use the title for both &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt; and commanders of vessels in the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Fleet\"&gt;Windrunner Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Dread-Captains and War-Captains presumably hold higher authority.\n&lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; and ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; organizations.\nAncient laws forbid anyone but a Captain of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; to receive power of their order. Aspirants must undergo the \"rite of the captain\", traditionally patrolling the labyrinths for 3 weeks without rest.\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; and troll tribes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, answering to the God King, are organized in ship crews commanded by captains.\nOther factions.\n&lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackwater Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost Steamwheedle Cartel captains are part of the &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;-based Blackwater Raiders, and are in charge of ships used for either transportation or warfare. \n&lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese two organizations have entered into a partnership, and one captain of the Buccaneers are aiding the Brotherhood.\n&lt;a href=\"Dread%20Crew\"&gt;Dread Crew&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; Dread Crew is led by their Dread Captain."}

He later received help from an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, sent by Gryan Stoutmantle to support his investigation. As he and his men have noticed a rise in violent acts amongst the homeless, he suspected that something or someone was getting them all riled up, and ordered the adventurer to find any evidence that would allow them to trace the source of the pamphlets distributed by a group of thugs recently arrived in the town.\nDuring their research, Alpert and the adventurer discovered that the person in charge of the propaganda against the kingdom was a certain \u201cV\u201d, which made him think of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, but he confirmed that the latter had been dead for years. He subsequently ordered the adventurer to attend the meeting of the \u201cShadowy figure\u201d to retrieve information, as the homeless were starting to mobilize in the town.

{"id": "528440", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=528440", "title": "Captain Fareeya", "text": "Captain Fareeya is a &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; and high-ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. As one of &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s chief lieutenants, Fareeya is responsible for issuing orders to the army, as well as commanding forces in the field. She is also personally in charge of a small unit of elite Lightforged champions, some of the best the Army of the Light has to offer.\nFareeya, along with the other Lightforged, waged a millennia-long war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; home planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. They took part in the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; alongside forces from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to bring a permanent end to the Burning Crusade.\nIn the wake of the final victory on Argus, the Army of the Light would pledge their support to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and continue to operate and train more Lightforged draenei from the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nArmy of the Light.\nFareeya lived on the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, home of the original &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race, at the time of its fall to the fallen &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Fareeya herself served in a military capacity, with &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Atalaa\"&gt;Commander Atalaa&lt;/a&gt; as her second-in-command.\nThough many of the eredar would join their leaders &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; in pledging their loyalty to Sargeras, Fareeya was part of a smaller group (later known as the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;) that chose to side with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. Velen's followers made a desperate escape from their homeworld through the benevolent &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; named the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". Before fleeing the planet, Fareeya had the blacksmith &lt;a href=\"Gaal\"&gt;Gaal&lt;/a&gt; create an elaborate key to secure the &lt;a href=\"Armory%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Armory of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, which he forged from a pristine &lt;a href=\"argunite\"&gt;argunite&lt;/a&gt; crystal. The armory was locked, and the last time Fareeya saw her, Atalaa was leading a force to secure it. Atalaa succeeded in her mission but died at some point afterward, her spirit eternally focused on guarding the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Armor of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; within. Unlike Fareeya, Gaal did not make it to the \"Genedar\" but would survive as one of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elite soldiers of the draneei, including Fareeya, would eventually part ways from the other exiles aboard another ship called the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" with the naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; across the cosmos. They became known as the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and were infused with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, becoming immortal &lt;a href=\"Lightforged\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt;.\nFareyaa would thus command Lightforged forces in combat and secure numerous small-scale victories against the Legion. Despite the cunning and tenacity with which they fought the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, however, they could not stop them alone, and were losing the war by the time of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows of Argus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; coordinated one final assault with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; homeworld of Argus. As the Azerothian forces arrived aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" to rendezvous with the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\", the latter was struck down by heavy Legion artillery and crashed into the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;. Fareeya, and the other leadership of the Army of the Light, would survive the crash and establish small bases in the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Fields\"&gt;Shattered Fields&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;ally&lt;/a&gt; made contact with the survivors of the crash, they were ambushed by the powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taraafash\"&gt;Taraafash&lt;/a&gt;. Fareeya herself struck from behind, however, slaying the &lt;a href=\"eredar%20brute\"&gt;eredar brute&lt;/a&gt;. She then briefed the High Exarch on their situation. Working with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; from Azeroth, she also directed efforts to salvage resources from the wreckage of the \"Xenedar\" and worked to defeat &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Raalgar\"&gt;High Inquisitor Raalgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the operations in Krokuun, Fareeya boarded the \"Vindicaar\" with the other leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. There, she fully reunited her unit of elite troops including &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Y%27mera\"&gt;Archmage Y'mera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Vindicator%20Sorvos\"&gt;Grand Vindicator Sorvos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baraat%20the%20Longshot\"&gt;Baraat the Longshot&lt;/a&gt;. As the search for the pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; continued, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; took Fareeya and her troops with him to the region of &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; to seek the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Conservatory%20of%20the%20Arcane\"&gt;Conservatory of the Arcane&lt;/a&gt;, the group was ambushed by a massive force of demons, with Velen himself cut off from Fareeya and the main forces. But &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; arrived with reinforcements and later rescued the Prophet. At the same time, Fareeya headed an effort to rescue her soldiers cut off in the field. The Crest of Knowledge would ultimately be secured, and the Crown of the Triumvirate restored.\nWhen the time came to launch the final assault on &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Captain Fareeya was one of the front line commanders, as the Army pushed through the demonic fortress. From the \"Vindicaar\", they were able to hold the line against the Legion long enough for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;other forces&lt;/a&gt; to eventually bring about the imprisonment of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, thereby ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Fareeya returned triumphant with the other victors on board the \"Vindicaar\", leaving Argus behind and finally having completed their ancient mission.\nNew causes.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the victory over the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Fareeya and the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; maintained their new headquarters on the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\". They continued to train and initiate new &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as Lightforged, the progress of whom was overseen by Fareeya personally.\nIn the lead-up to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; would pledge the allegiance of the Lightforged, who desired to fight for and alongside their kin once more, to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Captain Fareeya herself deeply approved of this course of action.\nShe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nSpeculation.\nFareeya may have earned her title, \"The Crescent Glaive\", from her proficiency with her weaponry."}

On the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, a number of them were stationed on the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Promenade\"&gt;Lightning Promenade&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting the heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to defeat them and prove their worth to the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the prelates were still devoted as ever to the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Prelate%20Rata\"&gt;High Prelate Rata&lt;/a&gt; who served as the \"Will of Rezan\", and ensuring the protection of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. They are also members of the &lt;a href=\"Rastari\"&gt;Rastari&lt;/a&gt;, the elite military group of the empire.\nWhen Rezan was killed during the confrontation against the traitor &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the prelates were cut off from his power. Without the Loa of Kings, they began to despair as their life is one of devotion, and without him they don't know what to do and especially what they will become. However, a handful of prelates were able to keep any sort of their powers, but according to their leader Rata, they were considered as suspects for this.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign\"&gt;War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, a number of prelates were stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Outpost\"&gt;Fallen Outpost&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. In order to create a diversion for the siege of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, heroes of the Alliance were sent by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to kill the prelated and Zandalari soldiers in the outpost. The Alliance troops managed to repel them and take temporary control of the outpost.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, a number of prelates were sent to protect the city and King Rastakhan from the Alliance invaders. Led by the Champion of Light &lt;a href=\"Ra%27wani%20Kanae\"&gt;Ra'wani Kanae&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to use &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt; through their faith for the loa, placing them among those who managed to keep their powers after the death of Rezan. Following the regicide of Rastakhan, the prelates served as the guards of the body during the King's funeral.\nWhen the time came for &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; to succeed his father, High Prelate Rata and her prelates came to support her to undergo the rite of queens and kings. However, dissidents led by &lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;the White Widow&lt;/a&gt; rose up in protest of a priest of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; becoming their queen, and then created chaos among the priesthoods in the capital. In response, Talanji and her allies evacuated the innocent priests and prelates from the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Terrace of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, and made the priests and prelates listen to reason, allowing them to bend the knee and live if they accepted to have been wrong and to remain faithful to the princess. However not all chose to accept and instead fought to the death for their opinions, among them was &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Kaj%27ra\"&gt;Prelate Kaj'ra&lt;/a&gt;, the former second in command of the prelates and the ringleader of the current uprising in the holy order. Considering this to be &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;heresy&lt;/a&gt; to their values \u200b\u200band duties, High Prelate Reta sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to eliminate Kaj'ra and her followers.\nFollowing the ascension of Talanji, the prelates pledged themselves to the new Queen of the Zandalar Empire, and Rata joined the new &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, in hope to serve as a voice of faith."}

They claimed its highest peaks and built crude shrines which, over the years, eventually became the massive temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Zandalari are scholarly and value knowledge above all else. They also work to preserve troll history and to further the goals of troll society as a whole. They are masters of magic and communing with the &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s,\nZandalari history had them &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;fight off&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, ally with the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;fight&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; explore the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, enslave the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; race, and fight &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; twice.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari prophet &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his followers traveled around the world to unite all trolls and build a united troll empire. Zul's &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; resurrected &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and allied with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; once more, to launch an assault on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; led to the Zandalari Empire allying with and later joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. This war also saw the Empire's home of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;besieged&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the death of their king &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, who had ruled over the empire for centuries.\nAppearance and traits.\nUp until \"&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1.0\"&gt;Rise of the Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;\", most Zandalari appeared as skinny pinkish-white trolls. In \"Cataclysm\" they were given a re-skinned &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; model and had a larger build than before, with a yellowish-tan skin. This new look was used for their appearance until &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt; where it was updated once more. Their newest appearance has them standing upright with skin colors ranging from gray, black, green, and blue, accompanied by glowing eyes in the color of yellow or blue. This new design is how Blizzard always envisioned them. The Zandalari received another model update in \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" when they became playable. This kept their \"Mists of Pandaria\" design but updated their animations to match the quality of player races, and also introduced female Zandalari with the \"Mists\" design.\nZandalari have been mentioned to have fur on their neck, though it is unknown if it covers their body akin to the hair like fur of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Most Zandalari are seen with scale-like patches on various areas of their bodies, such as; feet, ankles, shins, thighs, waist, back, shoulders, chin, cheeks, brows, scalp, biceps, forearms, and hands, locations appear to vary between individuals. However not all Zandalari have these patches and retain a smoother appearance. The patches of scales most Zandalari have can also grow into spikes. It is unknown what they truly are, though it is possible that they are s, bony deposits that form scales, plates, and even spikes. Many dinosaurs are known to have had osteoderms.\nThe Zandalari's third toe, or \"heel toe\", is less prominent on males than it is on females. It is especially prominent on both male and female Zandalari &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s, of which males are also sometimes seen wearing rings around their heel toes as accessories.\nMany male Zandalari stand a head taller than an upright jungle troll on average, most even more. And even short males tend to be taller. Female Zandalari stand taller than male and female trolls from other subgroup, excluding &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, the Zandalari generally stand tall because of their regal and proud attitude.\nThe Zandalari are considered the finest specimen of all troll tribes, with their royal stature and being the original trolls. There is an incident where a human calls them the \"&lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; of trolls\", much to their immense offense. Their exquisite beauty and elegance were inherited by their elven descendants - the night elves, the high elves and the blood elves.\nThe Zandalari boast incredible strength; being able to easily lift jungle trolls with both hands and are capable of puncturing through scale-armored breastplates padded with lacquered leather and quilted silk using only their thumbs. They are also strong enough to lift other Zandalari with one hand.\nCulture and people.\nZandalari society has remained an unchanging hierarchy for thousands of years. Hardworking farmers, fishers, and craftsmen form the peasant caste, the foundation of the empire. Zandalari elders tell them what to harvest, when to plant, and how to behave. To disobey the elders is to disobey the gods, an offense punishable by exile or death. The Zandalari warrior caste sits above the peasantry, acting as the arms of the King and the might of the council. Dexterity is not prized among Zandalari warriors: Brute force, backed by ancient magics, is the preferred combat style. Dictating every aspect of Zandalari society down to the very last detail are the scholars of the priesthood. Masters of magic and communing with the spirits, these respected bastions of knowledge stand upon fifteen millennia worth of accumulated knowledge. The highest of these have a seat on the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, which both advise the King and ensures his every command is executed upon. The council is consulted before every battle or major decision. From a golden throne, lording over all of the Zandalari, rests the great King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. Empowered by the Zandalari gods themselves to act as their voice, he has ruled for over two hundred years. Zandalar's rulers are generally notoriously long-lived. As such new coronations happen only every few centuries. Claiming the throne is the Zandalari's most sacred rite, with the would-be ruler's spirit being weighed and measured by the loa themselves.\nCitizens might request a direct audience with the current king or queen, but the waiting line could be made up of more than four hundred citizens at a time, resulting in lines lasting for days. More &lt;a href=\"Desperate%20Citizen\"&gt;desperate citizens&lt;/a&gt; might try pleading with the &lt;a href=\"Natal%27hakata\"&gt;current voice of the king&lt;/a&gt; in order to speed things up.\nCasteless orphan children are tested for any sign of connection to the loa. Those blessed by the loa receive full priest training and all of the honor and privilege that accompanies it. Those that are not blessed are given an opportunity to prove they will grow into strong warriors someday. Those that fail both tests are of no use to the Zandalari and are likely to end up as thieves or beggars.\nBeing a Zandalari farmer apparently involves taking the \"rock test\" by lifting heavy stones above one's head and show that one's back is strong, after which one gets a job pushing plow living on dirt.\nThere is no room for weakness among the Zandalari. Strength, ferocity, stamina, power: These are the traits by which success is measured. At adolescence, those Zandalari males not chosen to be priests or scholars must prove their strength to the council, the king, and the gods themselves. Any display of physical power will do. Tournaments and competitions are held as children come of age. Adolescents prepare for their trials with years of training, communion with the spirits, and by tattooing sigils of power onto their skin. A common rite is to travel to one of the violent, beast-ruled islands near the &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; to steal or subdue a wild creature. The lesser troll races have their own, humbler versions of this tradition. But the mastery of &lt;a href=\"ravasaur\"&gt;ravasaur&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s is nothing compared to the power required to call upon a &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ultimate symbol of power amongst the Zandalari is the garb they wear in battle, and the tribe acknowledges station and power through what the Zandalari wear. The Zandalar prize what they wear as a symbol of accomplishment. One doesn't need to be able to see what one wears to be able to sense what emanates from it - power transcends sight.\nThe Zandalari, during the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; that had turned &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; into an island, mastered the seas over thousands of years and as such their navy rivals, if not surpasses that of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The master of the Zandalari navy is &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; loa.\nTheir cloth features dinosaur leather and gold.\n&lt;a href=\"Preserved%20Night%20Elf%20Head\"&gt;Preserved night elf heads&lt;/a&gt; are an esteemed home decoration and children's toy in Zuldazar. &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Troll%20Berserker\"&gt;Golden Troll Berserker&lt;/a&gt;s are common children's toys.\nZandalari legends discuss the many magical properties of plants that grow from &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seeds\"&gt;golden seeds&lt;/a&gt;.\nPractitioners of alchemy among the Zandalari kept a tight society within the empire known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Zan\"&gt;Shadra'Zan&lt;/a&gt;\". Entrance into the guild included a ritual which would require the inductee to imbibe a potion made from their own blood. Should they withstand the effects, they were deemed worthy to learn the secrets kept within.\nOnce a generation, the greatest &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s from all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; come to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt; to challenge one another in combat. This is an ancient rite long presided over by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. They fight for the glory of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. To win is one of the greatest honors to which a troll can aspire. With Rastakhan's death, it is unknown if the rite will continue.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s used to &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;bury their dead&lt;/a&gt; in burial mounds until the final era of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tribes\"&gt;Council of Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;blood plague&lt;/a&gt; broke out, killing thousands of trolls. It was deemed that the bodies, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be handled by &lt;a href=\"Troll%20golem\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt;, cremated, and kept in special urns. As time progressed, this method became commonplace among the Zandalari in disposing of their dead. This marked the end of the now non-existent caste whose purpose was to handle and protect the remains of Zandalar's former rulers. Not all are cremated, however. Royalty and the most respected trolls are taken to &lt;a href=\"Kings%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kings' Rest&lt;/a&gt; where some of them are kept as &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaptors are the favored companions of Zandalari Kings and are mummified and buried alongside their masters, so they can carry them through the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;afterlife&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaired tusk rings are commonly exchanged in Zandalari weddings.\nTheir blood color is crimson.\nThe children of Zandalari who were banished to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; used to be exiled alongside their parents, but this is no longer the case.\nFaith.\nThe Zandalari worship beings referred to as &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. Countless loa exist, most weak, but some very powerful. Most are shapeless, whereas others have animal or creature forms. Zandalari families often worship their own family loa, cities usually have their own civic deities, and the greatest loa are worshiped by the nation as a whole. Powerful, enlightened Zandalari can become loa upon their death - or so it is believed. These spirits are central to the Zandalari worldview: so say the loa, so go the Zandalari. As such, the faithful (&lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt;s) are among the most revered in Zandalari society.\nThe homeland of the Zandalari, &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, was once a mountain range on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that was home to many loa. It was there that the Zandalari built their bustling capital of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, a temple city. Following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalar is now a large island located in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trolls of the desert who worship &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; use &lt;a href=\"blowgun\"&gt;blowgun&lt;/a&gt;s to hunt their prey, be it beast, or troll. The poison the darts were dipped in would paralyze their prey, and within a minute, kill them. \"The Sting of Sethraliss\" was whispered to children in order to keep them in line, as was written in an ancient poem: \"Should the young turn defiant, show anger or malice, the winds of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; will bring the Sting of Sethraliss.\" To honor the loa of death &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, Zandalari would don masks in their rituals and pray to him. Bwonsamdi, in turn, would either answer in kind, or curse them with pain, depending on his mood.\nThroughout the ages, many kings have ruled over the Zandalari empire. Each one, however, knew their place when it came to the great loa and offered their praise to the mightiest of all of them, &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of Kings. This loa honors deeds over words, but takes slights very seriously and had been known to harbor grudges.\nThe Zandalari believe that &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; brings the spirits of any who worship him into his realm; the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt;. \nSlavery.\nThe Zandalari are above the use of slaves, they are strong and capable of seeing to themselves. And as such, the sight of slavery within their city is insulting to them. Additionally, they see the usage of slaves as a sign of weakness. Thus, when they met the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;\u2013who built their empire with slaves\u2013over 12,000 years ago, they saw themselves above the slavers.\nDespite this, shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and up until they rebelled 100 years before the Dark Portal, they did enslave the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. This discrepancy was not addressed.\nClasses.\nZandalari classes vary from regular ones in names and in several aspects.\nThe greatest Zandalari &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s travel to the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; to prove their resolution. From the heart of the sea, they pull strands of kelp known as Maelstrom Tendrils. The kelp is then woven into a talisman that is enchanted to improve their accuracy and power.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; are Zandalari trolls &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, also known as &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt;s, that served &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; as the highest order of holy warriors to serve any &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. After Rezan's death, the prelates were cut off from his power except for a handful of his followers. However, even with the Loa of Kings gone, his ideals remained. The prelates chose to lead those who are lost, and through their faith for the loa, to stand as a beacon of light against the darkness.\nThe Zandalari &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s are primarily composed of the &lt;a href=\"Raptari\"&gt;Raptari&lt;/a&gt;, the followers of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a small group living in the wilds called the &lt;a href=\"Lun%27alai\"&gt;Lun'alai&lt;/a&gt;, but they are considered heretics, and the matron they follow is not considered a true loa by the other Zandalari.\nBeast taming.\nThe Zandalari are known and regarded for their ability to tame even the most powerful of beasts. Including\u2013but not limited to\u2013&lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skyscreamer\"&gt;skyscreamer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOne of their greatest allies is that of the direhorn. Plated skin, with spikes protruding from various directions, this creature offered both protection for itself and that of its master. It was custom for its future master to be the first to see it when it broke free from its shell. All the beasts that haul their goods, carry their armies, and fight their wars are born and bred at &lt;a href=\"Warbeast%20Kraal\"&gt;Warbeast Kraal&lt;/a&gt; in Zuldazar.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; however, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Ward\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Ward&lt;/a&gt; resorted to ancient ways of magically breaking the animals with the aid of charms and fetishes, due to their lack of time to bond with them.\nMagic.\nThe Zandalari are quick learners and carry out tasks well. Having mastered the usage of magic and communing with the spirits. Zandalari priests and mages wield magic with incredible power and utilize forbidden knowledge whilst being backed up by at least fifteen millennia of accumulated knowledge due to the scholarly nature of their culture.\nWith their mastery over spirits, they can capture and entomb spirits within golems and sentries. They can also channel the essence of a &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit into powerful constructs. Likewise they have totems to retrieve the spirits bound within golems by siphoning them out, called \"soulcatcher totems\".\nBecause of their incredible mastery over magic, the Zandalari were able to erect a powerful shield around the lands of their empire as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded and broke &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; apart. They had hoped to shield the rest of the continent but did not have the time to extend past their own borders, beyond the shield they watched the world be consumed by water. In the aftermath, they discovered that their lands had become an island.\nThey mastered, honed, and perfected the &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; arts. The true origin of voodoo magic is unknown yet it is likely that it originated from the Zandalari.\nZandalari casters, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Loa%20Speaker%20%28Isle%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Loa Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s utilize their faith in the loa to bestow incredible powers upon their weaponry, as well as their bestial companions. Items and animals empowered this way are referred to as \"Loa-Infused\". Loa-Infused items are often passed down through generations, with each generation adding more power to the item. Two such items are: &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Spirit-Caller\"&gt;Mask of the Spirit-Caller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Dark%20Mystic\"&gt;Mask of the Dark Mystic&lt;/a&gt; having belonged to two Zandalari brothers, &lt;a href=\"Spiritbinder%20Tu%27chek\"&gt;Spiritbinder Tu'chek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcanital%20Ra%27kul\"&gt;Arcanital Ra'kul&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThey have an impressive mastery over the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;, having achieved what many others have not as they are able to combine the two schools into one. A unique feat that only the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization is also known to have achieved.\nDuring times of war, the Zandalari faced off against many powerful foes. Some, even, that they could not break. Their &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s devised cursed pots and through the use of powerful magic, summoned them at different locations within the enemy's encampment. Shortly after, a fountain of &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s would spring forth, causing a ruckus and confusing the enemy in the process. Little did they know that these frogs carried a &lt;a href=\"plague\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; with them that would quickly devastate their ranks and force them to retreat or surrender.\nThe Zandalari have been known to use &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, however &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; forbade the use of it after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; had broken the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Likely due to knowing how corrupting the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s' use of it is because of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;'s influence. Blood magic is described by &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt; as being from the \"old\" ways, despite it only having been banned around the year of 28. &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Cultist\"&gt;Blood cultists&lt;/a&gt; still operate in secret.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Zandalar tribe is the progenitor tribe from which all other troll tribes sprang. Zandalar has long been the heart of all troll culture throughout the world. Zandalari are their own separate sort of troll \u2014 not jungle trolls, not forest trolls, not ice or dark or sand. (However, several groups of other trolls live on Zandalar, including jungle trolls beneath the canopy and ice trolls on snowy Mount Mugamba.) The Zandalari\u2019s overall goal remains what it always has been: to maintain troll history and continue their research. They also again oppose Hakkar.\nEvery 6 years, Zandalar also plays host to a meeting of all troll tribes. Trolls from all over the world meet in the great ziggurat-city of Zuldazar to discuss matters of importance to all trolls. Zandalar is neutral ground for trolls. Though many tribes don\u2019t get along with each other, they all meet on peaceful terms in Zandalar.\nOrganization.\n&lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, a hoary and formidable witch doctor, rules the Zandalari from his capital of Zuldazar. The Zandalari are mystical and ancient trolls who revere knowledge and history; their organization is loose. They represent an overall priest caste for all trolls, yet they do not attempt to parley this position into real power with those trolls.\nMilitary.\nThe Zandalar tribe is a group of mystical trolls who serve as the priest caste for all other trolls. They have few warriors, and what warriors they do have are dedicated to protecting their home island of Zandalar. Thus, when the Zandalari need people to accomplish tasks in the larger world, they work through agents of other races. Were an unfriendly member of such a race to enter Zandalar, however, he would find himself contending with the Zandalari\u2019s warriors. Though few, they are rumored to be excellent fighters.\nThe Zandalari make their home in the jungle. As such, their warriors prefer to attack from ambush, lurking in the trees\u2019 shadows, in the underbrush, or in the canopy before bursting out to attack. They set themselves up in the wilderness along their enemy\u2019s path well in advance, then leap forward when the time is right. They hurl javelins; then, depending on the reaction, they either continue to fling their weapons, they charge into melee, or they melt back into the shadows to perform the same tactic again.\nMany priests and witch doctors work among the Zandalari, so almost all Zandalar warriors are in possession of a few bottles of brews they can slug back to make themselves stronger, fiercer, or heal their wounds. Zandalar leaders carry many such concoctions and are sure to have witch doctors at their sides who provide them with more. If they expect to go to battle, the trolls drink the brews immediately beforehand, allowing them to crush their enemies with ease.\nIf battle is joined, Zandalar priests and witch doctors support their warriors with enhancement spells and healing in addition to entering the fray directly. Bloodlust and inner fire are particularly devastating \u2014 spells that affect many allies at once. Of course, the spellcasters don\u2019t mind blasting their enemies when the situation calls for it, and Zandalari potion docs spend battles hurling explosive potions into enemy ranks.\nThe few Zandalari warriors take the front lines, though they prefer to soften up the enemy with thrown javelins and axes first. This tactic also allows their spellcasters more time to cast beneficial spells on them before melee is joined. Zandalari warriors are fierce and wild, and they do not often retreat; once a troll throws himself into melee, he isn\u2019t coming back until the enemy\u2019s corpses lie about him.\nZandalar warriors perform other functions as well, including reconnaissance, discovering the best places to set their ambushes. They also harry enemy forces with guerilla tactics, which can make the enemy foolish. Priests and witch doctors help these endeavors with divination magic.\nMembership.\nOne must be born a Zandalari to be part of the tribe, with at least one parent being a Zandalari.\nAveraging eight feet in height, the Zandalari trolls are among the largest, strongest trolls in the world; only the Drakkari ice trolls of Northrend are as big. They are just as ferocious as other trolls, and just as cunning, if not more so.\nA typical Zandalari spends his days hunting in the jungles or fishing along the coastlines. Many spend their days researching ancient lore and cataloging history. Religion is important to the Zandalari \u2014they are the trolls\u2019 priest caste, after all \u2014 and they revere their pantheon of primitive, animalistic gods that take the forms of bats, snakes, and the like. Zandalar priests carve totems and engage in rituals, while Zandalar witch doctors brew potions and administer to wounded trolls. The Zandalari are constantly vigilant against invaders."}

Their language is largely syllabic, and various syllables can be added to the beginning or end of a troll's name to denote status and ability.

The Zangar sea, and thus the Zangar encroachment, was created from the rotting body of the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne strain of fungus in particular is especially prevalent in Draenor's fungal ecosystem, causing &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Hadley%20Ricard\"&gt;Dr. Hadley Ricard&lt;/a&gt; to name it Zangarium Draenormycota. It is highly adaptable, can be found on many of the living organisms throughout &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Shore\"&gt;Zangar Shore&lt;/a&gt;, and is believed to be unique to Draenor. Dr. Ricard also believes that gaining an understanding of the fungal strains in relation to the local ecology will teach a great deal about the various species on Draenor.\nSimilar to the plant-based &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;, the Zangar encroachment has the ability to infest land-dwelling creatures with spores, turning them into mindless fungal slaves, as can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Fen\"&gt;Crimson Fen&lt;/a&gt;. In southern &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, the land is being overtaken by the mushrooms that grow underwater, and as a result, strange fungal creatures are sprouting up in the area. &lt;a href=\"Pinchwhistle%20Point\"&gt;Pinchwhistle Point&lt;/a&gt; was overwhelmed by the fungus and most of its inhabitants were infested; however, managed to find a cure.\nAfter Draenor shattered into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Zangar encroachment eventually bloomed into the &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nEven though the encroachments appear to employ the same manner of infecting victims with spores as the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; (as can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Fen\"&gt;Crimson Fen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pinchwhistle%20Point\"&gt;Pinchwhistle Point&lt;/a&gt;), the two groups do not appear to be allied with one another, since &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen fighting &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s on the northern coast of ; in fact, rumor has it that podlings are extremely allergic to the spores of fungal giants. However, there is &lt;a href=\"Leaf-Reader%20Kurri\"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; to believe that the podlings were eventually transformed into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s, likely due to fungal infection.\nSince most Primals appear to have vanished from Draenor after its destruction, with the exception of a few &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20ancient\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s, but plenty of fungal creatures remain in the Zangarmarsh, it is probably safe to assume that the fungi were victorious in the end.\nThe Zangar fungi spawned from a Sporemound, one of the rulers of the prehistoric Evergrowth that the Primals also sprang from. Why the fungi seemed to turn on their former allies is unclear, but it was possibly due to the collapse of the Evergrowth's hivemind."}

Though largely teeming with life, sections of the swamp have begun to die of late, and the sapient fungi of the region seek help in returning it to life. This zone is located in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to the west of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe marshes are the home of myriad varieties of predatory invertebrates and flora, including &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sporebat\"&gt;sporebat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nZangarmarsh was formerly a sea called . The sea, and thus the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;Zangar encroachment&lt;/a&gt;, was created from the rotting body of the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;. Early marshes existed along the coast of the sea. Similar mushroom forests dotted the landscapes of all realms of Draenor. Notable examples include the &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen\"&gt;Umbrafen&lt;/a&gt; in and &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; (a forest known as &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; in Outland).\nSeemingly having a mind of its own, the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;Zangar encroachment&lt;/a&gt; sought to overtake the land by releasing thousands of spores and slowly growing inland over time. This seems to explain how Zangarmarsh eventually came to be. Zangarra was the source of the bloom that would become Zangarmarsh.\nRise of the Horde.\nIt was the place where &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and his surviving followers hid after the orcish genocide and waited until their raid on the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\"; presumably it was either the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Shore\"&gt;Zangar Shore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt;, as they were the two closest marshes to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. It was also where &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; led his own followers after the fall of Shattrath, though it seems he and his people later moved east to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; where they built the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Village\"&gt;Draenei Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther hiding individuals in the marsh included the draenei child &lt;a href=\"Leena\"&gt;Leena&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt; orc &lt;a href=\"Jaruk%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;Jaruk Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point, either because of fel corruption, because of Draenor shattering, or because of the aforementioned intention to overtake the land, the Zangar Sea was transformed into a swamp that is known now as the Zangarmarsh.\nIn World of Warcraft, Zangarmarsh's history is strengthened using other areas in Outland, also somewhat continuing the story about &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III, Illidan, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; managed to seize the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;. As part of his conquest, Illidan &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;closed down&lt;/a&gt; several &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s used by by Magtheridon to bring &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. In World of Warcraft, it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Clearing\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of these gateways was actually located in Zangarmarsh.\nIllidan was originally planning to hide in the Black Temple from &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; after failing &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;his task&lt;/a&gt; of killing the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. It was, apparently, still an easy feat for Kil'jaeden to find him, and he offered Illidan a second chance to destroy the throne. After Illidan failed his task once more, Kael'thas and Vashj picked up his beaten and unconscious body with them as they fled back to Outland. Kael'thas decided eventually to turn away from Illidan and join Kil'jaeden, but Vashj stayed loyal. She and most of her forces, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;, settled in Zangarmarsh where they began to drain its waters, collecting it in the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. Their exact reason for doing this is somewhat unclear; one theory is that they're attempting to control Outland's sparse amount of water - another is that they're planning to make a new &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. They have constructed large pumping-machines on all the major lakes in Zangarmarsh; &lt;a href=\"Marshlight%20Lake\"&gt;Marshlight Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Lake\"&gt;Serpent Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen%20Village\"&gt;Umbrafen Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lagoon\"&gt;The Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; and the lake that was once at the now &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead%20Mire\"&gt;Dead Mire&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Vashj herself is &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;the final raid boss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Before Kael'thas turned away from Illidan, he sent him five blood elves to train as &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. The training was rather harsh, and &lt;a href=\"Varedis\"&gt;only one&lt;/a&gt; succeeded. Three others died, and the &lt;a href=\"Leotheras%20the%20Blind\"&gt;last one&lt;/a&gt; became insane. He somehow ended up in Serpentshrine Cavern where he is a boss as well.\nZangarmarsh is also facing danger from the &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20tribe\"&gt;Ango'rosh tribe&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Gorefist\"&gt;Overlord Gorefist&lt;/a&gt;. They are likely coming from the northern &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and are for some reason cutting down the giant mushrooms. By destroying the &lt;a href=\"Hewn%20Bog\"&gt;Hewn Bog&lt;/a&gt;, they've destroyed the food source of the &lt;a href=\"fungal%20giant\"&gt;fungal giant&lt;/a&gt;s which now are going to &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Glen\"&gt;Spawning Glen&lt;/a&gt; to feed on the young &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s instead, much to the dismay of &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; draining the waters and the &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20tribe\"&gt;Ango'rosh tribe&lt;/a&gt; cutting off the mushrooms for their own needs the ecology of the marsh is being severely affected, if the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; doesn't act quickly the marsh could be destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; has also marked their presence here, somewhat being the third major organization after the naga and ogres to threaten the marsh. However, unlike the Twilight's Hammer-forces which worship &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the ones found in Zangarmarsh seems to be some kind of subgroup worshiping &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;. Each year, during the &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt;, they're trying to summon the frost lord &lt;a href=\"Ahune\"&gt;Ahune&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; inside the Coilfang Reservoir. Ahune is supposed to enter Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and fight Ragnaros on the other side, creating an elemental war which will \"rend the foundations\" of Azeroth and make it \"a frozen paradise\". Ahune's summoning within the Slave Pens is conducted by &lt;a href=\"Skar%27this%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Skar'this the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; - \"Heretic of Neptulon\" , a naga which seems to previously have been among Lady Vashj's forces. Both Ahune and Skar'this are killed by the player as part of the festival before they get to destroy Azeroth.\nInterestingly, there are few traits of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in Zangarmarsh. In fact, it is the Outland zone which has suffered the least of its corruption. The marsh is however inhabited by several &lt;a href=\"lost%20one\"&gt;lost one&lt;/a&gt;s - draenei heavily corrupted by demonic magic. The ones in Zangarmarsh are members of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfen\"&gt;Daggerfen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralfen\"&gt;Feralfen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen%20tribe\"&gt;Umbrafen&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The lost ones in Feralfen are worshiping &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;. One of the few (if not the only) demons in the marsh is a &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Xeleth\"&gt;Xeleth&lt;/a&gt; who once was worshiped as a god by primitive swamp creatures. When Draenor was sundereded he retreated into a slumber deep below Marshlight Lake, close to the dimensional gate in Zangarmarsh. As seen from the &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1.0\"&gt;patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt; trailer, Akama and his followers did also fight a number of demons in Zangarmarsh.\nBoth the Horde and Alliance have established outposts here. The Horde ones, &lt;a href=\"Swamprat%20Post\"&gt;Swamprat Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zabra%27jin\"&gt;Zabra'jin&lt;/a&gt;, seem to have been built by the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Alliance ones, &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;, lies atop one of the mushrooms and appears to have been built by &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. The other, &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, are some old draenei ruins ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nZangarmarsh consists of a large expanse of swampland, bordered by mountains to the north, south, and to some extent the east. A long stretch of coastline forms the western edge of the zone. Giant mushrooms are the characteristic feature of the area, towering above the pools of marsh water like great trees.\nZangarmarsh contains four instances all located in the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, one of which is a 25-man raid. This area has no battlegrounds or micro dungeons but has a world PvP zone for a graveyard nearest to the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; entry.\n(Note: as of Feb 03 2008, at least for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the graveyard only works for the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; instance as the distance to instance portals is used instead of the distance to the Coilfang entry).\nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Herb\"&gt;Herb&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Ore\"&gt;Ore&lt;/a&gt;\nMiscellaneous\nDig sites.\nZangarmarsh has two &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn Warcraft.\nWarcraft II.\nNot very much is known about the past history of Zangarmarsh as it was not mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\". Its name does not appear on any Draenor-maps, but the map for the PlayStation version on Warcraft II depicts a large green area where Zangarmarsh is located. Notably, based on this map, it seems Zangarmarsh at that time was the home of the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft III.\nZangarmarsh does not appear in ' either, in which Outland is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The Outland seen in \"Warcraft III\" does however contain a large amount of giant mushrooms, which acts as Outland's \"trees\" (see &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;). It is possible that the giant mushrooms in \"Warcraft III\" were made into Zangarmarsh in \"World of Warcraft\", similar to how the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; was retconned to be in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, it appears that Blizzard used the various features in the \"Warcraft III\" \"Outland-version\" to create new areas in \"World of Warcrafts Outland. The draenei encountered in \"Warcraft III\" were also shown to build their houses of these giant mushrooms (see &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Village\"&gt;Draenei Village&lt;/a&gt;), which is similar to &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\".\nOne particular area in \"World of Warcraft\", &lt;a href=\"Thornfang%20Hill\"&gt;Thornfang Hill&lt;/a&gt;, contains both Zangarmarsh-mushrooms and Hellfire Peninsula-terrain. Thus, it is the Outland-area in \"World of Warcraft\" which is most similar to Outland seen in \"Warcraft III\"."}

Rather, it is meant to show a player the most efficient way to complete all quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the as to your reasoning.\nHorde Questing Guide (LVL 62-65).\nAlthough this guide is designed for the horde, there is a great deal of overlap. In addition, more than half the quests (including the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt; are neutral. This guide does not point out the extremely obvious (that you should turn in as many quests as you can at a given time) and does not include messenger quests (other than ones that lead you to Zangarmarsh). All the quests are listed in order of how the chain can be completed, so as long as you complete each step in order, you shouldn't have to worry about missing pre-requisites. This guide also does not include any class or profession-specific quests. \nBefore You Leave.\nBefore heading to &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, it would be a good idea to wrap up &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few quests that lead you to Zangarmarsh which bear mentioning.\nThese three are easy to come by, &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;Arelion's Mistress&lt;/a&gt; is the only one part of a chain (beginning with &lt;a href=\"Arelion%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Arelion's Journal&lt;/a&gt;). The last two are basic message drops to bring you over. \nGetting There.\nHead directly west out of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and you will find yourself in Zangarmarsh. You can pick up a flight path in &lt;a href=\"Swamprat%20Post\"&gt;Swamprat Post&lt;/a&gt; as well as the first series of quests. You'll also want to head just south to &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Refuge\"&gt;Cenarion Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nUmbrafen Lake Quests.\nThe first main area with quests in &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen%20Lake\"&gt;Umbrafen Lake&lt;/a&gt;, south-west of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of quests available that can all be done in one run.\nWhile you could complete all of these quests on a single run, there are a few that you can keep working on since you will run across their goals later on as well. These are: &lt;a href=\"Thick%20Hydra%20Scales\"&gt;Thick Hydra Scales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plants%20of%20Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Plants of Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"There%27s%20No%20Explanation%20for%20Fashion\"&gt;There's No Explanation for Fashion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Warm%20Welcome\"&gt;A Warm Welcome&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you can wrap up in the Umbrafen Village, you can finish by picking up &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Umbrafen\"&gt;Escape from Umbrafen&lt;/a&gt;, since it takes you pretty much back to the Cenarion Expedition for unloading and turn-in.\nBack at the Cenarion Expedition.\nThe latter requires friendly reputation with the Cenarion Expedition which you should have at this point, but both can be completed immediately and don't require you to leave town (technically you fly away, but you come back).\nThe Southern Lakes and Funggor Cavern.\nThis run has you going back to the steam pump at &lt;a href=\"Umbrafen%20Lake\"&gt;Umbrafen Lake&lt;/a&gt;, then on to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lagoon\"&gt;The Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;, and finishing down in &lt;a href=\"Funggor%20Cavern\"&gt;Funggor Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. All of these quests can be completed on one run, and should be. You will need to finish &lt;a href=\"Thick%20Hydra%20Scales\"&gt;Thick Hydra Scales&lt;/a&gt; before the next run.\nDead Mire and Eastern Serpent Lake.\nThis run will send you north, to the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Mire\"&gt;Dead Mire&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Lake\"&gt;Serpent Lake&lt;/a&gt;. This leg can be a little tricky- Here are some additional notes:\n&lt;a href=\"Searching%20for%20Scout%20Jyoba\"&gt;Searching for Scout Jyoba&lt;/a&gt;: Once you've found his body, he will give you a follow-up quest, &lt;a href=\"Jyoba%27s%20Report\"&gt;Jyoba's Report&lt;/a&gt;. You must then kill &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Giant\"&gt;Withered Giant&lt;/a&gt;s until his report drops (usually pretty fast). They will also drop randomly a quick quest called &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Basidium%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Withered Basidium&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Drain%20Schematics\"&gt;Drain Schematics&lt;/a&gt;: If this didn't drop for you already, it will probably drop off the &lt;a href=\"Bloodscale%20Overseer\"&gt;Bloodscale Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFeralfen Ridge and the West end of the Lagoon.\nIt's time to head towards Zubra'jin.\nThese two are pretty straight forward.\nSpawning Glen and Quagg Ridge.\n... and get started on those loveable little mushrooms, the &lt;a href=\"Sporeling\"&gt;Sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe first quest, &lt;a href=\"Burstcap%20Mushrooms%2C%20Mon%21\"&gt;Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!&lt;/a&gt; is a gathering quest that doesn't have to be complete until you head to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfen%20Village\"&gt;Daggerfen Village&lt;/a&gt;. The final two are repeatable if you want to get reputation with Sporeggar (which isn't too hard- just collect &lt;a href=\"Bog%20Lord%20Tendril\"&gt;Bog Lord Tendril&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mature%20Spore%20Sac\"&gt;Mature Spore Sac&lt;/a&gt;s).\nOnce you've completed &lt;a href=\"Observing%20the%20Sporelings\"&gt;Observing the Sporelings&lt;/a&gt; then do...\nYou will probably run into &lt;a href=\"%22Count%22%20Ungula\"&gt;\"Count\" Ungula&lt;/a&gt;, which can give you &lt;a href=\"The%20Count%20of%20the%20Marshes\"&gt;The Count of the Marshes&lt;/a&gt;, which also turns in to &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Leesa%27oh\"&gt;Watcher Leesa'oh&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"A%20Spirit%20Ally%3F\"&gt;A Spirit Ally?&lt;/a&gt; takes you back to &lt;a href=\"Feralfen%20Village\"&gt;Feralfen Village&lt;/a&gt;, but you can skirt along the southern edge and keep engagements to a minimum.\nWestern Serpent Lake and Hewn Bog.\nYou'll take a nice swim into &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Lake\"&gt;Serpent Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and in the center you can check out the big drain and kill some more hydras. After that, stroll over to the Ogres and finish them up.\nOptional Side Run: Back to Hellfire Peninsula.\nCompleting &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Schematics%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Drain Schematics&lt;/a&gt; means you can go back to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Refuge\"&gt;Cenarion Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in Hellfire Peninsula. You can also grab a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Spirits\"&gt;Cenarion Spirits&lt;/a&gt; and wrap up &lt;a href=\"Arelion%27s%20Mistress\"&gt;Arelion's Mistress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Drain Schematics eventually leads to the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20in%20Action\"&gt;Lost in Action quest&lt;/a&gt;, but is not a prerequisite. In &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Refuge\"&gt;Cenarion Refuge&lt;/a&gt; you'll get &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20the%20Marsh\"&gt;Return to the Marsh&lt;/a&gt; which will send you back and get you the next step.\nCoilfang Reservoir- Slave Pens.\n&lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt; is the first &lt;a href=\"Instance\"&gt;Instance&lt;/a&gt; in Zangarmarsh, and can be run as early as level 61. \nThe two quests are not actually in Slave Pens, but can be done on the way. To finish the Drain Schematic quest line you meet &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Jhang\"&gt;Watcher Jhang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. She gives you the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20in%20Action\"&gt;Lost in Action&lt;/a&gt; which starts in &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt;, and is the only available quest in Slave Pens until you come back at &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Heroic Mode|Heroic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSporeggar.\nYou can repeat &lt;a href=\"The%20Sporelings%27%20Plight\"&gt;The Sporelings' Plight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Enemies\"&gt;Natural Enemies&lt;/a&gt; until you get Neutral with Sporeggar, at which point you can continue with those quests until Friendly, or include these additional quests.\nYou can choose to skip the reputation grind with Sporeggar since the &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Rewards&lt;/a&gt; are not overwhelming, but getting to friendly is not too long and opens up two more quests.\nCoilfang Reservoir- Underbog.\nYou should have already gotten &lt;a href=\"Lost%20in%20Action\"&gt;Lost in Action&lt;/a&gt; and completed the first half in &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pens\"&gt;Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20A%20Shrubbery%21\"&gt;Bring Me A Shrubbery!&lt;/a&gt; is the only one that requires friendly reputation with &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;- the other two should be available at neutral.\nMarshlight Lake and Ango'rosh Grounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshlight%20Lake\"&gt;Marshlight Lake&lt;/a&gt; is just east of Zabra'jin, and &lt;a href=\"Ango%27rosh%20Grounds\"&gt;Ango'rosh Grounds&lt;/a&gt; is just north of the Lake.\nYou should be able to finish &lt;a href=\"There%27s%20No%20Explanation%20for%20Fashion\"&gt;There's No Explanation for Fashion&lt;/a&gt; with the drops from the Stingers if you haven't already.\n&lt;a href=\"Fhwoor%20Smash%21\"&gt;Fhwoor Smash!&lt;/a&gt; requires &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt; status with Sporeggar.\nTurn in at Zabra'jin and Sporeggar. This should also complete all the &lt;a href=\"Swamprat%20Post\"&gt;Swamprat Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; quest, so you can turn in there too.\nDaggerfen Village and Ango'rosh Stronghold.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Sharpest%20Blades\"&gt;The Sharpest Blades&lt;/a&gt; is actually south of Zabra'jin, unlike the rest of this leg which is far to the north. Probably the easiest is to do it on the way back to turn in Watcher Leesa'oh.\nTurn in at Watcher Leesa'oh and Zabra'jin. \nCongratulations, you've done all the quest in Zangarmarsh (54 are needed to get the achievement)."}

It is well-known that his toxic elixirs can even rouse the dead from their graves.\"\nAbilities.\nZanzil's Secret Techniques.\nZanzil periodically performs one of his three secret voodoo techniques, but he never chooses to perform the same technique twice in a row.\nCauldrons.\nZanzil has spread three experimental cauldrons around his lair. Each cauldron has a unique mixture, and drinking from the cauldron grants the player that mixture's effect.\nStrategy.\nThis encounter requires the group to use the cauldron mechanics from the rest of the dungeon. \nWhen pulled the tank should position the boss at roughly an equal distance from each cauldron to reduce movement time when getting the appropriate debuffs.\nZanzil himself casts Voodoo Bolt, which can be interrupted, and Zanzili Fire. The trail left behind by Zanzili Fire causes 50,000 arcane damage per second to anyone standing in it. The trail will move away from the Zanzil in the direction he was facing when the cast was started.\nZanzil will use one of 3 abilities, which require the use of the cauldrons to mitigate. He will use these abilities repeatedly until he is dead:\nZanzil's Graveyard Gas.\nZanzil will cause the entire area to be covered in toxic gas, this will cause damage to all players. While in this phase Zanzil will continue to cast Zanzili Fire which will be harder to see through the gas, so stay alert of the bosses casts. Every group member will need to get the debuff from the green cauldron in order to survive the damage from this ability. DPS should stay on the boss providing there are no adds up.\nZanzil's Resurrection Elixir (Zanzili Beserker).\nZanzil will resurrect a Zanzili Berserker, one member of the raid with a ranged ability should use the frost cauldron and freeze the berserker. All DPS should focus on the berserker and get it down before Zanzil uses his next ability. If the troll is not down before the frost trap expires then it will pursue a group member who should kite it, the berserker cannot be kited.\nZanzil's Resurrection Elixir (Zanzili Zombies).\nZanzil will resurrect a group of Zanzilli Zombies, the melee classes in the group should get the debuff from the red cauldron and focus on AoEing the zombies down, ranged classes should also AoE the zombies and if your group is ranged heavy or DPS is low then some ranged players may need to get the cauldron debuff and DPS in melee range in order to get the zombies down. Once the zombies are defeated the debuff can be dispelled to reduce extra damage being taken.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He is also a 5 man boss in the newer &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nYears ago, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; exiled one of their own from Zul'Gurub: a troll by the name of Zanzil. The reasons why aren't all that clear, but it had most likely something to do with Zanzils tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw. His mixtures cause those who drink it to become strong but feeble-minded - similar to zombies. Apparently, he is the one troll too insane for the likes of the Gurubashi.\nZanzil's liberal use of &lt;a href=\"%3AZanzil%27s%20Mixture\"&gt;:Zanzil's Mixture&lt;/a&gt; has drugged just about everything in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Aboraz\"&gt;Ruins of Aboraz&lt;/a&gt; into obeying him, including naga, &lt;a href=\"Chucky%20%22Ten%20Thumbs%22\"&gt;Chucky \"Ten Thumbs\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yenniku\"&gt;Yenniku&lt;/a&gt;. Yenniku was captured by Zanzil, who took control of his body and mind, and then sent to the &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt; to make them join him. Using a &lt;a href=\"%3ASoul%20Gem\"&gt;:Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, players were able to retrieve his soul.\nCataclysm.\nZanzil attempted to unite the troll tribes of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; into an army under his rule, starting with the &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears after the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, Zanzil the Outcast was approached and brought back into the tribe. He was enlisted by the shade of &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; to help him restore Zul'Gurub to its former glory by resurrecting both &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Jeklik\"&gt;High Priestess Jeklik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt; using his special elixirs. Though the player managed to thwart the resurrection of Jeklik, High Priest Venoxis was successfully brought back to life.\nAfter the Zandalari pledge to aid the Gurubashi to reach their former greatness, the Gurubashi begin attacking Stranglethorn, and Zanzil personally ventures to the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; and turns the inhabitants of both &lt;a href=\"Hardwrench%20Hideaway\"&gt;Hardwrench Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%20Digsite\"&gt;Explorers' League Digsite&lt;/a&gt; into voodoo zombies by poisoning the food in each town.\nHe was killed in the Gurubashi capital of Zul'Gurub, failing in his attempts to redeem himself to the empire.\nQuotes.\nAt the alter of Jeklik during the quest &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Into%20Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Plunging Into Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;\nSpeculation.\nTribe?\nDespite a quest, &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt;, and Zanzil himself mentioning and implying that he was exiled from the Gurubashi, his &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Journal\"&gt;Dungeon Journal&lt;/a&gt; page and &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Compendium/Other%20Trolls%23Zanzil%20the%20Outcast%20and%20His%20Followers\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast and His Followers&lt;/a&gt; list him as being exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Skullsplitter%20tribe\"&gt;Skullsplitter tribe&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Extractor can detect these clouds and track their position on the minimap while placed in inventory, irrespective of your other tracking preferences (e.g. while tracking Minerals).\nSource.\nThis item is crafted with &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (305); taught by . \nNotes.\nThis item is used to extract motes from various clouds, gases, mists and vortices in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. It can be put to use on the fairly distinctive, wandering clouds as long as your character is in close proximity to them. Simply activate the device when you are near a cloud and it will channel the motes into a spare inventory slot, should you have one.\nIn general.\nIf you are an Engineer using &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; as your second primary profession, and you find a spot with both a cloud and an ore vein in close proximity in a heavily &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farmed&lt;/a&gt; area, it is in your best interest to mine the ore first. While there are many Engineers in the game who may go after the cloud while you are mining the ore, there are \"far\" more Miners who may come for the ore as you are harvesting the cloud.\nIn The Burning Crusade.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Vortex\"&gt;Arcane Vortices&lt;/a&gt; are normally invisible, so if your minimap tracker is not enough to go on you will need the ability to &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Invisibility\"&gt;Detect Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne common misconception is that this item can also be used to extract &lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Water\"&gt;Motes of Water&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Water\"&gt;Pure Water&lt;/a&gt; that spawns in &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; spots around &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Pure Water in fact gives up its bounty to players who fish from it, not to mote extractors.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Windy%20Cloud\"&gt;Windy Cloud&lt;/a&gt;s will very frequently spawn on top of the floating islands that are dotted about the &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; region, requiring a minimum of &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Expert Riding&lt;/a&gt; to reach them.\nAlso note that other methods exist for acquiring &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20ingredient\"&gt;Motes&lt;/a&gt;, such as by tapping veins or looting from &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nBe sure you have bag space before you start extraction. The cloud disappears after extraction whether you collected the motes or not. If you have an engineering bag the motes are automatically allocated to that, so having an engineering bag is very helpful here.\nIn Wrath of the Lich King.\nVarious clouds and such also exist in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where the Zapthrottle Mote Extractor can be used to extract &lt;a href=\"elemental%20ingredient\"&gt;Crystallized ingredient&lt;/a&gt;s. The main difference is that more than one kind of element can be extracted, unlike the ones in Outland.\nIn later expansions.\nThe Zapthrottle Mote Extractor had no uses in \"Cataclysm\" or \"Mists of Panderia\"."}

In ', Zar'jira was revealed to be a naga. In ', her model is that of a naga sea witch as well. As she is translucent in WoW, however, she may also be a banshee or a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt seems the &lt;a href=\"Manifestation%20of%20the%20Sea%20Witch\"&gt;Manifestations of the Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt; that Zar'jira summoned may be the creature with the banshee model encountered in \"Warcraft III\", if it wasn't Zar'jira herself."}
