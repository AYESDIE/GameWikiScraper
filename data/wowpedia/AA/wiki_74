At the start of the event the infection had a duration of 10 minutes, but this decreased nearly daily, with a duration of only 1 minute by day 5 of the event. Once the infection's duration expires, or if the player dies while infected, they will transform into (or be raised as) a Plague Zombie.\nInteractions as a Plague Zombie.\nAll undead are friendly to the player, even zombies of the other faction. You can communicate and even trade with zombies of the other faction. Most mobs are neutral (and able to be targeted). All living players from any faction are hostile and can be attacked even if not flagged. The zombie gets about a 50% health buff as well as a new skill bar. The base speed of the zombie is around 50% of running speed. Zombies, thanks to their rotting flesh and lack of organs, have no lungs. Breathing underwater is therefore unlimited - though death may still occur if lack of &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; fighting fails to occur, resulting in loss of health.\nThe ability to loot mobs that you have killed has been removed for the infected zombie, yet anything you kill that counter-spawns into a zombie may be commanded by you to follow you and attack your targets as well.\nHealth.\nHealth drains moments after you turn into a zombie. Attacking living humanoids, mobs, or players to regain health is important to survival. Each successful attack returns 3% of your total health to you.\nAbilities.\nYou posess 5 abilities (Along with passive buffs, like tracking, 1.0 attack speed and increased damage): (in bar position order)\nSpreading the plague.\nAttacking humanoids (both NPCs and players) may have the chance to spread the plague to them. Resulting death for the victim results in them instantly re spawning as a zombie with 100% health.\nPCs come back as zombies with their current level.\nNPCs come back as zombies with a slightly reduced level.\nExamples:\nA level 75 NPC will come back as a level 70.\nA level 65 NPC will come back as a level 60.\nA level 9 NPC will come back as level 1.\nNPCs which return as zombies switch to a mode like an aggressive hunter/warlock pet and will attack any living thing in their radius. If they attack humanoids, they receive the healing from attacks like the PC zombies.\nIf you attack anything which would normally cause pvp, pvp mobs, players from either faction, etc. you are flagged as pvp. If any player attacks you, they are also flagged. Either faction can attack you whether you are flagged or not, and all guard type npcs are hostile to you.\nIf you can kill a town guard, it will fight alongside you to kill others and you can build a sizeable undead army since your attacks and your fellow zombies attacks all spread the plague to others.\nBack to the living.\nOnce you run out of health as a zombie either through combat, exploding, or health attrition, you die, taking the normal durability loss, and get the normal release to the graveyard dialogue. You release to the nearest graveyard from the zombie death, not the one where your living form initially died.\nIf you're killed by another player when you are a Zombie, you will not lose durability. You will not lose durability when you make the transition into a Zombie, so you don't have to worry about the possibility of double durability loss.\nLife not as a zombie.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Healer\"&gt;Argent Healer&lt;/a&gt;s have showed up all over the place. These will heal the disease off of players. If you are a zombie they will cast Righteous Fire at you which will kill you in at most 3 attacks.\nThere are also wards placed across the doors to every inn in capital cities and at each auction house entrance to cleanse the disease from anyone trying to enter those places.\nThe argent healers are also present in many towns near the flight points or by the inn.\nA tactic for avoiding infection is to keep clear of the large population centers. This is easier said than done. However, if you can collect multiple quests from quest givers in smaller towns or rural areas then pursue quest chains that take you away from towns and cities you can avoid most of the plague."}

Each of the cauldrons has its own unique mix of toxins and is guarded by a Cauldron Lord with a retinue of formidable Scourge soldiers. The vast forces that protect each cauldron make these landmarks the second largest concentration of scourge in the area, behind &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. Recently agents in the employ of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; were able to defeat the Cauldron Lords, and gain samples of the deadly toxins, which are still used to this day by the Argent Dawn in a constant battle to try and counteract the deadly concoctions.\nOrigins.\nThe enchanted cauldrons were masterminded by the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Heigan%20the%20Unclean\"&gt;Heigan the Unclean&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn preparation for the siege on the north lands, the Cauldrons were moved to Kel'Thuzad's recent acquisition, the Barov Manor on Caer Darrow (&lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;) where the Plague of Undeath was perfected within them. Using samples from the cauldrons, Kel'Thuzad began to poison grain shipments exported from Andorhal, thus dooming the populace of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to the plague. After &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' final \"purge\" of the region, the cauldrons were ordered to be placed in the various fields around Andorhal by &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; to help support the Scourge forces in the area.

The Scourge was intended to be a vanguard for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul's captors, during their attack on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nThe creation of the Plague took some time before and during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Using his will alone, the Lich King spread the mystic disease to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; settlements of Northrend killing them and causing them to rise again as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; under the influence of Ner'zhul. Yet, the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s proved immune to the plague. After the wizard &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; answered Ner'zhul's psychic call, he was tasked with containing the Plague and transporting it across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where it was used to infect food supplies and distributed to the populace under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, an acting lieutenant of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad first had to gather a cult of followers to aid him in the spreading of the Plague, and for this he established the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt; family servants were used as experiments for the plague, before a devastating disease, which was not the Plague that the Scourge would employ later but an experience of Scholomance, was unleashed and ravaged &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; before a visit from Uther the Lightbringer was scheduled. None survived, while the plague variant compelled its victims to wander as ghosts. According &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, this variant of the plague of undeath is now extinct, but he still prefers to avoid sending his agents in the region.\nWith the aid of his cultists, Kel'Thuzad and &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; used the agricultural hub of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; to ship Plague-infected grain to the surrounding towns within Lordaeron which included &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Those contracting the Plague typically die within three days, rising shortly thereafter as feral zombies easily controlled by the Lich King's immense psychic power. The &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; suffered an impressive number of deaths when the plague swept through the region, and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Grave\"&gt;mass graves&lt;/a&gt; were created to hold the bodies. After successfully destroying the infected granaries, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, fresh on the heels of Mal'Ganis, came to Stratholme to find it already infected by the tainted grain. Knowing that the citizens would soon turn into the cursed undead, he proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;slaughter&lt;/a&gt; them all, against the council of &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; the Lightbringer (Arthas' &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; mentor), in order to prevent them from bolstering Mal'Ganis' ranks.\nAfter Arthas left for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to hunt Mal'Ganis, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; sent a shipment of grain to a village of Lordaeron where &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt; happened to be stationed at. When the villagers turned into mindless zombies, Thomas understood that Rivendare was a traitor and reported it to the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; paladins.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA few years later, after the Scourge had built a considerable presence in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, they set up a series of massive &lt;a href=\"Plague%20cauldron\"&gt;cauldrons&lt;/a&gt; with which they continue to spread the Plague directly into the air, corrupting the land itself as well as the local wildlife. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a regime dedicated to the eradication of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; menace, have discovered ways of sabotaging these cauldrons and reversing their effects, thereby purifying the chemicals within and making them toxic to the undead.\nApothecaries of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were working on producing their own &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, which would have a similar effect as the original Plague, but will kill undead creatures as well as living ones. This will allow the Forsaken to destroy all their immediate enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Experiments on this &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; have been conducted by Apothecaries in &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe days before the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Conspicuous%20Crate\"&gt;plagued grain crates&lt;/a&gt; started appearing in the capital cities of Azeroth because of the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken dealt with curing the plague while the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; pledged itself to destroy the Scourge's &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe Forsaken &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Blight) was refined during the war in Northrend and used by a rebel faction of Forsaken (mostly made up of members of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; and led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;) against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Scourge forces during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the Horde has prohibited the usage of the full strength Blight.\nCataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Dithers\"&gt;Apothecary Dithers&lt;/a&gt;, under orders of &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Ravensun\"&gt;Lindsay Ravensun&lt;/a&gt;, took samples of the original Plague from the diseased bears of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href=\"Dithers%27%20Plague%20Drums\"&gt;plague drums&lt;/a&gt;. These drums were deployed as bombs to kill the farmers in &lt;a href=\"Felstone%20Field\"&gt;Felstone Field&lt;/a&gt; and undo the healing achieved by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nNature of the Plague.\nThrough the course of his experimentation, Ner'zhul insured that the affliction would specifically target humans for \"undeath\". Long term affliction of the plague causes a certain reanimation of activity in the dead, as if the corpse is waiting for further commands. Those who die by the plague are only lying dormant in their graves, awaiting one skillful in necromancy to awaken them.\nThough non-human races and creatures (and even the land itself) were susceptible to the Plague, it was humanity in particular that Ner'zhul meant to scour from the world. As a result, infected flora and fauna reacted differently \u2014 symptoms ranged from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations, but rarely resulted in death. Diseased and decaying but not truly undead, these beings were not under the thrall of the Lich King. Hence, while undead representatives certainly do exist among the ranks of the non-human races, these particular agents are examples of undead created through &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; rather than the Plague. An example of the Plague turning a non-human creature into undead is that of the &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the few creatures that thrives in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"carrion%20grub\"&gt;carrion grub&lt;/a&gt;. They can reach huge sizes and are immune to the Plague. A prime example of a carrion grub is &lt;a href=\"Borelgore\"&gt;Borelgore&lt;/a&gt;. The Plaguelands also have heavy populations of massive mushrooms which also seem to thrive in these conditions.\nDemonic energy.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; that the Plague contained &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; energy while investigating its initial spread across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They noted that the land around the contaminated grain had the life sapped out of it, exhibiting a similar effect found on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul's Plague was a life-draining sickness and victims of this Plague became limned with a sickly, green glow characteristic of something tainted with demonic energies. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; a mushroom created from demonic mist infected people with a different type of plague that caused its victims to grow exploding pustules before killing them moments later. This plague did not resurrect its victims.\nCure.\nThe Plague, while established many times as a very powerful affliction, was proven to be curable at least once. During the end of the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Event\"&gt;World Event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; managed to find cures to the Plague, even if the converted zombies themselves could not be saved.\nThe Plague can not be healed or weakened by individual means, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; (regarding weakening the affliction).\nSpeculation.\nFungal.\nThe Plague was originally cast and controlled psychically by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. There are no large fungal growths around the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; or the human settlements in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; hit by this version of the Plague, but there might be evidence that the Plague of Undeath eventually became fungal in nature in the form of &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt;, where clouds of what look like spores emanate from the colossal mushrooms in the area, whose growth may be linked to the Plague. Growths on infected plants and animals also would make this possible. Early infections could have been mostly due to ingested grain, but proximity does not appear to be infectious.\nDrinking from tainted water sources, such as the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt; near Andorhal before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, can also cause infection. The Plague may have either evolved over the years to influence the growth and size of lifeforms, such as the carrion worms and mushrooms. Plants and animals tend to grow when exposed to fel magic.\nEbon Blade.\nIn the \"\" version of , a few of what seems to be plague cauldrons can be seen (specifically near &lt;a href=\"Salanar%20the%20Horseman\"&gt;Salanar the Horseman&lt;/a&gt;). It is possible that the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; have begun brewing their own, that the Lich King is now resupplying them with it, or it is something else entirely. Thus far it has not been shown to have been used by the Ebon Blade against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

The plague tore through the empire, killed thousands of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and began one of the most terrifying periods in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;'s history.\nIt became too risky for mortals to handle the dead, and &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s were summoned for the grim work of preservation and burial. It was also deemed that the bodies of the plague victims, too polluted for proper burial, would instead be burned and kept in special urns. It is believed that the Soulflayer's touch may still linger within &lt;a href=\"Kings%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kings' Rest&lt;/a&gt; where the urns are kept, thus a placard within the crypt tells anyone who may become infected to leap off the bridge to their death. \nAfter the great plague, there were still those who clung to the magics of the blood god, having taken the \"Path of Blood\". They tested their magics and perfected them. One such relic was a &lt;a href=\"Sanguinating%20Totem\"&gt;Sanguinating Totem&lt;/a&gt; capable of draining the life and blood from enemies and infusing the caster with it, altering them in unsual ways. This was the dawn of who the Zandalari call, \"the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;constructs&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; studied the plague in search of a cure, but found that only isolation and extermination was effective. When Uldir's safeguards cracked apart, the blood plague was accidentally combined with a sample of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;'s blood, creating &lt;a href=\"Vectis\"&gt;Vectis&lt;/a&gt;, an entity that hungered for fresh victims.\nSpeculation.\nThis plague may be the same incident mentioned in , where shortly after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; around 1,500 years ago, the Zandalari almost succumbed to an \"evil within their own tribe\", which led to them \"banishing the trolls who would destroy their own kind\". This evil might have been Hakkar summoned to Zandalar, and the banished trolls would be the ones who summoned him. However, Hakkar was summoned to Zandalar \"many millennia ago\", which would be an odd choice of words if it was the same incident as this one which occurred 1,500 years ago."}

The region sometimes includes the Tirisfal Glades. The Eastweald was a stretch of fertile foothills located east of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, military leaders from &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; constructed \"crude\" forts throughout the Eastweald prior to the kingdom's direct confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; around 2,800 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, those forts would become populated trading centers from which many modern cities would spring. The settlements built on the Eastweald like &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; were the most important holy sites of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust before the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; directed the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; on the northern nation of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; by tainting the grain from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; (the primary distributor of grain in the northern provinces) and shipping it to outlying villages and towns. The virulent plague killed thousands throughout the provinces and raised them as mindless undead in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and caused the land to become tainted, the plant and animal life becoming diseased. A small resistance, led by Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, were able to destroy the infected granaries and temporarily halt the spread of the plague. Not long after the time of Arthas' eventual fall, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;the Culling&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and coming to its climax with the murder of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of the population had been converted into the undead, had fled or were regrouping trying to fight the living dead in any way they could.\nThe name Eastweald was still used during the days of the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; but as time passed the name was replaced by the Plaguelands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, having already suffered from the effects of dragons' fire during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; over a decade earlier, also became tainted by the plague after the fall of Lordaeron, during the Scourge's march to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to give the Scourge as pyrrhic a victory as possible, the elves put their forests to the torch. Today the region is known as the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, and is home to the major Scourge holding in Quel'Thalas, the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Scourge's defection from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; after the Third War and the later splintering of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the Plaguelands became divided between the minions of the Lich King and the new followers of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, the Scourge continues to corrupt the Plaguelands, spreading the Plague of Undeath from strategically-placed &lt;a href=\"plague%20cauldron\"&gt;cauldrons&lt;/a&gt; that taint not only the land, but the air and the wildlife as well. Although the Scourge presence is decreasing thanks to the efforts of different factions based on these regions.\nThere are many others besides the Forsaken and the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; who battle the Scourge in the Plaguelands. The &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of maddened zealots who attack anyone who opposes them as fervently as they destroy the undead, took control of some of the few surviving towns in the region, such as &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; but lose them in the following years with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; being their last bastion. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, formed by former members of the Scarlet Crusade who opposed its corruption, fought the Scourge for some time striking against key leaders and locations throughout the Plaguelands until they joined with the remaining &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; around the area and formed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe proper Plaguelands are the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, including the ."}

With Arthas gone, and the Lich King gravely weakened, the aforementioned factions rose up to take control of the power rift left behind. The war ended with the deaths of Balnazzar and Lord Garithos, and left Sylvanas and her lieutenant Varimathras as a new great power over much of the former of Lordaeron.\nA new power in Lordaeron.\nThough Illidan's ritual was disrupted in time by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, he was able to injure &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; in the Frozen Throne, causing his power to seep out. Ner'zhul communicated with Arthas several times, and urged him to return to Northrend to defend him. While Arthas was preparing to leave, he was beset by the dreadlords and their forces. Separated from &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and gravely weakened, he was grateful to find many undead loyal to him who helped his flight from the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas wasted no time in departing and appointed Kel'Thuzad to rule the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in his stead. Due to the Lich King growing weaker, the Scourge overall was in a much weaker state, and Kel'Thuzad and the Scourge remained passive and essentialy absent for the most duration of the civil war.\nIn the wake of Arthas' departure at &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;'s day, Sylvanas, and some other &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Forces\"&gt;strong-willed undead&lt;/a&gt; were able to free themselves from the Lich King's grasp, while the dreadlord brothers Varimathras, Detheroc, and Balnazzar took control of the majority of undead forces. They strongly believed that the Scourge belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and attempted to maintain a Legion presence on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; despite their great loss on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. As rivalries between the undead factions grew stronger, Lord Garithos dreamed of reforming the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and joined the fray with what remnants of Lordaeron he could gather. Despite the defection of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, Garithos' &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; forces were able to carve a foothold for themselves by retaking &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the dominant force at the start of the war, Varimathras, at the behest of his brothers, extended a formal invitation to Sylvanas and her forces to join them, promising her that they are the future of the Plaguelands. Sylvanas declined, and steeled herself to fight a much larger foe.\nThe civil war.\nOn the onset, Sylvanas was at a great disadvantage, with her army consisting largely of ghouls and banshees and not much else. She had her banshees possess the local bandit group leader, &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn\"&gt;Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the ogre leader &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt;, to bolster her armies and devastated Varimathras' forces. Before Sylvanas could kill him, Varimathras pleaded with her to spare his life in exchange for information on his brothers' forces. Sylvanas complied, making Varimathras her lieutenant but keeping a close eye on him.\nWorking off of the information Varimathras provided, Sylvanas learned that &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; had entrenched himself in the western Plaguelands and has used his powers to mind control Lord Garithos and subdue his forces. Sylvanas faced a dual threat in Garithos and Detheroc's forces and used subtlety and deception to sneak her way past guards and establish a presence behind their city gates. When the forces of Detheroc and Garithos awakened, they clashed with Sylvanas, who was able to devastate both forces. After Detheroc was destroyed by Sylvanas and Varimathras, the mind control spell put on Garithos and his forces was lifted. Sylvanas approached him and offered to join forces to defeat their common enemy - Balnazzar and give him his lands back. Garithos reluctantly agreed and rallied his armies. Varimathras questioned Sylvanas' decision, and she informed him she had no intention of returning Lordaeron to the humans.\nThe night before attacking the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas met with the freed undead. She spoke about their purpose in the world and if they help her retake the Capital. An undead alchemist called &lt;a href=\"Lydon\"&gt;Lydon&lt;/a&gt; asked her what would become of Garithos' humans. She responded that they would just serve for the battle.\nSylvanas, having defeated Detheroc, and joined forces with Varimathras and Garithos, marched on the Capital City, where &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; resided. Despite being the last dreadlord, Balnazzar had the largest army and had opened gateways to summon demonic allies. Sylvanas organized a two-pronged attack on the capital city: Her and Varimathras would attack from the front, while Garithos would attack from the rear. Upon encountering Balnazzar, Sylvanas taunts him about enslaving his brother and tearing the other to shreds. Balnazzar expresses outrage at Varimathras's betrayal when encountering him, and when encountering Garithos, he reveals that he was the mastermind behind the mind control, not Detheroc. Eventually, Sylvanas and Garithos are successful, and they confront a defeated Balnazzar. Sylvanas orders Varimathras to kill him, to which he reluctantly obliges. She then orders him to kill Garithos as well. She formally declares her defection from the Scourge and names her forces the \"&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;,\" vowing to slaughter all who stand in her way. Sylvanas's declaration and the deaths of Balnazzar and Garithos mark the end of the civil war.\nAftermath.\nSylvanas was able to successfully consolidate Forsaken rule over &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, but was ultimately pushed out of the Plaguelands. The Forsaken are largely split into two major parties: those loyal to Sylvanas and those loyal to Varimathras. She joins the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; shortly after in an attempt to create more allies for herself, in exchange for the Horde having a presence on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. A relationship that began as being exclusively mutually-beneficial quickly evolved into a much stronger bond, as the Forsaken became a crucial part of the Horde, playing major roles in most of their campaigns until Sylvanas' ultimate ascension to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarimathras initially maintained his loyalty to Sylvanas, but during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, he and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, along with his loyalists, stage an uprising in which Sylvanas is kicked out of the Undercity and Varimathras renews his loyalty to the Burning Legion. He and Putress are both stopped and Varimathras languishes in &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;, being punished for his continuous failures.\nThe status of the remnants of Garithos's forces is unknown. Seeing the free-willed Forsaken occupy their former capital, the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who didn't join with the High Marshal renewed their assaults on the undead. &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; eventually infiltrated their ranks as racist dissensions splintered the resistance's leadership, leading to a split between the former knights into the two orders of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Balnazzar and Varimathras kept in contact, working together to protect their interests.\nWith Arthas's ascension to the Frozen Throne, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; regained their power, and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; wasted no time in reclaiming the land he lost during the civil war. He ruled over the Plaguelands from atop his floating Necropolis, &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe power gap left by Arthas and the weakened Scourge was ultimately filled by Sylvanas for a short while after she won the civil war, but with the Scourge renewed in their strength, they returned as a serious threat in the region, with only the Forsaken, the Argent Dawn, and the Scarlet Crusade to challenge them."}

Though &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; is partially to blame as well, the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; are a testament to the ravages that disease can bring to the world. While other people perpetually bemoan their dead and portray themselves as the sole victims of the pestilence of the age, the stoic races of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldier on, accepting life's misfortunes without feeling a need to complain. Unlike others, the wise races of the Horde realized that the plague must be fought intelligently and skillfully, through knowledge and not with wild sword strokes. After long and careful deliberation the Horde formed a new order of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"plagueshifter\"&gt;plagueshifter&lt;/a&gt;s, who were charged with reclaiming the Plaguelands and other stricken areas for the Horde.\nPlagueshifters fill a specialized role, one typically taken by &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, who are willing to leave &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and walk in far lands. To become a plagueshifter, one must risk exposure to the deadliest diseases and poisons, and learn to master them. It's a dangerous profession, but just as the mastery of sharp steel has its rewards, so too does the victory over the most insidious enemies of the natural world.\nThe plagueshifter's body and mind are strong enough to resist the effects of poison, disease and similar effects. The plagueshifter can recognize any natural or magical disease. The plagueshifter's mystical forces protect her not only against disease, but also against the creatures that carry them.\nThe plagueshifter can enchant four stones and place them in a square to protect an area from harm. All vermin are unable to enter or exit the area, likewise natural diseases are also barred. All diseased creatures within the area do not spread their illness, nor do they suffer the disease\u2019s effects. The effects last for as long as the plagueshifter cares to leave the stones in place, other effects and creatures cannot move them.\nPlagueshifters are capable of summoning creatures to their aid. They can summon strange creatures called white hounds, that can understand the plagueshifter's speech and obey to the best of their ability. White hounds can cure by touch, and their bite releases &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are also able to summon &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. The elemental must stay in fresh water, and cannot venture far from where it was summoned. All waters near the elemental are made free from corruption and disease and are drinkable, even the polluted filth of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; is cleansed. The elemental remains until the plagueshifter dismisses it. The water can be polluted again.\nThe plagueshifter may plant a magical garden that yields an incredible bounty of fruits, grain, and nuts. Even normally carnivorous creatures may eat from this garden and be content. Regardless of pestilence, blight or frost, the harvest cannot be diminished. However, fire (or flooding with befouled water) destroys the garden.\nThe plagueshifter can use purify food and drink as a spell-like ability at will. The plagueshifter can touch a living creature and infect it with a short-duration, low-grade fever that puts it into a berserker state.\nPlagueshifters in the world.\nMost plagueshifters are members of the Horde, typically &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who live near the Plaguelands and tauren druids who traveled to Lordaeron and trained themselves to battle the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. They're a relatively recent addition to the Horde's druidic orders, so their influence has not been felt in the world, and the Scourge and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; haven't taken any notice of them - yet. As it is a horde-conceived notion, all current plagueshifters are members of the Horde.\nHowever, it is important to note that any race has the potential to become a Plagueshifter, as long as they meet the prerequisites to become one. (That is, they must have the ability to cast Remove Disease as a divine spell, have a certain level of the \"heal\" skill, and knowledge of nature.)\nIn World of Warcraft.\nThe combined efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; managed to heal down the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rayne\"&gt;Rayne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rimblat%20Earthshatter\"&gt;Rimblat Earthshatter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgris%20Deepriver\"&gt;Mulgris Deepriver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adrine%20Towhide\"&gt;Adrine Towhide&lt;/a&gt; could be seen as plagueshifters."}

It is heavily occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and contains large amounts of infrastructure, including &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slaughterhouse\"&gt;slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the prevalence of the Scourge, representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; routinely patrol the road leading to and from Stratholme. They attack any &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; that they encounter \u2014 as well as any other travelers that these fanatics chance upon. All those journeying along the forest's road should be on the lookout for them, as they present as much of a danger as the ravening Scourge.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nBefore the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Stratholme\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt; was a beautiful place similar to &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. It had a small village around the area of the arch, near the forest's entrance. When &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; began his work, the poisoned grain from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; reached this area as well. &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Morigan\"&gt;Sergeant Morigan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeronian&lt;/a&gt; soldier from the village here, was the first soldier to realize that something was wrong. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; crossed the woodland in order to reach the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the woods were already drastically altered by the &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;, completely changing the landscape. The soil itself resembled a sponge in appearance, and the ecology of the area was dramatically altered. Fungus grew to amazing proportions, predominantly in the form of large mushrooms or toadstools, dwarfing nearby trees. They often belch out dark brown gas, looking similar in appearance to the gas that spews from &lt;a href=\"plague%20cauldron\"&gt;plague cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s; whether or not these fungi are a tool used by the Scourge to spread clouds of noxious plague gas is not clear. With this transformation, the forest came to be known as the Plaguewood instead.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Plaguewood was the home to an imposing structure that opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, the enormous &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; that once floated above the forest. Access to this portal was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and only those who were exalted with them could enter free of cost, while others had to pay a hefty fee (the quest in question, &lt;a href=\"The%20Dread%20Citadel%20-%20Naxxramas\"&gt;The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, remained in the game until \"Cataclysm\").\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war in Northernd&lt;/a&gt;, Naxxramas left the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; after being summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. The teleport device to the necropolis was since replaced by a different structure.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; extended its presence in the area after rebuilding the &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood%20Tower\"&gt;Plaguewood Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaguewood Digsite.\nThe Plaguewood is a &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIts original name might have been \"Greenwood\", as the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt; that connects the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; (that is in close proximity to the forest) could have been the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20Pass\"&gt;Greenwood Pass&lt;/a&gt; seen in \"\"."}

Besides reality and its physical realm, six cosmic forces form the universe. All these forces push and pull against one another in an unending tug of war, constantly vying for power over each other. If one fell, all worlds would fall into chaos. Existence within these planes is not a simple thing: it consists of layers upon layers of realities that can be traversed through &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al means.\nThe multiverse is a term used to refer to &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;all the possible universes&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\".\nGreat Dark Beyond.\nThe Great Dark Beyond represents the mortal and the physical universe. It is an infinite living realm composed of innumerable &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; civilizations. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is found in it, and it is merely one of the countless worlds drifting through vast reaches of the Great Dark.\nThe physical world is referred to as the material world or corporeal realm and is in contrast with the realm of spirits.\nTwisting Nether.\nThe Twisting Nether is the astral plane between worlds that lies in parallel with the Great Dark Beyond. The forces of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; bleed together at its boundaries, engulfing the Twisting Nether in perpetual strife. Sometimes, the volatile energies that pervade the Nether intrude upon the physical universe, warping reality beyond measure.\nEmerald Dream.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; is an ethereal realm of &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s and untamed nature that exists alongside Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s forged it to act as a map for the evolutionary path of Azeroth's flora and fauna. As life ebbs and flows across the physical world, the spiritual energies that stature the Dream keep pace with it.\nShadowlands.\nThe Shadowlands are nightmarish realms of decay, labyrinthine spiritual planes teeming with the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of the dead who have passed from the world of the living. They have existed ever since &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; life arose in the physical universe. Its main realms are &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; is the border between the Shadowlands and the living world, and the &lt;a href=\"In-Between\"&gt;In-Between&lt;/a&gt; separates and surrounds the realms of the Shadowlands. The &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Shadowlands%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; is an alternate phase of the existence of the Maw.\nLight and Void.\nPure &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; dwell in a realm outside the borders of reality, but shades of their presence are found in the physical universe as well as engulf the Twisting Nether in perpetual chaos. Light and Shadow are the most fundamental cosmic forces in existence predating the physical universe. Although contradictory in nature, they are bound together on a cosmic scale as one cannot exist without the other. The &lt;a href=\"Void%23Void%20realm\"&gt;Void realm&lt;/a&gt; is visited in and on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nPocket dimensions.\nPocket dimensions (or dimensional pockets) seem to be little parts of a dimension secluded by &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Plane.\nThe Elemental Plane is the home of all &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that were removed from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; created four interlinked domains within a pocket dimension, imprisoning them millennia ago.\nWyrmrest sanctums.\nEach sanctum is a refuge out of time and space that are magical dimensions unto themselves. The sanctums' appearances are reflective of each &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalls of Valor and Helheim.\n&lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; called upon the same powers she had used to secure the Elemental Plane and sealed off &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s fortress\u2014the Halls of Valor\u2014with an impregnable, magical barrier. She then proceeded to create Helheim as an enchanted refuge for herself and the other &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; far below the Halls.\nDe Other Side.\nDe Other Side is &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s pocket dimension in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther realms.\nThese realms exist but there is not much known about them:\nSpeculation.\nPlanes for all the cosmic forces?\nWhile the cosmology chart in \"\" shows the Emerald Dream as a counterpart to the Shadowlands, the book also asserts that the Emerald Dream is mostly an artificial phenomenon unique to Azeroth, even though the quest chain to get the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;Swift Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; hinted at a cosmic scale. The Shadowlands has been asserted to be the \"cosmic\" realm of Death, with the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; being more akin to the Emerald Dream, and as such there could be additional cosmic-scale realms for the other cosmic forces.\nThere are some hints to that possibility:\nThese sentiments indicate that there is an &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; plane separate from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; plane separate from the Emerald Dream. Additionally, it seems that the Light and Void as \"planes\" may not be so straightforward as well."}

Beyond the physical world there is something greater it lies infinitely far away, yet also infinitesimally close. It has places of brilliant purity and the darkest chaos. Creatures of air, fire, and shadow call these places their homes; and those from Azeroth who dare to travel into these realms will find them unlike anything they have ever seen before. They are the planes, and the physical world of Azeroth is but one of them. Those from Azeroth who dare to travel into these realms will find them unlike anything they have ever seen before. \nSome adventurers go beyond Azeroth to other planes of existence. It is there that they encounter &lt;a href=\"eternal\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, adventurers and villains, strange and vastly powerful creatures, and conflicts that span worlds \u2014 if not the universe itself.\nThe human magocracy made great advances in their studies of planar travel after the orc invasion, and copies of the archmage Khadgar\u2019s \"&lt;a href=\"Contemplations%20on%20Many%20Worlds\"&gt;Contemplations on Many Worlds&lt;/a&gt;\" are found in several libraries in the eastern lands.\nAmong the elves, it is commonly believed that mortal planes such as Azeroth and Outland are the crudest reflections of planes of greater power such as the Twisting Nether and the Emerald Dream.\nThere are scholars who study the concept of planes and wonder if there are more to discover.\nHistory.\nThough the titans and eternals have known about the planes for longer than the recorded history of the world, the first time mortal creatures on Azeroth suspected there was something other than the world around them was when the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; made their way out of the jungles to the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and stared deep into its waters. There they sensed a great power, and in a course of events that would change the world forever, dedicated themselves to its study. They hoped that they would discover the moon goddess Elune within its waters, but instead they plumbed the darkness and felt the cold touch of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; waiting on another plane, the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaterial Plane.\nThe Material Plane refers to the mortal, material worlds such as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and, in the past, &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. All material worlds are made from the same planar material as the known material worlds, though some of them might possess different basic planar traits (from basic physical traits to magic traits).\nEach of these worlds, though they share most of the same planar traits, is separated from the rest in its particular material pocket. As such, each world is treated as its own separate plane \u2014 spells such as \"teleport\" that allow for transport within the Material Plane do not allow for transport between isolated material pockets. Another plane, the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, must be traversed to journey from one to another.\nThe &lt;a href=\"eternal\"&gt;eternal&lt;/a&gt;s and even the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; share residence on the Material Plane of Azeroth with mortal beings.\nHigher planes.\nWhen the term \"higher plane\" is used, it is in reference to one of the known planes, such as the Emerald Dream, the Twisting Nether, the Great Dark Beyond, the Elemental Plane, or simply another planet out in the Great Dark Beyond.\nGreat Dark Beyond.\nA philosophical placeholder as an answer was agreed that beyond the boundaries of the Twisting Nether, there is the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. The Beyond is all that is unknowable about the cosmos. Were part of it to be journeyed to or defined, it would become its own plane.\nElemental Plane.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; is a prison within the Twisting Nether fashioned by the titans as a separate plane to hold their old foes. The plane the titans created is spherical and comparatively small \u2014 about the size of a single world. It is a three-tiered realm. The domain of Air sits atop the middle layer, which supports both the Water and Earth domains. Beneath these lies a third layer of Fire and molten rock.\nEmerald Dream.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; is a kind of echo of what &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would be like if intelligent beings had not altered its surface.\nTwisting Nether.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; is a place where chunks of worlds float among prismatic clouds, and colorful energy ribbons twist through the void. All is spectral and shadowy \u2014 blurring together in a muted, multicolored haze that brushes and teases the senses. Physical laws do not exist in this realm of ghosts, save those that a traveler creates for herself. Magic and illusion dance across the ever-changing vastness. Coterminous with all other worlds, the Twisting Nether can be a gateway for those who know how to use it.\nMultiverse.\n&lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; studies the various planes of the multiverse both remotely and in person. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; is aware of all air spells that are cast anywhere throughout the multiverse, although if this is true, he rarely becomes personally involved in their resolution unless they affect him directly.\nNon-existant planes.\nAccording to the books, there are no \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" style planes within the Warcraft universe. The Warcraft universe is both simple and vast. Unlike the standard D&amp;D world, Azeroth has no distinct Astral, Ethereal, Inner, Outer, Positive, or Negative Planes \u2014 just a measureless nothing known as the Great Dark Beyond. An infinite number of worlds spin within the multiverse and it's impossible to say whether they are scattered across the universe or superimposed upon each other. However, although those planes don't exist, they have a counterpart or are somehow related to the Warcraft universe.\nAstral Plane.\nThe Astral Plane does not exist in Warcraft universe, it is replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; exists in this plane.\nEthereal Plane.\nThere is no Ethereal Plan in the Warcraft universe. No exact equivalent of the Ethereal Plane exists in the Warcraft universe. Only the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; can be clearly mapped to another plane, that of the physical world of Azeroth, yet they remain distinct places in the cosmos and grow more disparate with each change made in the mortal realm. Ethereal Spells result in the target becoming invisible and intangible to all creatures and effects on the Material Plane.\nAs such, any creature described as existing or otherwise interacting with the Ethereal Plane is treated as simply being on the &lt;a href=\"%23Material%20Plane\"&gt;Material Plane&lt;/a&gt;, but are considered invisible.\nInner and Outer Planes.\nOnly the titans remain as creatures who may originate from a place beyond the known planes, and the dwarves have yet to discover the answer to their mystery.\nThe final destination of the spirits of the deceased remains a mystery to the priests and philosophers of Azeroth. However, as spells such as resurrection can reunite a dead body with its spirit, and a majority of living creatures from the tauren to the troll shadow hunters claim they can communicate with and call upon the power of the spirits, a widely held belief is that the spirits of the dead remain on the Material Plane \u2014 in an immaterial state that can only be altered or contacted through the use of magic.\nPositive Energy Plane, Negative Energy Plane, and Shadow Plane.\nThese planes don't appear to exist. But their forces are known to flow through Azeroth and the Twisting Nether. These forces are not limited to any single plane; they are instead an integral part of every aspect of the Warcraft universe, woven into every plane. Thus, spells that call upon these energies such as harm, heal and shadow conjuration instead draw upon local sources rather than reaching to another plane.\nPositive energy remains associated with the energies possessed by living beings, and negative energy with the motive forces of death and the undead. Thus, spells that aid the living with positive energy will harm the undead, and spells that would injure the living using negative energy will heal the undead.\nMagical weapons that have effects wielding these energies draw upon that positive or negative energy bound into their own material, freed by enchantment."}

In this mission, an unnamed regent is asked to construct a small outpost and defeat local orcish patrols scattered in the area.\nMission briefing.\n\"As a test of your abilities, the &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; has appointed &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Crown\"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; as Regent over a small parcel of land. Since we must keep our armies in the field well supplied, you are to build the town into a farming center of no less than 6 &lt;a href=\"Farm%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;. Construction of a &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; for defense is also advised, as our scouts have reported &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; patrols in the area.\"\nBattle.\nThe human regent and his troops began the construction of six farms and a barracks as ordered by King Llane. While constructing these buildings, the humans encountered orcish grunts and spearmen who were scouting out the nearby lands. Minor skirmishes ensued between human footmen and the orcish scouts. Searching out the renegade orcs, the humans managed to defeat all of the orcish patrols in the area.\nGuide.\nBegin with building a Peasant and send your first one to the nearby Gold Mine just east of your base. Once the Peasant is complete, command it to build a Farm along any part of the road, then train at least one more Peasant and have it gather resources. Eventually you will have to build four more Farms and a Barracks to complete the mission objectives. There is more than enough road to build all your buildings along it and you should not have to build any more.\nYou can explore the map with your Footmen, which will be necessary should you spend too much on additional units. There are Gold Mines to the northwest, southwest and one to the far south. The southwest and south ones have 1-2 enemy units guarding them (Grunts and Spearmen), requiring you to clear them out with Footmen before you can send your Peasants there (Reminder: Peasants cannot attack). The northwest Gold Mine does have not have any nearby units, though three enemy units are in the nearby vicinity. Regardless, it is possible to move a Peasant to the mine and mine gold without attracting their attention.\nThe Easy Way.\nThere is no truly fast way to win this mission, since initial resources are a bit tight. Between your starting resources and what is available in the Gold Mine (to the east), you have enough gold to build 5 farms and 1 barracks. This allows you to skip the exploration and having to conduct any long-distance mining. You will need to empty out the mine and gather 1600 units of lumber, so put one Peasant on the Gold Mine and two on the trees to the north of the Town Hall. Stay away from the northwest corner of that patch of trees; a Grunt is nearby and if it is alerted to your presence, it will prioritize going after your Peasants.\nIf you wish to delay building a farm to maximize resource gathering, you can kill off one of your Footmen, early on."}

He was instrumental in unmasking her, though he paid for it with his life.\nHistory.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; served together under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaptured.\nMarshal Reginald Windsor was a legendary knight and commander in his best days. He was a loyal friend of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and studied swordcraft with him, although Windsor came to favor the hammer. With nerves of &lt;a href=\"thorium\"&gt;thorium&lt;/a&gt; and wielding his family's epic hammer &lt;a href=\"%3AIronfoe\"&gt;:Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, he became a living legend in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Later he was assigned the post of commanding officer of Alliance forces in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, he traveled to the Burning Steppes to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and obtain proof of Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery for Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. However, when a flippant King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; returned to Stormwind, Windsor was troubled by Varian's passiveness and began investigating the possibility that an impostor \u2014 possibly even a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had taken the king's place.\nAs threats of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt; grew, he and his agents traveled to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. While traveling with the information they gathered, his squadron stumbled into a Blackrock orcs battalion laying traps for an upcoming battle with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; and were forced to fight them. Though Windsor managed to defeat the orcs, he was spotted by 300 &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and was captured. Only one of his men, &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20John\"&gt;Ragged John&lt;/a&gt;, escaped to tell the tale. Marshal Windsor was captured and imprisoned, &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;his hammer&lt;/a&gt; taken by the Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, and the precious information seemed lost.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nEventually, however, he was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;. He revealed to them the dark secret that he learned while stationed in the Burning Steppes: that the court of Stormwind had been infiltrated by the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, in the guise of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. Reginald Windsor accompanied the four to Stormwind and, even though he knew it would lead to his death, he confronted her, revealing her true form within &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. With her plans unraveling and her disguise ruined, she incinerated Windsor and escaped to her &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nPrior to the release of \"\", &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s could discover his notes, scattered among major individuals of &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;. Returning his notes restored Windsor's hopes, and the player escorted him to freedom. Returning to Stormwind, Windsor was greeted as a hero, despite orders from Lady Katrana Prestor for his arrest. Windsor proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to reveal Katrana's true identity as Lady Onyxia before being slain by her. However, this part was slightly retconned as seen in The Comic.\nDespite most of his appearances made unavailable, he can be seen as Marshal Windsor enslaved in the &lt;a href=\"Detention%20Block\"&gt;Detention Block&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nStormwind City.\nStay back!

{"id": "15181", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15181", "title": "Region", "text": "Region is a term used to designate the different areas in which \"World of Warcraft\" service is offered. The four current regions are Americas &amp; Oceania (US &amp; OCE), Europe (EU), Taiwan (TW), and Korea (KR). Game services were suspended in the China (CN) region on 23 January 2023 and it is unknown when, or if, they will return.\n\"World of Warcraft\" accounts are region-specific and only allow the use of features related to that region, including access to that region's selection of &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s. For a list of realms by region, see &lt;a href=\"realms%20list\"&gt;realms list&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost account-bound features, such as &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Collections\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;, are region-specific. Characters cannot be transferred to realms in other regions, and players cannot communicate with or invite players from other regions. Cross-realm features like &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zone\"&gt;cross-realm zone&lt;/a&gt;s and battleground instances do not function cross-region, and all leaderboards and ladders (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt;) are currently region- or realm-specific. The result of these limitations is that players are unable to communicate, interact, transfer, or compete cross-region.\nRegion also determines factors such as support and forum access. The US and EU have separate official sites for the game, featuring separate forums; only players with an active account in the corresponding region are allowed to post on that region's forums. Additionally, certain features are at times made available to US players before those of other regions. Since the vast majority of all developer and 'blue' forum posts are made on the US forums, this has led to dissatisfaction among some EU players, who are unable to join in these discussions due to region restrictions, and claim to feel less heard due to fewer responses from blues.\nDifferent regions are notable for featuring different player trends. For example, while all regions can be accessed from multiple time zones, some feature a higher number of players within a certain time zone, which can lead to strong spikes in server stress at peak times. The EU region has been described as \"more compressed\" than the US, with a larger proportion of players playing during the same times, leading to greater server stress problems than in the US region. The EU has also been stated to have more servers with very high populations than the US. EU players have been described by Lead Encounter Designer &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; as \"slightly more hard-core raiders than the rest of the world\". For some related statistics for US and EU servers, see &lt;a href=\"Realm%23Statistics\"&gt;realm statistics&lt;/a&gt;."}

Before becoming Thrall's adviser, Rehgar was a successful &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; slave master who \"owned\" &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; while he was suffering from amnesia. \nAt Thrall's request, he represented elemental magic in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nRehgar Earthfury was born on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; into a clan warring with a band of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. He made his first kill long before the normal age of an orc's rite of passage, and was captured by the ogres to be used as a training tool for their youths. However, Rehgar grew into a strong warrior, and after slaying many of their young fighters, was sold to the orc arenas in an attempt to recoup their loses.\nDespite his young age, he was a superb warrior, and was chosen to participate in the orcs' invasion of Azeroth, leading to his eventual capture and internment. However, unable to subjugate him, the guards sold him as a gladiator to fight for the human, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Agrovane\"&gt;Lord Agrovane&lt;/a&gt;. He escaped and became a fighter in underground arenas, gaining riches and fame.\nUsing his savings, he purchased the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orc, &lt;a href=\"Bloodeye%20Redfist\"&gt;Bloodeye Redfist&lt;/a&gt;, from authorities in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and followed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings, becoming a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, they traveled the fighting circuit, Rehgar teaching Bloodeye the ways of the gladiator. Bloodeye became the orc's favored champion, dominating in single combat, earning both himself and Rehgar riches. Bloodeye bought his freedom, and the two pooled their money to purchase and train &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; to join Bloodeye in team combat.\nShortly after, Bloodeye was killed, poisoned by the mate of a fighter he slew in the arena. Following Bloodeye's funeral pyre, Rehgar set out to find a replacement for his team.\nRehgar discovers an &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;amnesiac human&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of Durotar, and enslaves (using the excuse he was a &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; deserter) him as a gladiator. The human had killed a &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt; in self-defense when Rehgar's group came across him, and so Rehgar jokingly nicknamed the man \"Croc-Bait\". Rehgar brought his team to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; where he taught them to channel their fury and use their assets to fight individually and as a team. The amnesiac human later leads Rehgar's team to victory in a &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt; tournament at &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, gaining Rehgar a fortune in gambling winnings. After the tournament, Rehgar takes his team to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; in order to find a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; gladiator to take the place of &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, whom he sold to another gladiator master. On the way there, the human (dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt;\" by the spectators at Dire Maul, a name which stuck) and his teammate &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; request to visit the haunted &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them hope to discover answers by taking part in a ritual there--Lo'Gosh hopes to fill in the missing pieces of his memory, and Broll hopes to commune with the spirit of his deceased daughter. Rehgar grants their request and visits with his friend, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;. After Lo'Gosh and Broll defeat a mysterious elemental monster that has taken up residence in the Pools of Vision, the gladiators are taken to see Hamuul and Rehgar. After conversing for a time, Hamuul gives Lo'Gosh the feather of a &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; as a gesture of thanks for destroying the monster. Rehgar knows that Hamuul's purpose in the gift is that it can be used by his gladiators, through Broll's druidic powers, to summon a hippogryph that will carry them to freedom, but says nothing at the time.\nLo'Gosh and Broll took flight on the back of the hippogryph &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt; and Rehgar sent his guards to recapture them. However, it appeared as though Rehgar privately hoped his fighters would successfully escape. After Hamuul observes that Rehgar does not appear concerned by the loss of his slaves, Rehgar replies as follows:\n\"At Dire Maul, I recouped my investment in those two a thousand times over. I knew this day was coming. A man is truly a prisoner only as long as he agrees to remain one. After that, in his heart, at least, he is free. And where his heart is, his body may follow if his will is strong enough.\"\nFollowing their escape, Rehgar realized that since his \"heart was with them instead of the profit he could have made from their service\", that he has had his fill of battle and the Crimson Ring. He has thus retired as a gladiatorial master and offering his services to Thrall, has been made the Warchief's trusted advisor. Rehgar and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; used to be in disagreement with each other: while Garrosh wanted to destroy the Alliance, who he considers the Horde's enemies, and take Azeroth for their own, Rehgar wanted to remain open to diplomacy with the Alliance and conserve their treaty of non-agression with &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Rehgar later accompanied Thrall and Garrosh to Theramore for a summit with King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The summit turned disastrous however, as &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; agents posing as member races of each faction attacked all the delegates; leaving both factions in distrust of one another. Later on, Garrosh, who was angry at losing face at Theramore and Thrall's continuing tolerance and cooperation with the Alliance, began to openly challenge Thrall's leadership when they returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Rehgar advised Thrall to make an example of Garrosh before his warmongering ideas spread. Thrall concurred and lured Garrosh to challenge him to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Before the duel could be concluded however, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked Orgrimmar and Rehgar was among the many defending Orgrimmar against them.\nHe later becomes a member of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; in Thrall's stead and helped to defend Theramore several times and ultimately, he aided &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; in defeating &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm and aftermath.\nJoining to the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Rehgar traveled to Maelstrom shortly after the Shattering. There he, &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; and others shamans tried to help Thrall during his failures. When Thrall returned from his epic journey to Maelstrom, Rehgar was happy to see him and he, alongside &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; were the first to know that Thrall is now Go'el.\nRehgar learned about the fall of Theramore and was worried about what Garrosh would do next.\nLegion.\nRehgar is one of the few surviving members of the Earthen Ring after the catastrophic battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nRehgar and an elemental shaman &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; journey to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, which belonged to &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; and was placed in the care of &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; after his defeat. However, Xuen required that whoever sought to wield the weapons must pass a trial. Rehgar said that since he trained Varian, the adventurer was in good hands. Together, Rehgar and the adventurer brought down &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; (who Rehgar seemed to have a rivalry with) and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt;, earning them the Fist of Ra. After retrieving the weapon, the Burning Legion attacked the temple and were fought off.\nDuring the conversation with the Tidehunter, &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, Nobundo told him that they must reunite the four Elemental Lords. The Tidehunter discarded the idea as Rehgar insulted him that they would rather be slaves to the &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Dark Titan&lt;/a&gt; as enslaved to &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;. He participates in the battle in the Elemental Plane of fire to provide the Farseer support to recruit the new Elemental Lord of Fire, &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s are reunited by the Farseer an impressed Rehgar declares that it has been an honor to behold their accomplishments. He then becomes a &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers%23Champions\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of the Earthen Ring.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Rehgar carried the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Doomhammer (artifact)&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a shaman, representing the Earthen Ring.\nDragonflight.\nHaving joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, Rehgar was one of the many who journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where he would come to reside within the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27iri%20Springs\"&gt;Ohn'iri Springs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. He was impressed by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Clan Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt;, declared them to be masters of the wind, and believed that they could learn much from one another. He also discovered that the clan did not think kindly of storm magic, a fact that he preferred not to think about.\nRehgar was present at the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. He was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Zor%20Lonetree\"&gt;Zor Lonetree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terga%20Earthbreaker\"&gt;Terga Earthbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nThe weapons of the storm await us, &lt;name&gt;!\nDragonflight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; are truly masters of the wind.

The girl had been born by the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Aggra initially stayed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to care for her and &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;, but she later joined her life-mate on .\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and his family moved to a farm near &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Rehze and Durak often played in the pools near the farm, and Aggra taught both of them to weave. When Thrall returned to Azeroth to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, his family stayed in Nagrand.\nYears later, Rehze and her family were among the guests at &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s wedding at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; noted that the youngsters seemed to be well behaved. As Durak approached the age for the &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt; rite, his parents brought him and Rehze to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; to introduce them to &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and an orc &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; came to Drek'Thar to discuss bringing back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. Young Rehze was still shy at this point: she hid behind her mother when Aggra asked her to say hello to Eitrigg, and she blushed and looked away whenever the adventurer tried to talk to her.\nThe meeting resulted in the decision to bring back the Kosh'harg as well as introduce the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt; rite. While Thrall and Eitrigg gathered the clans, Rehze, her family, and the adventurer returned to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Tusk\"&gt;Broken Tusk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Aggra left to prepare the om'gora while the adventurer flew with Rehze and Durak to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; on the family's &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s. On arrival, Durak stayed to keep an eye on his sister while the adventurer went to begin the om'gora.

He is known for his overuse of the jasmine perfume. He wears a hood over his head. He often made fun of his companions' bickering, because he is bored most of the time.\nBiography.\nLife and undeath.\nReigol Valdread was born in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; where he joined the , being the elite and killing only those that threatened His Majesty and the nation. He reported to and served directly under King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who made him a baron. At some point after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he dueled with &lt;a href=\"Marjani%20Flintwill\"&gt;Marjani Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Makemba\"&gt;Makemba&lt;/a&gt;\", and they made love afterward. As a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, Varian sent him to the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He later returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to relate intelligence of Lordaeron, and as he was pushing to 40, Varian was curious whether he would retire now and finally enjoy the title. But that did not happen as he volunteered to investigate the rumors of the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron.\nWhile there, he fell to &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and was raised as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, killing people he once loved. He was later found by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who he praises, and who used her power to free his mind, will, and soul, becoming a Forsaken and swearing fealty to the Banshee Queen. He then assisted her in fights in the north but eventually grew bored, so he asked her to release him from his vow. She begrudgingly agreed, and he left the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a mercenary and paid assassin, traveling across Azeroth and eventually being hired by &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nReigol approached &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Cobb\"&gt;Jonas Cobb&lt;/a&gt;, ship on the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\", and struck a deal with him in &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt;. With Cobb's knowledge, the Hidden aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Inevitable\"&gt;Inevitable&lt;/a&gt;\" attacked \"Wavestrider\" and killed everyone except for &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hidden tracked them into the &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; forest and captured their new companion, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;.

While explaining the deal - Aram's compass for Murky, Throgg gathered the body pieces and the undead placed them back and left.\nHe then followed the rest of the Hidden to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and watched as Malus killed King Gordok.

If the subject\u2019s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return has no problems. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature\u2019s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature\u2019s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes an hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated (the body may no longer be of his previous race). The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities and the like, but it doesn\u2019t automatically speak the language of the new form. Common incarnations include, ironforge dwarves, high elves, night elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, humans, kobolds, murlocs, orcs, pandaren, tauren, troggs, and jungle trolls. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any skills it formerly possessed. A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.\nA creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can\u2019t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders and undead creatures can\u2019t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.\nReincarnation.\nThe tauren chieftains hold such sacred bonds with their Earthmother that they can actually be reincarnated after they die in combat. Though this ability is very rare, it makes the wise, benevolent chieftains a dangerous foe to threaten."}

Throughout Revendreth one sees sinstones, which represent the souls that have left Revendreth cleansed of sin. The venthyr &lt;a href=\"Maneo\"&gt;Maneo&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of assigning sinstones to souls, where each soul is forced to chisel their sins into their stone, handed to them by a &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;.\nSinstones bear the true name and sins of a &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt;, as souls are given a new name if they become a venthyr, requiring both being redeemed during the Ritual of Judgment and chosen to be sired by another venthyr. Traditionally, the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temel\"&gt;Temel&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of publicly announcing the true name and sins of every single soul that has ever passed through the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt;. Souls that become venthyr are usually kept within the Sinstone Archive, maintained by &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Fane\"&gt;Archivist Fane&lt;/a&gt;, in both the Halls of Atonement and &lt;a href=\"Archivam\"&gt;Archivam&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20Ward\"&gt;Catacombs Ward&lt;/a&gt;. Sinstones of powerful venthyr tend to go \"missing\", stolen for fear of their sinstone being used against them, including compeling souls into service and submission. Sinstones can also be abused by being bound to their soul, as well as corrupting a bound sinstone with more anima and through the sins of others, which can lead to instability and self destruction of the soul, which can lead souls to be condemned to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; once knew the contents and locations of every sinstone in Revendreth dating back to the foundation of the realm, essentially having all the Sinstone Archives memorized, but her time in the Maw has altered her memory temporarily.\n&lt;a href=\"Sinstone%20golem\"&gt;Sinstone golems&lt;/a&gt; are generated through the unresolved sins of those souls who failed their redemption and were condemned to the Maw and can grow more powerful if exposed to anima. or they can amalgam into a construct due to the anima inherent in any sinstone either over time or through an accelerated alchemic process. It seems the size of the sinstone corresponds to the amount of sins. The readable sinstones found throughout the zone, except for Houndmaster Loksey's and Prince Kael'thas's, are the objectives for &lt;a href=\"Census%20of%20Sins\"&gt;Census of Sins&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; one finds the &lt;a href=\"Sinstone%20of%20Revendreth\"&gt;Sinstone of Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the sinstones of every sin that the Harvesters are charged with and duties otherwise.\nKnown.\nObjects.\n\"Note: All of these objects can be read.\""}

Until recently, she was believed dead. Her experiments led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, through which she planned to rule Azeroth. Her plans never came to fruition, and she was killed during the destruction of her own creation, the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. However, recent events have revealed that she was reanimated by the power of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe reanimated Sinestra served as the broodmother of the twilight dragons that fought in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;War against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, giving birth to many offspring from within the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers found their way to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Caverns\"&gt;Twilight Caverns&lt;/a&gt; below and slew Sintharia and her clutch with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;. Years after her death, she allegedly was still whispering to &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt;, one of her children, from beyond the grave. \nBiography.\nEarly history.\nSintharia was once the prime consort of Neltharion, who later came to be known as . She gave birth to some of Deathwing's most despicable children including and his sister, . After Neltharion's madness overtook him and the rest of the black dragonflight, the newly disfigured Deathwing attempted to mate with his consorts, causing Sintharia a great deal of pain and leaving behind scars and marks that would continue to burn for (at least) the rest of her natural life. Sintharia was the only mate known to have survived.\nApproximately five hundred years prior to the opening of the Dark Portal, Sintharia attempted to bring down the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; with a curse that left the wizards unable to use their magic. Her scheme was foiled in part by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, consort to Alexstrasza, and when Sintharia was defeated, most believed her to be dead. She survived, however, and forsook her mate and children, taking on the guise of Lady Sinestra, a name she came to use as a dragon as well due to distaste for her own.\nThough the Black Dragonflight is in the process of dying out, that isn't stopping Deathwing from trying to keep it alive. Sinestra's children, Nefarian and Onyxia, have continued their plan of domination even in their father's absence. But Nefarian fell, leaving nobody behind to continue Deathwing's plans. Sinestra, on the other hand, wasn't beholden to Deathwing at all, or so she thought, though she hated her former mate.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAfter the death of Nefarian, Sinestra reemerged hoping to continue her family's plan of creating a superior dragonflight to rule over Azeroth. She traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs to trade the services of the black flight for &lt;a href=\"netherwing\"&gt;netherwing&lt;/a&gt; eggs, in service of her master, Deathwing, and the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;- or so she claimed. At the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Dragonmaw Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, using her blood elven guise, met with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt; and presented herself as an emissary of the black dragonflight.\nNight of the Dragon.\nOnce the nether eggs had been gathered, Sinestra took them to Grim Batol - the same place that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; had been imprisoned many years before. The place itself was viewed as cursed by the dwarves who once used to inhabit it, so the black dragon wouldn't be interrupted while she continued her work. In addition to the netherwing eggs, Sinestra had another ace in the hole: a full-grown Nether Dragon she had captured named &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the various eggs she had collected, Sinestra used a magical artifact called &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt; and the fused together shards of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to extract the essence of Zzeraku and infuse it into the eggs. It was not only a continuation of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;s efforts in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, but also the combination of Netherwing energies along with the draconic eggs created the most vicious dragonflight Azeroth had ever encountered, the Twilight Dragonflight. Despite Sinestra's claim that the experiment had been her idea, it was revealed that Deathwing had planted the idea in her mind, just as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; had convinced Deathwing to forge the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. \nSinestra wasn't alone in her efforts. Assisting her was the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, desperate for magical energy to sate his addiction and willing to ally with anyone in order to take care of the issue. Along with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the mountain of Grim Batol had come under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDargonax, her ultimate creation, was frustrated with Sinestra's attempts to control him and turned on his \"mother\" after Vereesa managed to shatter the Demon Soul for a second time. Iridi used the powers of her staff and the last shards of the Demon Soul to destroy the Twilight Drake. When Dargonax's already unstable powers finally destabilized, he burned away, taking his \"mother\" with him. Korialstrasz believed that Sintharia's last, angered glance may have been at him.\nCataclysm.\nSinestra thought she was turning her back on her flight and creating a flight of her own; in reality, she was simply responding to the machinations and whispers of her former mate. Even the name \"twilight dragonflight\" had been a suggestion of Deathwing, who actually got the idea from his Old God masters. Deathwing now had his superior flight of dragons, for the caverns below Grim Batol were filled with eggs left over from Sinestra's experiments. He also had a method of creating more, something that is discovered in the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists recovered the broken corpse of Sintharia and pieced together and reanimated it with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magics, the powers of Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;Old God master&lt;/a&gt;. Now a ravaged husk of her former self, she retained a sliver of her former personality, but she was now an obedient servant of the cult. The Twilight's Hammer sought her knowledge of how to craft monsters. Thus, she continued building an entire flight of twilight dragons.\nSinestra oversees the creation of new twilight clutches. She is the 'true' final boss encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, accessible only after beating on Heroic difficulty. It is revealed that she's giving birth to a clutch of black dragon eggs that are to be turned into twilight dragon eggs, performing the duties once held by Alexstrasza in Grim Batol. Sinestra's fate is ultimately to be an egg factory for Deathwing and the Twilight Cult, producing black dragon eggs to be turned into twilight eggs.\nAt the outset of the battle, Sinestra is weakened from past battles and from nurturing the Twilight brood. During the fight, &lt;a href=\"Calen\"&gt;Calen&lt;/a&gt; also appears in his night elf guise. Sinestra siphons all the life energy from her eggs and shoots that energy at Calen. He dies and gives his power to the heroes of the Alliance and Horde, empowering them and giving them enough strength to finally vanquish Sinestra.\nLegion.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt;, Sintharia's whispers from beyond the grave sent her to lead the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and reborn twilight dragonflight in an attack against &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nSintharia had the unfortunate experience of surviving mating with Deathwing - a creature largely composed of molten lava. The experience left her with half of her face literally melted away, and the scars on her face and body continued to burn, thousands of years later - more than enough to drive Sintharia completely insane. Besides that, there were voices speaking to her while she slept that assured her creating a new dragonflight was a very good idea. After Sinestra got reanimated during Cataclysm she performs the duties once held by Alexstrasza in Grim Batol. Sinestra's fate, ultimately, is as an egg factory for Deathwing and the Twilight Cult, producing black dragon eggs to be turned into twilight eggs. She will have her flight of children - but her sanity is far gone, her body in tatters, and her mind apparently devoted to Deathwing entirely. Much like her children Nefarian and Onyxia, Sinestra now appears only to serve Deathwing, and Deathwing alone. Whether her devotion is borne of newfound appreciation for her mate or of the combination of Deathwing's might and the Old God's control is uncertain, but as long as she lives, she will continue to produce her beloved Twilight children until the fall of Azeroth is a certainty."}

He was one of the paladins who witnessed - and agreed with - &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s rejection of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s proposal to &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;purge Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. He was present throughout as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Third%20War%23Scourge%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He witnessed &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal when he sent a large supply of plagued grain to a village he was defending. He received word that Prince Arthas returned from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and murdered his father; Thomas believed that the foundation for the crime had begun long before he'd sailed for Northrend, if Stratholme was any indication. Five days later he was informed that Arthas had murdered Uther and many other paladins had been killed.\nDesperate to keep his family safe, he ordered his wife to flee to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, following Jaina, while he remained in Lordaeron with the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Scourge. Over the next four years, alongside the other paladins following the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas constantly fought against the Scourge under &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;'s wing, a man he looked up to. Eventually, though the Silver Hand was broken when &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; murdered his father with the Ashbringer, and the founding members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, heeding &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;'s testimony, left. Thomas stayed to join the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, however, Saidan Dathrohan led Thomas and others to a town full of refugees, who let them in under the assumption that it was just another plague check. Dathrohan gradually convinced Thomas that the population was infected, and unlike Stratholme, Thomas helped to slaughter the refugees.\nHe then accidentally killed his own family before he realized it was them, his daughter turning to look him in the face just as his sword struck her down last. He came to the conclusion that when he had put them on the last ship fleeing to Kalimdor, a storm that had been approaching at the time must have arrived sooner than expected and damaged it before it could leave. With Lordaeron in chaos, there would have been no shipwrights to repair it, and the other ships would have been too full, forcing the former passengers to hide wherever they could.\nBroken, he was taken back to the Scarlet Monastery where he finally went mad. Believing the entire world to be infected and speaking in rhyme, he alone was the only being that could save them. After killing many of his former comrades on &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;, he was confronted and beheaded. Dathrohan decided to give the fallen crusader an honorable burial. Once entombed and alone with the body, Dathrohan (who in truth was &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; disguised as the fallen general) used his own blood and &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies to raise Thomas' corpse creating the &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt; with his own mad free will.\nQuotes.\nFor ages, I was lost.

Apparently resenting Maiev deeply for what she perceived as her having abandoned them, saddling Sira with the burden of leadership, a perceived abandonment by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and feeling the despair of death, she is now dedicated to killing her former leader and serving the Banshee Queen. \nShe was tasked by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; with killing the loa of death &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; but ultimately failed, was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and then sent to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result, she could identify the wielder of any moonglaive by the weapon alone.\nSira was present at the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, where she and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; helped the adventurers against the minions of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. She later traveled to and could be found at &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in and &lt;a href=\"Yrel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Yrel's Watch&lt;/a&gt; in .\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Sira became the interim leader of &lt;a href=\"the%20Wardens\"&gt;the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; was missing. Sira herself was stationed on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. She asked the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; for help to deal with enemies on the Isle and in the &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Marsh\"&gt;Tidal Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the burning of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev, Sira, and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; spoke to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to try and convince him to assault &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. As the three night elves spoke to Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; went on ahead of the army to try and retake Darkshore herself. Maiev, Shandris, Sira, and an adventurer located Tyrande's ruined ship at the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt;, which contained a book about the ancient ritual of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The Night Warrior was the incarnation of Elune's wrath. The ritual to become the avatar of the Night Warrior was extremely dangerous, and even witnessing it would put you in danger. Legend said that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to carve out their empire. None who have attempted the ritual since then have survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart. Upon journeying to Darkshore, Maiev tasked Sira with scouting the coast while she and Shandris went further inland. Sira expressed concern that Elune had not watched over the night elves during the War of the Thorns.\nSira confronted and fought off a Horde adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; that were aiming to raise &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;, but was killed. Her last words were disbelief that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; had not arrived to help her. Very soon afterward Tyrande, empowered by the Night Warrior, did arrive and battle Nathanos, but despite Tyrande's efforts the Val'kyr succeeded in raising not only Delaryn, but Sira as well, both as &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt;. Sira accused Tyrande and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; of abandoning her and declared that she was now a Dark Warden of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. She left the battlefield with the Horde.\nSira served as the Horde commander in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, opposite Maiev. She accused Maiev of having abandoned the Wardens when Sira was left in charge. After Maiev led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to victory over the Horde, Sira and &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; Horde forces were able to escape and/or flee the battlefield.\nShadows Rising.\nIn contrast with other &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; who stayed with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; out of loyalty, Sira joined the Banshee Queen due to a desire for the succor of flesh and blood. She and Nathanos were ordered by Sylvanas with killing the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, they allied with the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; rebels led by a witch known as &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;. When a Zandalari patrol found them, Nathanos ordered her to bring the \"&lt;a href=\"Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" to a nearby coast.\nIn order to weaken the protections around Bwonsamdi's shrines, Nathanos was forced to hand over something precious and irreplaceable to the witch. Thus, after a moment, he handed his officer's badge given to him by Sylvanas when they were among the Farstriders many years ago and warned Apari that if she failed to destroy the loa's shrines as promised, then the consequences would be severe. After the witch departed to begin her work, Nathanos instructed Sira to remind him to drown her in the bogs of Nazmir after their mission was complete.\nAs the Widow's Bite and the Banshee loyalists fought side by side, they finally clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, where they were discovered attempting to sacrifice children in order to weaken one of Bwonsamdi's shrines. In the end, this skirmish ended with the children saved, and Nathanos commanded his forces falling back. In the aftermath, Nathanos asked Sira if the theatrics with the children sated her bloodlust, causing her to wonder if he had a weak stomach. Nathanos was unmoved by the taught and reminded Sira that if the Zandalari were galvanized enough, they could pose a threat to their plans, especially if they acquired a few orc battalions.\nIn light of their alliance with the Widow's Bite, Sira revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lelyias\"&gt;Lelyias&lt;/a&gt; was a skilled healer who could help Apari with her leg injuries, however, the witch refused. This vexed Sira who noted that the Widow's Bite were loyal to Apari, that they would fall apart without her leaving the loyalists with no reinforcements, and more importantly, to Sira, was they needed the witch to survive until the loa Bwonsamdi was killed.\nAfter arriving at loa's &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos prepared traps, anticipating that Bwonsamdi could receive reinforcements. Unbeknownst to Sira, &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, the lieutenant of the Widow's Bite, had grown increasingly disgusted with Apari's tactics, especially those against children. When Apari sought to harm another child in order to summon Bwonsamdi, Sira witnessed Tayo stopping Apari. After Tayo left, Apari let her go as she believed that Tayo would simply return. When &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;Visrynn&lt;/a&gt; went to follow her, Nathanos called her off and told the dark ranger that they no longer needed her. When Bwonsamdi appeared, Nathanos gave the order to attack.\nUnknown to Nathanos, his decision to ignore Tayo would prove costly as she defected to the Horde, with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; later noting that her aid proved instrumental in saving them from Blightcaller's traps. Though caught off guard by the Horde and Zandalari reinforcements, Sira was determined to fight on. When the side turned against them, Sira called out for aid, only to reel in shock when Nathanos abandoned her, and left her ranting about how she wouldn't be &lt;a href=\"Where%20Hope%20Dies\"&gt;abandoned again&lt;/a&gt;. Her broken state of mind allowed Thrall to quickly knock her out and capture her. Soon Sira was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; custody as the beginning payment of what was owed by the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; revealed what Thrall wanted of her to which &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; agreed but first, he sought a word with her. Anduin demanded to know where Sylvanas was, and Sira declared that she was nowhere they could find her and that they had already lost. In response, Anduin attempted to use magic against her which made Sira laugh, declaring once more that they had already lost, and that Anduin would serve well. She was subsequently placed in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;s and soon after visited by Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. When Tyrande mentioned that she saw Sira as a sad and defeated thing that had chosen a path, Sira grew outraged and declared that she hadn't chosen to return, would never choose to return, and how everything inside her is ugliness and rage, and the only thing that quiets the screams is death. She further declared that for what was done to her, she saw a hundredfold done upon this realm.\nMaiev mentioned to Tyrande that she had lived a life consumed by vengeance and though there was no great love between them, she had no desire to see Tyrande become what she was.

{"id": "670018", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=670018", "title": "Sire Denathrius (tactics)", "text": "Sire Denathrius is the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;. The Master of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; has fallen prey to the very sins he was meant to excise from others, now seeking to rule the realms. As the one responsible for the severe &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought throughout the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, and one of &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s foremost allies, Denathrius must be overthrown if the &lt;a href=\"Covenants\"&gt;Covenants&lt;/a&gt; are to prevail against the Jailer.\nThe battle against Denathrius is a very long one which consists of 3 different phases. Phase 1 revolves around the raid managing their Burden of Sin stacks and avoiding Denathrius' sneak attacks. Phase 2 involves battling Denathrius, his living sword &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;, and his loyal followers, while using the room's teleportation mirrors to dodge his Hands of Destruction spells. The final phase is a race to finish him off as the room becomes filled with blood.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"For countless ages, Sire Denathrius stood among the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; who rule the realms of Death. But in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;' darkest hour, he has betrayed his sacred duty. With his bloodthirsty living blade &lt;a href=\"%3ARemornia\"&gt;:Remornia&lt;/a&gt; at his side and defended by his most sycophantic loyalists, Denathrius will cut a swath through any who stand against him and cast their remains into the inescapable terror of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires 2 tanks. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be saved for the final phase where the raid begins to run out of room the longer the phase goes on for. The raid should have enough ranged DPS to kill the Crimson Cabalists in the 2nd phase that are beyond the melee players' reach. Denathrius has a unique skill, Inevitable, which will allow him to instantly teleport to the target of his aggro no matter where they are.\nPhase 1.\nThe fight starts in a round room, with Denathrius fighting the raid and his sword Remornia standing in the center. Random players will be targeted by Feeding Time, causing circles to appear underneath them. 5 seconds later, the boss will strike each player and heal for 150% of the damage caused to all players in the circle. Simply move out of the raid to minimize raid damage. This phase has a hard timer due to Remornia's Ravage cast: After a 6 second cast, Remornia will fill one third of the room with blood which does heavy damage to those within it. After 3 casts, the raid will wipe. The raid must get Denathrius down to 70% health to transition him to Phase 2 prior to the third Ravage, but they cannot do this unless everyone has 2 or less Burden of Sin stacks.\nBurden of Sin and the Transition: Each member of the raid starts with 4 Burden of Sin stacks. These stacks serve to slow your movement speed during the transition from Phase 1 to 2. During the transition, Denathrius will knock all raid members to the wall, &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt; them, and command them to come to the center of the arena where it is safe, channeling for 15 seconds. If a player has too many stacks, they will be too slow to reach the center by the time the boss finishes and they will die. Players must have a maximum of 2 stacks to survive.\nManaging Burden of Sin: To clear your stacks, players need to be struck by the boss' Cleansing Pain attack. This is a frontal cone that targets the tanks and players near them in a cone. Being hit will drop a stack from each player hit, but also cause an Echo of Sin add to spawn. These are low health mobs, but deal high AOE damage and can potentially be lethal if too many players are hit at once. Thus, to ensure everyone loses stacks at a steady rate, but the Echoes are kept manageable, the raid should be divided into 2 teams, each with 1 tank: One group to take 2 Cleansing Pain attacks first, and the other takes the last 2. However, this also has a caveat due to the Blood Price spell.\nBlood Price stuns each player for 3 seconds, lifts them into the air, and tosses them back, dealing higher damage the more people there are with the same amount of Burden of Sin stacks. If everyone has the same amount, this ability becomes lethal. To counter this, ensure each of the 2 groups has a different number of stacks at all times. This is done by having the first two Cleansing Pains hit Group 1, and the last two Cleansing Pains hitting Group 2. This will ensure the damage from Blood Price is kept to a minimum.\nNote that the transition can be cheesed by &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; who activate &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;Death's Advance (death knight ability)&lt;/a&gt; prior to being silenced. The same is true for players who chose the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=\"Soulshape\"&gt;Soulshape&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shamans\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt; who use &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; prior to the silence. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; healers who make it to the center can also use &lt;a href=\"Leap%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Leap of Faith&lt;/a&gt; to pull players who have too many stacks inside the safe zone for the transition.\nBy the time everyone only has 2 stacks, (making the transition survivable) the boss should be just about at 70%. Ensure everyone is topped up, head to the center during the transition, and Phase 2 will begin.\nPhase 2.\nAll players who made it safely to the center of the arena will drop down into a new one, with a large central area, and 4 walkways that lead to 4 mirrors at the ends. These mirrors serve as teleporters to the mirror at the opposite edge of the room, which will become vital during this phase. Remornia will become active and start attacking the raid, applying hard-hitting &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; stacks. These can be removed either by a &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; player's &lt;a href=\"Phial%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Phial of Serenity&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; player's &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt;, or simply allowing the debuff to drop off after 15 seconds. Meanwhile, Denathrius replaces Cleansing Pain with Wracking Pain, a frontal cone that increases all damage taken. Tanks typically want to swap every single application of Wracking Pain.\nThe DPS will want to focus on the Crimson Cabalists, adds which do nothing except channel Shadow damage to the entire raid. Two will spawn next to a mirror, and 1 other will spawn across a chasm which only ranged players can target. The tank holding Denathrius should draw him close to the adds to be cleaved while the DPS focus on the adds, keeping him faced away from the DPS to avoid them being hit by Wracking Pain. However, Wracking Pain can also hit the adds, increasing their damage taken by 50%. Communicate with the raid so that the DPS quickly move out of the way, and the tank can strike both adds at once, helping them go down quickly.\nThe raid will typically want to stand close to the mirrors for Hand of Destruction. Denathrius will pull all players to his location, leaving an afterimage that will explode after 6 seconds, dealing lethal damage to those close by and moderate damage to those far away. Use the mirrors to teleport away. The boss' Inevitable skill will activate, allowing him to follow the raid instantly across the room.\nRemornia: Denathrius' sword will not just be attacking the off-tank, but also using abilities of her own. Impale will cause Remornia to temporarily become unhittable and target 3 random players. A few seconds later, she will rush through these players, one after the other in a line indicated by arrows on the floor, and apply a bleed to anyone hit. Keep one side of the arena clear so people who are targeted by Impale can safely move to the side without fear of hitting anyone else. She will also periodically use Massacre, creating lines on the floor that will be slashed through with massive swords after a few seconds. Be ready to dodge, especially if the raid is clumped close together as there will be a lot of sword-lines close to each other, which could potentially make it difficult to dodge.\nIdeally, this phase should only see about 3-4 waves of Crimson Cabalists, killing any remaining adds as the boss reaches 40% health. Any additional adds who are still alive during the transition will remain in Phase 3, which can be disasterous for multiple reasons: The last phase is a hard race against time where all DPS needs to be alive and focused on the boss. There is also a large amount of raid-wide damage going out in Phase 3 which, when combined with the Crimson Cabalists' passive Shadow damage, can easily prove lethal. Watch DPS, be patient, and wait for a moment to perform a clean transition.\nPhase 3.\nDenathrius will teleport to the center of the arena, shatter the mirrors, and cause red fog to envelop the outer edges of the arena, beginning the final phase. He will now wield Remornia, reducing his attack speed, but drastically increasing his attack power. His attacks also apply a stacking DOT called Scorn. Tanks typically want to swap at 4-6 stacks to keep damage low.\nIn addition, Denathrius also gains two of Remornia's abilities: Massacre from Phase 2 and Ravage from Phase 1. Both of these abilities are the same, including the hard enrage that Ravage creates from slowly covering the arena in damaging blood. Three uses of Ravage and the raid will wipe, so Bloodlust should be used at the start of this phase. Dodge Massacre as normal.\nIn addition to keeping his Hand of Destruction cast, which the raid now needs to run away from normally instead of using mirrors, the boss will also gain a few final abilities. Fatal Finesse will mark 3 players with large circles. Similar to Feeding Time, this only deals damage to those caught in the circle, so step out of the raid to avoid damaging teammates. Lastly is Shattering Pain, which hits the tank with heavy physical damage, then damages and knocks back all players. Players should be mindful to never stand too close to the edge of the arena, as Shattering Pain could potentially knock them over the side. Tanks should position the boss closer to the center when he uses Shattering Pain, but closer to the edge when using Hand of Destruction to keep raid damage at a minimum.\nThis last phase is about being mindful of the limited space the raid has to work with, and using it to its full potential: Keeping Fatal Finesses away, knowing where to run during Hand of Destruction, and keeping DPS high to beat the enrage. If all these steps are followed, Denathrius should go down."}

They have the upper bodies of female &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s, with wings in place of arms and snake- or fish-like lower bodies, and possess magical voices with which they can enslave other beings and lure ships into shipwrecks. They are considered a plague on the seas and a danger to all seafarers.\nBackground.\nSirens are mainly found in coves in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fogcliff%20Strand\"&gt;Fogcliff Strand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Tideway\"&gt;Wailing Tideway&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Wanderer's Cove&lt;/a&gt;) in camps made of debris from the wrecks they cause. A few live near the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and one is found on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;. They are not found on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; sailors know of them and refer to them as bwon'tulak, meaning \"death singers\" in &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;.\nSirens use their enchanting song voices to lure passing ships into shipwrecks so that they can eat or enslave their crews. Hearing a siren's song causes the victim (regardless of gender) to fall madly in love with the creature and become her thrall. The thrall will fight on the siren's behalf out of a desire to protect her, impress her, or out of a jealous belief that enemies are rival suitors trying to steal her. The enchantment can be broken by killing the controlling siren or by offering the thrall something they find even more alluring (like grog). Even after the siren is killed, the charm may linger on the victim for a while; &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; described this as feeling like \"a good hangover and a bad breakup put together\". Since the enchantment is caused by hearing the sound of the creatures' voices, deaf people are unaffected. Earplugs also work as a defense. Sirens can also use their voices in combat by releasing damaging screams and sonic missiles on enemies, and some have power over water magic.\nSiren elders are called \"sisters\". They are bigger, smarter, and stronger than younger sirens, and their voices carry far out to sea and bring in all the big \"catches\". According to &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20the%20Ancestral\"&gt;Wayne the Ancestral&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Siren\"&gt;Enchanting Siren&lt;/a&gt; in Stormsong Valley was once a maiden fond of song who fell into the sea alongside a \"leering idol\" and was transformed into the sirens' queen and slave.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Joseph\"&gt;Brother Joseph&lt;/a&gt; can summon sirens to aid him.\nA few sirens have found a more peaceful use for their voices by becoming singers in dive bars."}

It can be found on the city's lower levels, and borders two other residential districts in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt; across the canals to the east and north respectively.\nSiren's Vigil has significant access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds much of the district, and possesses two separate jetties for accommodating transport boats. The commune is also notable for housing a school for nightborne children, including a classroom and an outdoor playground. \nHistory.\nThe lack of strategic value and peripheral location of Siren's Vigil meant it received relatively little attention from either side when the civil war known as the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; erupted in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Inhabited Suramar's lower classes, the vigil, along with neighboring districts, did serve as sources of support for the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt; against the tyrannical rule of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs part of their attempt to suppress dissent, the regime began to cut off the vital &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; supply to these districts. Following the continuing success of the insurrection, Elisande and Suramar's leaders resorted to even more extreme tactics. This culminated in a wholesale massacre orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; forces on orders from the Grand Magistrix. As a result, a large amount of civilians were slaughtered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and Siren's Vigil, with the particular aim of wiping out the Nightfallen base at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Siren's Vigil was heavily occupied by demons and nightborne security forces. The deaths of the residents of these districts ultimately worked against Elisande's cause, driving even more nightborne into the rebel camp, and eventually helping to topple her regime."}

There are two types of peels.\nThe first type of peel usually involves another player intercepting and gaining &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; from a given mob (in essence, \"peeling\" the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; off that player) who is attacking one of the more &lt;a href=\"squishy\"&gt;squishy&lt;/a&gt; members of the group. This role or action is most commonly filled by a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; in the raid environment where peeling mobs off an initial aggro target to a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; is a common step in the pulling of many boss encounters that have multiple mobs involved. A boss where you might see a peel implemented is &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;. In a PvP environment this can be achieved with methods of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; such as stuns, slows and the death knight spell &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt;\nThe other kind of peel is known as a self peel whereby you remove the player or mob from yourself. In PvE an example of this is the priest spell &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt; or in a PvP environment the paladin spell &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, druids &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt; and warlocks ."}

{"id": "652960", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=652960", "title": "Pelagos", "text": "Pelagos is an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20One\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, the being who rules over the Eternal City of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; and is responsible for judging mortal &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and assigning them to appropriate afterlives. He was formerly a mere aspirant of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; who struggled to find his place in the afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, but who\u2014alongside his &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014found himself caught up in the momentous events unfolding across the Shadowlands. He volunteered to become the Arbiter in order to fill the vacancy created by the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;previous Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. As an aspirant, Pelagos was known for his hope and compassion, qualities he retains in his new role.\nAs a kyrian, Pelagos is one of the soulbinds available to members of the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Together with Kleia, he can be invited to the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Court\"&gt;Ember Court&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIn his mortal life, Pelagos presented as a woman, though he doesn't remember what his name or race was. He never felt that his body represented who he was inside and struggled with that identity his whole life. After his death, his soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and was reborn as a &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; with a male form. He was greatly excited by this, as it meant that his appearance finally matched who he was on the inside. He has noted that his mortal family likely wouldn't recognize him anymore.\nAs a kyrian, he befriended &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, another aspirant, and offered her support long after her first &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; ascended and she lost all contact with her. Pelagos and Kleia grew closer and eventually became soulbinds themselves. Pelagos struggled with the ascension rituals that all kyrian undergo, failing every time he attempted the Rite of Purity to cleanse himself of his memories. At times he worried that he'd never manage to become an &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt; and that he'd get sent back to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to be assigned to another afterlife, but Kleia assured him that he'd overcome his challenges.\nThe Path to Ascension.\nAt the same time as a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Bastion, Pelagos made another attempt at the Rite of Purity in &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Aspirant's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, but his violent &lt;a href=\"Manifestation\"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt; began to overwhelm him. Kleia couldn't help him, since it's forbidden for aspirants to intervene in each other's trials, but the Maw Walker was allowed to save him and bring him back to his soulbind. The Maw Walker had come to Bastion to inform &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20kyrian\"&gt;kyrian serving the Maw&lt;/a&gt;, but to get an audience with her they needed to walk the same path of ascension as the kyrian. Pelagos and Kleia accompanied them to the &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Crucible\"&gt;Aspirant's Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, where\u2014after they'd helped &lt;a href=\"Forgelite%20Sophone\"&gt;Forgelite Sophone&lt;/a&gt;\u2014they'd be put through a combat trial with &lt;a href=\"Athanos\"&gt;Athanos&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagos first sent the Maw Walker to spar with the other aspirants to test their stamina. The Maw Walker's undergoing of the trials attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"Kalisthene\"&gt;Kalisthene&lt;/a&gt;, who simply said she'd shared the Maw Walker's news with the Archon. After this disappointing reply, Pelagos and Kleia returned to &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Aspirant's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20Kosmas\"&gt;Disciple Kosmas&lt;/a&gt; had come with news about trouble at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the temple, &lt;a href=\"Eridia\"&gt;Eridia&lt;/a&gt; the Hand of Purity told Kleia to assist the Paragon &lt;a href=\"Vesiphone\"&gt;Vesiphone&lt;/a&gt;, and Pelagos and the Maw Walker to assist the struggling disciples in the temple grounds. They found that many of the aspirants were being overwhelmed by doubt, including Eridia's disciple &lt;a href=\"Nikolon\"&gt;Nikolon&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Maw Walker found talking to &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; before they brought him to Eridia. Eridia tried to cleanse Nikolon's doubt and asked the Maw Walker to help her, but told Pelagos to stay out of it, as she worried that he more \"fragile\" than most when it came to cleansing. The cleansing failed, the corrupted Nikolon left, and moments later the temple was attacked by an army of &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. Kleia helped Pelagos escape to safety while the Maw Walker helped Eridia confront the Forsworn and their leader &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nKleia and the Maw Walker later discovered that the Forsworn were planning an attack on another temple and met up with Pelagos and Kalisthene at &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Hero's Rest&lt;/a&gt; to get an audience with the Archon. The Maw Walker summoned &lt;a href=\"Adrestes\"&gt;Polemarch Adrestes&lt;/a&gt;, who escorted them to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; while Kleia and Pelagos flew there on Kleia's &lt;a href=\"larion\"&gt;larion&lt;/a&gt;. At the hold, the Archon finally appeared and told Adrestes to inspect the wards protecting Bastion's temples. He delegated the job to the Maw Walker, Pelagos, and Kleia. While they were inspecting the wards, Uther appeared and disabled the &lt;a href=\"Ward%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Ward of Courage&lt;/a&gt;. Adrestes immediately sent the outsider and the two soulbinds to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;, just in time for the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; invasion of the temple. Pelagos and Kleia initially helped the Maw Walker and &lt;a href=\"Thanikos\"&gt;Thanikos&lt;/a&gt; the Hand of Courage fight the invaders, but then retreated from the battle.\nChains of Domination.\nDuring the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, a Maw Walker obtained the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Justice\"&gt;lost soul fragment&lt;/a&gt; of Uther, who repented his actions among the Forsworn and needed help mending his soul. Pelagos, Kleia, Adrestes, and the Maw Walker tried to help him connect with the soul fragment, but the ritual failed. &lt;a href=\"Thenios\"&gt;Thenios&lt;/a&gt; concluded that Uther's memories had been twisted and that he needed to relive them in order to heal. The Maw Walker, Pelagos, and the others helped guide him through his past, eventually allowing him to start on the path to healing. Pelagos told Uther that he could rid himself of the painful memories in time, but he replied that they served as a lesson and that he'd never let them go if given the choice.\nThe kyrian had planned to name a new Paragon of Loyalty and retake the Forsworn-occupied &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Citadel of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; in order to recreate their lost &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;covenant sigil&lt;/a&gt;, but Uther's words caused Adrestes to realize that Bastion needed to follow a new path. Along with Nikolon and other Forsworn who regretted their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Adrestes told the Archon in Elysian Hold that the virtue of Loyalty should be replaced by Devotion. The Archon agreed and declared that from then on, all kyrian would be offered a choice between keeping their memories or letting them go. Adrestes would become the Paragon of Devotion and Kleia would be his Hand. Pelagos volunteered to stay in Elysian Hold and prepare for Adrestes' promotion ceremony while the others went to retake the Citadel of Loyalty and transform it into a Temple of Devotion.\nOnce this was done, Pelagos and the others gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt; to witness Adrestes' promotion and the recreation of the kyrian sigil. Pelagos exchanged some words with Nikolon, saying that he was glad the former disciple had returned to them, and Nikolon thanked him for his compassion. To the Maw Walker, Pelagos expressed pride over how far Kleia had come and admitted that he wasn't sure how he'd become involved in such momentous events since he was still just a struggling aspirant. He decided that he'd become one of the first acolytes of the Temple of Devotion and, along with Nikolon, help facilitate conversation between the newly reunited Forsworn and kyrian. However, he also stated that he felt that his journey was far from over. After the ceremony, Pelagos asked Uther what had happened to the soul of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and the Lightbringer revealed that he and &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; had cast it into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagos realized that Arthas could've had a chance at redemption if he'd been brought to the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; instead. He added that he didn't think any soul deserved to be sent to the Maw and that while some might never be forgiven, Uther had shown that they must at least be treated with compassion.\nPelagos also traveled to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in Korthia, where he wanted to help the local &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s by collecting offerings they'd left in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Guidance\"&gt;Sanctuary of Guidance&lt;/a&gt; and preserving some of the memories of attendants who'd died.\nEternity's End.\nInto the unknown.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; summoned a Maw Walker and various covenant representatives, including Pelagos and Kleia, to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal to pursue &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; into the land of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was for the Maw Walker to go through the portal alone and find a foothold so the covenants could follow them. However, as the hero prepared to leave, Pelagos unexpectedly asked the Primus for permission to accompany them, which the Eternal One granted. As the two were about to take off, the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; attacked and the kyrian and hero only just managed to fly through the portal before the Mawsworn disabled it, leaving them stranded on the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Inception\"&gt;Path of Inception&lt;/a&gt; in Zereth Mortis. There they encountered the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Firim&lt;/a&gt;, who got them to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Core%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;strange core&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Vestibule\"&gt;Genesis Vestibule&lt;/a&gt; for him and in exchange escorted them to his estranged kin, the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving. The Enlightened initially assumed Pelagos and the Maw Walker to be part of the Mawsworn attacking Haven, but the Maw Walker earned their trust by helping to defend the village. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ara\"&gt;Elder Ara&lt;/a&gt; brought the outsiders to an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waystone\"&gt;Ancient Waystone&lt;/a&gt; which the Maw Walker activated, allowing them and Pelagos to reunite with their allies in Oribos and bring them through to Haven.\nLater, Pelagos asked the Maw Walker to help him take care of the &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s, the other major threat to Zereth Mortis. Upon reaching the devourer-infested &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Fields\"&gt;Genesis Fields&lt;/a&gt;, the two heard a voice calling for help in the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20Nascence\"&gt;Cradle of Nascence&lt;/a&gt;. They helped defend the source of the voice\u2014an &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;automa oracle&lt;/a&gt;\u2014from devourers, but she fell unconscious despite their efforts. They brought her back to the Enlightened in Haven, who warned them against meddling with servants of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and refused to help, so instead they went looking for Firim in &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Exile's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, who was being beset by assassins from &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Xy\"&gt;Cartel Xy&lt;/a&gt;. While the Maw Walker helped Firim, Pelagos brought the oracle from Haven. Her presence activated the automa core the Maw Walker had obtained for Firim earlier, causing it to awaken into &lt;a href=\"Pocopoc\"&gt;Pocopoc&lt;/a&gt;, a small automa who led the hero and Firim on a trip around Zereth Mortis and began teaching the former how to understand the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Cypher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagos stayed with Firim in Exile's Hollow to keep watch over the oracle while the Maw Walker returned to Haven to report the news to &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelagos and Kleia accompanied the Maw Walkers' allies when they headed to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in Bastion to gaze into their memories and find a way to resist &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nThe new Arbiter.\nSome time later, the body of the oracle\u2014&lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt;\u2014started acting up and Firim sent Pelagos to fetch the Maw Walker from Haven. When they arrived with Pocopoc, Saezurah took control of the small automa and used it to guide the Maw Walker on a journey to the &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Peaks\"&gt;Resonant Peaks&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the dormant &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; and bring it back to Exile's Hollow. Pocopoc then released its gathered energy into Saezurah to revive her, and she revealed that the vessel would be used to create a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore balance to the Shadowlands, which had been in disarray ever since the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;previous Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; stopped directing souls. A dumbfounded Pelagos sent the Maw Walker to report this development to Bolvar while they waited for Saezurah to finish her preparations.\nWhen the time came, Pelagos summoned the Maw Walker back to Exile's Hollow, where Saezurah explained that the vessel needed to be filled with a soul from the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; in order to become an Arbiter. However, the Crypts had been overrun by Mawsworn, so they'd need the help of the covenants to get past them. Kleia went to rally the kyrian while Pelagos and the Maw Walker headed out to speak with the others: the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Catalyst%20Gardens\"&gt;Catalyst Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolords&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Esper\"&gt;Provis Esper&lt;/a&gt;. As they recruited each covenant, Pelagos reflected on the responsibility the Arbiter had over the Shadowlands and on how he hoped that every soul would be able to find redemption and their deserved afterlife. After some preparations, the covenants, Firim, and Saezurah fought their way through the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt; and entered the Crypts, where Pelagos helped the Maw Walker clear out some Mawsworn intruders and restore the flow of souls that the Mawsworn had tampered with.\nAs Pelagos, Kleia, and Firim watched, Saezurah and a group of &lt;a href=\"Automa%20Scryer\"&gt;automa scryers&lt;/a&gt; began the ritual to infuse the vessel. However, the ritual was interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Echo of Argus&lt;/a&gt; to take the vessel, killing the scryers and incapacitating everyone else but the Maw Walker in the process. The hero was able to defeat the echo with Pelagos and the others' aid, but the vessel was left without a soul and the scryers were irreparable. Kleia was at a loss for what to do, but Pelagos spoke up, saying there had \"always been just one path\". He then offered his own soul to be placed in the vessel in service to the Shadowlands. Kleia protested, unwilling to let him go, but Pelagos insisted that this was his purpose\u2014perhaps the reason he'd never been able to ascend in the first place\u2014and reminded her that, as soulbinds, they would never truly be apart. After exchanging a hug with Kleia, Pelagos went up to Saezurah, who greeted him as \"a worthy soul, pure and unburdened\" and placed his soul in the vessel, transforming him into the new Arbiter.\nThe transformed Pelagos retained his personality and identity and assured Kleia that he was still who he'd always been but also \"so much more\". After exchanging goodbyes, he traveled back to Oribos to take his place in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; and direct the flow of souls to the afterlives they deserved. The &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; became Pelagos' Honored Voice, just as she'd spoken on behalf of the previous Arbiter. Pelagos resolved to listen to the counsel of others before passing eternal judgment and, unlike the previous Arbiters, decided to give each soul a voice in which afterlife they wanted to be sent to. He also decided that no soul would ever again be sent to the Maw, as he believed that everyone deserved a chance at redemption and recent events had shown that every soul had the potential to change the fate of the Shadowlands.\nKleia mused that Pelagos had now ascended higher than any kyrian, and traveled with a Maw Walker to the Crucible to meet with him. Pelagos asked Kleia to tell &lt;a href=\"Adrestes\"&gt;Adrestes&lt;/a&gt; that he was sorry he couldn't become an acolyte of Devotion like he'd planned. He also thanked his friend the Maw Walker for helping him find his path, but then continued that the Jailer still had to be defeated in order to truly restore balance to the Shadowlands.\nJudgment of Sylvanas.\nWith help from their allies and the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walkers defeated the Jailer in the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, to begin healing the damage caused to the Shadowlands, the Jailer's former ally &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the Crucible to be judged by the Arbiter for her past crimes. Bolvar also traveled to Oribos and gave the Crown of Wills to the Arbiter. Pelagos invited a number of Azerothians and covenant representatives to the Crucible to witness the event.\nPelagos began by noting that Sylvanas' actions showed signs of the Jailer's influence, but she replied that she'd been in control of her own actions and that she'd accept the consequences for them. She then handed herself over to the judgment of her archenemy, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. After asking if there were any objections from the trial attendants and not receiving a response, Pelagos allowed Tyrande to decide on Sylvanas' punishment, as it was she and her people, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who'd been most wronged by Sylvanas and he trusted in Tyrande to make a wise decision. The night elf leader announced that Sylvanas would begin her penance by finding all of the souls that had been unfairly trapped in the Maw and send them to the Arbiter so he could send them to their rightful afterlives. Sylvanas agreed to this and disappeared into the Maw to begin her work.\nAfterward, Pelagos invited his Maw Walker friends to visit him in the Crucible whenever they chose, giving them free access to the previously-restricted chamber.\nSoulbind traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian Covenant&lt;/a&gt; members can &lt;a href=\"soulbind\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; with Pelagos after completing &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Meets%20Body\"&gt;Soul Meets Body&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nIn Haven:\nLater:\nOpening:\nEnding:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Take the portal back up to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt;, where a small gathering awaits: Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; are standing in front of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Pillar\"&gt;Soul Pillar&lt;/a&gt;, while Sylvanas is standing with &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance leaders &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt; are standing close together on the northern side of the gathering, the Horde leaders &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern side, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; on the southern side.\nJust as the player approaches, Sylvanas finishes a conversation with her sisters:\nAll of the characters present have unique gossip text here (except Dori'thur, since she's an owl). Much of it is faction-dependent. Jaina only speaks to Alliance players.\nA real-time cutscene plays.\nOn the other side of the cutscene, turn in to Tyrande. Upon completion, most of the gathered characters walk away in different directions. The Windrunner sisters and the night elves remain where they are.\nThe last line of dialogue depends on player's faction:\nShe, Shandris, and Maiev then walk off, use the portal down to the Ring of Fates, and disappear.\nPost-quest dialogue.\nAfter completing this last part of the expansion storyline, a number of \"Stay awhile and listen\" dialogues unlock around Oribos, similar to after &lt;a href=\"Covenants%20Renewed\"&gt;Covenants Renewed&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Characters with dialogues display a large icon above their head. The icon disappears after the first time the player triggers the dialogue, but the option remains permanently available from the NPCs in case the player wants to see the dialogue again. Unless otherwise noted, the NPCs continue to have the same initial gossip text as they did before the finale cutscene. The player also, for the first time, unlocks permanent access to the Crucible and can travel to and from it at will by talking to Tal-Inara in the Enclave."}

Cowardly, lazy, and slow-witted, they are typically unfit for warfare, but their work is simply indispensable. Without them, more able-bodied orcs would have to take precious time from their battles to do menial labor. This is why the importance of the peon is recognized in the holiday &lt;a href=\"Peon%20Day\"&gt;Peon Day&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, long years of service take a harsh toll, as most peons are physically bent from beatings and hard work. They trudge expressionlessly in their duty, a large sack slouched over malformed shoulders that are broader than any soldier's. \nPeons appeared as units on the Horde side in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;,\" and were voiced by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Roper\"&gt;Bill Roper&lt;/a&gt;. They are the classic counterpart to &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst War.\nThe lowliest of the Orcs, these dogs were good for little more than rough work. They were commanded to cut &lt;a href=\"Lumber\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; or mine the pits for &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. They also made strong laborers in the construction of all manner of buildings. They were all cowards, and would run like little children if attacked.\nSecond War.\nThe label of peon denoted the lowest station amongst those in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Inferior in all skills of import, these dogs were relegated to menial tasks such as harvesting &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; and mining &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Their labor was also required for the construction and maintenance of buildings necessary to support the vast undertakings of the Horde. Downtrodden, the orc peons slaved thanklessly to please their overseers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; captured and interrogated some peons of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; that Ner'zhul had sent against them as cannon fodder to delay the Alliance.\nThird War.\nThe label of Peon denotes the lowest station amongst those in the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Inferior in all skills of worth, these dredges are relegated to menial tasks such as harvesting lumber and mining gold. Their labor is also required for the construction and maintenance of buildings necessary to support the vast undertakings of the Horde. Downtrodden, but exceedingly loyal, the orc peons toil endlessly to provide for the greater Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Peon\"&gt;Chaos Peon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Orc%20Peon\"&gt;Fel Orc Peon&lt;/a&gt; in campaign missions have a different red skin color and glowing yellow eyes compared to normal orc peons. \n\"World of Warcraft\".\nAs their &lt;a href=\"manual\"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; description evolved over time, it seems that in the modern Horde peons are treated in a slightly gentler manner than before, an effort which could presumably be attributed to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, as was the case in the non-canon &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;. Peons are often under the watch of foremen, overseers, or &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20aristocracy%23Overlord\"&gt;overlord&lt;/a&gt;s, who ensure that they don't get too lazy or complacent, in which case they are punished using blackjacks or &lt;a href=\"booterang\"&gt;booterang&lt;/a&gt;s. Peons are, as such, sometimes unhappy with their situation, and sometimes gather enough self-confidence to try to progress in life. For example, &lt;a href=\"Murg%20Stonecrack\"&gt;Murg Stonecrack&lt;/a&gt; is a former peon who was promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"mining%20trainers\"&gt;mining trainer&lt;/a&gt; and allowed to boss around other peons.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Magrok\"&gt;Foreman Magrok&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; got angered by the way peons had been treated and demanded that the Horde gave them more respect and better working conditions.\nMost peons still have the same soundset and quotes as in \"Warcraft III\". Interestingly enough, many peons all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and also share the same face, maybe a nod from Blizzard to the fact that many &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; peasants share the same model.\nIn the RPG.\n\"Pity the poor peon, working from dusk to dawn, slaving away in the service of orc and Horde. Permanently bent from years of labor, the expressionless orc trudges in his duty, a large sack slouched over malformed shoulders that are broader than any soldier\u2019s.\"\nCommonly treated with contempt, the wise Horde chief knows that without these sturdy little guys, the Horde war machine would grind to a halt. They are nearly worthless in combat, which is why they prefer to hide in &lt;a href=\"Burrow\"&gt;Burrow&lt;/a&gt;s and throw &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;s out the windows, if it comes to that.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; respected peons and punished the orc captain &lt;a href=\"Narg%20Snarl\"&gt;Narg Snarl&lt;/a&gt; for disrespecting them."}

Always able to beat her brothers and sisters at skipping stones and other throwing games, she caught the eye of her uncle, a weapons engineer. He trained her in throwing knives and axes. Praising her sharp eye, he introduced her to bows. She worked a great deal on her upper body strength, and when she turned 15, her uncle gave her her first firearm. Although deadly with a knife or other thrown objects, she greatly prefers her gold-inlaid long rifle, a gift from her uncle when she entered the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces. The Alliance accepted her because they were desperate for soldiers, but didn\u2019t take her seriously.

Having turned away from the sethrak's &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt;, the Faithless and their emperor seek to conquer all of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and will not stop until they have conquered the world. They have allied themselves with the forces of &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; with the shared goal of breaking the seal on the great pyramid of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and unleashing &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;the monstrosity within&lt;/a&gt; in order to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Faithless' leader &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; was once one of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; charged with protecting &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, the tomb housing the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; after he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the sands continued to spread, Korthek grew hungry for war and plotted to unearth Mythrax and use him as a weapon to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. He raised an army of like-minded sethrak, and they began to slaughter those who opposed them. Keeper &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt; was the first to fall, but not before safeguarding one of the three keystones required to break the seal on Atul'Aman. The &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; who were still loyal to Sethraliss, led by Keeper &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, were forced out of their home and into hiding. They have been fighting the Faithless ever since. Since Korthek's betrayal, the Faithless have brought war upon the lands in search of the remaining keys to Atul'Aman, and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt; has become the last bastion for the Devoted.\nIn ages past, the Faithless attacked the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Port of Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Pirate-King%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Pirate-King Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. Refusing to let the sethrak take his home, Zem'lan used a set of cursed idols to transform his crew into &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20troll\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to retain control of the port for all eternity.\nIn the current day, one force of Faithless led by &lt;a href=\"Fangcaller%20Sraka\"&gt;Fangcaller Sraka&lt;/a&gt; mercilessly attacked a &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; caravan at the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Burrows\"&gt;Abandoned Burrows&lt;/a&gt;. Another group, headed by &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Nerzet\"&gt;Overseer Nerzet&lt;/a&gt;, scoured the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt; in search of Keeper Sulthis' keystone. An invasion force was also sent to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, where they &lt;a href=\"Sandscar%20Breach\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; the village of &lt;a href=\"Dol%27watha\"&gt;Dol'watha&lt;/a&gt;. The sethrak have taken to subjugating anyone they can as slaves.\nLater, a large force of Faithless assaulted the Sanctuary of the Devoted and captured Vorrik until he was rescued by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey aim to spread the sands of the desert and as such the frontiers of their empire as far as possible, even &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nThe majority of generic sethrak mobs affiliated with the Faithless use the same set of voiced quotes that can be spoken upon aggro and death."}

Surely you feel a true bond forming between you and your falcon. Would you believe me if I told you that when the time is right you'll be able to see through the eyes of your bird? Aye, it is the ultimate level of falconry.\nBut first you must hunt more! The bird must hone and quicken its reflexes. Send it against a more formidable opponent! The fjord hawks of the region make the tops of the trees around us their homes. They shall be your next target!\nProgress.\nYour falcon must be constantly fed or else it will eat the prey that you are sending it to kill.\nCompletion.\nAye, the hawks are very territorial and often travel in packs. I suppose I could have told you that before I sent you out into the field.\nNotes.\nJust in case people are having difficulty finding the hawks, they are all over the area directly around . Also, each time you send your falcon after a hawk, a second hawk will almost always come and attack you \"if\" you are within aggro range of the second hawk. Keeping max distance away from the pair can defeat this relatively minor issue.\nHints.\nIt may be helpful to write the following macro and bind it to a key.

Players are also able to rescue an orphaned falcosaur pet to begin a journey toward understanding these hungry creatures, and \"may just earn a new mount along the way\".\nFalcosaurs are immune to the corruption and infusion of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primal need to hunt occurs in falcosaurs at a young age. And while falcosaurs are predatory, they are actually omnivores and eat fruits as well as berries in large quantities. Said berries are actually what give the Bloodgazer falcosaurs their distinctive, blood red eye color.\nIf a falcosaur has been away from their origin of birth for too long, they may become depressed and lethargic and will possibly cease to eat and drink. They also have no issue with consuming dairy products such as cheese.\nSpecies.\nThere are in total four different species of falcosaurs found on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Where they came from originally is unknown, however &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; points out that they've come from offshore, suggesting another island, or perhaps several. Whether there are more species of falcosaurs from where they came, is also unknown.\nThe species encountered on the Broken Isles are as follows:\nBloodgazers.\nDark red stripes, red scales with black fur. Found in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the colors they sport make them look fierce and intimidating, the bloodgazer falcosaurs are predisposed to eating fruit and berries.\nDirebeaks.\nGreen stripes, teal &amp; blue scales with orange fur. Found in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDirebeak falcosaurs are the heartiest of the bunch. Their sense of smell, however, is not as good as that of other falcosaur species, which had led them to prefer pungent meals (of which diary products are an example) and are often found feasting on carrion that has been in the sun for days.\nTheir shimmering hides have adapted to confuse and disorient prey.\nSharptalons.\nDark green stripes, green scales with purple fur. Found in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sharptalon falcosaurs have a diet which subsists mainly on small nuts and berries, their claws are used mostly for defense.\nTheir viridian hide allows for them to blend into magical forests and non-magical forests alike.\nSnowfeathers.\nDark blue stripes, gray to white scales with white fur. Found in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nSnowfeather falcosaur are the most predatory of all known falcosaur species while being particularly fond of large prey.\nTheir hide and fur allow them to hide in fog and fog banks.\nAs a companion pet.\nAs a mount.\nThese mounts involve the process of the companions growing up alongside the hero."}

The Fallen Avatar, trapped in titan machinery, assaults the players from his location while the now corrupted Maiden of Valor also attacks. As the encounter progresses, Containment Pylons activate around the room pouring energy into the Fallen Avatar. The Maiden of Valor can absorb this energy. At 100 Energy, she casts Cleansing Protocol, expending all of her energy. If allowed to reach 100 Energy, the Fallen Avatar shatters the floor, dropping players into the chamber below. Free from the titan machinery, the Fallen Avatar now becomes fully mobile. Thanks to the infusion of fel energy from the Containment Pylons, the Fallen Avatar's Rupture Realities now shatters the ground below him until the platform is completely destroyed.\nAbilities.\nStage One: A Slumber Disturbed.\nLocked into an ancient titan device, the Fallen Avatar struggles to regain his full power by corrupting the machinery around him.\nStage Two: An Avatar Awakened.\nUpon reaching 100 Energy the Avatar shatters his bonds, destroying the platform and dropping players deeper into the Tomb of Sargeras.\nQuotes.\n\"As the raid enters the Chamber of the Avatar, Kil'jaeden awaits them. Behind him is the Maiden of Valor, corrupted with fel energies, and the Avatar itself. It is lifeless, embedded from the waist down in the floor, and its wrists bound.\"\n\"Kil'jaeden channels fel energies into the Avatar before vanishing. With a roar, the Avatar surges to life before breaking free of his bindings.\"\n\"The Avatar shatters the floor, sending himself and the raid plummeting further into the Tomb. The raid lands on an unstable platform floating atop an immense pool of fel lava. The Legion's portal lies on the edge of the pool, guarded by Kil'jaeden. Prophet Velen, Illidan Stormrage and Khadgar arrive and begin to combat the Deceiver.\""}

The heart of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, it is a lush rainforest with statuesque stone spires, prominent with the pandaren architecture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; is located in the eastern portion of the zone, and it is the very first dungeon adventurers will encounter when first arriving in Pandaria.\nUnlike two previous expansions, where the adventurers could choose one of two starting zones, Jade Forest is the sole starting location, much like &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, but the major difference is that factions start on the opposite sides of the zone (Horde at the north and the Alliance at the south). The zone itself is roughly 50% larger than &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe introductory quest for Alliance players is &lt;a href=\"The%20King%27s%20Command\"&gt;The King's Command&lt;/a&gt;, and for Horde players is &lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20War%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Art of War (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription from official site.\n\"After a naval battle between the Horde and the Alliance leaves the survivors stranded on the beaches of Pandaria, rescue parties of those factions\u2019 elite soldiers set out explore the mysterious, fog-shrouded island. You are among them. As one of the first explorers to set foot on Pandaria, you\u2019ll begin your investigation in the midst of the emerald bamboo and coastal marsh of the Jade Forest, where two of Pandaria\u2019s most prominent races make their homes. The monkey-like &lt;a href=\"Hozen\"&gt;Hozen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; fish-people thrive near the rivers of the Jade Forest, and your first encounters with them are likely to be hostile. Yet, ultimately, your lack of allies and guidance in this unfamiliar land will make befriending the natives your only option.\"\nIntroduction.\nAfter a devastating naval battle, survivors from both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; wash up onto the tree-lined shores of the Jade Forest. Surrounded by wilderness, they must form alliances with the natives if they wish to survive. Along the way, they will meet the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;... along with some of the greater powers that protect and shape &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance and Horde will ally themselves with the indigenous creatures to fight a war with lasting consequences to the Jade Forest, and possibly the rest of Pandaria as well.\nThe Alliance and Horde enter from the North and the South with a small force of survivors from a shipwreck.\nGetting there.\nPlayers that have reached level 85 are given access to introductory quests in their faction capitals &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; that bring them to the zone via gunships. There is no boat or road you can take without the starting quest.\nGeography.\nThe landscape of the Jade Forest is verdant and lush. High spires dot the region and its coastal areas, and the flora is diverse in several areas of the land. Pandaren buildings, such as temples, monasteries, farmlands are prominently gracing the land and fascinate its curious visitors that have managed to get past the mists shrouding the continent. In some places, ancient &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; ruins can be found - one example are the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Ten%20Thunders\"&gt;Terrace of Ten Thunders&lt;/a&gt; in the north, yet travelers must exercise caution, as the reawakened servants of the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; have reawakened and now plot the downfall of Pandaren empire. Since the arrival of two warring factions of Azeroth, they have gained a foothold in old mogu structures in the northern and southern reaches of the forest, as well as gained support pandaren villages. &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt; has sided with the Alliance, while &lt;a href=\"Honeydew%20Village\"&gt;Honeydew Village&lt;/a&gt; has sided with the Horde. In the east, there is a temple and a monument dedicated to the Eastern &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, the Jade Serpent, but due to the release of negative energies the temple became overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; and his spawns, and the monument destroyed.\nNotable characters.\nThere are four ancestor spirits that guard over Pandaria. The &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;the temple&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to her, as well as a statue in the zone.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are a family of assassins that move unseen by night, as well as masters of the mystical and martial arts.\nMost of the Jade Lotus is made up of races that came from the distant shores of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt;.

The family consists of &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s that own the shadows, command ancient spirits and bend the forces of nature to their will.\nAn immense pandaren warrior known as &lt;a href=\"White%20Eyes\"&gt;White Eyes&lt;/a&gt; leads the Jade Lotus' operations, but unbeknownst to even most of the Jade Lotus' own members, he is not the leader of the organization. Instead, he is merely a figurehead, and the sworn bodyguard and servant of &lt;a href=\"Aya%20Blackpaw\"&gt;Aya Blackpaw&lt;/a&gt;, the last heir of the wealthy Blackpaw family and the true leader of the organization. Using the Gadgetzan Museum of Ancient Artifacts as her headquarters, Aya issues orders to the rest of the Lotus through her loyal servant whilst shrouding her activities behind her family's reputation as generous philanthropists.\nMost denizens of Gadgetzan believe the Lotus to be criminals and mere thieves and assassins, and whisper fearfully of them in taverns and alleyways throughout the city. The Jade Lotus' one purpose in the town has been to steal jade and jade artifacts from all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but not for wealth. Instead, the Lotus' secret lies in how the magic within the stones can be drawn forth to create , powerful living statues that do the faction's bidding. Many of the organization's members have been granted trinkets that can summon these warriors in the blink of an eye. Each Jade Golem they summon arrives more powerful than the last, and soon the Lotus are planning to unleash them upon Gadgetzan."}
