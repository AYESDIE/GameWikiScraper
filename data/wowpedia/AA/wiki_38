As such, they are warriors who wield the power of &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;, as they did in the past.\nAlthough not as numerous as some of the more ancient paladin orders, the Sunwalkers' ways are no less powerful and their members are no less respected. They are the most militant branch of the tauren armies within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These paladins exist alongside the &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt;, tauren &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s led by Sagewind, who also rediscovered the use of the Light through the power of An'she.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi pledged her order's support to the reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in their war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwalkers left the ranks of the Silver Hand after its splintering, and supported once more the Horde against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; discussed whether the tauren have overlooked a key aspect of balance, noting the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' near exclusive worship of the &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, known to the tauren as &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;. Yet in their culture, both Mu'sha and &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun, are the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The pair concluded that the night elves, through their ties to tauren druids, passed on their cultural prejudice against the sun to their tauren students. To properly revere the Earth Mother they hold sacred, the two decided to strive for balance and further explore the powers of the sun, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;. After she fought on the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, Brightmane remained hopeful that An'she would shine across the sky, and victory would be won by the mortal races, no matter what perils remained.\nAs Our Fathers Before Us.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; to confront the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Brambleblade%20Ravine\"&gt;Brambleblade Ravine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the Sunwalkers, as the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; may need their assistance whether he wanted it or not. Flanked by a handful of Sunwalkers, Baine saved Garrosh while the quilboar retreated in their tunnels after the tauren paladins killed many of them. However, when quilboar far larger than the others came to fight them, Baine ordered his group to retreat to the surface, where they boarded a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to return to Thunder Bluff.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the paladinhood was officially created by &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; and began recruiting to train tauren paladins.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin trainer &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Atohmo\"&gt;Sunwalker Atohmo&lt;/a&gt;, an honored member of the order, requested to meet young tauren paladins who impressed him as brave defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and followers of their ways. After the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; are increasing their collaboration, Atohmo sent the Sunwalker adventurers to gather their weapons with &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; powers, and to break them over the &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Anvil\"&gt;The Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;. On the orders of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, he also sent them to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to recover materials and the holy symbol of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Springvale\"&gt;Commander Springvale&lt;/a&gt; for the creation of weapons at the height of their dedication.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and several tauren of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; had dreams of a valley, golden with blossoms, filled with the hope of peace. Baine Bloodhoof ordered &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dawnchaser%20tribe\"&gt;Dawnchaser tribe&lt;/a&gt; to sail into uncharted waters in search of this mysterious place. Guided by the visions of Dezco's pregnant wife, &lt;a href=\"Leza%20Farwalker\"&gt;Leza Farwalker&lt;/a&gt;, the last vessel was able to find &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and landed on the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. After heading inland by canoe, the group and a few Sunwalkers followers set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Cleft\"&gt;Thunder Cleft&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the expedition members, one &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Scout\"&gt;Sunwalker Scout&lt;/a&gt; was sent to patrol around the &lt;a href=\"Krasari%20Ruins\"&gt;Krasari Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, where he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s before he could report their presence. Another was found dead by Horde adventurers at &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20River\"&gt;Krasarang River&lt;/a&gt;, killed by a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; arrow while he was sent by Dezco to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;battle for Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; commander, &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Chagon\"&gt;Sunwalker Chagon&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde troops against the Alliance forces, and tried to take control of &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; to prevent their expansion deeper into &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Iron%20Horde\"&gt;war against the Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; in , a few Sunwalkers could be met and recruited as &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking redemption for his wife and son's death, &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; traveled alone without his clan on alternate Draenor and researched the way the fanatic &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; worshiped the light in different ways than the Sunwalkers.\nLegion.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faala\"&gt;so&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Sahale\"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; Sunwalkers could be seen at the sparring ring of the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, where Horde champions fought in preparation for the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to learn more about the location of the &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin &lt;a href=\"Orik%20Trueheart\"&gt;Orik Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; asked the Sunwalkers for help to communicate with the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorvold%20Ironbrow\"&gt;Gorvold Ironbrow&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren order provided assistance by sending &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; to assist them in their quest.\nFollowing the disastrous conflict, Aponi Brightmane led the Sunwalkers to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, in order to pay their respects to the fallen &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. In order to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Aponi pledged her order's support to the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, many Sunwalkers joined the reformed Silver Hand, and some could be found training new paladins in the &lt;a href=\"Armory%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Armory of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ongoing offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; also drew the interest of many &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Recruit\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; who wished to join the ranks of the Silver Hand, some were Sunwalkers awaiting to be judged by the Highlord itself who eliminated the &lt;a href=\"Volzarak%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Legion infiltrator&lt;/a&gt; among them.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Assault on Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who came to retrieve Tirion's body and make him the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Brave\"&gt;Sunwalker Brave&lt;/a&gt;s fought alongside the Silver Hand forces to repel the undead invaders. While they were defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself intervened and burned the surrounded death knights, forcing them to flee and granting victory to the paladins.\nSome tauren paladins were later present at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where they could be seen fighting against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, while those injured were healed by their Silver Hand allies.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwalkers fought on the fields of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. They faced off against &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, who led the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; troops in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the Order of the Silver Hand has splintered once again at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Alliance War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, some Sunwalkers served as &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Emissary\"&gt;Horde Emissaries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to help their &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; allies at the &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt;, where they could be seen healing &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Bladeguard\"&gt;Injured Bladeguard&lt;/a&gt;s. As these emissaries were also sharing secrets that the Horde have regarding the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, they were sent by the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; rift on &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s orders.\nShadowlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin trainer &lt;a href=\"Avaros%20Dawnglaive\"&gt;Avaros Dawnglaive&lt;/a&gt; asked to meet young tauren paladins who impressed him as brave defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He sent them to fight the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to obtain materials for the creation of weapons at the height of their dedication, as &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Atohmo\"&gt;Sunwalker Atohmo&lt;/a&gt; did in the past.\nCulture.\nThe path of an exemplary Sunwalker is to be a brave defender of the Horde and a follower of their ways, while their first duty is to preserve and protect &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. Every Sunwalkers strive to be a beacon of hope, and all know that in all things there was only one true path, one right decision.\nAs a young sunwalker continues their training, they will learn how to lead rituals to honor An'she and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, and will grow closer to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. In their faith, the Light is associated to An'she, which gives them their powers. It is important to note that they don't use &lt;a href=\"solar%20magic\"&gt;solar magic&lt;/a&gt;, since it is associated to &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic rather than holy magic. When they refer to the Light, they use the terms \"An'she's light\", \"the light of the Sun\", and \"Sun's light\". In order to use their holy powers, they may pray to An'she silently or verbally.\nThe power of An'she can appear either as red flames emerging from a white-hot source or as golden magic similar to other &lt;a href=\"divine%20magic\"&gt;divine magic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; has specifically used An'she's powers to weave protective shields of light, channel holy energies through his mace to crumble enemies such as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to dust, and heal others' wounds with \"bright yellow light\". However, Dezco mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;'s presence and influence in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was weakening his Sunwalker powers.\nThe \"yeena'e\" ceremony is an ancient ritual that was nearly lost to memory before the Sunwalkers breathed new life into it. It is an ancient ceremony honoring the dead, and taking place just before dawn. The ritual is conducted with quick drumming and ceremonial garb, beginning as &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; rises to bleed his light into the world, and ending once he has ascended fully above the horizon. It is believed that, as An'she bleeds, sacrificing part of his light to announce the coming of the dawn, he is helped by the \"yeena'e\", \"those who herald the dawn\", spirits of great ancestors who died in the process of saving lives or, in some cases, making new ones. The ceremony appears to honor those spirits that have finally joined the \"yeena'e\".\nIn the TCG.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\", the Sunwalkers cards have many quotes related to their faith, their duties, and their god &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "24829", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24829", "title": "Sunwell", "text": "The Sunwell is a fount of mystical power located in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. While its waters, holy to the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, were originally pure &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power, it has since been restored as a fount of both arcane and &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; energy. The Sunwell was originally created when the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, used a stolen vial of water from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; at a nexus of arcane ley lines within the woodlands that would soon become known as the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Dath'Remar's followers named the Sunwell after their leader, in honor of his bold quest to reignite their culture; magic had been outlawed in the Highborne's ancestral homeland, and the Highborne, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, embraced this cherished source of arcane power, going on to found a kingdom of their own. The Sunwell became the very heart of their culture, the kingdom of Quel'Thalas only made possible because of it.\nThe Sunwell empowered the high elves for roughly seven thousand years to come. Its presence in their lives was comparable to eating or breathing. In the Sunwell's light, Quel'Thalas grew mighty, becoming a beacon of power in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, the boons it granted were not without a price: the high elves, constantly bathed in the Sunwell's power every moment of every day, became &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to its energies.\nThe Sunwell was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, when Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; invaded the kingdom, slew most of its population, and used the Sunwell to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. This ritual tainted the Sunwell's energies and threatened to kill the few elves who had survived the onslaught; in response, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, last of Dath'Remar's bloodline, rushed to the aid of his homeland and had the corrupted Sunwell destroyed. This act saved his people from destruction, but also cut the elves off from their source of power completely. Bereft of their beloved Sunwell, the elves, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, were left with an insatiable hunger for arcane magic.\nThe Sunwell's remaining power manifested itself as &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, who was put under blood elven protection in Quel'Thalas. However, Kael'thas, defeated on Outland and twisted by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies, returned to the ruins of the Sunwell and openly sided with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to usher his new master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth through the fountain's exhausted mystical depths.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, supplemented by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces banding together, succeeded in both slaying the denounced prince and vanquishing his demonic master, once again protecting Azeroth from the Legion's Burning Crusade. In the aftermath of the battle, the draenei prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; sanctified the legendary Sunwell using the &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunwell shone once again, now a fount of both arcane power and Holy Light -- bringing about the gradual \"rebirth of a nation's soul\". Almost immediately after the Sunwell's restoration, the addiction pangs of both the blood elves and their high elven kin were considerably relieved, although according to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, it might take a while for their most of their peoples to adjust, due to the changes in its energies, with the exceptions of the priests and the paladins who are already familiar with the Light's powers. With the Sunwell's rebirth, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an order of blood elf &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who once wielded the Light by force \u2014 have decided instead to embrace it and to forge a new identity as they lead their people into a more promising future. \nHistory.\nCreation.\nAfter many hard-fought battles, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; exiles under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the forested woodlands one day known as &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Dath'Remar had long sought a suitable homeland for his people, practitioners of arcane magic abhorred by their brethren across the Great Sea. Unveiling a stolen vial of water from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, Dath'Remar poured its contents into a lake situated at a convergence of powerful ley lines. A brilliant fount of energy tore through the skies of Azeroth, and Dath'Remar proclaimed that this new source of power would one day surpass its &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunwell was named after Dath'Remar, in honor of the Highborne leader's bold quest to reignite Highborne culture. Over time, the Highborne lost their characteristic kaldorei looks and shunned the moon to embrace the sun. They would become known as the high elves, or quel'dorei, and the Sunwell became the heart of their culture.\nThe well's potent arcane magic fed and strengthened the high elf people. It suffused them unceasingly; they were bathed in its power every moment of every day. The Sunwell had empowered the magi who built the kingdom, and enabled some of the elves' day-to-day spellcasting. Thus, the city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was established. The power of the high elves grew, and they cast an enchantment on the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; that would keep them bathed in eternal springtime. Elven magi crafted monolithic &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s along the borders of Quel'Thalas; these massive stones relayed the Sunwell's power into a magical shield intended to mask the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats and protect the land from invasion. The hard-won peace of Quel'Thalas would endure for roughly four thousand years.\nFor millennia the mystical pool of energy fuelled the potent magic of the exiled high elves. The Sunwell's inexhaustible power permeated the elves and infused them with a constant supply of arcane energy. For generations the high elves protected and cherished the well, benefiting from its powers even when outside the borders of their homeland. All high elves had access to the Sunwell's powers from anywhere on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the high elves came to regard the Sunwell's waters as holy. Magic became part of their genes centuries before, but the Sunwell's unique energies became part of them acutely.\nRole in Quel'Thalas.\nThe Sunwell enabled many of the enchantments and indulgences used by the elven magi. Most notably, the Sunwell passively empowered &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;'s great shield, &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;, an impenetrable barrier used to repel any would-be invaders. Neither &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; could find the key to the shield's subversion, only treachery from within could undo it. While the elves generally lived in harmony with the creatures of the woodlands, the Sunwell ensured the pacifism of their artificial creations, such as &lt;a href=\"mana%20wyrm\"&gt;mana wyrms&lt;/a&gt;. Culturally, the Sunwell was the very center of Thalassian society.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;burning of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; intended to use the power of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to break through &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;'s protection. As the Altars were crafted from the elves' own &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, which were originally powered by the Sunwell, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; thought to use that link in reverse, sending his own magic into their power source and either destroying it or wresting it away from them. He and his acolytes were largely unsuccessful however, and Silvermoon remained protected throughout the battle, which the fel-crazed orcs soon abandoned.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the death knight &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; laid waste to Quel'Thalas, wiping out most of its population and reducing large tracts of the mighty kingdom to ash in his quest to reach the Sunwell. The Sunwell's mystical depths were a key component in the resurrection of the fallen necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who guided the prince toward his goal telepathically.\nAs the undead armies closed in, a high elf named &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; (who hoped to gain the favor of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;) aided Arthas by lowering the shields surrounding the Sunwell, killing key members of the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and binding the well's energies using instructions from his undead masters. Dar'Khan, who had long coveted the Sunwell's energies, could not resist the urge to gorge upon them himself, despite Arthas forbidding it. Unfortunately for Dar'Khan, the energies he had ingested were soon corrupted, and the man he had sold his kingdom to repaid his treachery in kind. Before that, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Tel%27kor\"&gt;Tel'kor&lt;/a&gt; to the Sunwell Plateau to warn the mages that they could have been betrayed.\nWith the elven capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; lying in ruins, Arthas marched triumphantly to the Sunwell and tossed the bones of the necromancer into the radiant beam of light. With this act, the sacred well was instantly corrupted. Knowing he had sealed the fate of the high elves, Arthas departed with the newly resurrected Kel'Thuzad to carry on in service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the Scourge, however, remained behind to prey upon the few elves who had not yet fallen.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the legendary King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; lay dead along with the members of the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves' ruling body (among them &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas Windrunner's second\u2013in\u2013command, assumed temporary leadership and organized the remaining survivors to fight the undead, but it was the return of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; - a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and only son of Anasterian - from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; that brought the elves a fragment of renewed hope.\nKael'thas soon learned that the greatest danger to his people was posed not by the Scourge remnants, but by the Sunwell itself. The corrupted powers of the well, tainted by Arthas' ritual, still permeated not only the elves, but all that they had built. Given enough time, the &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; energies would kill the elves and cause a catastrophe. Kael'thas painfully concluded that the Sunwell, the heart of their society, must be destroyed.\nHe executed a plan that would irrevocably change the fate of his people. With the aid of the most powerful remaining magi, accompanied by Lor'themar and a party of volunteer defenders, Kael'thas succeeded in destroying the Sunwell. After a three-way struggle between the elves, the Scourge remnants, and an armada of emboldened Amani trolls seizing an opportunity to secure the Sunwell for their own purposes, the elven magi detonated the Sunwell and escaped, leaving the undead and trolls alike to perish in the ensuing blaze. However, though the Sunwell's energies had been dispersed, not all of its essence was lost. A wizard named Borel - in truth, one of the guises of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; - gathered what remained of the energies and hid them away in the guise of a young human girl, &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the Sunwell's destruction, Kael'thas declared that his people would be forever known as the sin'dorei, or blood elves, so they would never forget those who had fallen in defense of their homeland.\nAlthough the Sunwell's threat was ended, Kael'thas could not have foreseen the effect its loss would have on his people. The elves suffered terribly from withdrawal, for many of them had been infused with the arcane energies of the well all their lives. Only in the absence of the Sunwell did the blood elves come to realize how addicted they had grown to its powers. Over time the elves grew ill, weakened, and the youngest and oldest among them died.\nThirsting for vengeance, Prince Kael'thas and the healthiest of his warriors immediately joined the campaign against the Scourge in Lordaeron while Lor'themar and a ranger named &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; remained behind to safeguard the land and seek a cure for their people. Kael'thas and his warriors followed the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; through the portal and into the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There, the elves met the one being capable of putting an end to their painful hunger: the renegade demon &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of Kael'thas' group chose to stay in Outland, but &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; was sent back to carry a message of hope to those blood elves remaining in Quel'Thalas. Rommath accomplished his mission: relaying tales of a glorious promised land, spreading the teachings of Illidan (teachings which Rommath smoothly attributed to Prince Kael'thas), and planting the notion that Kael'thas might one day return to lead his people to paradise. Rommath remained in Quel'Thalas to help rebuild and await the prince's return.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nMonths later, the traitor Dar'Khan \u2013 now a powerful agent of the Scourge \u2013 returned to Quel'Thalas. There he battled the avatar of the Sunwell, Anveena, and a band of heroes with the aid of the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and others. She was able to defeat Dar'Khan and release the Sunwell's energy, in the process restoring the grove once destroyed by the Scourge. Anveena decided to stay in the ruined city and begin the process of renewal with Kalecgos, protected by a magical shield and watched over by Lor'themar Theron. Anveena's identity as the avatar of the Sunwell's power was kept a closely guarded secret, known to only Lor'themar and his people.\nThe Sunwell Restored.\nFollowing the defeat of Illidan in Outland, Kael'thas - bristling with power from his Manaforges in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; - finally returned to Quel'Thalas. Seeking to summon the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas captured the personification of the Sunwell's power: Anveena. Kael attempted to summon Kil'jaeden into Azeroth using the reignited Sunwell as a portal. This was prevented by the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, a group of heroes charging into &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and finally, the sacrifice of Anveena, who used her power to prevent Kil'jaeden's emergence.\nThe battle with Kil'jaeden once again left the Sunwell without power. However, Velen appeared shortly thereafter and used the \"spark\" of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru's&lt;/a&gt; to reignite the Sunwell. This restored the Sunwell using the energies of M'uru, the Sunwell's new energies being derived from both the arcane and from M'uru's powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Sunwell is seen briefly during the quest to restore the fabled elven sword, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;. Access to the Sunwell itself is policed by the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, who allows adventurers to enter once the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt; - Quel'Delar's original wielder - offers his blessing. The Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; are seen within, along with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and groups of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf%20Pilgrim%20%28Sunwell%29\"&gt;blood elf pilgrims&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, several &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; have been allowed access to the sacred Sunwell; &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt; seen as the high elf representative.\nIf the adventurer is not a &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, Quel'Delar is submerged into the Sunwell itself, and Lor'themar Theron thanks the adventurer for returning it to its \"rightful owners.\" He attempts to claim it, though the blade hurls him back, to which Rommath and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Honor%20Guard\"&gt;Sunwell's Guardians&lt;/a&gt; immobilize the player and Auric, outing them as traitors. Auric is able to defuse the situation, however, and states that Quel'Delar chooses its own wielder. Rommath calls the guards off, ordering the player to begone with the blade if it is not meant to be theirs.\nIf a blood elf delivers Quel'Delar to the Sunwell, things play out differently. Lor'themar simply observes it as it is submerged into the Sunwell, and both he and Rommath confirm its authenticity. Hailing the player as a hero and inspiration to the sin'dorei, Lor'themar, Rommath, and Auric offer words of support. Rommath instructs the sin'dorei to deliver the blade to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and notes that the blood elves will always rise up to face any foe.\nLegion.\nDuring preparations for the battle on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, a group of blood elf paladins use the power of the Sunwell to enchant their Horde allies' weapons with holy might. The priests of &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; later retrieve a fragment of Light from the Sunwell, among other holy places on Azeroth.\nThe Sunwell is visited by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The visit was intended as a gesture of goodwill for the nightborne leaders and a courtesy for Alleria; while the latter was estranged from Silvermoon's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;political climate&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar would not deny a daughter of Quel'Thalas' request to see their people's most sacred site. Alleria's presence attracts a group of void creatures, who spill into the plateau at &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;'s command and begin spreading their corruption. The heroes, along with the Sunwell's magi, wardens, and spellbreakers, sortied to battle the void beasts and prevent the Sunwell's corruption. A powerful void horror, &lt;a href=\"Aruun%20the%20Darkener\"&gt;Aruun the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;, then emerged in an attempt to contaminate the well directly but was stopped and killed. Finally, a rift portal was opened directly above the Sunwell's waters, but Rommath, Thalyssra, and Alleria combined their magics to close it before catastrophe struck. In the aftermath of the battle, Alleria was exiled by Lor'themar, on the grounds that her very presence poses a threat to Quel'Thalas and the Sunwell. The battle's outcome also endeared the regent to Thalyssra, who pledged &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;her kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to the Horde.\nRommath had previously demanded &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt;'s group be exiled for similar reasons, as those who treat with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; are a danger to the Sunwell. According to Thalyssra, the Sunwell is as potent as the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, albeit of a different nature due to its partially Light-based energies.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs part of a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;ceremony of remembrance&lt;/a&gt; held each year in the kingdom, the blood elf &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; returns to the Sunwell on their journey to reenact the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer inevitably fails to prevent Arthas' advance into the plateau and the corruption of the Sunwell, and then experiences the aftermath of the onslaught, when Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; led a raid to destroy the tainted fount of power and save his race from destruction.\nIn the RPG.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt; left shattered Quel'Thalas, he managed to salvage the skull of his father, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, from the ruins of Quel'Thalas. The skull is among the artifacts that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes would be needed to restore the Sunwell.\nAlexstrasza the Life-Binder, the immensely powerful red dragon aspect, believes the Sunwell can be rejuvenated. She is involved with other affairs in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, however, and doesn't have time to do it. To recreate the Sunwell, she believes various items must be gathered from around the world: a vial of &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; water from Kalimdor; three crushed gems from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-made chalice held by the goblin &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;; and the skull of Anasterian Sunstrider, the last King of Quel'Thalas, which the blood elves took to Outland. Also needed are at least 300 living high elves. Gathering them together would require rounding up refugees from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, scouring the world for the few high elves left in various cities and/or forcing blood elves to repent.\nSpeculation.\nThe Sunwell's protection.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunwell itself proved a huge advantage to Silvermoon and Quel'Thalas. The Sunwell directly empowered its citizens, its great power tied to Quel'Thalas and her people, and ensured that none of the invading &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s could so much as touch the capital. These defenses were only bypassed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, who had gained the loyalty of a &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;great traitor&lt;/a&gt; in the upper echelons of Silvermoon, a turn of events which ultimately ended in the Sunwell's destruction. However, with the Sunwell restored, it is unclear as to whether Silvermoon once again possesses these great defenses."}

It is located on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. It is said to lie across a small stretch of ocean, on an island north of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nMillennia before it was a peaceful grove on the island with a small lake in the center. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the grove with a vial of water from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. He poured a few drops to begin the transformation, and the whole bottle to complete it. The Sunwell was born. The powers of the well were immediate, and they used them to build a place of honor around the well. The rest of Dath'Remars followers could not resist using the source of magic.\nThe Sunwell used to be the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; node that empowered the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and sustained their existence. The &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; defiled the well, using its energies to revive &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. The grove remained scarred and burned, like most of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Sunwell Grove lies across a small stretch of ocean, on an island northeast of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energies were defiled by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, the grove was left scarred and burned. Rumors say that the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s have sent agents to the Sunwell to see if it can be reenergized. No one has seen this dragons though, but only terrible creatures, like shadows hurling death from the trees.\nSpeculation.\nThe Grove can be seen in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunwell%20Trilogy\"&gt;The Sunwell Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\" when the Sunwell was first formed, and after. When the Sunwell exploded during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it took a section of the forest with it, though the grove and the Terrace and Temple surrounding it can be seen again after &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; returns to the well. In the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKE1TGCw2k6g\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4\"&gt;Patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, it shows the Sunwell was once in an open forest. As stated in \"Lands of Conflict\", the Scourge left the grove scarred and burned. No grove can be seen near the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\". It may be related to scale issues, or the Plateau was built over top of the grove. If the latter, the damage to the building is unexplained unless the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; and remaining Scourge decayed it."}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, these elves founded their own kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. For millennia the mystical pool of energy known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; fueled the potent magic of the exiled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the remnants of this ancient fountain have become the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s latest target as the demons prepare to summon their commander, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, with the Sunwell's energy.\nHeroes from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; have joined under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, endeavoring to crush the Legion's invasion before it becomes insurmountable. More combatants join the Offensive every day, but the might of the Legion cannot be easily suppressed. Fierce demonic servants guard the Sunwell Plateau, attacking anyone who interferes with their proceedings. As the time of Kil'jaeden's arrival draws near, Azeroth's heroes have one final chance to save their world from blistering devastation.\nShattered Sun Offensive invaded Quel'Danas and waged war against the Legion, delaying Kael'thas' spellwork. Adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the Sunwell Plateau and fought against Legion demons, Sunfury elves, and felblood elves. They also rescued and defeated prisoners such as the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, controlled by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the Sunwell chamber, Kil'jaeden rose from a rift in the Sunwell's depths before the Alliance's eyes. They fought hard, but it was eventually &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt; who turned the tide. She sacrificed herself, using her remaining energy against the demon lord. The Alliance then managed to banish the weakened Kil'jaeden and close the gateway. The Sunwell laid tainted again, threatening to corrupt blood elves once more. Although &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; considered destroying the corrupted Sunwell, another solution presented itself. Velen had arrived to the halls, paying respects to the fallen naaru M'uru. However, he sensed in its heart a glimmer of power, so he used it to cleanse the Sunwell, transforming it into a font of Holy Light and arcane magic. In the wake of Kil'jaeden's fall, a lot of powerful artifacts were found and stored.\nAs with Quel'Danas, the plateau was eventually taken by the sin'dorei. They allowed high elves to make pilgrimages to the site of the Sunwell.\nGeography.\nThe instance contains both outdoor areas and building interiors, and inside the final building the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nLoot.\nThe Sunwell Plateau is tuned for &lt;a href=\"Tier%206\"&gt;Tier 6&lt;/a&gt;-geared players and the gear that drops from the first three bosses are additional Tier 6 items (boots, belt, and bracers), and non-set epics as well.\nAttunement.\nThe instance was open to players right from the start of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, but the last 3 bosses were only available as each gate - which blocked the next boss encounter - opened over a set period of time on all servers. (Although this happened on maintenance day, so the US had an apparent one day advantage over the EU servers) The first gate was opened on 8 April 2008 in the US, two weeks after the patch went live. The second gate opened after weekly maintenance on April 29, 2008. The third and final gate was opened on May 20, 2008 on US realms. The difficulty of the instance was set at the first 3 bosses being on par with Tier 6 encounters, and then the last three and increasing from each.\nQuel'delar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; quest chain players are visiting a heavily phased version of Sunwell Plateau once again.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Its &lt;a href=\"Rig%20Blueprints\"&gt;blueprints&lt;/a&gt; were locked away in &lt;a href=\"Thermaplugg%27s%20Safe\"&gt;a safe&lt;/a&gt; guarded by &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Mekgineer Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and whose combination was only known by Thermaplugg himself. According to the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nogg\"&gt;Nogg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the rig was \"better than all our &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt; models combined\", and he wanted the blueprints in order to figure out all of the gnomish innovations that went into its creation so they could be used for new goblin shredders. It is unknown if by \"our\" he meant all goblins or just those in service to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs discovered by &lt;a href=\"Kernobee\"&gt;Kernobee&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were somehow involved in the super rig's creation. For his part, Nogg posited that the gnomes stole the rig from goblins in the first place. However, upon being informed of the presence of Dark Irons in Gnomeregan, he suggested that the gnomes might've stolen the plans for Dark Iron &lt;a href=\"stone%20golem\"&gt;stone golem&lt;/a&gt;s and modified them, and that the Dark Irons would want payback for this. He later added that this seemed like a reasonable lead as to how the gnomes \"suddenly were struck with goblin-like inspiration\".\nSpeculation.\nIt is never actually revealed specifically what this rig is used for, but because it is compared to shredders and golems it can be assumed that this is some sort of pilotable mech (&lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt;). Since the blueprints were guarded by Thermaplugg, its creation involved the Dark Irons (whom Thermaplugg was in contact with, as seen by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ambassador\"&gt;Dark Iron Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;) in one way or another, and Nogg implies that the rig was only created after Gnomeregan fell and Thermaplugg took control of the city, it is likely that the super rig is the &lt;a href=\"pounder%20robot\"&gt;pounder robot&lt;/a&gt; type that Thermaplugg drives in Gnomeregan."}

{"id": "581870", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=581870", "title": "Mythic+", "text": "The Mythic+ &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; system provides an endlessly scaling challenge in 5-player &lt;a href=\"Mythic\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; dungeons. Parties compete against a timer while dealing with weekly-rotating &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es that encourage different tactics. Mythic+ compares to &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt; but replaces it with a greater emphasis on difficulty and solid execution rather than pure speed. Players receive gear proportionate to their difficulty, or &lt;a href=\"keystone\"&gt;keystone&lt;/a&gt; level, and rank according to &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B%20Rating\"&gt;Mythic+ Rating&lt;/a&gt; achieved throughout the &lt;a href=\"PvE%20season\"&gt;PvE season&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nPreviously only dungeons from the current expansion were eligible. Currently a mix of current dungeons, and dungeons from previous expansions, are used. New seasons normally coincide with the opening of a new raid, resulting in higher mob scaling and item level rewards. &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B%20Rating\"&gt;Mythic+ Rating&lt;/a&gt; and various achievements track a player's best performances in each dungeon until the season ends.\nStarting.\nTo start a Mythic+ dungeon, at least one player in the party must have a &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Keystone\"&gt;Mythic Keystone&lt;/a&gt; (for the current dungeon rotation) or a &lt;a href=\"Timeworn%20Keystone\"&gt;Timeworn Keystone&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Timewalking\"&gt;Legion Timewalking&lt;/a&gt;) to insert in a &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Power\"&gt;Font of Power&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeystones are acquired by completing a Mythic or Mythic+ dungeon, or by opening the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Vault\"&gt;Great Vault&lt;/a&gt; after a weekly dungeon reset. A player may only possess one at a time, and will only receive one per week.\nOnce the Activate button is clicked, this will force all players to reload their UI, place a ghostly green wall in front of the party, and begin a 10-second countdown timer. When this reaches 0, the wall is removed and the Mythic+ timer begins.\nCompleting.\nThe players' aim is to defeat all of the bosses in the dungeon, as well as a set amount of trash before the Mythic+ timer expires.\nThe player who started the dungeon will receive a new keystone based on the outcome:\nA toast window will pop up when you complete the dungeon, displaying whether you beat the timer or not. This window also shows how many levels the Keystone is upgraded by if you successfully beat the timer, as well as how much Mythic+ Rating you earned, if any.\nLeaderboards.\nWeekly leaderboards track the best 100 completions (by difficulty, then time) on each server:\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//develop.battle.net/\"&gt;Battle Net (website) API&lt;/a&gt; provides the means for websites to query up to 500 per server. Players on high-population servers might not reach their own leaderboard with an inferior result, but they could yet appear on another server's leaderboard if they joined a &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;pickup group&lt;/a&gt; with at least one player in a lower-population server.\nIn-game, seasonal performance is also tracked through &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B%20Rating\"&gt;Mythic+ Rating&lt;/a&gt;. To incentivize inviting players with inferior Mythic+ experience, bonus &lt;a href=\"Flightstones\"&gt;Flightstones&lt;/a&gt; are earned whenever a player achieves a personal season-best score for a given dungeon.\nComposition and preparation.\nYou cannot change party members once you have begun a Mythic+ dungeon.\nMythic+ dungeons, at least up to level 10, are balanced so that proper execution is a bigger factor in the party's success than any particular composition.\nYou cannot change talents or specs while inside the dungeon once you have begun. However, you can zone out of the dungeon and use a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Tranquil%20Mind\"&gt;Tome of the Tranquil Mind&lt;/a&gt; to change your talents before re-entering.\nChallenger's Burden.\nInside a Mythic+ dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Challenger%27s%20Burden\"&gt;Challenger's Burden&lt;/a&gt; shaves 5 seconds from the timer as a penalty whenever any player dies. This debuff forces the party to consider whether a \"death run\" - streaking past trash mobs only to die and resurrect behind them - is strategically beneficial. In certain cases, such as the opening hallway in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the party may determine if it is worth saving their potion cooldown (and using potions for 10 minutes), instead of killing the trash or using Invisibility potions.\nThis also serves as an indicator to the party that they may not be ready for a certain Mythic+ level. If accidental deaths are too frequent, the party will run out its clock long before completing the dungeon. Players will need to return with better gear, techniques and strategies to succeed.\nAffixes.\nAn affix changes how mobs behave. Affixes appear on all Mythic+ dungeon keys, but the number and type depends on the keystone level. The first affix is gained at level 2, the second at level 7, and the third at level 14. If the Keystone has an affix listed on it, then all of the enemies in that Mythic+ dungeon will inherit this property unless specified.\nActive affixes are set game-wide on a week-by-week basis, and remain the same for all players until the next weekly reset. This means that every keystone will have the same set of level 2, 7, and 14 affixes for the week. \nInformation about each affix appears on the &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Power\"&gt;Font of Power&lt;/a&gt; interface, the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dungeons\"&gt;Mythic Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; interface, and the objectives frame (where the timer and kill count appear) during the dungeon run.\nLevel 2 affixes.\nMythic +2 alternates between two affixes each week:\nLevel 7 affixes.\nMythic +7 adds one of the following affixes:\nLevel 14 affixes.\nMythic +14 adds one of the following affixes:\nRetired affixes.\nLevel 10 seasonal affixes.\nMythic +10 adds a &lt;a href=\"PvE%20season\"&gt;seasonal&lt;/a&gt; affix which, unlike the others, does not change week by week. It spans the entire Mythic+ season and usually shares a theme with the current raid tier. These affixes often require greater changes in strategy and pathing through the dungeon, either to reach all objectives or deliberately omit one (incurring a unique trade-off in the final boss fight). Thus, dungeons beginning at 10+ may have an entirely different feel than easier ones or previous seasons.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight%20Season%202\"&gt;Dragonflight Season 2&lt;/a&gt;, the seasonal affix has been retired. Since Dragonflight introduced the dungeon rotation to keep each season fresh and interesting, the additional variety provided by seasonal affixes was no longer needed. It is unknown if the seasonal affix for Legion Timewalking is going to be retired as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Legion%20Timewalking\"&gt;Legion Timewalking&lt;/a&gt; Mythic+ runs uses the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28affix%29\"&gt;Infernal (affix)&lt;/a&gt; seasonal affix and it is still available after the removal of these affixes.\nOther retired affixes.\nThe following is a list of non-seasonal affixes that were removed from the game, and will no longer appear on keystones.\nLoot.\nThere are two sources of loot associated with Mythic+ Dungeons: a chest at the end of the instance (known as the &lt;a href=\"Challenger%27s%20Cache\"&gt;Challenger's Cache&lt;/a&gt;), and an additional one to three options for one item from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Vault\"&gt;Great Vault&lt;/a&gt; the week after. The Challenger's Cache drops are taken from the loot table for the dungeon the players have completed, while items in the Great Vault may be from any dungeon.\nLoot reaches its maximum potential item level at Mythic +20, dropping at ilvl 431 from the Challenger's Cache, and ilvl 447 from the Great Vault. While more rewards are possible (additional currency or items), none are more powerful than what can be earned by completing +20. Thus, progressing beyond +20 represents extreme dedication to this type of content. Mythic+ teams who wish to push beyond Mythic +20 are likely to require specific group compositions and use highly refined strategies."}

Additionally, +4 and +7 are worth double and +10 is worth triple.\nCompleting the dungeon faster yields a small increase, not exceeding the jump to a higher level. Completing it a little slower yields points comparable to a keystone two levels easier; however, a lengthy delay (&gt;40% beyond the timer) awards zero score.\nThe best performance in each dungeon is multiplied by 150%, and the best with a different affix (between Fortified and Tyrannical) is multiplied by 50%. These two are added together, along with scores from all other dungeons.\nRewards.\nMythic+ Rating awards &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;al achievements like &lt;a href=\"Keystone%20Master\"&gt;Keystone Master&lt;/a&gt;, and it unlocks superior gear upgrades purchasable with &lt;a href=\"Valor\"&gt;Valor&lt;/a&gt;. Players may combine superior performance in some dungeons with inferior performance in others; however, the rating thresholds are tuned to require completing all dungeons with both Fortified and Tyrannical affixes.\nTrivia.\nMythic+ Rating was inspired by the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//raider.io/\"&gt;Raider.IO AddOn&lt;/a&gt;, which required players to frequently update their AddOn for the latest data. \nAdding rating to the game was met with some controversy. Proponents argued it was only targetted at players who were likely already using external AddOns, while critics felt its introduction would tempt others to unfairly screen players from unrelated content. This controversy compares to attitudes when \"World of Warcraft: Cataclysm\" added &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; to the game (replacing the &lt;a href=\"gear%20score\"&gt;gear score&lt;/a&gt; AddOn); however, it was also a proxy for the clashing counter-cultures between players who enjoy timed and untimed content in \"World of Warcraft\"."}

He eventually became a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;, and was said to be \"more demon than orc\".\nIn the RPG.\nFel'dan, the current leader of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, plans with the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Banehollow\"&gt;Banehollow&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hold\"&gt;Shadow Hold&lt;/a&gt;, which was once the largest of the &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt;s. This ancient orc obviously has lost none of his strength to age, and his bloodied robes and gruesome blade make him an intimidating sight. With the death of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Fel'dan has taken charge of the remainder of the Shadow Council, and reestablished its powerful ties to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He works extensively with Lord Banehollow to further the Shadow Council's interests, most notably spreading the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; into other areas. Fel'dan seeks to corrupt the druidic home of &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, but thus far, his efforts have been thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Circle\"&gt;Emerald Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, the mighty son of Cenarius. In combat, Fel'dan prefers to allow his two succubi companions, &lt;a href=\"Moora\"&gt;Moora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salia\"&gt;Salia&lt;/a&gt;, to lead the way into melee while he destroys his enemies with spells from a distance. If his succubi are not present, he attempts to summon help to fill their roles. He is not hesitant to cut down his foes in melee, and retreats only if truly necessary. He prefers to use directly damaging spells over curses, unless he expects the battle to last a long time.\nFel'dan has learned how to reanimate the deceased druids of &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt; into intelligent undead druids who retain many of their abilities. These undead druids have such an intimate knowledge of nature that they are able to spread the corruption of Felwood much further and faster than normal. Fel'dan carries the greatsword, Hellfire.\nIt is believed that Fel'dan is \"perhaps a descendant or apprentice of Gul'dan\"."}

When assembled, the shadow orb is a smooth solid black globe about five inches in diameter. It glows with a faint violet light and is surprisingly heavy for its size. The individual shadow orb fragments are jagged and non-luminous. \nPowers.\nFor each fragment fused, the former fragments powers are increases.\nThis is the smallest fragment of the shadow orb. To activate its power, you must touch it to a weapon. The fragment fuses with the weapon.\nThis fragment is activated as the first fragment, and grants the same bonuses, plus the following: The eye's of the weapon's wielder glow faintly.\nThis fragment is activated as the second fragment, and grants the same bonuses, plus the following: The wielder's form darkens with shadows. \nSmaller fragments are to weak to grant their powers without being directly attached to a weapon. Once four or more fragments are fused, the resulting fragment is powerful enough to operate free of restrictions. The owners still grants the same bonuses.\nThis fragment is activated as the fourth fragment, and grants the same bonuses, plus the following: On command, the owner can levitate.\nThis fragment is activated as the fifth fragment, and grants the same bonuses, plus the following: Once per day the owner may summon a shadow.\nThis fragment is activated as the sixth fragment, and grants the same bonuses, although they are greatly improved.\nThis fragment is activated as the seventh fragment, and grants the same bonuses, plus the following: The owner gains the ability to fly with good maneuverability.\nThis fragment is activated as the eight fragment, and grants the same bonuses, plus the following: The owner automatically heals faster over time.\nWhen the final fragment of the shadow orb is reconnected with its cousins, there is a burst of darkness. Lost limbs, organs and other missing body parts grow back. The dark power of the completed shadow orb can be overwhelming. The owner's most notable obsession grows stronger over time. In the case of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, he was driven to madness to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. In Maiev's case, she was driven to recapture Illidan to the point where all other considerations were secondary."}

Psychic Horror will consume up to 3 Shadow Orbs, empowering the spell according to the number consumed, requiring a minimum of 1 Shadow Orb; while Devouring Plague always consumes 3 Shadow Orbs, and cannot be cast with fewer.\nShadow Orbs do not decay or disappear over time; they can be stored indefinitely until they are needed. However, events such as dying or logging out will reset the priest's Shadow Orbs.\nImprovements.\nTalents, abilities and glyphs that increase the availability of abilities that generate Shadow Orbs can in turn lead to increased Shadow Orb generation. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Insight\"&gt;Divine Insight&lt;/a&gt; and .\nTips.\nAny Orbs generated while at the maximum will be wasted. Priests with full Orbs should generally therefore try to make use of an ability to consume them, before using abilities that will generate further Orbs. \nA simple tactic to provide an edge when facing a tough opponent is for the priest to first generate 3-5 Shadow Orbs from fighting other, usually weaker, foes, before engaging the more challenging target. As Shadow Orbs can take some time to accumulate (especially in single combat), this tactic can substantially increase DPS in short encounters."}

However, crossing over often takes quite a toll on the uninitiated, leaving them grappling with their own minds in confusion.\nWhile within the realm of shadow, arakkoa claim to be able to move more quickly than in the normal world, although this may simply refer to traveling unhindered by their adversaries. Outcasts may hide in the Shadow Realm to escape their enemies, including the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, who appear unable to perceive their presence there. However, especially powerful individuals may attract unwanted attention from the Shadow Realm's inhabitants while within it. The Outcasts sometimes also hide powerful relics and items within the realm of shadow, usually at shrines to Terokk.\nThe Shadow Realm of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; is filled with &lt;a href=\"fleshbeast\"&gt;fleshbeast&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s.

Ashamed of the broken, wingless being he had become, he hid himself in a world of shadow to hide from &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; so she would not see him.\n600 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, as the great king of the arakkoa &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; grappled with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, he eventually came to hate the world and commit heinous atrocities in order to find a cure, such as sacrificing his own people. The &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s sealed him away into the Shadow Realm in the hopes of rejuvenating their fallen king and some day bringing him back.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; worked with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to collect &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dust%20%28Outland%29\"&gt;Shadow Dust (Outland)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; and create &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Elixir of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; to see hidden arakkoa.

The adventurers then called back the maddened Terokk himself and killed him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt;, who had dominated the mind of Anzu, called him out of the shadow realm to attack the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAn adventurer enters into the shadow realm at the &lt;a href=\"Shadowglade\"&gt;Shadowglade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Akraz\"&gt;Veil Akraz&lt;/a&gt; to locate talonpriests &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest%20Ishaal%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ishaal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest%20Zellek%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Zellek&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, for the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcast\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcast&lt;/a&gt;s' plan to bring back &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the first places players will get to experience this type of \"modular\" gameplay is near the entrance to the Molten Front, in the forward base known as &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Malfurion's Breach&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to your normal duties at this outpost, you'll also be asked to secure the aid of two benevolent orders stationed in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Omnuron\"&gt;Skylord Omnuron&lt;/a&gt;, and the Shadow Wardens, a fierce group of night elves under the guidance of Captain Saynna Stormrunner. This will be a pivotal point in your progression within the Molten Front and represents the first big unlock of new content for the area.\nTo secure the allegiance of the druids and wardens, you'll need to collect &lt;a href=\"Marks%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Marks of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt; to present to each order's leader. Once you've gained the appropriate amount of marks and turn them in, you'll unlock a unique set of daily quests tailored to either the Druids of the Talon or the Shadow Wardens. If you opt to unlock the Shadow Warden dailies, you'll lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Spire\"&gt;Forlorn Spire&lt;/a&gt;, wresting it from the enemy's grasp and establishing a new forward outpost. From there, you'll be poised to attack the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Clutch\"&gt;Widow's Clutch&lt;/a&gt;, the breeding grounds for hordes of &lt;a href=\"fire%20spider\"&gt;fire spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Wildflame%20Point\"&gt;Wildflame Point&lt;/a&gt;, a base of operations for the nefarious Druids of the Flame.\nOnce you've recruited both the Druids of the Talon and the Shadow Wardens, you'll have the option to choose which set of daily quests you complete each day. You'll only able to be complete one set of daily quests per reset (either the Druid of the Talon dailies or the Shadow Warden dailies), but the choice of which path you take is up to you. \nQuests.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; daily quests, a player can enlist the aid of the Shadow Wardens.

A devotee may throw off the shackles of their &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;-like body, becoming one with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%23Magic%20School\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Those who succeed become shadow ascendants. Outsiders do not understand the process that fuels the ascendant's evolution from a physically powerful but slow corpse to a quick and deadly shadow. The Cult of Forgotten Shadow, however, preaches that all Forsaken are born from the Shadow and that they carry a portion of the Shadow within them. By strengthening their ties to &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;, the ascendant manifests their inner Shadow, bonding with it until they become a living shadow, the ultimate manifestation of the Shadow from which they were born.\nChanges.\nAs the Forsaken undertakes their journey, many changes manifest. The Forsaken's skin darkens, and shadows cling to their body. Their features blur and become indistinct, almost as if they were melting away. The ascendant becomes more sensitive to light, preferring to stay in darkness. Later, the air becomes cold around the ascendant. Their voice echoes, as if they speak both words and thoughts. The ascendant becomes one with darkness and shadows, and they feel their emotions grow colder and darker as they continue down this path.\nCulmination.\nAt the culmination of this path, the ascendant's body fades, and they become a living shadow. While the Forsaken loses the strength of an undead body, they gain the perfection of undeath, an incorporeal and inhumanly powerful free soul. This form resembles their old form, but without facial features. Hair and body shape remains, formed of the stuff of shadows, and eyes remain as burning balls of unholy light. The Forsaken still has a body, however, and is not truly incorporeal as a ghost is. The ascendant's shadow body bears some substance, almost like an ephemeral, inky fluid, but it is so wispy that it almost doesn't exist.\nAbilities.\nAs the Forsaken ascends the normal coils of undeath and transforms to an undead shadow, they grow supernaturally quicker. An ascendant can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed. As long as they are near some sort of shadow, an ascendant can hide from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. They cannot, however, hide in their own shadow. A skilled ascendant can see any invisible creature and may climb any surface as though it is a spider. The ascendant can travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell, the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A highly skilled ascendant can cause innumerable tendrils of shadows to sprout from their body. The effect is centered on the ascendant, the tentacles don\u2019t affect them, and the tendrils retract into their body and the effect ends.\nAn ascendant can attempt to drain the shadows from a creature, and through its shadows, absorb its life forces. If the ascendant pins a foe during a grapple, they drain its shadows. When the ascendant uses this ability, the victim\u2019s shadows drain into the ascendant, and the hollows in his facial features, under his hair, and beneath his body pale into nothingness. The ascendant may use this ability to cannibalize a corpse as well, as normal, but they do not need to actually eat any flesh, while the ascendant feeds, the corpse begins to wither, until it turns to dust.\nThe ascendant animates their own shadow into a shade resembling them. Unlike a normal shade, this shadow\u2019s alignment matches that of the ascendant, and the creature is always visible to the ascendant. The shade cannot be turned, rebuked or commanded. It serves as a companion to the ascendant and can communicate with them. While the ascendant has a shadow companion, they do not have a shadow of their own.\nA highly experienced ascendant finally throws off the shackles of their body and becomes a living shadow. As an incorporeal undead, they no longer have the use of any mundane item unless it has the ghost touch property. They can drain shadows only from a helpless victim or a corpse, however, as they can no longer grapple corporeal foes. They retain all other abilities. The ascendant finds themself unable to stand bright lights. While in a source of bright light (whether natural sunlight or from a spell)the ascendant's attacks are weaker, they are more vulnerable to attacks, and they are less competent at their skills. Furthermore, any light-based attack (such as the holy light spells or damage from a brilliant magical weapon) deals double damage to the ascendant.\nShadow ascendants in the world.\nShadow ascendants, obviously, are universally Forsaken. Ascendants come from all walks of life, but most are &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, though the occasional &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; may find ascension in the Forgotten Shadow. Most Forsaken revere ascendants as the perfection of death and their own inner darkness. An ascendant is a powerful creature, a physical manifestation of the Shadow, free of mortal constraints such as a body or feelings. Shadow ascendants hold a special place in the Cult of Forgotten Shadow. Most ascendants are followers of that faith and expound that their transformations are proof of the faith's truthfulness. Ascendants attend the cult as prophets, leading clergies to the path of true undeath. Even ascendants who claim to be atheists have some knowledge of religions and faith if just to understand their own undead bodies and the Shadow from which they were born. Secretly, an ascendant must have a little faith to begin the transformation, despite how atheistic they may be.\nAmong the Horde, ascendants serve as nigh-invisible spies, priests, and assassins. These living shadows frighten other &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; members, but the Horde bears a measure of respect toward them. The shadow-creatures they become resemble some &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; spirits, though dark and uncontrollable. &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; are wary of the creatures, which exude an overpowering stink of death to the tauren's spirit-sensitive noses. On the other hand, some trolls revere those who complete their manifestations of true undeath as dark Loa spirits, and go out of their way to please ascendants.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nThe appears as a common card for the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". At the end of the controlling player's turn, the Ascendant gives a small buff to the Attack and Health of a random friendly minion on the battlefield. Its flavor text reads: \"When you're at the bottom, there's nowhere to ascend, but up.\"\nIn the web comic \"&lt;a href=\"Freedom\"&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt;\", can be seen sending forth his \"ascendant\" to \"work [her] worst\" by pouring her power into one of Anduin's undead soldiers, causing the creature to be transformed into a bloated monstrosity.\nNotably, the Shadow Ascendant appears to represent the first time that a de-canonized concept from the RPG has been adapted for \"Hearthstone\". However, while \"Freedom\"'s depiction is in line with the \"Horde Player's Guide\"'s description of a formless, incorporeal shadow, the artwork used by the in-game Shadow Ascendant card appears to depict a decidedly more corporeal Forsaken than the shadow ascendants described in the RPG.\nIn canon?\n&lt;a href=\"Cuffs%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Ascendant\"&gt;Cuffs of the Shadow Ascendant&lt;/a&gt; could be a reference to this.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spellbound%20Ritualist\"&gt;Spellbound Ritualist&lt;/a&gt;s that transform into &lt;a href=\"Void%20Ascendant\"&gt;Void Ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt; may be related to the idea of shadow ascendants."}

{"id": "19807", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19807", "title": "Shadow hunter", "text": "Shadow hunters (also written as shadowhunters or shadow-hunters) are masters of &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and were once the highest authority amongst &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Their spirit powers can both heal and curse, walking the line of dark and light in hope of saving the future of trollkind, doing whatever it takes to secure a future for their kin. The &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; can channel themselves through the shadow hunters when they use their ceremonial &lt;a href=\"rush%27kah\"&gt;rush'kah&lt;/a&gt; masks. The traditional shadow hunter weapon is a long double-bladed &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warglaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;. Females are sometimes called shadow huntresses, but the title \"shadow hunter\" can be used by both men and women.\nBackground.\nIn the old days of trolls, even before the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, shadow hunters were prominent in troll society. Sometimes they moved to the fore, while at other times they advised dynamic leaders or gathered together as a council. Their endorsement was always sought and the wisdom of their decisions was always respected. When the Zandalari began to pull away and the trolls began to gather in great cities, the shadow hunters' influence was lessened and their role had to be redefined. To complete a shadow hunter's training remains a great and celebrated thing, however. Shadow hunters are raised to be heroes of mythic proportions. They are both respected and feared since they walk with the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; and therefore cannot completely understand the needs of mortals. It was &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s dream for trollkind to once again be led by shadow hunters, as they had in the past.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; lived on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;, trolls aspiring to be shadow hunters needed to enter the jungle known as &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt; to be judged by the loa. In First Home, ancient spirits of those who had transcended death could give a troll second sight or drive him mad so that he would pull out his own eyes. The loa, which could grant wondrous boons or inflict terrible punishments, made judgments upon those that entered the jungle. These judgments were vicious, swift, and unpredictable. Nobody entered First Home besides shadow hunters and fools. Sometimes the shadow hunters returned, but the fools never did. Now that the Darkspears live on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown where the trial for new shadow hunters is held. It's furthermore unknown what the trials for non-Darkspear tribes entail.\nThe status of a powerful shadow hunter is shown by skulls and materials incorporated into their armor. The strongest shadow hunters of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; are given a special knife after completing their rites of passage. If a shadow hunter happens to be taken under the captivity of other trolls, they are still revered to the extent that they're attired appropriately and are granted an ornate, sacrificial dagger to be strapped in a sheath to their upper-left arm with the intent to make them \"shine like a god\", as is custom. Shadow hunters are revered by the loa, and mistreating them, even under capture could lead to the displeasure of the loa.\nShadow hunters are able to sense &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;titan magic&lt;/a&gt; around them and in other beings.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nShadow hunters can be found in areas with high troll population such as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was revealed that Vol'jin had an elite shadow hunter group known as the &lt;a href=\"Atal-Mhuto\"&gt;Atal-Mhuto&lt;/a&gt; who assisted him on his assault of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of shadow hunters accompanied the Horde and are seen in the various areas of the alternate , serving as Warchief Vol'jin's eyes and ears in a manner similar to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s .\nIn Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.\nThese reclusive, wily jungle trolls are considered to be the highest authority within their respective warbands. They are masters of voodoo magics who can use their spirit-powers to both heal their allies and place curses upon their hapless enemies. Donning their ceremonial rush'kah masks -- that channel the spirits of their dark gods -- the Shadow Hunters walk the line between darkness and light in hopes of salvaging the future for their savage brethren.\nShadow hunters can cast Chain heal, turn enemies to harmless critters with Hex, summon ward to assist him in battle, and point-blank area of effect spell that turns allies around shadow hunter invincible.\nThe names randomly assigned to the Shadow Hunter unit in \"Warcraft III\" are Zul'kis, Zul'abar, Zul'rajas, Zul'maran, Jo Jo Headshrinker, Shaka-zahn, Shakti-lar, and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Mezil-kree\"&gt;Mezil-kree&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nLike other practitioners of voodoo, shadow hunters deal with the darker aspects of the spirit world. Unlike witch doctors and members of other professions associated with this ancient faith, shadow hunters claim to develop a special bond with voodoo spirits called the Loa. Able to channel the essence of some of these extremely potent beings - and often acting with their blessing - shadow hunters gain special abilities only the Loa can grant. As they grow in experience, the shadow hunters' bond with the Loa strengthens and their connection to these powerful voodoo spirits eventually gives them the ability to curse and heal at a whim.\nBrave practitioners of rituals and dark rites, shadow hunters tread a cautious line between darkness and light. Often misunderstood but always respected by those who have witnessed their eerie powers, shadow hunters rely on faith in the Loa and the ability to communicate with them. Through the magic of prayer and ritual, a shadow hunter spends a lot of time maintaining the particular relationship he shares with the Loa.\nRoughly spoken, shadow hunters are former &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter\"&gt;headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s who have gone deeply into the arts of &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;. However, they have not forgotten their hunting skills, which makes a shadow hunter very dangerous in combat. They can stand far away from their enemies while throwing weapons at rapid speed, track down enemies with ease, and also heal themselves and allies. Of all trolls, shadow hunters are the most feared. The traditional shadow hunter weapon is a fel glaive, a long double sword (with a blade set on either end of the handle) which looks a bit different from a &lt;a href=\"moon%20glaive\"&gt;moon glaive&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoa blessings.\nThe voodoo faith of the shadow hunter deals with beings they call the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly, these spirits are mighty entities that grant the faithful extraordinary powers. By calling upon these voodoo spirits, the shadow hunter gains special blessings with which he can combat darkness and help those in need. The abilities granted vary according to the Loa the shadow hunter calls upon.\nThe Loa &lt;a href=\"Legba\"&gt;Legba&lt;/a&gt; is a master of swift motion. Through him, the shadow hunter learns to bestow great speed and grace to his allies.\n&lt;a href=\"Lukou\"&gt;Lukou&lt;/a&gt; is the Loa of healing and respite. She grants the shadow hunter the ability to heal his allies. With a word, the shadow hunter can invoke a scintillating rain of positive energy, which drops from the sky to heal all living allies it touches.\n&lt;a href=\"Samedi\"&gt;Samedi&lt;/a&gt; is the Loa of cemeteries and the restful sleep of the dead. In Samedi\u2019s eyes, the undead are abominations that should be destroyed. A shadow hunter with this ability may attempt to smite an undead with one normal melee attack. If the shadow hunter accidentally smites a creature that is not undead, the smite has no effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Shango\"&gt;Shango&lt;/a&gt; controls the realm of storms, and he guards the secrets of lightning and mayhem. By channeling the fury of this powerful and often unpredictable Loa, the shadow hunter can throw a lightning bolt that deals electrical damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogoun\"&gt;Ogoun&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of war, teaches the shadow hunter to place dire curses upon his enemies. The shadow hunter may change a single targeted individual into a frog. This ability functions like a shaman's &lt;a href=\"Hex\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dambala\"&gt;Dambala&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of serpents and treachery, teaches the shadow hunter to move swiftly and quietly by changing his shape into that of a serpent.\nShadow hunters in the world.\nThe shadow hunter's craft originated within jungle troll society. Since joining the Horde, this breed of civilized trolls has taught voodoo to others deemed worthy of the ancient faith. They also taught the shadow hunter craft to a few special individuals who shared a passion for the faith. Some orcs and tauren have since then become skilled shadow hunters, but the vast majority of members of this class remain jungle trolls. Shadow hunters may be members of any culture and society, but most are part of the Horde. Their intrinsic connection with the Loa and their strong faith in the traditional religion of the jungle trolls make shadow hunters veritable paragons of the faith. Thus, most jungle trolls view shadow hunters as the sacred keepers of their ancient beliefs. As such, shadow hunters ensure that the Loa continue to bless their people by maintaining the age-old traditions and strengthening bonds with the powerful spirits.\nTraditionally, most shadow hunters remain in their homelands, providing sound counsel to tribal chieftains and warriors as well as lending a hand in battle and during other times of need. Today, many shadow hunters roam the world in search of adventure while seeking to further their faith as well as the interests of their people. In olden times, shadow hunters donned special rush'kah masks when performing ceremonies. As they travel throughout the lands of Azeroth, many shadow hunters wear these unique ceremonial masks to cover their features and inspire fear in others."}

Shadow priests can be worshipers of many dark forces such as the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, or simply focus their art on shadowy magics and mental manipulation, understanding the necessity of balance between dark and light. But to truly understand such ancient, corruptive influence is to be driven mad. This is the state in which these dark priests thrive, embracing &lt;a href=\"insanity\"&gt;insanity&lt;/a&gt; and feeding off of the minds of their opponents to reach terrifying new limits.\nShadow priests often stand out by assuming a &lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; were once worshipers of the sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. But discipline was harsh among them, and those found guilty of dabbling in shadow magic or worshiping gods other than Rukhmar were hurled from the spires and into the cursed pools of &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, where their wings shriveled and their bodies contorted. This led to the rise of a new caste of &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;outcast arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, with their own custom of worshiping &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; the Raven God and their own shadow priesthood known as the &lt;a href=\"talonpriest\"&gt;talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShadow priests were first brought to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; society after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt;, a bishop of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, began to delve into workings of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who had poured through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and desecrated their hallowed dead. While at first this was done in order to provide Azeroth with the knowledge it needed to fight against such dark magic, the bishop's studies over the years became increasingly obsessed with finding out why such dark energies existed at all, and why she began to see the ebb and flow of such energies in the world around her. She began preaching about the necessity of a balance between &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, but after her death, her books were locked away in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s vaults in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.

There are various sources for shadow resistance (like green random drop items and pre-BC sets crafted from &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune\"&gt;Dark Rune&lt;/a&gt;s), but it's not advisable to use these items at level 70, because they're too weak and shadow resistance is generally of little use.\nUseful in....\nIn the following instances, shadow resistance can be useful:\nPvP.\nBesides that, shadow resistance can also be useful in PvP when fighting shadow &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. \nNonetheless, &lt;a href=\"Resilience\"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt; is generally considered to be the more useful stat in PvP.\nMount Hyjal and Black Temple.\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; are the only places which cannot be mastered without shadow resistance, and incidentally these are the only places where &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; drops. Therefore, raids entering Mount Hyjal start to find these items, and are well advised to save them and set up a policy how to craft shadow resistance gear for everybody, because at Mother Shahraz the whole raid really needs it.\nThe first good shadow resistance item is gained by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple%20Attunement\"&gt;Black Temple Attunement&lt;/a&gt;, it's the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Medallion of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. The next item everybody should get made is &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20End\"&gt;Night's End&lt;/a&gt; which needs only one &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; to craft.

Since equipping 24 raid members with the full set would require about (8 * 30 =) 240 HoD, many raids won't reach this goal. Most frequently, some raid members miss the Legs. In these cases, some enchants should be used and/or a few gems or green items to reach the cap.

To combat their new allies, the demons started sending in &lt;a href=\"Homunculus\"&gt;homunculi&lt;/a&gt;. These undead creatures are very life like and well preserved, only one with keen eyes would notice the difference.\nIn present day, &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; noticed something strange in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. A night elf named &lt;a href=\"Tearir\"&gt;Tearir&lt;/a&gt; caught her eye. Figuring out his true form, Lilian took him down. With &lt;a href=\"Kyrai\"&gt;Kyrai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt;, they investigated the body and found it pouring green liquid with every cut. \nLilian decided to gather intelligence and finds eight targets located around the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; capital. Unable to do this alone, she sends a raven to &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Keever\"&gt;Apothecary Keever&lt;/a&gt; to send the Shadow at once.\nThe shadows arrives at the sight of the homunculus and Lilian explains what it going on. She tells him that she has plans to kill the remaining homunculi. To do this right and not cause confusion the in Shadow's faction cities, Lilian tells the Shadow to go after the opposing faction's cities.\nTheir first targets were &lt;a href=\"Ardaan%20the%20Solemn\"&gt;Ardaan the Solemn&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tercin%20Shivenllher\"&gt;Tercin Shivenllher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. They both walk around with a hard hitting golem as their bodyguard. After separating them from their protectors, the targets are killed. \nTheir second targets were &lt;a href=\"Taylenne%20Sweetsong\"&gt;Taylenne Sweetsong&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Matilda\"&gt;Mistress Matilda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Both have organised a party and both of them have invited powerful casters. When the rogues see the targets far away from company, they strike and disappear back in the shadows. \nTheir third targets were &lt;a href=\"Corin%20Twinbellows\"&gt;Corin Twinbellows&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kroksy%20the%20Impregnable\"&gt;Kroksy the Impregnable&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. They both have strong armour and would be hard to kill. However, they both stole their keys and removed their armour, rendering them vulnerable easy targets.\nTheir final targets were &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20Jaxon\"&gt;Auctioneer Jaxon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20Xifa\"&gt;Auctioneer Xifa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. They were found in the most crowded of places. With a faster strike, they take out their target and run for their lives.\nThe news of their success reached &lt;a href=\"Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; who in return rewarded the Shadow with a new mount.\nNotes.\nUnlike other class mounts, this mount does not change colors depending on your spec. Other variants may be purchased upon maxing out each spec's artifact."}

In them players can participate in team PvP, struggling for victory in one of a number of battlegrounds against a similarly capable team of players from the opposite &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. Battlegrounds are the main way for players to earn &lt;a href=\"honor%20point\"&gt;honor point&lt;/a&gt;s, used to purchase &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;. Players can also gain &lt;a href=\"experience%20points\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt; through participating in battlegrounds, making them a viable option for leveling. The first battlegrounds become available at level 10, with new battlegrounds becoming available as the player levels. Players can queue for battlegrounds through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattlegrounds can also be experienced as &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s. Rated battlegrounds are fought between two highly-organized teams of dedicated players, offering additional rewards in the form of &lt;a href=\"conquest%20points\"&gt;conquest points&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the chance to acquire a personal and team rating, and rise to the top of the regional PvP ladders. War Games offer a similar experience, but with no rewards or rating adjustments involved, giving organized players a chance to play just for fun against a team of their choice. These types of battleground often vary slightly in their rulesets - see those pages for information. &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;s are also very similar to battlegrounds, sharing many of the basic features.\nThere are a number of battlegrounds in \"World of Warcraft\". Each has its own design, location, and context, as well as its own rules, objectives and special objects. Battlegrounds range from small encounters of 10 players to a side, to large-scale conflicts featuring 80 players and dozens of NPCs. Battlegrounds are categorized as &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt; matches, &lt;a href=\"resource%20race\"&gt;resource race&lt;/a&gt;s featuring multiple &lt;a href=\"resource%20node\"&gt;nodes&lt;/a&gt;, or general warfare involving the attrition of reinforcements and elimination of enemy objectives. Different battlegrounds may focus on individuals carrying mobile objectives, squads holding fixed objectives, pilots operating siege vehicles, or whole raids killing &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as countering those actions by the enemy. Two things all battlegrounds have in common are &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; combat, and the necessity for teamwork and coordination to achieve victory.\nBattlegrounds represent major staging posts in the ongoing conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting for the rights to valuable resources, access to powerful technologies or control of strategic ground, these battles rage endlessly. Each faction struggles to assert their dominance in these battlegrounds in the name of their faction and for personal honor, gaining rank and standing among their allies as a result of their actions on the field. Those who demonstrate their bravery and prowess will be rewarded handsomely, with the most powerful gear and weapons in their faction's armories.\nThe two initial battleground areas, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, went live June 7th, 2005. &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; was added to the list in &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.7\"&gt;Patch 1.7&lt;/a&gt; on September 13th, 2005. A fourth battleground, named &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, was released with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\". A fifth battleground, the &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, was added in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" but later removed in '. The sixth battleground, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, was added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2\"&gt;Patch 3.2&lt;/a&gt; on August 4th, 2009. Two new battlegrounds, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, were added with the launch of the third expansion, '. \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" introduced &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvershard%20Mines\"&gt;Silvershard Mines&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Deepwind%20Gorge\"&gt;Deepwind Gorge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3\"&gt;patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt; in order to conclude the story arc of \"\" and introduce the one of \"Battle for Azeroth\".\nList of battlegrounds.\nBattleground maps are generally categorised into the standard and epic formats. Standard battlegrounds are used for random and rated battlegrounds and each team has 10 or 15 players (10v10 or 15v15 format) taking part in a &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"resource%20race\"&gt;resource race&lt;/a&gt; scenario. Epic battlegrounds take place in the 40v40 format.\nBattleground play.\nBattlegrounds offer a unique experience of &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhere between the wild, unpredictable ambushes of &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; and the honed, highly coordinated combat of &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;, battlegrounds offer players the chance to engage in team PvP with dozens of allies, working together to achieve victory against the opposing team. \nBattlegrounds pitch teams of players against each other in large outdoor and indoor areas. While direct PvP combat remains the bread and butter of the experience, players are required to achieve specific objectives in order to triumph. As opposed to most forms of PvP that focus on defeating other players in combat, battlegrounds therefore often shift the focus away from actual combat and toward a more strategic form of victory. Of course, the prime obstacle in achieving these objectives remains the onslaught of the opposing team.\nWhile largely obeying the same ruleset, &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and battleground &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s offer a slightly different experience. For instance, rated battlegrounds tend to feature highly practiced teams with a precise balance of classes and class &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s, actively communicating at all times. Rated battlegrounds offer greater rewards than regular battlegrounds, and a loss will likely cause the players to lose rating, resulting in higher pressure than regular battlegrounds. War Games similarly tend to be fought between two honed teams, but offer no rewards of any kind, allowing teams to enjoy high-quality PvP without the pressure of victory.\nIn comparison, regular battleground teams tend to comprise fairly randomly selected players, with widely varying gear, experience and ability. Players with less powerful gear are likely to find themselves easily defeated, while those equipped with more powerful &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt; will often dominate the battlefield. However, at max level, the gear of players in both rated and non-rated battlegrounds is limited by the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20item%20level%20cap\"&gt;PvP item level cap&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to limit the impact of gear on play, any item above the current cap is scaled down accordingly, giving less well-geared players a fighting chance.\nRegular battlegrounds are always fought against the opposite &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s may be fought against a team of either faction. In any type of battleground, communication with the other team is prohibited, with any speech in /say or /yell rendered appropriately incomprehensible. Players can however still communicate to some degree via &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt;s. Emote 'spamming' (the repeated use of an emote such as /spit to irritate or annoy enemy players) is seen at times.\nOrder of play.\nPreparation.\nPlayers will enter battlegrounds in their faction's starting area (&lt;a href=\"%23Starting%20areas\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;). Battlegrounds have a countdown of roughly 2 minutes from their creation before the battle itself commences. Players are usually invited at the start of battlegrounds (see &lt;a href=\"%23Queuing\"&gt;\"Queuing\", below&lt;/a&gt;), meaning that most players will have a short time to wait in the starting area before the game begins. Players can use this time to apply buffs to themselves and their party, summon pets, select gear and specialization, and exchange services such as food conjuring and &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt; summoning. During this time players are also granted the \"Preparation\" buff, reducing the power cost of all their spells and abilities to zero. This includes preventing death from &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Ritual of Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Players joining the battleground after the commencement of the battle itself will still appear in the starting area, but will not have the chance to benefit from the Preparation buff.\nA visual element displays the time remaining until the start of the battle, and the final 10 seconds are announced both visually and audibly. After that, gates and entrances leading out of the starting areas are opened, the Preparation buff is removed, and players are free to enter the battleground proper.\nVictory or defeat.\nBattlegrounds continue until either the amount of time allotted for the battle elapses, or one team achieves the battleground's objective (&lt;a href=\"%23Objectives\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;). If the battleground ends due to running out of time, a draw, loss or victory may be determined, depending on the rules of the battleground. Different battlegrounds have different amounts of time allotted for a match.\nBattlegrounds may end in a victory for one team and defeat for the other, or in a draw for both parties. Various rewards may be granted (&lt;a href=\"%23Rewards\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;), depending on the battleground option and whether the player won or lost. In most cases, a draw offers the same rewards as a loss.\nPost-match.\nOnce a battleground has been completed, all play immediately ceases, health and resources are returned to maximum, and players become unable to take actions or control their characters. Players remain free to communicate with their team through the /instance channel. The outcome of the battleground is announced, and a scoreboard is presented (&lt;a href=\"%23Scoreboard\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;) detailing the efforts of the participants. Players can click a button to immediately leave the battleground, or will be automatically removed after 2 minutes. Leaving the battleground also removes the score board.\nElements of play.\nIn addition to specific objectives (&lt;a href=\"%23Objectives\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;), battlegrounds offer several elements not seen in other forms of PvP.\nStarting areas.\nEach battleground features starting areas for each faction. Typically teams will start at the opposite ends of a map; some battlegrounds are therefore significantly skewed by faction, with certain bases or objects initially far closer to one team than the other. In some battlegrounds, the starting area is also a critical area, for instance in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, the starting area is the flag room.\nGraveyards.\nOne of the key differences between battlegrounds and &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; is that in battlegrounds, players can die any number of times without penalty. Upon death, players can choose to release from their corpses, at which point their ghost appears at a nearby graveyard. There a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guide\"&gt;Spirit Guide&lt;/a&gt; resurrects all nearby players on a regular cycle, with a dialog box displaying the time until resurrection. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;s found in the rest of the world, players resurrected by Spirit Guides are restored to full health and mana, as are any pets or minions. Resurrected players also gain a \"Preparation\" buff similar to that granted before the beginning of the match, reducing power costs of all spells and abilities to zero for a few seconds.\nEach faction has its own graveyard(s). Some battlegrounds feature only a single graveyard for each faction, while others feature a number of possible graveyards, with the graveyard a player's ghost is sent to based on the location of the player at the time of death - although this does not necessarily mean the closest. In some battlegrounds, all graveyards are faction-specific; others feature a number of capturable graveyards which will serve whichever faction currently controls them; if the graveyard is captured by the opposite team, all ghosts waiting at the graveyard will be transferred to another of their faction's graveyards. Occasionally, the time spent in transit between graveyards can cause players to miss the resurrection wave, forcing them to wait for the next cycle before they can rejoin battle. Graveyards featuring capturable graveyards also feature at least one graveyard belonging permanently to each faction, to facilitate resurrection should the opposing faction capture all of the graveyards.\nPlayers can also choose to resurrect in the traditional manner, by running as a ghost to the location of their corpse. While this method does not require waiting for a resurrection cycle, it only restores players to 50% health and mana. Additionally, each player's corpse carries an insignia, which can be looted by enemy players, rewarding them with a very small amount of money. If a player's insignia is removed from their corpse, they will be unable to resurrect from their corpses for the duration of the battleground. Each player's insignia can only be looted once per battleground, and can only be looted from corpses of players who have not yet resurrected. Loss of insignia causes players to automatically release from their corpses upon dying.\nBuffs.\nAt various fixed locations within each battleground can be found a number of buffs or power-ups, appearing as overflowing treasure chests with glowing icons hovering above them. These buffs can be acquired by moving into them, granting the player a temporary effect. After the buff has been consumed, a fresh buff will respawn after a short while. Some locations spawn only a specific type of buff, while others will generate a random buff each time. Buffs are the feature of a handful of battleground &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Take%20a%20Chill%20Pill\"&gt;Take a Chill Pill&lt;/a&gt;.\nBerserking.\nIncreases all damage caused by 30% and all damage taken by 10%. Also increases the player's size, and grants a flaming visual effect to the player's hands. Duration 1 minute. This power-up resembles a screaming skull.\nRestoration.\nRestores health and mana. Duration 10 seconds. Taking sufficient damage will cancel the effect. This power-up resembles a large green leaf and adds a nature healing spell visual effect to the player.\nSpeed.\nIncreases run and swim speed by 100% for 10 seconds. Extremely useful for flag carriers and those seeking to evade attackers. Note that it does not increase mounted speed. This power-up resembles a very impressive boot.\nScoreboard.\nAt the completion of a battleground, players are presented with a scoreboard displaying each player's class, name, total damage, total healing, honor gained, honorable kills, killing blows and deaths, as well as a few other statistics specific to that battleground, such as the number of flags captured by that player. Columns can be sorted by clicking on the title at the top of that column, and specializations can be revealed by mousing over the player's class icon. Players can select the 'Alliance' and 'Horde' tabs to view exclusively the data regarding that faction's players, or the default 'All' tab to view all data. The scoreboard also sports the button to leave the battleground.\nPlayers should bear in mind when viewing the scoreboard that it represents a very simplistic measurement of performance within the battleground. Invaluable contributions such as &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, dispelling, buffing and timely intervention or self-sacrifice are not shown. Defenders and flag carriers, while performing a vital role, will frequently rank extremely low on the battleground's scoreboard. In addition, total healing shown includes self-healing and healing of pets but does not include any absorb effects, which can present a skewed impression of the efforts of healers such as Discipline &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is easy to become caught up in attempting to reach the top of the relevant meter, measuring one's skill and contribution to the team solely by the scoreboard. However, this is a highly inaccurate reflection of players' performance, and should not be mistaken for a true measure of skill or anything else. Good play frequently requires players to waste the opportunity to increase their standing on these boards, with the greatest opportunities for combat often involving objective-less combat similar to that desired for honor farming (&lt;a href=\"%23Honor%20farming\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;). Consequently, the top-ranking players on the scoreboard are often those who have paid the least attention to assisting their team.\nDeserter debuff.\nLeaving a battleground before its completion will earn players the &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Deserter&lt;/a&gt; debuff, preventing them from entering another battleground for a short duration. This is to discourage players from abandoning battlegrounds simply due to preference, or because their team seems to be losing. Leaving a battleground to answer the call to a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt; does not apply the Deserter debuff.\nIf a character goes &lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;AFK&lt;/a&gt;, they will automatically be removed from the battleground, also gaining them the &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Deserter&lt;/a&gt; debuff. You can report an inactive player by right-clicking the player's portrait and selecting \"Report AFK\". When enough reports are registered, a 60-second debuff will begin to count down. Once the timer is up a new debuff will appear that will prevent the player from gaining any honor or marks while it is on. This debuff can be negated as soon as the player engages in PvP combat. This system is often abused, since a player can have good reasons for not participating in PVP, for example when they are defending.\nFaction asymmetry.\nAs well as differences caused by the location of each team's starting areas, many maps also feature overall differences in layout that provide an undeniably different experience for each team. Regular battlegrounds are always fought cross-faction, with any given character always experiencing the same face of each battleground. In rated battlegrounds and war games, these differences are no longer necessarily bound to a team's faction but still influence play.\nMost battleground maps are notably asymmetrical. Rather than simple open fields or symmetrical spaces like &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;s, these battlegrounds present idiosyncratically unique terrain on which to do battle. For example, Horde players in &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; find themselves defending their flag in a base surrounded by water, while Alliance players must cross that water to carry their opponents' flag up to the Wildhammer stronghold among the peaks. In addition, the placement of each faction's graveyards can influence play, with one faction having further to run to get back into action after resurrection. Some battlegrounds such as &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; place factions far closer to certain resources, significantly influencing tactics, while a few battlegrounds - &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; - offer a more symmetrical playing experience.\nThese asymmetries have lead to numerous accusations of unfairness and imbalance over the years, due to perceived advantages to one faction or the other. By becoming aware of these differences, players can adapt their tactics accordingly, giving their team the best chance of victory.\nLevel scaling.\nPlayers entering battlegrounds are automatically grouped with other players of similar levels (see &lt;a href=\"%23Brackets\"&gt;\"Brackets\"&lt;/a&gt;, below), with lower-level players placed within an appropriate 10-level bracket. However, in order to balance and equalize the playing experience for players of differing levels, players in low-level battlegrounds will have their effective level raised to the maximum level allowed in that battleground bracket. Players' base stats and spells are scaled accordingly and are treated as the same level when determining hits, misses, and critical effect chance. This feature has no effect on max-level players. Note that although players' stats and abilities are scaled, lower-level players will still lack new abilities and talents not gained until higher levels, and may still, therefore, find themselves at some degree of disadvantage.\n&lt;a href=\"Heirloom\"&gt;Heirloom&lt;/a&gt; items are normalized to the maximum level of the bracket. Normal gear does not scale.\nScaling was introduced with &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2\"&gt;patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt;. Before the introduction of the feature, below-max level players in battlegrounds often found themselves facing off against players of significantly higher level and therefore greater power. Players at or near their bracket's maximum had a large advantage, often capable of defeating several lower-level opponents at once, while those near the bracket's minimum often found themselves struggling to make a significant contribution to the game, easily defeated by most other players. The overall effect of this disparity of level and power was to unbalance the nature of low-level battleground play. This often led to players avoiding battlegrounds while near a bracket's minimum, as well as choosing to participate in battlegrounds more often when they were near a bracket's maximum. With a potential 9-level difference, players might one game find themselves gods of the battleground, able to single-handedly win the match (especially in smaller battlegrounds), and the next relegated to the bottom of the next bracket up, often killed within seconds of resurrection and unable to defeat any but the weakest of opponents. The level scaling feature aims to remove this imbalance in low-level battlegrounds, making for a more balanced and enjoyable game.\nObjectives.\nEach battleground features its own objective. These include being the first to &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;capture a certain number of flags&lt;/a&gt;; accumulate a certain quantity of resources; or defeat the opposing General. While the means of achieving these objectives are often varied, each battleground has a single objective, and only achieving that objective will result in victory.\nObjectives perhaps represent battlegrounds' most significant deviation from other forms of PvP; no amount of honorable kills will result in victory in a battleground unless the objective itself is achieved.\nWhile organised teams tend to focus efficiently on achieving objectives, randomly assembled groups often present varying degrees of commitment to this task. Achieving objectives can require certain players to wait for minutes at a time without experiencing combat, something which is often at odds with players' basic desire to engage in PvP. Consequently, in regular battlegrounds some players are often to be found diverting from the main objectives in favor of some simple player vs player combat. When large amounts of players get drawn into unorganized combat, battlegrounds can easily be lost, or descend into a free-for-all melee as flags and resources are forgotten.\nThose who prefer to focus on achieving objectives - typically including those who are more dedicated to winning the battleground - often do not appreciate these players deserting the team's cause, and such diversion from the main purpose of a battleground is indeed often the cause of a team losing the match. On the other hand, many assert their right to engage in simple PvP, especially when tired of forever taking the strategic option of retreat or defense, leaving some players thirsty for action. Some may also choose to focus on PvP combat for the purpose of honor farming (see below), while others may simply get drawn into combat 'mid-field' (either literally or simply in the sense of failing to achieve any objective) and find themselves unable to break free.\nCoordination.\nThe objective-oriented nature of battlegrounds creates the potential for a kind of strategic coordination not seen in other types of PvP. Each battleground presents a number of potential strategies, many of which cannot be successfully enacted without communication between players, with the pursuit of objectives often requiring patience and sacrifice from team members, as well as a degree of specialization not found in other forms of PvP. Coordination is an extremely powerful tool in any group play, and victory in battlegrounds is often determined by the degree of communication and responsiveness between the members of the team. Players can communicate in the /bg or /i channels to attempt to coordinate their team's actions, and click on the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; to direct allies to specific locations.\nWhile players in premade groups tend to be in continuous communication via online chat services, regular battlegrounds are typically composed of players thrown together from numerous realms, with no experience playing together, and tend to be far less communicative. Players may find themselves debating tactics with several others, or the lone voice in an apparently silent battleground. Nonetheless, even a little coordination can make a big difference to a battleground's outcome.\nPlayers should aim to be in regular communication with their team, alerting them to the movements of the other team, calling for help as required, and coordinating efforts to ensure that objectives are achieved. Players' failure to do so, such as defenders allowing themselves to be defeated without calling for help, is often the direct cause of a team's failure. While communication in a random group can be difficult, the results of successful coordination are undeniable.\nOffence and defence.\nThe very nature of objectives brings with it the suggestion of specialised roles. Depending on the objective of the battleground and the various opportunities for achieving it, a number of roles are possible.\nFor instance, in &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;Capture the Flag&lt;/a&gt; type battlegrounds, a single player will often take the role of flag carrier, usually one who has a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; or at least sports a high degree of survivability. A dedicated healer or two may choose to spend their time assisting the flag carrier, along with any dps players who may wish to join them. Flag carrying players in this way become similar to &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s in dungeons, with the team's success hinging on their survival. The role of defense in these battlegrounds is often far less exciting than that of offense, and failing to keep hold of the team's flag may be met with frustration by some players. Nonetheless, defense is a vital role in these battlegrounds, without which the team cannot triumph.\nIn &lt;a href=\"resource%20race\"&gt;resource race&lt;/a&gt; battlegrounds, teams are often split between different bases. It is almost always wise to leave at least one player at each base currently held; however, this is a far less exciting task than rushing off to assault a new base, which often results in players leaving bases undefended rather than risk spending the entire battleground merely waiting. Players can frequently by heard in the chat for these battlegrounds compelling players to defend the team's bases - although those players may prefer to nominate others to perform this vital yet less than a thrilling task.\nHonor farming.\nSince battlegrounds generally offer a 50/50 chance of victory, many choose to focus on free-form PvP within battlegrounds as a more efficient way of 'farming' &lt;a href=\"honor\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt;. Since this tactic can lead to the failure and frustration of a team which is trying hard to win, this lack of focus is often unappreciated by more serious players. When large numbers of players become drawn into such unorganized PvP, it is often left up to a few dedicated players to focus on the objectives of the game. \nSome teams will focus exclusively on accumulating honor, to the extent of repeatedly 'farming' the other team at their graveyard. These players will gather around the graveyard, quickly killing players when they respawn. While this can in itself be an effective tactic for victory, some teams will intentionally employ this tactic for extended periods of time in order to gain as much as honor as possible, often while refusing to simply win the game. This extended form of farming is often tedious and frustrating for those being farmed, who are unable to survive more than a few seconds against the assembled onslaught of the waiting team. Since leaving the battleground will result in players being flagged as &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;deserters&lt;/a&gt;, often the best choice in these situations is to simply choose not to resurrect; the farming players will then be deprived of some of their honor yield, and if sufficient players take this action, may choose to simply win the game.\nSpecial elements.\nOften related to the battleground's objective, many battlegrounds feature special elements that can be interacted with to achieve victory. Some are directly related to victory - such as flags, orbs and resource nodes - with interaction with these elements provided the sole means of winning the battleground, while others - such as vehicles and enemy structures - can help players gain an edge, or open the door to victory. See individual battleground pages for more details.\nThe involvement of special elements often leads to certain players devoting themselves to achieving certain tasks. For instance, players with a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; may specialize in carrying flags, while others may choose to enter a vehicle to focus on destroying enemy structures.\nThere are many different elements employed in battlegrounds, but a few are described here as examples:\nResources.\nResource nodes are probably the most common element in battlegrounds. Most nodes come in the form of a base that can be captured by players. While that base is held, the team will accumulate resources. Resources may also be generated through other means such as holding orbs or capturing mine carts. &lt;a href=\"Resource%20race\"&gt;Resource race&lt;/a&gt; battlegrounds are won by generating a set amount of resources before the other team.\nFlags.\nFlags are special elements found in games with an element of &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;Capture the Flag&lt;/a&gt;. Right-clicking on a flag will cause the player to pick it up, granting a corresponding buff. A flag can be dropped by right-clicking the buff. Dying will cause a player to drop any flag they are carrying. Flags remain for a short while after being dropped and can be picked up or returned (depending on the battleground) by other players before they despawn.\nFlags are typically used to score points or generate resources, by carrying it to an appropriate 'cap point' and 'capping' the flag. Battlegrounds may feature multiple flags or only one; numerous possible capping points or only one each. The position of flag-carrier is usually a vulnerable one, with enemy players seeking to kill you in order to make you drop your flag. Flags may cause players to become more vulnerable to damage as time goes on.\n'Flag' can also refer to the capture point for bases and graveyards (see below).\nFocused Assault and Brutal Assault.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;Capture the Flag&lt;/a&gt; battlegrounds, these two debuffs serve to progressively weaken the flag carriers, discouraging turtling and overly defensive play, and increasing the speed and activity of the game.\nThe Focused Assault debuff is first applied 30 seconds after both flags have been taken, and steadily increases the flag carriers damage taken by 10% every 30 seconds until they are suffering from an additional 150% damage taken. In addition, after 2 minutes 30 seconds, the Focused Assault stacks will convert to Brutal Assault, also limiting the player to normal running speed.\nBases.\nBases can be found in many battlegrounds, and offer a variety of benefits. Some are a form of resource node while others may serve the function of graveyards or defence outposts. Some bases can be repeatedly captured by alternating teams, while others will remain captured for the duration.\nThere are two different means of capturing bases, depending on whether or not it has a flag. To capture a base with a flag, right-click on the flag. This initiates the capturing action, which will take a few seconds to complete; any movement or damage taken during this time will cancel the action. Successfully capturing the flag will start a timer after which the base will be captured by your team - however, the opposing team may re-capture the flag in that time to cancel the takeover. These flags are therefore fought over fiercely.\nBases without flags use the presence of players to automatically capture them. To capture a base, simply remain within range of it (a visual element will display the current balance of power and the direction in which it is shifting). The presence of more players of one team than the other at a base will slowly cause the base to be captured.\nCapturing a base will cause your faction's banners to be displayed over it, changing corresponding flags to your faction's &lt;a href=\"crest\"&gt;crest&lt;/a&gt;. In some battlegrounds such as &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, capturing a base will additionally transform its appearance, changing the race of nearby non-interactable NPCs to match the controlling faction, while in battlegrounds such as &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, capturing certain bases may cause numerous defending NPCs to spawn and begin attacking nearby enemies.\nVehicles.\nSome battlegrounds such as &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; feature various vehicles which can be employed by players to demolish enemy structures, attack foes or even launch friendly players over the top of the opposing team's defenses.\nBombs.\nFound in battlegrounds such as &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, bombs usually serve the purpose of destroying enemy structures. They can be picked up from certain areas and deposited in vital areas to deal substantial damage to these key structures. Be aware however that planted bombs take a few seconds to detonate, and observant enemy players may try to disarm them in this time.\nGrouping.\nIn regular battlegrounds, players will find themselves pitched into a team of fairly randomly selected players. Players may be sourced from any number of &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s and may include foreign language realms, although this is kept to a minimum. The matchmaking system (see below) does its best to gather a balanced selection of players, but at times players may find particular classes dominating the group or absent entirely.\nIn &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s, players must first assemble their teams before queuing. This tends to make these types of battleground more balanced, with a desirable ratio of class roles and even dedicated players with specific purposes, such as that of flag carrier. In rated battlegrounds players are pitched against a team of roughly similar rating, while War Games allow players to choose their own opponents.\nBrackets.\nOne of the main ways of ensuring some measure of balance in battlegrounds is the use of brackets. Each battleground instance is designed for players within a 5 level range, with the top-most bracket admitting only max-level players. Brackets are automatically selected for the player based on their level, and gaining a level while queuing for a battleground will cause the player to leave the queue. It is however possible for players to gain levels while inside battlegrounds.\nPlayers level-capped due to not having the next expansion, and those who have chosen to &lt;a href=\"Experience%23Disabling%20XP%20gain\"&gt;turn off&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gains through speaking to &lt;a href=\"Behsten\"&gt;Behsten&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Slahtz\"&gt;Slahtz&lt;/a&gt;, will be placed together in separate brackets to other players.\nMatchmaking.\nBattleground teams are assembled from a large group of players, with a number of matchmaking criteria to make the match as fair and balanced as possible. However, judging the skill and ability of players is extremely difficult, and while the system is designed to create exciting, close games, in practice there will always be some games where one team is significantly superior to the other. In addition, the benefits of an extensive matchmaking process must be balanced against the resulting queue length.\nEntering battlegrounds.\nBattlegrounds can be queued for through the &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player%20interface\"&gt;Player vs. Player interface&lt;/a&gt;. This can be opened by clicking the PvP icon on the &lt;a href=\"micro%20menu\"&gt;micro menu&lt;/a&gt;. The same interface can also be accessed through talking to the &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s and Call to Arms NPCs found in capital cities. Additionally, the 'classic' battlegrounds (from before \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion) have entrances in the game world, from which players can likewise queue for any battleground.\nThe reason for this range of options for entering battlegrounds is largely historical. Each classic battleground (&lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;) has two red instance entrance portals - one for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and one for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; - and crossing these portals was originally one of the only ways to enter the queue for their respective battlegrounds. There were also individual battlemasters - one for each battleground - to be found in capital cities. Players were greatly limited in only being able to access battlegrounds through traveling to one of these places. Since the implementation of the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, players can access any battleground from any location, and there is no practical reason to access battlegrounds through any other means.\nNote that it is not possible to join a battleground while &lt;a href=\"dead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, falling, jumping or in mass-transit. Being under the effects of &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; will also prevent you from joining a battleground. However, taking damage will not prohibit access to battlegrounds. None of these restrictions prevent players from queueing for battlegrounds, only from entering them.\n&lt;a href=\"Rated%20battleground\"&gt;Rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s can only be initiated via the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt; (see below) or by using in-game commands.\nThe Player vs. Player interface.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player%20interface\"&gt;Player vs. Player interface&lt;/a&gt; allows players to queue for all forms of PvP, including battlegrounds of all kinds.\nThe Casual pane of the PvP interface allows players to queue for battlegrounds. Players can choose from a list of all specific battlegrounds available at their level, or choose the Random Battleground option (see below), which offers additional rewards. Players can queue for up to two specific battlegrounds at a time, or one Random Battleground, and may choose to queue individually, or in a group.\nRated battlegrounds can be queued for in the Rated pane of the PvP interface. This can only be done by the leader of a party with a sufficient number of members. War Games can also be queued for through the War Games tab of the PvP interface. They can only be initiated by the leader of a party with a sufficient number of members for the chosen map, while targeting the leader of another party.\nBefore joining a queue for a non-rated battleground, players must select one or more of the main combat roles - &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; - indicating which role(s) they are willing to perform in a battleground. Players are only able to select roles appropriate to one or more of their currently chosen specializations, but the role does not have to match their active specialization. For example, a paladin specialized in Retribution and Protection, with Retribution currently active, will be able to queue as a tank or DPS, but not as a healer. This ensures that the player is able to perform their selected role. Players cannot change their chosen roles while already in a queue, and players cannot queue for different roles for separate specific battlegrounds; they must make a single selection for all queues.\nWhen their battleground is ready, the player is informed of the role they are expected to perform, and if the player accepts the summon, their character's role marker will be set accordingly upon joining the battleground. If the player accepts the summon while in a specialization that is not appropriate for the designated role, they will automatically be switched to their alternate specialization, which due to the prior selection constraints, will always be an appropriate specialization for the role.\nRole selection is intended to facilitate more balanced team composition by balancing the number of healers on each team. Consequently, once within a battleground, the player is only able to switch between healing specs, or between non-healing specs. For example a Holy priest would be able to switch to Discipline, but not to Shadow, while a Guardian druid would be able to switch to Feral or Balance, but not to Restoration. This means that classes without healer specs are not affected by these restrictions; for example a death knight is able to freely switch between specs while in a battleground, regardless of the role in which they queued.\nAs well as choosing specific battlegrounds, players can opt to queue for a Bonus Battleground. Two types of Bonus Battleground currently exist: Random Battlegrounds and &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20battleground\"&gt;Call to Arms battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Bonus Battlegrounds offer players additional &lt;a href=\"Honor%20points\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"conquest%20point\"&gt;conquest point&lt;/a&gt; rewards for completing the chosen battleground. Bonus Honor gained by completing certain objectives is also increased in Call to Arms battlegrounds.\nThe bonus rewards for completing a Bonus Battleground are displayed in the Bonus Battlegrounds section of the PvP interface. Greater rewards are offered for winning the battleground, while a smaller amount is rewarded for completing the battleground with a loss or a draw. Each day, the first victory in a Bonus Battleground offers a larger reward; after this, the reward for a victory is reduced. &lt;a href=\"%23Rewards\"&gt;See below&lt;/a&gt; for current rewards offered.\nRandom Battleground.\nFairly self-descriptive, the Random Battleground option queues the player for a randomly selected battleground, appropriate to the player's level. However, through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt; players can choose up to two battlegrounds to be excluded from this selection process - these battlegrounds will not be chosen for players using the Random Battleground option, allowing players to opt out of their least favorite battles.\nRandom Battlegrounds tend to offer shorter queues than queuing for specific battlegrounds. The Random Battleground option is also exclusive to all other battleground queues; players cannot queue for a Random Battleground while queuing for any other battleground.\nRandom Battlegrounds become available at level 20.\nQueuing.\nOnce a queue is joined, the 'searching' icon will be added to the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; frame in the player's &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt;. Mousing over it will display the time the player has been in each queue, and the expected/average waiting time. Players can leave a queue at any time by clicking on this icon and selecting the appropriate option. Players can only be queued for two specific battlegrounds, or one Random Battleground, at any time. Queuing for &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;s will not affect any battleground queues.\nOnce a battleground comes up, a window will appear inviting the player to enter the battleground. The window also states the role the player is expected to perform in the battleground, and when queuing for a specific battleground, the battleground's name. Players have a one and a half minute window in which to choose to enter the battleground, after which the player will be removed from the queue. However, if the battleground finishes before the player chooses to accept the invitation, the invitation will be cancelled.\nThe majority of the time, players are invited to fresh battlegrounds which have not yet started. Invitations are usually sent approximately 2 minutes prior to the start of the battleground. However, if players leave a battleground mid-game, another player will be invited to take their place, leading the invited player (if they accept) to find themselves joining a game that is already in progress, or even near completion. Often this is due to players not wishing to remain in a battleground once they have determined that their team is going to lose; however, leaving in this manner can lead to other players' queuing time being wasted. It is possible for players to arrive in a battleground after the game itself has completed, presenting them only with a final scoreboard and no reward for their time spent queuing. Players may also on occasion be invited to a battleground which closes before the player has the chance to accept the invitation, causing the invitation to suddenly cancel.\nBeing invited to a battleground automatically suspends the player's place in any other battleground queues. Places will be reassumed once the player leaves the battleground, or declines the invitation. While players can queue for multiple battlegrounds simultaneously, they will therefore only ever be invited to join one battleground at a time, and will not be invited to join a battleground while already participating in one. It is also not possible to join a new battleground queue (or queue for &lt;a href=\"PvP%20zone\"&gt;PvP zone&lt;/a&gt;s) while in a battleground.\nRewards.\nPlayers are rewarded for participating in battlegrounds mainly through &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;. Players receive these for &lt;a href=\"honorable%20kill\"&gt;honorable kill&lt;/a&gt;s and for completing various objectives, as well as receiving a substantial portion at the completion of a battleground - especially if their side is victorious. Battlegrounds are the main source for honor points, leading many players to participate in them for the express purpose of obtaining &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;. Players below max level also gain &lt;a href=\"experience%20points\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt; for completing battleground objectives and actions which yield honor, but not for &lt;a href=\"honorable%20kill\"&gt;honorable kill&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Rated%20battleground\"&gt;Rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s offer rewards in the form of &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest Points&lt;/a&gt;, but also in the chance to improve personal and team ratings. As well as being linked to a range of &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, achieving sufficient battleground rating will grant players &lt;a href=\"titles%23Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP titles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattlegrounds initiated as &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s offer no rewards, except perhaps the warm glow of a triumphant victory.\nRegular battlegrounds.\nPlayers can earn &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt; during battlegrounds through honorable kills - gained by defeating enemy players - and as bonus Honor, for completing various objectives. These include gathering resources in &lt;a href=\"resource%20race\"&gt;resource race&lt;/a&gt; battlegrounds, preventing the other team from capturing flags, and destroying enemy structures and NPCs.\nParticipation in battlegrounds can also earn &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the related faction, such as the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;. These reputations may count toward rewards such as titles.\nRandom Battlegrounds.\nIn addition to the rewards granted in regular battlegrounds, Random Battlegrounds offer extra rewards for completing the battleground in the form of Strongboxes, containing a random selection of potential rewards including &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest Points&lt;/a&gt;, consumables and even gear. Along with &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, these battlegrounds are generally the only means for players to gather Conquest Points outside of the far more organized &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. This tends to make these some of the favorite options for those interested in gaining Honor or especially Conquest Points as quickly as possible.\nStrongboxes.\nPlayers are be able to earn Strongboxes through completing Random Battlegrounds. Three ranks of Strongbox are available: Bronze, Silver and Gold. One or more of these will be awarded to each player at the end of the match, depending on the team's performance in the battleground. Winning the battleground will award a Gold Strongbox. Players are still able to earn Strongboxes if their team doesn't win the match. Strongboxes are awarded to every member on the team, as long as they are present at the end of the match. While players will receive some Honor Points directly, Strongboxes are intended to be the main reward for completing Random Battlegrounds.\nThe Strongbox system aims to act as encouragement for players to participate strategically in each battleground, even if their team seems unlikely to win. Completing objectives such as resource gathering will still earn players extra rewards in the form of improved Strongboxes, even if their team loses.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Lore%20%28CM%29\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt;:\nAchievements.\nThere is a plethora of achievements related to battlegrounds. Most are related to events within specific battlegrounds, while some reward players for their total participation. See &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player%20achievements\"&gt;Player vs. Player achievements&lt;/a&gt; for full listings.\nBackground.\nBattlegrounds are representations of massive struggles between the Alliance and the Horde, and sometimes have extensive back-stories involving well-known characters and historic conflicts. Battlegrounds may present the possibility for multiple interpretations, with each party holding its own perspective on the origin and nature of the conflict. For example, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; involves the clash between the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt;. The Frostwolves claim rights to the valley as the home of their clan, accusing the dwarves of invading their territory, while the Stormpike Expedition claim to have been unfairly ambushed while searching for titan relics, calling the Frostwolves \"savages trying to halt Ironforge's sovereign imperialistic imperative\".\nTips.\nEach battleground presents players with its own rules, objectives, and style of play. For tips and strategies for each, see the individual battleground pages. However, there are some simple tips that apply to most if not all battleground experiences.\nRaid-wide buffs (such as , &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Blessing of Kings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Brilliance\"&gt;Arcane Brilliance&lt;/a&gt;) are an important part of battleground play. Through them, the players of each team lend numerous benefits to each other. If you notice (especially during non-critical play) that a nearby ally lacks a buff that you can supply, you can reapply the buff, strengthening them and so slightly improving your team's chances. Raid-wide buffs will automatically apply themselves to all nearby allies when cast. Re-applying raid-wide buffs mid-combat may also be useful, if enemy players are dispelling them from your teammates. As well as strengthening your allies, these buffs act as a kind of protection against other effects being dispelled.\nSimilarly, do your best to provide your allies with other benefits available to you, such as summoning a &lt;a href=\"Soulwell\"&gt;Soulwell&lt;/a&gt; to grant &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;s, or conjuring a &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment%20Table\"&gt;Refreshment Table&lt;/a&gt; to provide allies with food and drink. Always take advantage of these options when they are available.\nWhen resurrecting, make sure to apply all relevant buffs. Your allies will benefit too, and hopefully return the favor. However, in some situations (such as when attempting to prevent attackers from capturing one of your team's bases) it will be more important to simply jump straight into combat without stopping to apply buffs.\nWhen players die in battlegrounds, they need to resurrect and get back into combat as quickly as possible. For that reason, it's best for players to swiftly apply all necessary buffs and then immediately rejoin the game. Players can apply most buffs while running, but not while mounted. You can therefore save a little time by running forward as you buff, then mounting as quickly as possible. Some buffs (such as &lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt;) can also be applied while mounted, and so should only be applied after mounting. Players can also gain a small edge by moving to just inside the Spirit Guide's maximum range before they are resurrected, moving them closer to vital targets. While the time saved by these techniques may seem minimal, when time is of the essence, such as when rushing to defend a flag, the few seconds saved in this way can make the difference between victory and defeat.\nWhile the main substance of battlegrounds is certainly player vs player combat, allowing oneself to get caught up in simply attacking the opposing team is usually a bad idea. Try to keep your head, and don't allow yourself to get distracted by aggressive opponents or easy targets when there are more pressing objectives at hand. Many players will get caught up in random combat mid-field, while their team mates call desperately for help elsewhere; while it's hard not to let this happen at some point, try to remember to check in with the state of the game every so often, as well as keeping half an eye on the battleground chat at all times.\nThe direct cause of many a failed battleground, distraction can also be employed more directly to a team's benefit. For instance, a single player may choose to taunt a group of enemy players, using &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt; and defensive abilities to lead them in a merry chase across the battlefield while elsewhere the player's teammates are able to achieve their objectives unopposed. It is often easy to tempt players with the promise of an easy kill, with certain classes capable of surviving - and keeping a group of attackers busy - for extended periods of time. While this is unlikely to earn you many honorable kills, it may give your team the chance it needs to seize victory. Conversely, watch out for vulnerable outriders or pesky attackers trying to lead you away, and always remember that just because a player seems to be alone doesn't mean they don't have several stealthed allies nearby, waiting to pounce. Remember your objectives, defend your bases and watch those flags!\nThe most important tip of all for battleground play is to communicate with your teammates. Report on important events; call for help; keep others informed. Players often fail to report incoming attacks, or call for help when they need it. While other players won't always respond to such information, even a small amount of coordination in a battleground can make a huge difference, and the outcome of a battleground is often determined by the amount of communication within each team. Even more importantly, it can make for a far more enjoyable experience, with a real sense of team effort.\nUnder development.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe following features are planned for the coming \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion:\nScoreboard.\nThe battleground scoreboard will be updated to better reflect player performance in each match. A new stat called Battleground Score will be introduced, taking into account objective-based gameplay engaged in by the player, including returning flags, interrupting objective captures, healing, doing damage, and more.\nUser interface.\nPlanned for some time after 6.0, the battleground map will display objective timers, complete with additional animations. This is intended to make it easier to identify the time until an objective is captured, for players on both sides.\nWeather conditions.\nThe developers are \"working toward\" adding more substantially varying weather conditions to battlegrounds, apparently similar to seasons with features such as snow storms.\nCoffee with the devs.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/6415071\"&gt;Coffee with the devs: Mists of Pandaria PvP&lt;/a&gt; blog (2012-10-31), lead systems designer &lt;a href=\"Ghostcrawler\"&gt;Ghostcrawler&lt;/a&gt; discussed some of the current \"irons in the fire\" for PvP, including several for battlegrounds. While many of these ideas have since been implemented, some remain on the drawing board:\nHowever, while several ideas mentioned in the blog have since been implemented, Ghostcrawler states:\nMore recently, in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/8043620/Ask_the_Devs_%E2%80%94_53_PTR_Edition-19_04_2013\"&gt;Ask the Devs - 5.3 PTR Edition&lt;/a&gt; blog, the Systems Design Team stated the following in response to questions about new battlegrounds:\nCanceled battlegrounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Catacombs\"&gt;Gurubashi Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nA \"deathmatch\" style battleground, it was scrapped early in development but the concept eventually turned into &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; PvP.\n&lt;a href=\"Azshara%20Crater\"&gt;Azshara Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nA battleground similar to Alterac Valley that was scrapped due to issues with Alterac Valley's mechanics."}

{"id": "561178", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=561178", "title": "Battleground Preview", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Battleground Preview\", an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It's about the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; battleground implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds.html\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds.html&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nArticle Part 1.\nOne of the core tenets of the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt; is the raging conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Old hatreds die hard, as they say, and the hate shared between these two ancient foes is deep and primal. That's why the &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;player-versus-player&lt;/a&gt; gameplay has always been a staple of the design for &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;; the war between the Horde and the Alliance simply isn't over. It might not look this way now, because our full player-versus-player system isn't in the game yet, but the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, and the full PvP reward system, will change that perception. We've been testing Battlegrounds and our reward system for weeks internally now, and we're ready to bring you a full-blown, multi-part preview of what we have in store for you in the months ahead.\nLast week, we engaged in a massive internal test of the new Battleground system, as dozens of internal testers amassed for war in the snows of Alterac Valley. Arrayed in the southern valley was the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf tribe&lt;/a&gt;, a proud group of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s fiercely loyal to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s standard, while at the north valley stood the doughty &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt;, hearty &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s dedicated to the preservation of the Alliance. In a session that lasted hours, we were able to test the latest iteration of our PvP system: High-level groups marshaled at their respective bases and then sallied forth to clash in the center of the map, trying to break into the other side's forward camp, fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; defenders. Lower-level &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s who wanted to contribute in other ways to the battle could also do so by undertaking PvP-related &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, such as capturing &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;s to provide &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s for cavalry charges, claiming a nearby &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; and ferrying resources back to the main base to upgrade allied troops, or capturing enemy &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;s to lengthen the run back to the frontlines for revived adversaries.\nJust when the pitched battle seemed to be stalemated, Alliance &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s appeared over the battlefield and began to lay waste to Horde players below, bringing another set of challenges to the battlefront. To match firepower with even greater firepower, thanks to the efforts of questing Horde players, a fearsome &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; could be heard in the distance calling forth a mighty &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; to begin a rampage of the Stormpike camp. As the battle reached its climactic conclusion, we steeled ourselves for the inevitable destruction that would come as gryphon fury was overrun by elemental rage.\nWe tried very hard to create a battle experience that felt like Warcraft; we want you to feel like you are part of a larger conflict, with the potential for lots of strategy and tactics beyond a simple mob of players crashing into each other. Our hope is that we've succeeded, and once we further fine-tune our Battlegrounds, you players will be able to experience the first of many battlefields where the Alliance and Horde will test their resolve against one another.\nIn the meantime, to whet your appetite while you wait, and to show you some of what we have in store for Battlegrounds, we'd like to share a little more details on Alterac Valley itself. And in the weeks ahead, we'll provide a glimpse at the very latest iteration of our PvP honor system.\nThe Alterac Valley Zone.\nAlterac Valley itself is nestled high within the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. To get there, players will need to run through a tunnel in the mountains. Each side will have its own tunnel entrance into the valley. The entrance into the zone is a swirling red portal, so you'll know you're about to enter a Battleground when you see this striking sight.\nGreat cliffs surround the exterior of Alterac Valley, and hills and spotty trees dot the snow-covered landscape. In the south lies the Frostwolf base, while in the north is the Stormpike base. Each base is a functioning &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"smith\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt;s. And like any other zone, there are &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;hostile monsters&lt;/a&gt; wandering the wilderness. The difference, though, is that everything here is geared towards player-versus-player combat.\nThe middle of the map is basically a hotbed of conflict. Off to one side is a freezing cave where ruthless &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s reside. Within this lair, we're placing some elite &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; that players will be dying to acquire. However, with such incredible loot comes commensurate danger, not only from the residents within, but also from opposing players who might also come searching for treasure. One of several key graveyards is also situated near the middle (more on graveyards later). On opposing sides of this middle are the forward base camps for the two sides, with the Stormpike camp in the north and the Frostwolf camp in the south. Each is led by a powerful &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;: the first line of defense when trying to break through to the other side's base.\nBeyond this forward base camp are patrols of NPC guards, with some of them, such as the captain and several important &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, also being elite opponents. Nestled into the mountains in each side's territory is also a mine. These mines are fiercely held ground owned by &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s. However, inside are crates of supplies that either side would do well to acquire, for they can be used to upgrade NPC soldiers with better &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, thereby making them harder to kill and more lethal in battle.\nAt the opposite edges of the zone, deep in the heart of each side's territory, is a village, and just beyond that, its main fortress. You'll not only find each side's graveyard here, but also various support NPCs, including vendors, smiths, quest givers, and the ultimate &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28rank%29\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; of each side.\nDeath and Graveyards.\nWhen the Battlegrounds debut, you will be able to collect quest loot and trophies off of players you kill. For example, if you are a Horde player and kill an enemy PC, you will be able to take from them their blood. Not only will this be a trophy of your victory, but in the Battlegrounds, amassing the blood of your enemies will have an awesome and powerful effect. If you and the other players on your team bring enough enemy blood, and by that we mean hundreds, to your side's head shaman, he will begin a ritual to summon an immense elemental, which will then march methodically into the enemy camp to destroy it. Likewise, for the Alliance side, bringing enough trophies to your head spellcaster will call an equally powerful being to your side's aid.\nIn addition to looting blood off of a corpse to complete this grand summoning quest, when you kill a player, you will also loot an insignia off their body. The insignia looks very much like the PvP flag next to your character portrait when you are flagged for PvP. When you grab the insignia, you also destroy the corpse of your fallen foe, which means they can't resurrect where they died.\nThe slain player will then get a dialog box asking them whether they want to return to a nearby graveyard to be resurrected and avenge the defilement of their corpse. Once you release and go to a nearby graveyard, you will find that there is a living friendly NPC at the graveyard, not a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt;. Coming back from the dead is a little different in a Battleground. You cannot resurrect yourself at will. Instead, you have to wait for this special NPC to raise you, which he does with an area resurrection effect that he casts every minute or so (you will see a countdown timer on your screen telling you how long before you can come back). When the area effect resurrection goes off, all friendly dead players within the graveyard are brought back to life, with half health and mana, and no resurrection sickness or durability damage. At this point, you are free to return to battle. But how far you have to run to return to the frontlines depends on which graveyard you were raised at.\nAlterac Valley will have several graveyards distributed within it. There will be at least one, if not two, near each side's base and another in the mountains near the center of the map. Graveyards are basically &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; territory that can be captured by either side, which introduces some interesting strategies to the game. Each side obviously will want to control the graveyard closest to the center of the map, so that dead troops can rush back to battle even quicker. However, an even greater advantage is gained by taking the graveyard closest to the enemy's base. That makes it even easier for players on your team to storm the enemy base, as you basically eliminate the long run across the map.\nThe mechanism for controlling a graveyard is through the &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; that lies inside each one. A graveyard already under your side's control will have your faction's banner and several friendly NPC defenders there. The banner tells you who owns the graveyard. To claim a graveyard for your side, you have to tear down the current banner and erect your own, which is basically achieved by interacting with the existing banner. It's easier said than done, though, because a claimed graveyard will have opposing, elite NPC defenders. However, once you succeed, your allied NPC troops will begin to spawn in around the graveyard and take control of it. More importantly, enemy players will no longer be able to revive there.\nComing Soon.\nWe hope we've piqued your curiosity with this first look into the upcoming Battlegrounds. In two weeks, we'll introduce you to some of the more exciting elements of player-versus-player combat, including quests that can turn the tide of war in your side's favor, and the means by which you can storm the enemy camp and lay waste to their base. Read Part 2.\nArticle Part 2.\nA few weeks ago, we gave you a hint of what a Battlegrounds experience would be like, and also introduced you to some new concepts for player-versus-player combat, such as a slightly tweaked death system and capture-able graveyards. Now let's explore in greater detail how the battle for Alterac Valley can truly be won.\nAlterac Valley is a zone for high-level players, which means those who are at or near the level cap. Rest assured we do not plan to restrict Battlegrounds to the highest-levels of players, so there will be more accessible Battlegrounds for lower levels. However, at least initially, only very high-level players will be able to contest the Battleground in Alterac Valley.\nWe definitely are aware that the experience can start to degrade if the Battleground is completely packed with several hundreds of players; the sides begin to lose cohesion, individuals feel less able to contribute to the whole cause, and the potential evolves for a lop-sided affair. So we do have a cap on the number of people on each side that can enter a Battleground. Rest assured we want the two sides to be fairly matched. However, if you have to wait for your turn to enter the Battleground, you can still adventure in the rest of the game world before you are summoned to fight. Our goal has always been to create the optimum experience, and so we will continue to tweak the numbers till we feel we've got an epic, yet manageable, conflict that is fair to both Horde and Alliance players.\nVictory Conditions.\nThe ultimate goal of a Battleground is to slay the enemy's general and destroy the enemy's main base. We've set up many different quests and mechanisms to give players several strategies for accomplishing this goal.\nOstensibly, one side could decide to simply swarm the enemy territory. This would involve first attacking the enemy's forward base camp. This will be a difficult endeavor. The forward camp is guarded by numerous NPC defenders in the mid-fifties, as well as the elite camp commander and his elite special guards. Not only are these defenders numerous, and tougher due to the elites, but there will also be a tower or two flanking the way through this forward camp.\nTowers.\nTowers are defensive structures garrisoned by several NPC guards. The garrison is armed with extremely long ranged &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s, and can snipe at enemy players from far away. These towers will send volleys of fire at onrushing attackers, softening them up before they crash into the wall of defending enemy players and NPCs. The garrison defenders will also continue their withering fire as the attackers battle it out below. The side in control of the tower maintains a significant advantage in the melee ensuing underneath its considerable shadow.\nLike graveyards and mines, towers can be captured. The large flag atop a tower denotes its controller, and just as with graveyards, you can claim one for your side by tearing down the existing flag and erecting your own. At that point, your own NPC troops will spawn in and wrest control of the tower from the enemy. When control completely switches to your side, you will gain the supporting firepower of the tower, making it a key strategic point to capture on your way to your overall goal of destroying the enemy base.\nIf you can manage to kill the camp commander, wipe out the NPCs, and drive away enemy players, your work won't yet be completed. Taking the graveyard and towers near the forward camp and installing your own NPC troops there will ultimately place the area under your control and make it much easier for you to then mount a final push into the enemy's base.\nTaking the Main Base.\nAs hard as the forward base camp will be to defeat, the main base will be significantly harder. There will be a high level elite general even stronger than the camp commander, and there will be even more elite guards and more NPC defenders in waiting. And of course, there will be yet more towers defending the area. However, if you can manage to kill this general, then the surrounding enemy base will begin to erupt into flames in sympathetic ruin. As the buildings are consumed by fire, you will finally gain control of the base, and control of the Battleground as well. At this point, your faction will have recorded a victory in the Alterac Valley Battleground, with a huge number of subsequent &lt;a href=\"honor%20point\"&gt;honor point&lt;/a&gt;s being added to the honor pool that will then be distributed to all PvP combatants for the day.\nRebuilding.\nBattlegrounds, though, are a dynamic system, and so the conflicts therein will continue to rage back and forth even after a winner is declared. For the next few hours after your side scores a victory, the opposition will have no NPC troops to help them. That will give you greater control over the zone and the ability to fully explore Alterac Valley with confidence.\nEnemy players might choose to resurrect in the tunnels leading into Alterac Valley and harass your side's players, but as the entire zone will be firmly in your control, it will be difficult for any opposing players to mount any sort of effective counterattack. Instead, they will have to wait for their base to rebuild itself.\nA little while after it gets razed, the destroyed base will begin to slowly rebuild itself. Players can significantly reduce the reconstruction time, though, by capturing the nearby mine and delivering supplies between the mine and the base. Control of the Battleground will revert back to a contested status, and the battle for Alterac Valley will commence once again. However, mines, towers, and graveyards will remain under the victor's control, and will need to be retaken.\nPlayer-Versus-Player Quests.\nAssaulting and demolishing the enemy base will be prohibitively difficult if one side simply decides to storm the enemy. This is where quests come in. The PvP quests in Alterac Valley add strategy and additional avenues to assist in the overall goal of conquering the Battleground.\nThe initial and repeatable quest you can acquire is to gain improved &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the main base fighting for your side. Horde players will be told to kill Alliance players, and vice versa. After you collect the insignias of your fallen foes, you can bring them back to your base to increase your standing with your side; on the Horde side, you would be improving your relationship with the Frostwolf clan, while on the Alliance side, it would be with the Stormpike dwarves. As you improve your reputation, you'll gain a special &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;, which gets replaced by a more powerful version each time your reputation rank jumps up a category, such as from honored to revered. Reputation can also be improved through questing, of course. Improving your reputation will be very important because many of the best abilities for use in Battlegrounds, such as calling cavalry charges and air strikes, can only be done by players with very high reputation.\nOne of the first quests you can undertake is to take control of the mine near your faction's camp. The Alliance's mine is initially under the control of troggs, while the Horde's mine is held by kobolds. You can capture a mine, but unlike with graveyards and towers, you don't do so by planting a flag. Instead, after you kill the mine's kobold or trogg leader, a lieutenant from your side will spawn in with defenders to take control of it.\nDeep within each mine are supplies. The quest here involves gathering a certain number of supplies and bringing them back to your side's &lt;a href=\"quartermaster\"&gt;quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;. When you complete this quest, all your side's NPC troops automatically get an instant upgrade in weapon and armor effectiveness, and an increase in their level. There are several additional quests beyond this initial one to acquire more supplies, and each time you complete these successive quests, your side's NPCs get further upgraded in weapons, armor, and level. However, over time (usually about an hour), these upgrades begin to degrade. If you want to keep your troops in top fighting condition, you'll also need to keep the supplies flowing in as well.\nAnother quest is related to this, and it involves storming the enemy's mine and stealing their supplies to upgrade your troops. This is an additional quest, and not only do these supplies benefit your troops, but by stealing them away from the enemy, you also deprive the other side of upgrade supplies as well, since the supply crates within each mine are limited and spawn slowly.\nTwo other quests can also be accomplished by players, and their rewards have enormous influence on the outcome of a hotly-contested Battleground. One quest enables you to summon aerial units to bombard the enemy. To complete it, you must break into the enemy's camp and free the three wing commanders held prisoner deep within the opposition's base. If you can escort them out of the base and into safety, you will get a whistle as a quest reward that thereafter lets you call in air strikes from the wing commanders. On the Alliance, blowing the whistle will call a griffon to your aid, while on the Horde side, blowing the whistle calls a &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;. As there are only three wing commanders to rescue, your side will only be able to call down a maximum of three air strikes at a time.\nThe quest with the most powerful reward, though, requires you to gather the blood of fallen enemy players for your side's chief spellcaster. On the Horde side, as revealed a few weeks ago, the ranking shaman asks you to bring back the blood of Alliance players. The quest actually needs to be performed by dozens of players, as the shaman requires hundreds of blood samples to be brought before him. When enough is returned to him, he summons an &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Ice Lord Elemental&lt;/a&gt;, which then begins a rampage of the enemy base. On the Alliance side, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic enclave asks you to acquire the essence of Horde players, which is essentially their spirit made manifest in an item you can loot off their body. In both cases, the blood and essence is something in addition to the insignia that you can loot off a fallen player as a trophy of your kill. Once you return the requisite number of essences, the druid will summon a mighty &lt;a href=\"Ivus%20the%20Forest%20Lord\"&gt;Ancient of War&lt;/a&gt;, who will make his way toward the Horde base, dispensing destruction to all Horde players in his path. Both the Ice Lord and Ancient of War will be enormously powerful creatures, easily the equivalent of a raid boss, and will give their side a decided advantage in the battle to seize Alterac Valley.\nOther Quests.\nThere are also some neutral quests in Alterac Valley with significant rewards for whichever side can complete them first. At a &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; hideout in the Valley, you can meet a &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Master%20Ryson\"&gt;neutral Syndicate NPC&lt;/a&gt;, who will give you a quest to recover a Syndicate artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Ryson%27s%20All%20Seeing%20Eye\"&gt;All-Seeing Eye&lt;/a&gt;. It's been stolen by the elite trolls in the ice cave, and if you recover it for him, he will let you use it, and pledge his Syndicate &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s to your side. The twist with this quest is that once you get the Eye from the cave, you must bring it back to the Syndicate leader. But while en route, you'll be tagged with a glowing aura. If the enemy faction manages to kill you before you return the Eye, they can loot it off your body and finish the quest for you, thereby stealing the Eye and the Syndicate for their use.\nAnother neutral NPC, an &lt;a href=\"Master%20Engineer%20Zinfizzlex\"&gt;esteemed goblin engineer&lt;/a&gt;, is held prisoner in the ice troll cave. If you acquire the quest to free him and escort him safely out of the cave and back to your base, he will join your side. At that point, he will give another quest, this time to create a special war machine, the &lt;a href=\"Zinfizzlex%27s%20Portable%20Shredder%20Unit\"&gt;Portable Shredder Unit&lt;/a&gt;, for your use in helping your faction in the war.\nThese aren't the only quests available in Alterac Valley. Several others also exist to strengthen your chances for victory. Through them, you can spawn in waves of reinforcements to assault the enemy base, and accomplish other benefits for your side.\nA Final Preview.\nSo there you have it: the conditions whereby you can gain victory in Alterac Valley and the means by which you can expedite your mission. In several weeks time, we'll turn our gaze away from Battlegrounds and focus more on the new PvP Honor System, gaining ranks, and the bevy of rewards that awaits for those who engage in the honorable defense of their lifestyle against the encroachment of the enemy faction."}

Originally one of the only ways to queue for battlegrounds, with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, battlemasters are largely redundant, and serve no practical purpose.\nEach capital city has several battlemasters, but not all capital cities have battlemasters for all the battlegrounds: only &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; Battle-Mages, and only &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; Battle-Mages. The battlemasters can usually be found gathered in one place, often a war-room or similar. Battlemasters can also be found at the entrances to the original battlegrounds. Interacting with any battlemaster will open the &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt; window. When using the tracking system with the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; battlemasters will appear with the Alliance and Horde icons () at their locations.\nCity battlemasters were originally the only way to queue for a battleground without travelling to the physical entrance of that battleground. There was one battlemaster for each battleground, with players having to seek out the correct battlemaster to queue for the corresponding battleground. Players who had queued for a battleground could continue to travel around and play the game while they were queued, but upon leaving the battleground would be immediately teleported back to the battlemaster's location. Since battlemasters were located in cities, players generally had to travel from the zones where they were adventuring in order to seek out a battlemaster, making it difficult to combine battlegrounds with non-city-based activities. With the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, battlemasters were made redundant, as players can access the same options directly through the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20Menu\"&gt;Micro Menu&lt;/a&gt;, without needing to seek out a battlemaster.\nTactics.\nBattlemasters come in two varieties: &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. Battlemasters without a mana bar are considered warriors. City battlemasters are often in separate areas from normal PvP combat, however &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; both pull with their respective city battlemasters.\nWarrior battlemasters use strong physical attacks, can &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, have a , &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; attacks. As such, they are best kept separated from the rest of your party to minimize their overall damage and interference during combat.\nMage battlemasters are weak physically but use &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Armor\"&gt;Frost Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Blast\"&gt;Fire Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Amplify Damage\". \"Amplify Damage\" increases the target's damage taken by 100% for 10 seconds and as such should be dispelled quickly. When engaged with a city leader they should be quickly eliminated to avoid sudden spikes in tank damage.\nRemoved battlemasters.\nBattlegrounds and Wintergrasp.\n&lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; battlemasters were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, and most battlemasters for specific battlegrounds were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nArenas.\nArena battlemasters were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Aelus%20Goldmorn\"&gt;Aelus Goldmorn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sawemba\"&gt;Sawemba&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; were generic battlemasters, like the battlemasters still in-game today.\n&lt;a href=\"Arena%20Battlemaster%20%28Arena%20Tournament%29\"&gt;Arena Battlemasters&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Tournament\"&gt;Arena Tournament&lt;/a&gt;s were found in all races' starting areas on Arena Tournament realms."}

Just after the militia's founding following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Br\u00f6ng assembled the Garad'kra in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to give them their first orders: ending the new threat posed by &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; army. Despite his position, he seems to not agree with the division that was growing within the Horde under &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Garad'kra team led by the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; learned that the centaur's attacks on Horde settlements was a distraction meant to allow Aratas' army to invade the Horde's capitals. Shagara sent a message back to Br\u00f6ng to give the Horde time to prepare, while she and her team traveled to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; to strike at the centaur directly.\nShagara's team managed to kill Aratas and his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt;, but only by taking great risks and at the cost of one of their members, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rada%27jin\"&gt;Rada'jin&lt;/a&gt;.

Back in Orgrimmar weeks later, Br\u00f6ng told Shagara that she had been reckless but that her mission had been a success.

It \"stretches\" skin, bone and flesh on animals, forming it into new shapes, while they're alive and screaming loudly. Mastering this power requires decades of study. The &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; was the source of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;'s flesh-shaping power. In the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Flesh-Shaping%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Halls of Flesh-Shaping&lt;/a&gt; lies &lt;a href=\"Anima%20%28blood%20fluid%29\"&gt;the mysterious substance&lt;/a&gt; responsible for all &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; flesh-shaping experiments.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rookery\"&gt;Dark Rookery&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'jin felt the residue from the creation of the saurok. According to him, the magic that could remake something so completely came from the dawn of time, and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s had used such magic in their acts of creation. The incredible powers of such sorcery cannot be understood, let alone mastered, by a sound mind, but dreams of it fuels flights of fancy. Vol'jin thought that the same magic that had created the first saurok could unmake the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s that had killed &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; or cause &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s to regress back to &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. However, he also realized that in thinking that, he was falling prey to the same trap as the mogu. Immortal magic will inevitably corrupt a mortal, destroying the wielder and, likely, his people.\nIn Maldraxxus.\n&lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; is a place all about flesh shaping and resources given to soldiers to become the best army they can Someone arriving in Maldraxxus is given a very basic kind of form that they can inhabit and then based on their victories or their losses they get upgrades or downgrades to that body, the little scrawny leftover abominations are an example for those that just didn't work out, whereas someone like &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; who was successful working their way up the ladders very quickly they are in the position where they could start making some choices and are given some latitude in order to decide their form and start shaping their flesh their way, if someone doesn't prove themself then those choices dissipate pretty quickly. The &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20Fleshcrafting\"&gt;:Bindings of Fleshcrafting&lt;/a&gt; shaped \"the very flesh and bone of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; had the power to shape form in ways few beings can, his heart is called the &lt;a href=\"Fleshshaper%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Fleshshaper's Heart&lt;/a&gt; and is used to empower the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;."}

Here the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; focused his malefic powers on flesh giants: nightmarish creatures that make abominations look tame by comparison.\nScourge minions assembled flesh giants and abominations in a similar manner, piecing them together out of body parts from numerous corpses. Unlike abominations, though, the \"spare parts\" used to create flesh giants were harvested from multiple types of fearsome &lt;a href=\"Storm%20giant\"&gt;Northrend giants&lt;/a&gt;. These living battering rams employed tremendous brute strength in carrying out the inexorable will of their loathsome master.\nFlesh giants can be constructed from the pieces of &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;.\nA little-known quality of the flesh giants is that their spinal fluid interacts with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid.\nFlesh giant (Naxxramas).\nFlesh giants are a horrific &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20golem\"&gt;combination&lt;/a&gt; of flesh and machine.

It is located high above &lt;a href=\"the%20Avalanche\"&gt;the Avalanche&lt;/a&gt; that rumbled down into &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;. Even for a place controlled by the Scourge it is disgusting, with poison and plague bubbles everywhere, and undead fleshripper birds circle. The Fleshwerks consists of several different areas, a flesh giant lab named the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Reanimation\"&gt;Sanctum of Reanimation&lt;/a&gt;, and an abomination lab with a cauldron area and a summoning area.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; is the quest hub of this area, used by both the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; as a base of operations to shut down the Fleshwerks, in order to deprive the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; of a large component of his armies.\nHistory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, it was the &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; laboratory the Scourge used to construct massive mountains of flesh, the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. Here, they also built &lt;a href=\"flesh%20giant\"&gt;flesh giant&lt;/a&gt;s from parts of the &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, those enormous brutes served as unliving battering rams for the Scourge.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was sent here by &lt;a href=\"Darkrider%20Arly\"&gt;Darkrider Arly&lt;/a&gt; to observe and dismantle the summoning altars in order to stop the flow of skeletal laborers. After they placed &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Gaze%20Orb\"&gt;orbs&lt;/a&gt; to observe the movement, they were sent to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Orb%20%28Icecrown%29\"&gt;Blood orbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Embalming%20Fluid%20%28Icecrown%29\"&gt;embalming fluids&lt;/a&gt;. If the adventurer managed to find the &lt;a href=\"%3AJagged%20Shard\"&gt;:Jagged Shard&lt;/a&gt;, they were instructed to gather more of these and give them to &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Olakin%20Sainrith\"&gt;Crusader Olakin Sainrith&lt;/a&gt;. The Crusader told them that he had \"never seen any metal like this in all of his battles against the scourge\" and instructed them to smelt the metal in the furnaces beneath , so they could identify, as well as to capture more of the metal by killing the Runesmiths, in order to find out what the Scourge was doing with the metal. After this they were sent on a preemptive strike to burn the corpses, as well as to take out the ghoul mastermind &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Sabnok\"&gt;Doctor Sabnok&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the laboratory, &lt;a href=\"Father%20Kamaros\"&gt;Father Kamaros&lt;/a&gt; could be found prisoner of the Scourge, and asked the adventurers to escort him to safety at the &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the area was assaulted by both the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; forces, the adventure was sent to kill chained abominations in the laboratory. They were then tasked to gather the remains of the slain &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Olakin%20Sainrith\"&gt;Crusader Olakin Sainrith&lt;/a&gt; and revive him. Their final mission involved killing &lt;a href=\"Morbidus\"&gt;Morbidus&lt;/a&gt;, the Fleshwerks' greatest accomplishment.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Fleshwerks remained under &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; control; the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; still making more monsters of their own, though without driving purpose and at a much slower rate.\nPhases.\nWhen the quests are completed, the area does not become a base, like the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vault\"&gt;Shadow Vault&lt;/a&gt;, but remains in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitial.\nThe Scourge controls the area, skeletal laborers are being summoned constantly.\nCrusaders vs Corpulent Horrors.\nDelivering the quest &lt;a href=\"Killing%20Two%20Scourge%20With%20One%20Skeleton\"&gt;Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; starts a new phase in the Fleshwerks. Corpulent Horrors and geists populate the area, being attacked by crusaders and Ebon Knight cavalry. The summonings have also stopped."}

An agitated mob of them can be seen at &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Henry%20Framer\"&gt;Constable Henry Framer&lt;/a&gt;, wanting to see Lucille hanged for her supposed crimes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; proves Lucille's innocence in front of the villagers and later helps Mayor Evelyn Pare and the militia to evacuate their fortified camp before clearing the village from witches.\nOccasionally, the area is attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Darktide\"&gt;Darktide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, with the villagers held in naga cages.\nSpeculation.\nDue to the name and the village having a lumber yard as well as a mine, one could assume the village specialized in fletching - making arrows."}

It allows for raid content to automatically scale its difficulty depending on how many players are in the raid at the time the bosses are encountered\u2014between 10 and 30 players. That means if a raid has 11, 14, or 23 other people available for a Raid, they'll all be able to participate, and the enemies will scale dynamically. This difficulty scaling will bottom out at 10 players, even if you have fewer than that in the raid.\nRaids using the Flex system operate on a &lt;a href=\"Raid_lockout%23Loot-based_Lockout\"&gt;loot-based lockout&lt;/a&gt;, allowing players to fight bosses they had already killed (but without subsequent loot).\n&lt;a href=\"World%20boss\"&gt;World boss&lt;/a&gt;es also use this system to scale their difficulty.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, Flexible Raid was added as a separate difficulty that sat between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty (now Heroic) that was available for premade groups of 10 to 25 players, including any number in between. It was entered via queueing through the Flexible Raid UI and was separated by wings, similar to Raid Finder. It required a minimum of 8 players to queue. This difficulty was only available for &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the Flexible Raid difficulty was renamed Normal and this flexible scaling system was applied to Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic (old Normal) difficulties for Siege of Orgrimmar and all subsequent raids. Heroic was renamed &lt;a href=\"Mythic\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; and remains the only difficulty to not use this system\u2014being statically tuned around 20 players.\nBreakpoints.\nThere are generally no set breakpoints for boss abilities. With a few exceptions, each person in the raid adds a 20% chance for the boss ability to target an extra person or have an extra effect.\nProgression.\nIn Normal and Heroic modes, the bosses available in the raid instance is determined by the raid leader's &lt;a href=\"Raid_lockout%23Loot-based_Lockout\"&gt;loot-based lockout&lt;/a&gt; (first unkilled boss). If the raid leader has already completed all the bosses in the raid, it will start at the first boss."}

This is usually due to two reasons: only being available to one faction due to phasing, and so are invisible to the opposite faction and not attackable, or being a neutral faction, and thus not attackable at all. Flight masters don't attack players of the opposite side unless they are themselves attacked, nor help you if you are attacked by players of the opposite side.\nSome flight masters, such as several in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, only have one option to fly to and this is usually not very far away.

{"id": "95638", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=95638", "title": "Flight path", "text": "A flight path (often abbreviated as FP) is the primary means of zone-to-zone travel on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They are a transportation link between two fixed geographical points via fixed paths on faction-exclusive aerial &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; utilizes both the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; for transportation, while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; uses Kalimdor's &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, Lordaeron's massive &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20bat\"&gt;vampire bats&lt;/a&gt;, and Quel'Thalas's rare &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSee the side bar for links to listings of specific flight paths.\nIdentification and use.\nA flight point is manned by a single &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;. A flight path must first be \"discovered\" by visiting an area's flight master, which will then enable traveling to and from that area. If a flight master has a flight path to teach you, a green will appear above his or her head, the flight master will appear as a on your &lt;a href=\"mini-map\"&gt;mini-map&lt;/a&gt;, and as a shoe-with-wing icon on the &lt;a href=\"world%20map\"&gt;world map&lt;/a&gt;. Once you learn a flight point, it will be offered as a destination by all flight masters on the same continent. Even if you haven't learned the flight points in between two far-flung destinations, you will be able to route through them, but not land there.\nFlight path icons are color-coded by faction on the world map: blue for Alliance, red for Horde and gold for neutral (usable by both factions). Players cannot see the opposite faction's flight points on the world map.\nCost.\nDifferent flight paths cost different amounts. The cost of flights is reduced by 5-20% due to the &lt;a href=\"faction%20discount\"&gt;faction discount&lt;/a&gt; based on your &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the flight master's &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeed.\nSince , flight paths rides move at 434% of running speed, making them considerably faster than unbuffed &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;Master Flying&lt;/a&gt; (310%). However, flight paths also often take unneeded turns to reach their destinations, making the effective difference smaller. It may be faster to use a flying mount instead of a flight path, especially pairing Master Flying with a flight speed buff \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Up\"&gt;Mount Up&lt;/a&gt;, etc. \u2013 to avoid the unnecessary sight-seeing that flight paths take.\nAttacks.\nIf flight masters are attacked by members of the opposing faction, they will spawn a pair of level 110 elite &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s to defend themselves (s or s for Horde flight masters, s or s for Alliance). Flight masters, while hostile to enemy players, have no aggro radius and will only attack enemy players if they attack them first. This is done so that neutral places like &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where both Alliance and Horde flight masters reside, allow players to remain there without causing unwanted PvP fights.\nLogging out in flight.\nIf you log out in flight, upon logging back on, you will continue your flight from the same spot where you logged out. However, in a flight of multiple legs, you will then land at the next known waypoint of the journey. This behavior can be used to abort a flight, provided there are waypoints before the destination. (Though nowadays, there's also a button \"Request stop\" just above the spell bar which does the same/) This also happens if you teleport into an instance (&lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;) mid-flight and then exit the instance: you will return to the flight path at the point you were before entering the instance, but will be dropped off at the next known waypoint.\nInterestingly, logging back in to an Alliance character using a flight path will change whichever steed (Hippogryph, Skeletal Gryphon, Dragonhawk) was being ridden before into a normal Gryphon, and Horde characters will log back in to find themselves riding a Wyvern.\nNew characters.\nSince \"Cataclysm\", all characters automatically know the flight paths to all of their faction's capital cities and starting zone hubs, as well as &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance characters also learn the flight path between &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; upon discovering either one of its endpoints.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s begin the game with access to all of their faction's flight paths in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, with the following exceptions: the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and most smaller quest hubs (specifically, those added in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;). All of those flight points were added after the death knight class was introduced. This, however, was later changed on an unknown date.\nHistory.\nOriginally at each flight point you had to select the next flight point you wanted to go to and so on until you reached your destination. AFK characters were more prevalent than they are now at flight points before the introduction of linked flight paths in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.10.0\"&gt;patch 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt; allowed you to pick a point across the map and fly all the way there, provided that you knew all the intermediate flight paths. For example, new players in Northrend sometimes quest in both &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, but are unable to fly between them because they are linked by several intermediate flight paths in much higher level zones.\nOver time, additional flight points were added at various places.\nThen, in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, flight paths changed for the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" to reflect the revised world. Many zones received additional flight paths that make traveling within the zone faster and easier. And in some zones, flight paths disappeared or appeared due to changes in Alliance and Horde control. To remedy the breaking of some flight paths, characters now received all undiscovered flight points zone-by-zone on reaching suitable character levels. This had the effect of immediately granting many players knowledge of flight paths they had not known before patch 4.0.3a. Characters were also automatically given all flight points for many faction-specific low-level zones upon creation. \nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt; the \"Cataclysm\" changes were reverted, with flight points no longer automatically discovered.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%206.1.0\"&gt;patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, the behavior of flight paths changed again. Players may now fly through flight points that they have not discovered yet if doing so would result in a more direct flight path to the destination. Also, a button was added to the interface to allow players to abort a flight midway and land at the next \"known\" flight point (while flying past unknown flight points on the way).\nGallery.\nOne can often see what type of mount a certain flight point uses by the nearby banner:"}

The dissatisfaction of the &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; was due to the treatment of dragonkin appearing as dishonorable, feeling that they were pushed aside, reduced to mere servants, and they felt displaced. They joined the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and conglomerated in the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Vale\"&gt;Misty Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and also made camps near Valdrakken, &lt;a href=\"Scalewatch%20Caverns\"&gt;Scalewatch Caverns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rebellious%20Cliffs\"&gt;Rebellious Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;.

They provided them with magical runestones, which the rebels tried to use to detonate the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Seat of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. Except for commotion, the attempt was unsuccessful, but it alerted the &lt;a href=\"Scalesworn\"&gt;Scalesworn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Investigator%20Erima\"&gt;Investigator Erima&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, sent by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt;, investigated the crime scene, witnesses, and the &lt;a href=\"Inert%20Runestone\"&gt;Inert Runestone&lt;/a&gt; that was supposed to blow up the Seat. The rebel that was sent to the Seat dropped a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; that was found by Erima and the adventurer. They examined it and noticed the mark on Misty Vale.\nThe pair traveled to the vale and worked with the adventurer on killing rebels and Primalists, gathering their attack plan maps, and destroying &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Runestones\"&gt;Incendiary Runestones&lt;/a&gt; that were to be used for explosions. As Erima was scouting the camp, he found his childhood friend, &lt;a href=\"Maldra%20Flametongue\"&gt;Maldra Flametongue&lt;/a&gt;, being held captive. Maldra had joined the rebels, but after she discovered their true intentions and tried to leave, but they imprisoned her instead. &lt;a href=\"Orian%20Darkwater\"&gt;Orian Darkwater&lt;/a&gt; was holding her bound magically, but the adventurer killed Orian and freed Maldra, and the two friends were reunited. Inside the vale was the &lt;a href=\"Emberslate%20Cavern\"&gt;Emberslate Cavern&lt;/a&gt; where the rebels and Primalists were creating their fiery runestones. To gain access to the cavern, Maldra had the adventurer bring her &lt;a href=\"Fallingwater%20Mote\"&gt;motes&lt;/a&gt; from the vale's &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. Using Orian's knowledge, Maldra then performed a ritual to breach the fire wall and gain access to the cave. Inside, Maldra and the adventurer continued fighting against the rebels and their &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; allies, destroyed &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Focus\"&gt;Primalist Foci&lt;/a&gt; that the rebels had been using to create new explosive runestones, and sealed the Primalist portal and killed the &lt;a href=\"fire%20revenant\"&gt;fire revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magmaticus\"&gt;Magmaticus&lt;/a&gt;. This thwarted the rebels' plans completely and Maldra resigned from the Flightless for good. The Scalesworn, however, needed to continue keeping a close watch on any dissent going forward.\nThe rebels stationed at &lt;a href=\"Scalewatch%20Caverns\"&gt;Scalewatch Caverns&lt;/a&gt; were ambushing civilians along the roads to Valdrakken. Captain Drine sent adventurers to halt their operations by thinning the enemy numbers, freeing &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20Traveler\"&gt;Imprisoned Traveler&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Cage\"&gt;Rebel Cage&lt;/a&gt;s and destroying their &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Rack%20%28Thaldraszus%29\"&gt;Weapon Racks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rebels at the &lt;a href=\"Rebellious%20Cliffs\"&gt;Rebellious Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; raided a &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Medical%20Supplies%20%28Thaldraszus%29\"&gt;medical supplies&lt;/a&gt; and took them back to their encampment. Drine sent adventurers to reclaim the supplies.\nThe fighting against the rebels was successful, but it wasn't enough to stop them. Erima infiltrated the camp at Scalewatch Cavern and learned of their new plan. In the meantime, Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; wanted to find a different way than combat to end the rebellion and asked Maldra for help. Maldra explained their reasoning. Soon, Erima quickly arrived and informed them that the rebels were stockpiling explosives beneath the city to collapse the aqueduct from &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;. Erima, Maldra, and the adventurer grouped together again and went to the heavily guarded cavern. They knew they had to fight their way through, but they also wanted to take prisoners. Maldra once again used Orian's magical knowledge and created a &lt;a href=\"Maldra%27s%20Ring%20of%20Elemental%20Binding\"&gt;ring of elemental binding&lt;/a&gt; to be used on defeated rebels. The rebels also had several pieces of propaganda. Erima had the adventurer gather it, and the investigator learned that it was written by Belaphon. To halt the detonation, Erima asked the adventurer to kill the architect of a plot to destroy the Valdrakken aqueduct, &lt;a href=\"Agitator%20Zoralek\"&gt;Agitator Zoralek&lt;/a&gt;, and recover &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Detonator\"&gt;his detonator&lt;/a&gt;. With that done, the aqueduct was secured.\nThe rebel prisoners were sent to &lt;a href=\"Steelcliff%20Rampart\"&gt;Steelcliff Rampart&lt;/a&gt;, where Alexstrasza also arrived to speak with them, but they were refusing to talk to her. Wanting this rebellion to be brought to an end with as little violence as possible, Alexstrasza asked the adventurer to speak with the prisoners in her stead. Alexstrasza listened, understood their reasonings, and even realized things she didn't consider. With new knowledge and understanding, she also wanted to hear the adventurer's opinion on the dragonkin problem. In the meantime, Maldra was further examining the propaganda from Scalewatch Cavern and found a secret code about Belaphon's location at the Rebellious Cliffs. Alexstrasza hoped that the rebels there wouldn't need to be defeated.\nThis time, Erima, Maldra, and the adventurer arrived at the camp peacefully, &lt;a href=\"Notes%20on%20Dragonkin%20Equality\"&gt;spreading the word of planned changes for the dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing the news, many stopped fighting, but some continued. To stop the quills from inciting the rebels, Maldra had the adventurer gather Belaphon's &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Quill%20%28Thaldraszus%29\"&gt;quills&lt;/a&gt;. The final task was to deal with Belaphon - Maldra gave the elemental binding ring to the adventurer, and they used it to make Belaphon surrender and brought her to Alexstrasza to discuss ending the rebellion. Alexstrasza admitted to poor treatment of the dragonkin and presented a way for rights and respect that were fair to dragonkin. Still, many dragonkin died due to the instigation, and Belaphon rebellion and needed to pay for her crimes. But instead of pronouncing a sentence, Alexstrasza gave her the option to use her skills with quills to inform the dragonkin of Alexstrasza's new rules of equality and freedom for the dragonkin going forward, which Belaphon agreed to do.\nMaldra regretted her time in the rebellion, but she was glad the dragonkin got greater respect and that it brought peace to Valdrakken. Belaphon admitted that the rebellion was always about treating dragonkin right and fairly, and that she was never against the Aspects themselves.\nAlexstrasza offered Maldra to join in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; alongside the dragons. Maldra declined and before could accept that, she first wanted to see if the dragons would truly abide the equal relationship suggested by Alexstrasza. The Dragon Queen accepted, as Maldra's choice was completely free to make."}

Flightstones come from looting outdoor treasures, world quests, weekly events, dungeons, and raids.\nPvP gear and crafted gear cannot be upgraded using Flightstones. PvP gear still uses &lt;a href=\"Honor\"&gt;Honor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conquest\"&gt;Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, and crafted gear uses recrafting.\nCollect 2,000 to earn the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20Can%27t%20Fly%21\"&gt;Stones Can't Fly!&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nPlayers can also use Flightstones to buy &lt;a href=\"Mythic\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; dugneon-level (Adventurer 4, ilvl 398) gear from &lt;a href=\"Spinsoa\"&gt;Spinsoa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear sources.\nThere are six gear upgrade tracks in Season 2:\nVeteran-track gear can also rarely come from open-world content: typically &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;Fyrakk Assaults&lt;/a&gt; and weekly wrapper quests (like and &lt;a href=\"Fighting%20is%20Its%20Own%20Reward\"&gt;Fighting is Its Own Reward&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Elders\"&gt;Zaqali Elders&lt;/a&gt; world boss will drop gear on the Champion track. The end-of-run chest in Mythic+ will drop gear at the specified track. Completing Mythic+ keys will also add loot to the weekly &lt;a href=\"Great%20Vault\"&gt;Great Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Complete enough keys of the specified level to be able to select loot on that upgrade track.\nItem levels and upgrade costs.\nUpgradeable gear will only ever be created in the rank 1-4 band of an upgrade track. So, an item level 398 piece that drops will always be Adventurer 4/8, never Explorer 8/8.\nFlightstones have no weekly cap, so they can be ground out indefinitely up to the overall holding cap.\nTo upgrade to the listed item level from one row above, the Flightstone and Shadowflame Crest cost in the higher item level row must be paid. For example, to upgrade from Champion 1 (415) to Champion 2 (418), the cost is 145 Flightstones and 1x &lt;a href=\"Drake%27s%20Shadowflame%20Crest\"&gt;Drake's Shadowflame Crest&lt;/a&gt;. Upgrades are cumulative, so to upgrade from Champion 1 to Champion 8 would cost 1,115 Flightstones, 3x &lt;a href=\"Drake%27s%20Shadowflame%20Crest\"&gt;Drake's Shadowflame Crest&lt;/a&gt;, and 4x &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%27s%20Shadowflame%20Crest\"&gt;Wyrm's Shadowflame Crest&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould players attempt to upgrade a lower item level piece in a slot that they already have a higher item level in, no Shadowflame Crests will be required. For example, players who have looted or upgraded to an item level 437 helm will see helms of all lower item levels cost no crests and 50% of the Flightstones. The Flightstone discount (but not the Crest discount) is account-wide. For rings, trinkets, and one-handed weapons, since two of each can be equipped, the \"lower\" item level piece determines the discount limit.\nShadowflame Crests.\nThere are four versions of Shadowflame Crests and crest fragments with various sources:\nThese sources are not chance-based. That is \u2014 if players complete a task they \"will\" receive the crest fragments deterministically.\nPlayers can acquire 10 of each crest (actually the equivalent in crest fragments) each week at the start of Season 2. That cap increases week-by-week, so by week six, the cap is at sixteen, which is effectively unlimited, as there are fifteen or sixteen slots of items that are relevant for upgrades. Quest-rewarded crests are both exempt from the cap and will not affect the cap.\nEnchanters can use crests to craft an Enchanted Shadowflame Crest, which is used to set the item level range of crafted gear. Said crafted gear will then be upgraded using Recrafting, not Flightstones. For crafting purposes, crests can also be \"downgraded\" by speaking with &lt;a href=\"Vaskarn\"&gt;Vaskarn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt; cavern and trading them in."}

He was the master of the more amicable &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, but was cruel and bloodthirsty, believing that a god should rule, not beg for servants or worshipers. He was ultimately defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; and Bwonsamdi, who became his master.\nBiography.\nAncient times.\nLong ago, Mueh'zala was the sole loa of death. One day he elevated his follower &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; into a loa as well. Eventually, Mueh'zala's followers turned against him, fearful of the sacrifices and blood he demanded, and over time he was forgotten by most, while Bwonsamdi became the primary loa of death.\nAt some point in the distant past, the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;titanic keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; contacted Mueh'zala and sacrificed his eye to him in order to be able to peer into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. This led to Odyn creating the winged beings known as &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. Mueh'zala delivered Odyn's eye to his master, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, who transformed it into &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; to serve his own ends.\nAt some point, Mueh'zala also convinced &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to join the Jailer.\nTraveler.\nMueh'zala was summoned by the Sandfury tribe at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; so they could sacrifice their prisoners - &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; - to him. When Mueh'zala went after Murky as a \"little snack\", Aram stepped between the two of them and Mueh'zala stopped, shocking everyone including the Sandfury trolls. But Aram was told that it was not \"the day\", and that Mueh'zala would not engage him there and then. But the day would come, and if Aram were to lose that battle, Mueh'zala would feast on all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Mueh'zala sank into the sands of Zul'Farrak and vanished.\nMueh'zala later appeared to Aram in a vision alongside &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; who led the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;. In the dream, Mueh'zala and Xaraax taunted Aram, telling him they had no objection if Aram completed the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; whose shards he had been gathering. Together, Mueh'zala and the dreadlord said that there would be a reckoning, the battle would come, the fire would burn, and Mueh'zala would feast on all of Azeroth.\nLegion.\nMueh'zala whispered to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; on his deathbed and told him to make &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He also planned to throw Vol'jin's spirit into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; but his soul had too strong a connection to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"spriggan\"&gt;spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"boggart\"&gt;boggart&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; serve Mueh'zala. They have heard Mueh'zala's whispers and gleefully carry out his plans. By his command, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dambala\"&gt;Dambala&lt;/a&gt; were resurrected by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rakazodu\"&gt;High Priest Rakazodu&lt;/a&gt; to serve in his army. His forces are also seen channeling &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; runes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; seems familiar with him. &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to discover why the loa were missing, was surprised by his boss's actions and declared that Mueh'zala had gone too far.\nAfter his followers stole &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;, he offered her the chance to join him. However, in contrast to Dambala and Hakkar, Ashamane rejected his offer. In response to this rejection, Mueh'zala threw Ashamane into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nMueh'zala held nothing but disdain for Bwonsamdi, when the latter turned to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; for help. Mueh'zala then declared that Bwonsamdi's time was done, his power spent, and he was coming to collect. Mueh'zala's forces then clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, where during the conflict the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; killed Dambala, and Hakkar left the battlefield planning on becoming the loa of Blood and Death.\nWith the plans he laid in ancient times coming to fruition, Mueh'zala turned all attention towards his rebellious replacement, Bwonsamdi. As they clashed within &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;De Other Side&lt;/a&gt;, he demanded the souls of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; who died during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, whom Bwonsamdi was keeping away from him. Meanwhile, Bwonsamdi sent a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to gather &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; from old business partners to boost his power, where Hakkar was slain, indirectly aiding Mueh'zala in dealing with that treachery. Ultimately Mueh'zala was beaten, and then Bwonsamdi bound his soul, while declaring himself the boss now.\nSometime later, Mueh'zala let slip that he had stolen from the Winter Queen. Bwonsamdi brought Mueh'zala to his &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his arrival, his loyalists led by &lt;a href=\"Zel%27han%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Zel'han the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; attempted to free him but were slain by the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Zel%27han%27s%20Broken%20Armor\"&gt;Zel'han's Broken Armor&lt;/a&gt; was brought to him in order to break his hopes, Mueh'zala claimed his plan was older than them, and that slaying Zel'han meant nothing to him. However even as he said this, his gaze remained fixed upon the broken armor.\nMueh'zala was soon fed a bit of the life essence from all within the Necropolis as part of the ritual to compel him to reveal what information he had. Mueh'zala subsequently revealed how he had once offered an Ancient to join him, before casting them into the Maw after being rejected. Upon hearing his voice, Vol'jin realized Mueh'zala was responsible for him naming &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, causing Mueh'zala to mock him. Mueh'zala was then sent back to De Other Side by Bwonsamdi, where he remains imprisoned.\nAppearance.\nThough his shadow towers above everyone, Mueh'zala's figure is indistinct. His form is always shifting, his shadow melting from one shape to another. Shapes he has taken include a twelve-foot tall &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, a giant lizard, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, a creature of burning black flame, a floating &lt;a href=\"whale%20shark\"&gt;whale shark&lt;/a&gt; and a red-rimmed specter of black. When making his ancient pact with &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, Mueh'zala appeared as a great shapeless &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt; or spirit who billowed up from the mists to surround Odyn in shadow. In the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, he takes the form of a giant, hulking, troll-like figure with a muscular torso, multiple sets of tusks, a mane of white hair, and blueish-gray skin.\nSpeculation.\nAs the one who told Vol'jin to make Sylvanas warchief, Mueh'zala may also have been the one who robbed Vol'jin of his powers on the Broken Shore."}

The clan apparently split into two, one group remained in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of Mug'thol while the other group traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nMug'thol led his group of ogres in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and was preparing them for battle in the hills, however, he found himself caught in the middle of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Lady\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas needing to bolster her forces, she raided one of Mug'thol's camp and discovered the clan. She then attacked Mug'thol's encampment and tried to possess him; Mug'thol warned her that she would fall, but Sylvanas had one of her &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; sisters to possess the ogre, who then declared that his allegiance was now to the \"pretty ghost\".\nThe Crown of Will.\nLater, Mug'thol and his ogre warband were sent to &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Will\"&gt;Crown of Will&lt;/a&gt; for Lady Sylvanas. Unfortunately, instead of returning it, he decided to try it on. The Crown of Will enabled him to free himself from the banshee's possession and he defected, establishing himself and his band of ogres in the ruins of Alterac as the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; ogres. Mug'thol leads his band from the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;old palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nMug'thol has three loyal lieutenants--&lt;a href=\"Muckrake\"&gt;Muckrake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Targ\"&gt;Targ&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Glommus\"&gt;Glommus&lt;/a&gt;--as well as a talented &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Grel%27borg%20the%20Miser\"&gt;Grel'borg the Miser&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe adventurers of the Horde attacked him in order to get the Crown.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it has been mentioned that Mug'thol still commands &lt;a href=\"Or%27Kalar\"&gt;Or'Kalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that he is still alive.\nIn the RPG.\nMug'thol was an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; who fought during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; in the orcish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He is a &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ogre\u2019s hulking frame is covered in a mish-mash of scavenged bits of metal and trophies of war, held together by thick bands of sweat-drenched leather hide. He holds a massive tree branch in one hand, leaning it effortlessly against his shoulder. A &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Will\"&gt;gemstone covered crown&lt;/a&gt; sits awkwardly on his head, leaning slightly off to one side as if it doesn\u2019t fit very well. Mug\u2019thol likes to smash things. Although he has a certain amount of savvy when intimidating other creatures to do his bidding, he knows only one way to fight. He always uses full power attacks in combat, not realizing the disadvantage of doing so. He likes the sound that his club makes when striking metal, and he prioritizes his targets by how amusing he thinks they will be to hit. He typically prefers to strike at enemies with metal shields first, followed by those in suits of metal armor, and lastly those with metal weapons."}

This type of character rarely gets played other than as a gopher between the character needing storage space and the merchants, supplies, and/or product(s), as in the case of a &lt;a href=\"Professions\"&gt;crafter&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Other items typically stored on a mule are &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; tokens, &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;, and any other non-&lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt; items of interest (e.g., ). Before &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, most &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt;s were mules.\nA mule is often positioned next to the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; so its &lt;a href=\"main\"&gt;main&lt;/a&gt; can mail auctionable items to it. The mule runs between the mailbox and auction house selling goods and funneling the money back to the main. \nWhile mules are usually not developed into viable trade skill &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; was at one point useful for the conversion of unsalable items into raw materials. However, with the &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0\"&gt;patch 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, there is now a minimum skill requirement for disenchanting items, making it much less useful to a low-level mule. Higher level mules with trained enchanting skill (e.g., characters no longer actively played, but still used for storage / disenchanting) are of course still viable, but likely to be far less common than the pre-2.0 level 5 disenchant mule.\nWith the addition of &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, some players have formed single-member guilds on their mules to gain access to more (and in some cases cheaper) storage."}

Mulgore is nestled in the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and protected by a natural wall of mountains on all sides. The only pass through these mountains is currently closed off by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;, which leads into the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to the east. \nMulgore provides bounty for the hunt, as a diversity of wild beasts roam the rolling plains and climb the foothills of the surrounding range. In the northern section of Mulgore, the new &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Sungraze\"&gt;Camp Sungraze&lt;/a&gt; sits in the shadows of the mesas of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, a tauren city which towers above the plains. &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt; is centrally located and surrounded by the clear waters of &lt;a href=\"Stonebull%20Lake\"&gt;Stonebull Lake&lt;/a&gt;, while further south on &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt; stands as the principal training camp for all young tauren.\nDespite the serene landscape and the pine-scented breeze, Mulgore is fraught with trouble. &lt;a href=\"Brambleblade%20Ravine\"&gt;Brambleblade Ravine&lt;/a&gt; and the sacred &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt; are overrun by &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s, and they continue to spread into the rest of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-run &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; infests the &lt;a href=\"The%20Venture%20Co.%20Mine\"&gt;Venture Co. Mine&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern mountain face, while the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; try to take vengeance against the other tauren by poisoning their water wells. The &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Harpies\"&gt;Windfury&lt;/a&gt; harpy tribe lay claim to the extreme northern reaches of Mulgore and the southeast mountain face. A tribe of &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Palemane%20Gnolls\"&gt;Palemane&lt;/a&gt; make their home at the cave called &lt;a href=\"Palemane%20Rock\"&gt;Palemane Rock&lt;/a&gt;, as well in scattered camps along the southern mountains.\nHistory.\nMulgore is referred to as the ancestral home of the tauren. It is also hinted that the tauren lived here centuries after the Sundering. It's probably the same area as mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Hatred%20of%20the%20Centaur\"&gt;Hatred of the Centaur&lt;/a&gt; mythology.\nThe effects of &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s spell that summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; were sensed even in Mulgore.\nThe Third War and after.\nOnce nomadic, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s when they landed on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Looking to the orcs for protection, they saw kindred spirits with honor and power. With Thrall's escort, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; led his people to Mulgore and came upon what is now called &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. They constructed their capital upon the lofty mesas, and the city is now a center for trade and commerce. Ruling over the tauren in his old age, Cairne looked one day to hand the mantle of leadership down to his son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions were tasked by &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt; with driving the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; away from the tauren's &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; herds, for the foul creatures were slaughtering them and leaving their bodies to rot. Mulgore was also home to a large group of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Khiragg\"&gt;Khiragg&lt;/a&gt;, who had captured Baine and thrown Cairne into despair. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar rescued Baine and brought the tauren back into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' help, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof tribe&lt;/a&gt; were able to drive back the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and claim the grasslands of Mulgore for their own. For the first time in hundreds of years, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; had a land to call their own. Upon the windswept mesa of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne built a refuge for his people, where tauren of every tribe is welcome. Over time, the scattered tauren tribes united under Cairne's rule. There are a few tribes who disagree about the direction their new nation should take, but all agree that Cairne is the wisest and best suited to lead them towards the future.\nThough the noble tauren are peaceful in nature, the rites of the Great Hunt are venerated as the heart of their spiritual culture. Every tauren, warrior or otherwise, seeks identity both as a hunter and as a child of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Tauren who reach the age of maturity, must test their skills in the wilds of Mulgore and prove themselves in the Great Hunt.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; has invaded the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.%20Mine\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; and taken over the &lt;a href=\"Thunderhorn%20Water%20Well\"&gt;Thunderhorn Water Well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildmane%20Water%20Well\"&gt;Wildmane Water Well&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Winterhoof%20Water%20Well\"&gt;Winterhoof Water Well&lt;/a&gt;. For unknown reasons what appeared to be a small scouting force of &lt;a href=\"Galak%20tribe\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; could be found roaming the plains of Mulgore. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt; in order to excavate the area.\nHowever this incursion was against the wishes of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, who saw it as an affront to the Earth Mother, and as diplomatic solutions failed, the Bloodhoof Tauren resolved to drive the invaders out by taking and breaking their pickaxes. At the same time the tauren directed Horde agents to clash with the &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s that reside within the region. During this time Horde agents were able to drive the Venture Company away from the wells, thereby restoring it to tauren control.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Mulgore was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall stepped down as Warchief of the Horde. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who was believed to have ordered the killing of innocent druids (although this was a miscommunication; the act was actually done by orcs loyal to the nihilistic group of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;). Cairne, infuriated by the killings, challenged Garrosh for the leadership of the Horde. Garrosh accepted, and due to the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, won and killed Cairne. With Cairne's death, Magatha had Bloodhoof Village infiltrated and took Thunder Bluff for the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;a rebel to the Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren of the Horde retook the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; now leads the tauren from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rise\"&gt;High Rise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, in his father's former place.\nAs Our Fathers Before Us.\nWith the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; demanded to use Mulgore's waters.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren have erected the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; to block the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from further advancing. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Cataclysm, the dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt; were slaughtered by agitated Earth Spirits, proving Baine's warning correct. At the direction of &lt;a href=\"Ahmo%20Thunderhorn\"&gt;Ahmo Thunderhorn&lt;/a&gt; the Horde agents are sent to calm them with a magic drum.\nThe recent Cataclysm has also seen great changes to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, which has suffered greatly after becoming under siege by the Bristleback quilboar who have spread out from the &lt;a href=\"Brambleblade%20Ravine\"&gt;Brambleblade Ravine&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time Grimtotem rebels, refusing to swear allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, have invaded the region by taking control of and poisoning the wells. In response to this, young tauren are requested to aid in beating back the Bristlback, while the tauren accept aid from all members of the Horde in dealing with the Grimtotem and other threats in the region.\nWith everything that the Cataclysm caused, the tauren rebuilt the capital and fought back the quilboar who encroached on their territory.\nBattle of Azeroth.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, a group from the Venture Company stole from &lt;a href=\"Sheza%20Wildmane\"&gt;Sheza Wildmane&lt;/a&gt; and made a camp in the bluffs east of Thunder Bluff.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; reported that the tauren in Mulgore still face a lot of problems in the region - the Venture Company in the east, the gnoll threats to the west, and remnants of the Grimtotem tribe who strike at the tauren, going after Thunder Bluff's water.\nGeography.\nMulgore is a sheltered and pastoral valley dotted with mesas and surrounded by mountains on all sides, and accessible only through a pass to the southeast. Resembling a huge pasture, the area is covered with verdant green grass and few trees. An oddity of the landscape, the tall cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; tower over the fields in the center of the zone.\nMulgore is framed by &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20totem%23Structure\"&gt;big tauren totems&lt;/a&gt; and windmills.\nMulgore contains no dungeons of any type and no battlegrounds.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamona.de/worldmap2/map_mulgore.html\"&gt;Detailed pre-Cataclysm area map (lists all creatures)&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D28\"&gt;Topographic map of pre-Cataclysm Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nMulgore is home to several tauren of status. From the base camp in Camp Narache, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Hawkwind\"&gt;Chief Hawkwind&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young tauren out into the world. In Bloodhoof Village, &lt;a href=\"Mull%20Thunderhorn\"&gt;Mull Thunderhorn&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to cleanse the Mulgore water wells, and from his post on the road east of the village, &lt;a href=\"Morin%20Cloudstalker\"&gt;Morin Cloudstalker&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the foothold the Venture Company has established in the land. &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, son of the great Cairne, leads the tauren from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nAs the starting zone for the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore%20storyline\"&gt;Mulgore quests&lt;/a&gt; range from level 1-10 in difficulty. Quests here often deal with driving out invasive creatures and protecting the land. Particularly important to young tauren are the Rites of the Earthmother quests, in which they learn the ways of the land.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", Mulgore was a secondary map of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hatreds%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;Old Hatreds&lt;/a&gt; mission of the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign. The area was more arid than in \"World of Warcraft\", and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; already appeared, thought it was at the same level as the rest of the map, only separated of it by bridges. However, it may have been intended to be a different settlement as the map showed Thunder Bluff being in western Mulgore, while Rexxar visited a settlement on the eastern Mulgore border. The settlement was also home to a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Bazaar\"&gt;Goblin Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spirit walker&lt;/a&gt; peers were considered as &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20Outcasts\"&gt;outcasts&lt;/a&gt; and lived in a village north of the settlement with its own &lt;a href=\"mana%20fountain\"&gt;mana fountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nMulgore was home to a &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; group led by the &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20Destroyer\"&gt;Razormane Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; coven that attacked the native &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; beasts and a &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; army led by the &lt;a href=\"War%20Khan\"&gt;War Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThis rich plain was once used by the night elves as prime hunting grounds. When the Great Sundering shattered the world, mountains pierced the earth and the night elves fled north. The mighty &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; made their home upon the low valleys and high plateaus after the night elves left. In time, the ash of upheaval disappeared and the once fertile grasslands returned. The aggressive centaur claim the right to the grasslands and have warred constantly against the tauren for supremacy of the land, but the tauren's mesa strongholds have so far proved impregnable. Mulgore is a landlocked region, with Desolace to the west, the Barrens to the east, the Stonetalon Mountains to the north, and the Thousand Needles to the south. Mulgore is the ancient homeland of the tauren, who live on the windswept mesas and roam the grassy valleys. Below the mesa's ridgeline are the vast emerald plains, which hold an abundance of life including prairie wolves, young kodo beasts, and tallstriders.\nThe centaur forces mercilessly hound the tauren throughout Mulgore. The tepee-like tents and crude hide huts that comprise tauren towns stand in stark contrast to the turning windmills and pulley structures that keep the tauren gristmills operating. Large, ornately carved totems dot every street and stand above every major structure.\nToward the eastern border, quilboar displaced from Durotar have started creating dens with thorned hedgerow barriers. For now, it is a small concern for the tauren, but if the bristly \"boar men\" encroach too far, there will be a price to pay. At present, the tauren are far more interested in what the centaur are up to. Mulgore is filled with a variety of antelopes, rabbits, and wild boar, making it the ideal place for game hunting.

Their ancestral homeland is nestled in the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and protected by a natural wall of mountains on all sides. The only pass through these mountains leads into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nA land of windswept mesas and grassy plains, Mulgore is the tauren's ancestral homeland. Centaur often send raiding parties into Mulgore, and the tauren, now with the help of their Horde allies, beat them back. Tauren are naturally a nomadic people, and their tent cities are scattered across the landscape and change with the seasons and the weather. Now that they are members\nof the Horde, the tauren have constructed several permanent settlements, including their capital of Thunder Bluff.\nMulgore provides bounty for the hunt, as a diversity of wild beasts roam the rolling plains and climb the foothills of the surrounding range. In the northern section of Mulgore, the mesas of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; tower above the plains, casting long shadows. &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt; is centrally located surrounded by the clear waters of &lt;a href=\"Stonebull%20Lake\"&gt;Stonebull Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and further south on the protected cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt; stands as the principal training camp for all young tauren.\nDespite the serene landscape and the pine-scented breeze, Mulgore is fraught with trouble. &lt;a href=\"Brambleblade%20Ravine\"&gt;Brambleblade Ravine&lt;/a&gt; and the sacred &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt; are overrun by &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-run &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; infests the three sacred water wells of Mulgore as well as their &lt;a href=\"The%20Venture%20Co.%20Mine\"&gt;Venture Co. Mine&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern mountain face. The &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Harpies\"&gt;Windfury&lt;/a&gt; harpy tribe lay claim to the extreme northern reaches of Mulgore and the southeast mountain face. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; makes its presence known at the &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; scour the mountains for traces of their shrouded ancestry, and a tribe of &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Palemane%20Gnolls\"&gt;Palemane&lt;/a&gt; make their home at the cave called &lt;a href=\"Palemane%20Rock\"&gt;Palemane Rock&lt;/a&gt; as well as scattered camps along the southern mountains.\nHistory.\nThis rich plain was once used by the night elves as prime hunting grounds. When the Great Sundering shattered the world, mountains pierced the earth and the night elves fled north. The mighty &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; made their home upon the low valleys and high plateaus after the night elves left. In time, the ash of upheaval disappeared and the once fertile grasslands returned. The aggressive centaur claim the right to the grasslands and have warred constantly against the tauren for supremacy of the land, but the tauren's mesa strongholds have so far proved impregnable. Mulgore is a landlocked region, with Desolace to the west, the Barrens to the east, the Stonetalon Mountains to the north, and the Thousand Needles to the south. Mulgore is the ancient homeland of the tauren, who live on the windswept mesas and roam the grassy valleys. Below the mesa's ridgeline are the vast emerald plains, which hold an abundance of life including prairie wolves, young kodo beasts, and tallstriders.\nThe centaur horde mercilessly hounds the tauren throughout Mulgore. The tepee-like tents and crude hide huts that comprise tauren towns stand in stark contrast to the turning windmills and pulley structures that keep the tauren grainmills operating. Large, ornately carved totems dot every street and stand above every major structure.\nToward the eastern border, quilboar displaced from Durotar have started creating dens with thorned hedgerow barriers. For now, it is a small concern for the tauren, but if the bristly \"boar men\" encroach too far, there will be a price to pay. At present, the tauren are far more interested in what the centaur are up to. Mulgore is filled with a variety of antelopes, rabbits, and wild boar, making it the ideal place for game hunting. A tauren pastime involves hunting these animals to improve one's combat skills. The tauren rarely eat their prey, preferring to graze on wheat and grass that grow wild in the valley.\nOnce nomadic, the tauren met with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s when they landed on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Looking to the orcs for protection, they saw kindred spirits with honor and power. When &lt;a href=\"Cairne\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; led his people to Mulgore, they came upon what is now called Thunder Bluff. They constructed their capital upon the lofty mesas, and the city is now a center for trade and commerce. Ruling over the tauren in his old age, Cairne looks one day to hand the mantle of leadership down to his son &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nMulgore has temperate rugged hills, plains (grassland), some rugged mountains.\nMulgore is a sheltered and pastoral valley surrounded by mountains on all sides, and accessible only through a pass to the southeast. Resembling a huge pasture, the area is covered with verdant green grass and few trees. An oddity of the landscape, the tall cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; tower over the fields in the center of the zone.\nIt is possible for non-&lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to explore &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cloud%20Mesa\"&gt;Red Cloud Mesa&lt;/a&gt; without actually running all the way up. By hugging the cliff below, the area will appear on the map.\nMulgore contains no dungeons of any type and no battlegrounds. &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde aligned capital city for &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, is the only travel hub.\nTravel hubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; is the only travel hub in this zone, and is Horde aligned\nNotable characters.\nMulgore is home to several tauren of status. From the base camp in Camp Narache, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Hawkwind\"&gt;Chief Hawkwind&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young tauren out into the world. In Bloodhoof Village, &lt;a href=\"Mull%20Thunderhorn\"&gt;Mull Thunderhorn&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to cleanse the Mulgore water wells, and from his post on the road east of the village, &lt;a href=\"Morin%20Cloudstalker\"&gt;Morin Cloudstalker&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the foothold the Venture Company has established in the land. &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, son of the great Cairne, has been chosen to chief the village named by his bloodline.\nQuests.\nSince it is the starting zone for the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore%20quests\"&gt;Mulgore quests&lt;/a&gt; range from level 1-10 in difficulty. Quests here often deal with driving out invasive creatures and protecting the land. Particularly important to young tauren is the &lt;a href=\"Rites%20of%20the%20Earthmother/Chain\"&gt;Rites of the Earthmother quest chain&lt;/a&gt;, in which they learn the ways of the land."}

When he awoke, his colleagues of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Zur%27ak%20Firefist\"&gt;Zur'ak Firefist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krelna\"&gt;Krelna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lenka\"&gt;Lenka&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were discussing concerns relating to the reliability of the elements. His apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Kettara%20Bloodthirst\"&gt;Kettara Bloodthirst&lt;/a&gt;, asked him about the attributes of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt; as she was eager to learn about the spirit. He explained to her that she is not ready as only a few shaman were able to connect with the spirit. When Drek'Thar arrived, Muln was about to initiate the meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; but Drek'Thar was senile and could not stop speaking about a foreboding shadow. After Drek'Thar's companion, &lt;a href=\"Palkar\"&gt;Palkar&lt;/a&gt;, took him away to pacify his hysteria, a fire has attacked Camp Narache. The Earthen Ring raced to the camp and with their elemental powers, were able to evacuate the civilians. Yet the threat of the fire was compounded by the threat of a &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; attack. Though the Earthen Ring tried to fend them off, the elementals refused to give them aid, and so they were forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the group of shaman reached safety, they talked about how the elements have been failing them lately. A runner interrupted their discussion and told them that a newcomer drove off the centaur and put out the fire in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt;. Muln and the others went to meet the stranger only to discover that it's &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt;. Muln recognized him from the stories his ancestors told him but was told that Shotoa fell to his death trying to save his apprentice two hundred and fifty years ago. Shotoa informed him that he survived by being transformed and preserved by the elements and that he's come to help by teaching them a new form of shamanism that doesn\u2019t require them asking from the elements but rather to command them. Muln and a few others were wary of this new method of commanding the elements and believed that it was safer to follow their traditions. \nShotoa demonstrated the superiority of his method by guiding them to a giant twister rampaging through Mulgore. Shotoa asked them to stop or contain the cyclone. The Earthen Ring shaman can't even get their elementals to try aside from Muln and his apprentice Kettara Bloodthirst, though the elementals they summon fail at their task. Shotoa then demonstrated his power by dispersing the cyclone with his own elemental powers, though such a display of power appeared to have caused him some pain as he later collapses and mutters about the \"fire\" biting at him. \nThe Earthen Ring seemed to split between Muln and Shotoa supporters. Kettara talked to Muln about Shotoa's methods and tried to convince him to have an open mind about change. Muln however, continued to believe in the old ways and rejected Shotoa's methods, no matter how much more appealing his methods look. Muln used the orcs abandoning their shamanistic ways for warlock magic as an example of change leading her people to ruin. Yet Ketarra counters that the orcs arrival to Kalimdor was an example of positive change as the orcs were able to save the tauren from the centaur. They both recalled when Muln first met her 5 years ago; a day when he heard her name from a wind and asked her to join the Ring. Ever since then they forged an amazing friendship and fought off some &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; tauren harassing orc settlers. Kettara told Muln that there are times to resist change and there are times to accept it but change eventually comes naturally.\nKettara decided to follow Shotoa and Muln decides not to stop her, though he talked to Krelna, the only elder who remained with him, to have her send runners to other shaman so they can discuss what direction to lead the Earthen Ring. He then traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to seek Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s council on the matter. Thrall was unsure on the matter of Shotoa. He told Muln that change is a natural part of life but it's only good if it's right for their people. He advised Muln to follow the guidance of the spirits. Muln then relayed his fears with Drek'Thar about Thrall's indecisive stance. Drek'Thar told him that it's his fault as his advice to Thrall has been useless lately. Drek'Thar told Muln that lately he's been seeing two futures and his visions have been less reliable for Thrall. Drek'Thar told Muln that a time will come when the Earthen Ring will become Azeroth's salvation or lead it to ruin. Drek'Thar suddenly becomes frantic and warns Muln about the \u201cfire that consumes all\u201d.\nMuln went back to Mulgore where he found out from Krelna that Shotoa had led a lot of the shaman away to teach them his militant path of shamanism. Muln asked the Spirit of the Wilds for guidance and he received a vision of the cavern Shotoa fell into, where he learned that Shotoa wasn't preserved by the life force of Azeroth but by the energies of Ragnaros' release. Shotoa is in reality, a fire elemental wearing his shape. \nMuln gathered the rest of the shaman and followed Shotoa and his group to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. It is later revealed that Shotoa led his followers to a Grimtotem ambush in the hope of weakening the Earthen Ring. Muln and his forces arrived but with the elements in disarray, they were at a disadvantage against the Grimtotem warriors and shaman whom were using Shotoa's more reliable shamanistic methods. \nShotoa commented that a shaman as powerful as Muln could usurp authority from the weaker Grimtotem shaman controlling the elementals and save Kettara, (who was held captive at the hands of a giant earth elemental) if he imposed his will on them. \nMuln tried asking but was unable to break the earth elementals' control, so he helped in the main fight, destroying a number of fire elementals to try and get to the shaman commanding the earth elemental. He was too slow and the Grimtotem orders the elemental to crush Kettara. Muln promptly caused Shotoa to burst into flames before using a cyclone to fly at Shotoa in a rage. \nMuln told Shotoa he knew his secret, prompting him to burst into flames as he battled Muln. Shotoa told Muln that his &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; has forces all over the world working to bring its end. Muln opened a chasm under Shotoa trying to trap him but he was unable to get it to reclose, so he asked air, water, and earth elementals to aid him. At first they refused to work together but Muln motivated them to work together by telling them that they\u2019d all be threatened with slavery under Shotoa and his fire elementals, which prompted them to work together.\nThe three elementals each counter part of Shotoa's powers allowing Muln to crush his head with his totem. The other shaman defeated the remaining Grimtotems with lightning but they find it's tragically too late to save Kettara's life with Muln's healing. She died in his arms.\nKettara, along other deceased shaman, were given a fully shamanistic burial ceremony, with Kettara being cremated along with other fallen shaman. Muln tells the other members of the Earthen Ring that they're going to use the old ways to continue guiding the elements even in dark times.\nCataclysm.\nMuln Earthfury made his in-game debut at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, helping &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; maintain the rift.\nHe appeared and died in a nightmare caused by &lt;a href=\"Iso%27rath\"&gt;Iso'rath&lt;/a&gt;, but this was just imagined by the adventurers.\nMuln was worried about Thrall at Maelstrom when the former Warchief could not focus on the shamanistic duty. When Thrall returned from his journey, Muln was happy to see Thrall more calmer now.\nThe shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, to lent aid to their &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; comrades. Muln was present to see Thrall and Aggra become life-mates. Later, Muln, Nobundo and Aggra were rescuing Thrall, when he was tormented by Deathwing.\nTides of War.\nAfter the death of Deathwing, he has stepped down as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, being replaced with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. He learned about the fate of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. He was worried what &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; would do to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. He was present when Thrall received a vision about the enslaving of water elements and thought that the shaman should go to help them. However, only Thrall went.\nLegion.\nMuln aids the Farseer in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; seeks to gain the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lords\"&gt;Elemental Lords&lt;/a&gt; as allies against the Legion, traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Muln and the Farseer discover a sect of Twilight cultists working with twilight dragons. Earthfury knew that the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were extincted near the end of the Cataclysm. But upon entering deeper into the cave, he and the Farseer couldn't believe that they live as a whole again because of the work of the &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Mistress of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; in disguise as a Twilight drake herself. Just as Muln feared, they reported this to the Stonemother. He then becomes one the Earthen Ring Champions upon return to the Heart of Azeroth.\nLegionfall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; came to the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to ask the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; for help, Muln expressed fury towards the Elder Crone for killing his &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Chieftain&lt;/a&gt;. While Muln initially demanded the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Farseer of the Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; to evict her from the Heart, &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; managed to convince him that she could do more damage out in the open as opposed to under the eye of the Earthen Ring. Begrudgingly accepting, Muln spit at Magatha's feet and left.\nIn the RPG.\nMuln Earthfury, a powerful tauren shaman dedicated to keep the elemental forces in check and thus ensure the safety of all the lands Azeroth and the people who live upon them, leads the Earthen Ring. Like many members of the group, Muln frequently roams the land in search of elementals to pacify and cultists to defeat. His current location is unknown, but as dedicated to the group's cause as he is, Muln is undoubtedly carrying out duties important to the Earthen Ring. His long-term goals are unknown."}

{"id": "102296", "revid": "612753", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=102296", "title": "Multiboxing", "text": "Multiboxing is a term used to denote one user playing multiple accounts simultaneously. This could be done using one or more machines. Some players ran multiple accounts to seek a greater challenge than playing only a single character. Others sought to recreate the feel of older single-player RPGs where a well designed team was used to adventure together. There were also some who didn't want to rely on others to play the game when additional characters were required.\nMultiboxing remains an allowed part of the game; however, on November 3, 2020, Blizzard restricted the use of input broadcasting software which could replicate interactions to multiple game clients simultaneously. In a May 5, 2021 policy update, Blizzard expanded the restriction to encompass \"the use of all software and hardware mechanisms to mirror commands to multiple World of Warcraft accounts at the same time, or to automate or streamline multi-boxing in any way.\"\nTo comply with the new rules, one must 'alt-tab' or otherwise interact with each game client using different key/mouse strokes.\nBackground of multiboxing.\nAs noted above in the term description, multiboxing is a game play style accepted by Blizzard. The multiboxing solutions documented here do not violate Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"EULA\"&gt;EULA&lt;/a&gt; for \"World of Warcraft\".\nIn order to multibox in \"World of Warcraft\", you will need to have all of the following criteria areas addressed:\nIn addition, you will need to learn many multiboxing strategies, including &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; writing skills, and may need to pay special attention to your in-game &lt;a href=\"UI\"&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt;.\nDifficulty.\nHow complex of a solution do you want? A software-only solution using one machine and multiple copies of the game is pretty straightforward. For many, the real complexity is in writing macros that allow each character to function properly in the group. Because characters are sharing hotkeys, a lot of care must be put into what effects each hotkey activates. The end result is that you can become very knowledgeable in using the game's macro language and available &lt;a href=\"addon\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe basics.\nThis section will cover the basics of multiboxing.\nGame software.\nYou will need to purchase the game, and depending on needs the expansion as well, for each account you wish to run simultaneously.\nA minimum of one installation of the game software must be present on each computer.\nA single installation directory can be used to open multiple instances of the game client. It is not necessary to have multiple WoW directories on a machine to run multiple WoW Windows.\nThe single directory installation option saves hard drive space and simplifies setup and maintenance of your user interface and add-ons.\nSome users prefer to maintain several copies of the game files on one computer. It is widely believed that multiple installations of the game client will improve performance, however, this is only partly true. Multiple installations will improve performance only if each installation is on a different physical drive.\nIf the multiple directory method of installation is chosen you will need to maintain add-ons and user interface changes for each installation separately.\nUsers of &lt;a href=\"Mac\"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; computers can symbolic link the Data directory to save space when running multiple copies on one machine.\nUsers of Windows XP or newer with NTFS can use Junction Links for the same effect. Windows Vista/7 can use the included MKLINK program to create a junction. Windows XP users have to resort to a third-party program (e.g. Junction Link Magic).\nSystem hardware.\nTo run two or more copies on the same machine, it is recommended that it contain a dual-core processor, discrete 3d graphics accelerator, and at least one gigabyte of memory. Additional copies on the same machine will require faster processors and more memory. When using multiple machines, try to keep all of them identical.\nAdditional hardware.\nKeyboard, Video, and Mouse, switches (KVMs for short) are an option when using multiple machines; however, multiplexers cannot broadcast the same keystroke to more than one client. Additional monitors are also an option, or laying out multiple clients in windowed mode. (It may be preferable to have smaller displays for secondary characters.)\nGame concerns.\nSome of the choices you make are strictly within the game. From server type, character types, to the races of the characters. \nPvE or PvP.\nPlayer versus Environment.\nPlayer versus Environment is the easy solution. Even if the eventual goal is to play on a Player versus Player server getting practice with multiboxing will be much easier on the PvE server. PvE is very forgiving. Events are scripted, generally start when you start them, and allow for as many tries as you want.\nPlayer versus Player.\nPlayer versus Player interactions will require a unique approach when multiboxing, very different than &lt;a href=\"PVE\"&gt;PVE&lt;/a&gt; gameplay. Because of this uniqueness, you may find yourself in a situation where your typical &lt;a href=\"macros\"&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; for Player versus Environment do not apply to &lt;a href=\"PVP\"&gt;PVP&lt;/a&gt; gameplay. You may find that it will require more advanced macros and more thought put into contingency plans.\nServer selection.\nScout out the server and see what kind of ratio it has. Is it an old server or a new one? Old servers tend to have established PvP and knowledgeable players. It can be harder to find groups, not an issue if you are five boxing, and they tend to have a more vibrant auction system and economy. A good method to find a new server to multibox on is to ask in various forums if there are any existing multiboxing &lt;a href=\"guilds\"&gt;guilds&lt;/a&gt; on the server. If so, ask in advance if you may join the guild before making that server your new home. If you are playing on NA servers, one of the largest multiboxing guilds in the entire game is on the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; server, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; side.\nClass selection.\nClass selection. This depends on both your playstyle and the type of server you play on. For the ability to heal and dish outburst damage choose a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. Other options are to replace the mages with &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, replace the priest with another healer class like a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;.\nA very popular one-class choice is to have multiple shamans. Due to the macros, one set of shamans in a battleground can simultaneously cast &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, which can effectively destroy even the hardiest of twinks.\nDue to game mechanics picking two classes is far easier to deal with than using three or more classes. Even if five different classes is more appropriate being able to direct it is another issue. It comes down to how consistent the actions between the classes are and how the hotkeys can best be shared between them. When you are beginning multiboxing it is recommended to limit the number of classes.\nRace selection.\nSome consideration of racial abilities for PvP is warranted. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; which breaks &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s which are very bad when grouped up. Another good racial abilities are the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warstomp\"&gt;Warstomp&lt;/a&gt;. Race selection also limits class selection so some choices will not be available regardless.\nNaming.\nBelieve it or not, the names you pick for your characters make a difference. By picking logical names you will be quicker to react and it will be easier to tell your characters apart. \nAn example, where you have four &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;. Choose a unique multi-letter name and then prefix it to identify which character is which. Naming the first four characters mynameA, mynameB, mynameC, and mynameD, makes it easy to remember they are the the mages, whereas naming the priest mynameX provides enough distinction to separate him out. Why the last letter? Simple in PvP your opponent could say /target A and get the first character whose name starts with an A! You could also name them for their role in the party. Recognition of which character is which will come over time, using a naming strategy speeds up the process.\nConversely, if PvP is your primary objective, you may wish to pick names that all sound alike so that opponents using voice communication (e.g. Ventrilo) cannot easily designate one of your targets. Changing letter combinations (e.g. Aellii, Aellei, Aellie, Aelli) or substituting certain vowels (e.g. Boylston, Boylstun, Boylsten) may cause a slight delay in one of your characters being focused-fired upon in an Arena.\nOther concerns.\nPlay area layout.\nOnce again, this small detail makes a difference. If you run 5 or 6 monitors, I strongly suggest some logical order to how your characters are arranged and which computer runs which character. Your \"main\" is generally in the middle and the secondaries flank your main to either side. My personal choice is A in the lower left, B upper left, C upper right and D lower right. Clockwise with X in the lower middle. The upper middle is for browsing the internet, looking up quests, vent, etc. My key arrangement mirrors this and the X-Keys Desktop and Pro are perfect for this kind of setup as they have 8 keys wide and 5 vertical. Making your physical interface as intuitive as possible will speed the learning process and make far more logical sense when playing.\nGetting started.\nIf you choose the hardware method the hard part is paying for it all. You will need four identical machines. Literally, identical machines, down to the revision numbers on the components. I build my own machines but buying them is certainly an option. This project, done at its most basic hardware level, will cost $4280, not counting tax and shipping. Done right, it will push $5k, plus monthly fees. Depending on your perspective, this may be a lot of money. Nobody ever said multiboxing at this level was cheap but I can certainly think of far more expensive hobbies.\nLeveling.\nPowerleveling does not really work in WoW, so leveling up is tricky if you already have a level-capped character and want to add more characters without spending hundreds of hours leveling. The best way to level is to level them all at the same time; if you registered all the accounts under the same name, you can do a paid transfer later to consolidate the characters onto one or two accounts. You can do so with questing alone, questing and instances, or just instances. Questing is a good bet as the experience is great, the mobs are easy, and you get faction reputation. Though kill quests generally give credit for every kill to every player, collection quests require collecting X items for \"each character\", so avoid these whenever possible.\nInstance grinding is an excellent alternative. Elites give great experience, and about the time you get tired of an instance, you level out of it. The only downside is the time wasted learning the instance and at the lower levels, learning just how to multibox. One solution to the issue of learning of the instance is to download a dungeon map addon, so that you may become familiar with the dungeon you will be constantly running.\nAnother option (though it hardly counts as multiboxing) is to have the leveling character simply Follow a high-level character as he/she solos an instance. The low-level character will die quickly if he/she draws aggro or gets caught in an AoE attack, so the player should park the low-level character in a corner during tricky fights and/or use a high-level character who can heal or resurrect the other.\nNote: Blizzard has specifically stated that multiboxing to take advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Recruit-A-Friend\"&gt;Recruit-A-Friend&lt;/a&gt; experience bonus, while not what they intended for the program, is within the Terms of Use.\nUI mods.\nUsually constrained to arranging the bars as you need them and letting you view the state of each of your characters. Pitbull and Bartender are two very good mods.\nButton mods.\nThere are button mods out there that allow you to physically represent the buttons you have on your X-keys on your UI. There are even some out there that will change the buttons when you hold down your alt modifier key.\nAnchor mods.\nYou will likely want to set it so that you cannot move the windows on your \"secondary\" machines. If you move one, they get desynched and clicking on them with your wireless mouse will not activate all of them. \nMacros.\n&lt;a href=\"Macro\"&gt;Macro&lt;/a&gt;s consolidate multiple instructions to a keybinding (within each client). For multiboxing, these might cleverly use &lt;a href=\"macro%20conditionals\"&gt;macro conditionals&lt;/a&gt; such as codice_1 or codice_2 to \"follow the leader\".\nOther strategies include:\nBeyond these, any of the time-saving &lt;a href=\"useful%20macros\"&gt;useful macros&lt;/a&gt; might help, including those pertinent to each class ability."}

Each hit could offer up to 100% + 30% + 30% = 160% total damage.\nIn PvP, character spells and abilities had one chance to deal an additional 30% damage. Each hit could offer up to 100% + 30% = 130% total damage. Multistrike was exactly half as valuable in PvP, point for point. \nFor example, a character might cast a &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; against its target, hitting for 1000 damage, and then score a multistrike, causing a second Frostbolt to hit the target (with no additional mana cost or casting time) for 300 damage. In other words, sometimes the ability would hit just once for normal damage; sometimes it would hit twice, with the second hit dealing 30% damage; and occasionally it would hit three times, with the second and third hits each dealing 30% damage. Multistrikes didn't \"Double dip\" into stats like &lt;a href=\"Versatility\"&gt;Versatility&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, so if a character had 10% Versatility and their &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; hit for 1100, the Multistrike would hit for 330 (as apposed to 363 if it gained the benefit twice).\nMultistrikes crit independently of the main attack. That is, the main attack did not have to crit in order for the multistrike to crit. As seen on the &lt;a href=\"attack%20table\"&gt;attack table&lt;/a&gt;, assuming the character currently had 20% crit chance and 10% multistrike chance, each multistrike roll would look like this:"}
