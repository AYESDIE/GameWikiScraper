The Shadow Council was formed by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s as a clandestine council of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of many wars, the Shadow Council has somehow continued and has expanded to include many races with cults of the Shadow Council existing in different parts of the world.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; supplanted &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; as spiritual leader of the nascent &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he began to reorganize the clans into a single engine of destruction in the name of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, he promoted a public figurehead, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; to the new position of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan also brought together a collection of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, chieftains, and even the occasional ogre into a clandestine council \u2014 the Shadow Council. Gul'dan stroked Blackhand's ego by telling him he would rule both the Horde and the Council, but actually intended to manipulate him and the whole orcish people through the Warchief instead.\nThe original purpose of the Council was to ensure the stability of the Horde in their quest to destroy the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, manipulate the clans, and spread the use of warlock magics. When the time came, the Shadow Council fed the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; to the clans, apart from the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; (whose chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, forbade them from partaking) and a few other individuals. Not all orc warlocks joined the Shadow Council, however. Some, such as &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; stayed loyal to their clans instead.\nThe Council made their headquarters at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and oversaw the destruction of the draenei until Kil'jaeden mysteriously vanished. As the Horde began to fragment, the Shadow Council was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who offered a new world to plunder.\nTo test the potential of the daggers &lt;a href=\"%3AAnguish\"&gt;:Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3ASorrow\"&gt;:Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan gave them to his &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; and ordered her to use them against an unfortunate Shadow Council acolyte. The acolyte had no chance to defend himself before she tore open his throat with one slash. When the orc took his last breath, the wound that killed him became irregular. Nobody would be able to tell whether he had died to a knife, an axe, or a spear. Gul'dan saw the possibilities immediately. A mysterious death could be used to sow confusion and redirect suspicion wherever he pleased.\nThe First War.\nThe Shadow Council operated a number of the Horde's workings during the war effort against the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Shadow Council moved into &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, they were confronted by the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; minions of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall used his fledgling connection to the Old Gods to convince the dwarves and Ragnaros's lieutenants, who also served the Old Gods, to let the Shadow Council stay in the upper reaches of the mountain, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. If the warlocks remained there, they would not be disturbed by Ragnaros or his followers. Gul'dan was angered that he could not have the whole mountain, but was pleased by Cho'gall's effective diplomacy. However, he was unaware of the true reason it had worked.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was incapacitated for several weeks. During this time, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; killed Blackhand the Destroyer and seized the mantle of Warchief. King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by one of the Shadow Council's finest killers, Garona. Orgrim captured and had Garona tortured to learn of the location of the Shadow Council's secret refuge. Sensing it threatened his position and that it was the root of the Horde's corruption, Orgrim launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, annihilating most of the warlocks of the Council. Their spirits were subsequently imbued into the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, while the magical energies of other long-dead &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s were infused into the bodies of the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nEven in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadow Council still remained. It is not clear how the Council was reformed after the death of most of their members, including Gul'dan. The current Shadow Council included members of all races, provided they possess the ideology of acceptance of the tenets of the Burning Legion.\nThe Shadow Council set up its main base in &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hold\"&gt;Shadow Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, where they reigned with massive force and numbers. The Burning Blade was also active in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and even had a &lt;a href=\"Neeru%20Fireblade\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, while the Searing Blade dwelled beneath the orcish &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; operated in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, while the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt; manipulated the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, it was discovered that some members of the Council, including &lt;a href=\"Vorpil\"&gt;Vorpil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackheart%20the%20Inciter\"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/a&gt;, survived by hiding in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt; operated from within Auchindoun, while members of the Shadow Council were widespread all over &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council%20Enforcer\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the original Council could be seen.\nCataclysm.\nWhile some members were missing after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; which was wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the rest of the Council in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be undamaged and active.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, an alternate rallied the members of the Shadow Council who have been in hiding on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, in order to help him retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jergosh%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Jergosh the Invoker&lt;/a&gt; led a team to obtain the book from the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Allaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Allaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nagaz\"&gt;Nagaz&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; for the eye. All three were later killed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Netherlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Malgath\"&gt;Lord Malgath&lt;/a&gt;, alongside several &lt;a href=\"Infiltrator%20Assassin\"&gt;Shadow Council assassins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council%20Warlock%20%28Violet%20Hold%29\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;, assisted the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in breaching the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Later, several of their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council%20Warlock%20%28Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%29\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; were seen aboard &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s command ship.\nStructure and operations.\nThe shape of the original Shadow Council is unclear. Gul'dan is described as a \"warlock of the Inner Circle\" (also an \"initiate of the Seventh Circle\") and Cho'gall as an \"initiate of the Fifth.\" This means that there are at least seven circles of the Shadow Council, the Inner Circle being the Seventh.\nThe hold of the current Shadow Council is extensive; they control cell-based organizations throughout &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; including the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt; cults, which utilize the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Seed\"&gt;Demon Seed&lt;/a&gt;. Agents of the Council have even infiltrated areas of the Orcish capital city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. It is also revealed from a questline in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; is another branch of the Shadow Council, and certain clues, like &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt; members they employ, &lt;a href=\"Marez%20Cowl\"&gt;Marez Cowl&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darbel%20Montrose\"&gt;Darbel Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, lead some to believe that the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; may be affiliated, if maybe loosely, with the Council. The Shadow Council is also present at &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grangol%27var%20Village\"&gt;Grangol'var Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27sorrow%20Fortress\"&gt;Kil'sorrow Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Its headquarters are in the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;.\nCults and groups.\nNote that most Shadow Council members are orcs; although they worship demons, most of them are not &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpeculation.\nWhile it may be a simple case of model reuse, the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign shows some &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; warlocks on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. It is, therefore, possible that some Stormreaver survivors traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and founded the local branch of the Shadow Council."}

He gained the support of many orcs and ogres, and also managed to gain the allegiance of the traitorous draenei known as the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA part of the council is captured by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; in order to use to open and maintain the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. , and &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; are inside Fel Spires near the Portal. They are freed during the assault by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Another group of warlock prisoners had been transported to &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; where they faced ogres from the .\nFollowing their escape from the Iron Horde, the Shadow Council regrouped in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27var\"&gt;Gul'var&lt;/a&gt;/the &lt;a href=\"Gloomspire\"&gt;Gloomspire&lt;/a&gt; (depending on the player's faction). While &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; hunt them down, Gul'dan sends Teron'gor to in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; to \"bleed them dry\", and Cho'gall to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; in so that he can subjugate , to which Cho'gall responds that \"the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20orc\"&gt;pale&lt;/a&gt; are the key.\"\nGul'dan flees after being found by an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; working with Khadgar, but not before having &lt;a href=\"Razuun\"&gt;Razuun&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Giselda%20the%20Beautiful\"&gt;Giselda the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; attack the Adventurer as a distraction. He later sends to assassinate Khadgar, but Garona is fought off by Cordana and flees.\nTalador has a heavy Shadow Council presence, with both and under its occupation and under attack. Shadow Council forces are able to steal the Heart of Auchindoun, though defenders are able to keep pieces out of their and reacquire them. Shadow Council warlocks in the northwest are &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;draining life&lt;/a&gt; from the land, preparing to summon a demon lord.\nIn Nagrand, Cho'gall transforms K'ure into a &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; and turns against Gul'dan. He goes on to invade &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, where he meets his demise.\nSocrethar meets his end when the &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; and make a move to reclaim Shattrath. \n&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2.0\"&gt;Fury of Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of , Cordana helped Khadgar break Garona free of Gul'dan's control, with the use of a Shadow Council &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Orb of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. After using it to break Gul'dan's hold over Garona's mind, Cordana took the orb away to destroy it. Even as Gul'dan lost his personal assassin, the warlock to gain control of the Iron Horde by re-offering the demon blood. However, still refuses and moves to strike Gul'dan down. The latter effortlessly incapacitates Grommash and opens the offer of demon blood to all orcs present, many of whom struggle with the decision of whether or not to accept. Ultimately it's Kilrogg who steps up to drink from the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;crude chalice&lt;/a&gt;, despite Grommash's urgent warnings. Once Kilrogg drinks the demon blood he quickly mutates into a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and Gul'dan takes control of the Iron Horde.\nWith their master in control of the Iron Horde, the Shadow Council freely operates within &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; as they aid the new Fel Horde. Sometime after a group of &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt; join up with the Shadow Council with some members seeking an end to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt; and others merely power-hungry. The Shadow Council is then able to aid their master in acquiring &lt;a href=\"The%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;The Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; to Gul'dan. However defects from the Shadow Council and aids the commander in thwarting Gul'dan's plans for the cipher by killing the insane &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh\"&gt;Cyrukh&lt;/a&gt;. \nMeanwhile it is soon discovered that rather than destroy the Orb of Dominion, Cordana fell to its influence and the warden become corrupted from afar. When the commander brought her a number of &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Tomes of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; from to destroy, she instead attempted to use the fel magic within them to take the ring Khadgar had given the commander. The commander was forced to fight her until she retreated through a demonic portal, vowing that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would soon come to destroy &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar was visibly stricken with grief at her betrayal.\nDetermined to put a stop to Gul'dan, Khadgar sends adventures into to end the warlock's once and for all. This assault devastates the Shadow Council as many of its members and senior leadership are slain, with even their burning masters falling to the might of Azeroth's champions.

Upon the demon lords' death Grommash and Khadgar have proclaimed that Draenor is free\nGrommash, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and turning their attention to rebuilding , could signify that the Shadow Council has been destroyed or has been weakened to the point the Draenor leadership feels that they are no longer a threat.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Assault on Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, several appearing orc and ogre warlocks are tagged as members of the Shadow Council. They respectively look like &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and spellcasters of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that they come from the alternate Shadow Council instead of their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Azeroth self&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nThe shape of this Shadow Council is unclear. The original &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had at least seven circles, the Inner Circle being the Seventh, and both &lt;a href=\"Razuun\"&gt;Razuun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giselda%20the%20Beautiful\"&gt;Giselda the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; are being described as \"inner council members\".\nSpeculation.\nWhile there are no orcs clearly associated with the , it can be speculated that, similarly as Tagar, the clan's members were assimilated into the Shadow Council and probably make up the Council's members."}

Shadow Focus increases your relative spell \"level\" to the mob, reducing the chance they will resist a portion or the entire spell outright. If you find yourself commonly dealing with mobs several levels higher than you, you will find this talent invaluable. In non-raiding situations, if you are the appropriate level for your zone/instance, 2-3 points should be all you need.\nIf you plan on doing endgame instances/raids as a Shadow priest, 3 points in this talent are required to minimize resists against raid bosses. That leaves a 86% hit chance, so 14% must be made up with spell hit gear at 22.6 rating per 1% equals 368 rating.\nWhen combined with the Shadow talent &lt;a href=\"Misery\"&gt;Misery&lt;/a&gt;, this increases your chance to hit (assuming 100% uptime of Misery) to 89%, and only 11% must be made up from gear, which equals 289 hit rating.\nSee the articles on &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;spell hit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; for more information."}

They are masters of voodoo magics who can use their spirit-powers to both heal their allies and place curses upon their hapless enemies. The Shadow Hunters walk the line between darkness and light in hopes of salvaging the future for their savage brethren.\nInformation.\nThe Shadow Hunter is an extremely popular hero among Orc players because of his massive support capabilities that he provides, especially in team matches. He is a fairly weak hero though, and requires protection to make the most out of him. He is often the second or third Hero due to his lack of offensive capabilities to compliment hero rushing and killing thanks to his Hex spell.\nHero names.\nZul'kis, Zul'abar, Zul'rajas, Zul'maran, Jo Jo Headshrinker, Shaka-zahn, Shakti-lar, &lt;a href=\"Mezil-kree\"&gt;Mezil-kree&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and abilities.\nHaling Wave.\nThe spell allows Orc players to quickly heal without having to rely on Healing Salves, a fountain or the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Witch%20Doctor%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;'s Healing Wards.\nHe.\nHex also works on Heroes, but at a significantly reduced duration. Despite this, it is just as effective against Heroes as it is against powerful creeps, as the hexed target cannot attack, cast spells and use inventory items. Hexed targets also have their speed reduced to 100. When the unit breaks out of Hex, you can have a Tauren Chieftain use War Stomp to further incapacitate the Hero and kill them.\nSerpent ard.\nThis allows the Shadow Hunter to creep early in the game, especially at level 3 where they can deal considerable damage due to their fast cooldown and high damage. Serpent wards possess low attack priority, meaning that they're unlikely to be killed unless targeted by the enemy in a massive fight. The wards are also immune to spells.\nBig Bad oodoo (Ultimate).\nDuring the duration of this spell, all friendly units near the Shadow Hunter are put into a state of invulnerability - the Shadow Hunter himself is still vulnerable to attacks. If the Shadow Hunter is already under the effects of invulnerability when he casts the spell, it is automatically removed for balancing reasons.\nAs a channeled spell, it can be interrupted by stuns or silence. Before using the ability, make sure there are enough units to protect the Shadow Hunter as he will most likely be targeted by nearby enemies. This spell is extremely powerful in team matches."}

He was said to be an orphan.\nAlodi's staff, &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"frost%20mage\"&gt;frost mage&lt;/a&gt;s in \"\".\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nAlodi never knew his real parents. From infancy, he was raised in an orphanage for magically gifted children in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. His only connection to his parents was &lt;a href=\"Ebonchill\"&gt;Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, which they had left with the boy when they abandoned him at the school. His dubious parentage and mixed ancestry made life difficult for Alodi. Most magi pitied him, but others treated him with scorn. No one believed he would rise to greatness. From his early days in the Dalaran orphanage, Alodi had been fascinated with frost magic. This was due in part to the icy enchantments woven into Ebonchill. With the staff, Alodi learned how to freeze water and manipulate air temperature, often to the chagrin of the orphanage headmaster.\nThe First Guardian.\nAs a young adult, Alodi witnessed the fall of &lt;a href=\"Aertin%20Brighthand\"&gt;Aertin Brighthand&lt;/a&gt; and altered the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; by restructuring the transfer ceremony used to link the Council of Tirisfal with the Spearhead. He did this by using a spell that &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; and him devised that will allow the Council of Tirisfal and the Spearhead to link at great distances, as before that the Council had to be within a certain range of the Spearhead, thus risking them whenever the Spearhead did battle. This allowed them to engage the enemy with the Council of Tirisfal's power and safety intact and out of harm's way. To reflect this change, the Council of Tirisfal altered the title of Spearhead to &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;-- of the Council's power, safety, trust, and defense of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlodi was engaged to the human &lt;a href=\"Eidre\"&gt;Eidre&lt;/a&gt;, whose family owned land on &lt;a href=\"Brightwater%20Lake\"&gt;Brightwater Lake&lt;/a&gt;, but she broke it off due to his duties as Guardian. She later made peace with the fact that she could not keep him to herself and from helping the world as she witnessed how Alodi fought and banished the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; banished by a Guardian.\nLater life.\nThe spell Alodi and Meryl created would later be applied to a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Forge of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and used for all Guardians from that day on, until the day &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; refused to return her power.\nHe later had a relationship with the head of the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Bank of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, a shapeshifting \"astral entity\" named &lt;a href=\"Glutonia\"&gt;Glutonia&lt;/a&gt;, who was an elf in his time but a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; today.\nShortly after Alodi became Guardian, he honed his mastery of frost magic and imbued Ebonchill with his own powers. A wintry aura enveloped the staff. Much to the astonishment of Alodi's companions on the Council of Tirisfal, the weapon never felt cold to the touch. Ebonchill contained only a sliver of Alodi's might, but even that was more than most magi could ever hope of wielding. During Alodi's tenure as Guardian, he used Ebonchill to hunt down every demon that stalked the lands of Azeroth. Many records tell of him calling down vicious ice storms to overwhelm his enemies, or encasing the Legion's agents in solid blocks of ice before exiling them from the world.\nNear the end of Alodi's one hundred years of service as Guardian, he turned his attention to his apprentices. He had trained and tutored many young magi in the ways of the arcane. They had become the family that he had never had, and he treated them all as his own sons and daughters. Alodi decided to pass on Ebonchill to one of these learned apprentices. He did not choose the most powerful. More important to Alodi were compassion, wisdom, and comradery. After much consideration, he entrusted his greatstaff to the apprentice who most embodied these traits. So began a tradition of bequeathing Ebonchill that would endure for millennia.\nWhen Alodi died, his spirit was forever bound to the Forge of the Guardian, available for consultation to the Kirin Tor if he was ever needed.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran called on the spirit of Alodi to ask of him the location of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, as while he had written \"&lt;a href=\"Notable%20Antiquities%20of%20Ancient%20Azeroth\"&gt;Notable Antiquities of Ancient Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" on the subject that Khadgar found within &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, it did not elaborate on their location because even he dared not trifle with their power. Alodi directed the mages to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Meryl and a mage &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; battle Kathra'natir in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Alodi's spirit is awakened within the Forge of the Guardian and temporarily infuses the adventurer with his power to aid in the fight. Afterwards his spirit travels to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; with Meryl and the hero to recreate the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, a group of magi used by the Council of Tirisfal in the absence of a Guardian.\nIf asked, he will help to retrieve Ebonchill.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Inside, the chapel's &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel%20Eternal%20Flame\"&gt;eternal flame&lt;/a&gt; ensured the protection of the building from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the flames of Stratholme, but also to prevent its single occupant \u2014 the paladin &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 from being transformed into a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to complete their final trial to obtain the rank of Master, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; had to enter into Stratholme and extinguish the eternal flame. When they entered, they had to face Aurius and the spirits of five knights of the Silver Hand - &lt;a href=\"Aelmar%20the%20Vanquisher\"&gt;Aelmar the Vanquisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cathela%20the%20Seeker\"&gt;Cathela the Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gregor%20the%20Justiciar\"&gt;Gregor the Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vicar%20Hieronymus\"&gt;Vicar Hieronymus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nemas%20the%20Arbiter\"&gt;Nemas the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. After the Blood Knights emerged victorious from the battle, and extinguished the eternal flame, the chapel began to burn.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the liberation of Stratholme from &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; took control of the chapel, as &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Crusade Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that it was the only building that the Scourge couldn't touch, and that it would be their forward base of operations in that half of the city.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, though the city was still in control of the Scourge, the chapel was controlled by the Silver Hand and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; who used it as a base of operations. While some paladins were present in the Elder Square to protect the building, the others escorted the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; through the burning city, in order to later perform the ritual of purification for the barding of the &lt;a href=\"Highlord%27s%20Golden%20Charger\"&gt;Highlord's Golden Charger&lt;/a&gt;."}

In life, he was the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and the mentor of many heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, including the first paladin of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus learned of the massacre that the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Order%20of%20Northshire%20Clerics\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt; had suffered against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. In order to lend the Church's support, he created with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; an order of holy warriors, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Uther, he recruited and trained &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt; to make them the first &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth. After completing their training, he chose his apprentice to be the first paladin and their leader in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war, Alonsus joined the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt; and ensured that the meetings between the kings of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; did not turn into conflicts. After their victory over the orcs, he worked for years to restore the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, ordering his priests and paladins to help those in need. Among his projects, he invested funds in the reconstruction of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, reformed the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, and oversaw the reconstruction of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Alonsus died for unknown reasons and was succeeded by his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; as the Archbishop of the Church of the Holy Light. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he was resurrected as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; but managed to free himself from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s control, like the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. For years, he remained in hiding and managed to find the princess &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who survived the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; by her brother &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. He then ensured her protection and training as a priestess of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus returned and joined the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;, he led the priesthoods from all over Azeroth in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and eventually reached the title of Archbishop once more after the end of the invasion. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he helped &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to organize the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAlonsus Faol was a short and stout human with a snow-white beard and a friendly face, he was also occasionally compared to &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt;. He needed no introduction anywhere in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as even without the ceremonial robes and staff that he constantly carried with him, Alonsus Faol was the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and was revered by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s everywhere. He was a loved and generous man, and many would enjoy his presence, even those who had just met him, as just watching the old man created a sense of peace and wisdom.\nWhen he was a &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; of the Church, Faol met &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and made him his apprentice many years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, serving as his spiritual advisor and mentor.\nSecond War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus was present with the kings of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;Imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, where he listened &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; recount the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. As the conversation began to get tense, he stepped in to ask what Lothar was waiting of them, which was the creation of an alliance to save their world from the invading orcs.\nDays later, Alonsus was present during the second meeting as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Even if he wasn't a king, he was a leader in his own right, as the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Light\"&gt;Church of Light&lt;/a&gt; his followers included most of the people from all the kingdoms combined. After the meeting, the Archbishop interrupted the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; who criticized the behavior of the kings during the discussions, after he politely lectured him, he explained to Lothar that he also voted for him as the Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He then announced that this war would push both men to the very limits of their talents, courage, and resolve but that he was certain that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; would be with them, before giving them his blessing. He later pledged the Church of the Holy Light to the cause of the Alliance Lordaeron, and would aid in Stormwind's restoration by raising funds once the crisis had been dealt with.\nAfter he learned what happened to the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, Faol was deeply troubled by the loss of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, and by the terrible attrition its &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s suffered in that conflict. Four days later, he met with Lothar and proposed to create a new branch of the Church, a new order, one that would represent the best qualities of humanity. It would comprise soldiers who were skilled not only in wielding the Light, but also in leadership and the arts of traditional warfare. With Lothar's permission, and aided by his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, Faol recruited a handful of knights to form this new order, all of them showed an aptitude for the Holy Light and also exemplified the qualities of loyalty, bravery, and honor. He began to train other &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s in the way of the Light and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s in the arts of martial combat. He called his students the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and their group's name was the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll the order's members he recruited were revered individuals from Lordaeron, among them were &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and his apprentice Uther, as he was already an accomplished knight and a pious believer. The last of them was &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, a battle-hardened knight of the First War sent by Anduin Lothar, and whose Alonsus welcomed with open arms. The city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; would serve as their base of operations, but Lothar decided to keep them close and to travel alongside the main Alliance army. For days and nights, Alonsus Faol trained them vigorously, teaching them how to use the Light to comfort their allies and smite their enemies, and also how to lead by example. They would be more than weapons, and would serve as lights in the darkness, as beacons of hope to guide the Alliance. He also instructed his paladins to live simple lives, as they would seek no fortune or glory in war, and until the end of their days, they would put the needs of others above their own.\nAs training progressed, Faol presented a set of enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s to the paladins. These holy tomes were some of the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented what Faol saw as a core trait of the Silver Hand: retribution, holiness, protection, justice, and compassion. He gave one libram to each of the paladins and challenged them to become the living embodiments of what their holy tomes represented. When Lothar asked for Turalyon and Uther to serve him as his lieutenants, Faol was happy to accommodate the supreme commander, but he did not release the paladins from his care yet. It would be weeks before they were ready to set foot on the battlefield.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, he performed the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%23Formation\"&gt;ceremony of induction&lt;/a&gt; of his five apprentices, and made Uther the first paladin of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the Supreme leader of the Silver Hand.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop Alonsus Faol worked ceaselessly to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and bring aid to the remaining nations of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He helped to reform the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and raised vast funds to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. He also took under his wing the kindly &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; and spent many years teaching him the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and together, they built the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, he was in charge of organizing the ceremony for &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s induction into the Order of the Silver Hand, in the Cathedral of Light.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, he held the position of one of the four jurors. Like the other judges, he was shocked when Tirion admitted his guilt, for taking a vow of honor to protect the orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and refusing to break it, which led the paladin to his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; and his exile. Later, Alonsus Faol died for unknown reasons when &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was just a child. His apprentice &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; took charge of the Church as the new Archbishop and swore to continue the good work his mentor had begun so many years ago.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus was raised as a mindless minion of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; though he would later gain free will when the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, freed themselves from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s control. At some point, while escaping from undead, Princess &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was found by Alonsus to his great joy. As she recognized him, the former archbishop showed her that not all undead had lost their minds, and that there were some who were still themselves even after death. This made her understand that the Forsaken and the Scourge were two separate entities, with the former still deserving of dignity and compassion. The princess became his pupil, and both of them went into hiding for some time.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Faol returned after years of absence hiding in the shadows. Over this time, he notably worked with &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and during their infiltration, they learned about an ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; relic, &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter directing the priest &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; to search for various &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s, Faol joined Moira and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the trio journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient draenei prison for &lt;a href=\"Saraka%20the%20Lighteater\"&gt;Saraka the Lighteater&lt;/a&gt;. There, Alonsus along with the artifact wielder and several other priests were able to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it back to its &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;original state&lt;/a&gt;. To celebrate, Alonsus changed the prison into the priest order hall and promoted the artifact wielder as the leader of the order.\nThe first thing on his agenda was to spread the word to gather more priests to the Temple, and to get rations to the maximum extent against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He then asked the priest to meet &lt;a href=\"Gilner%20Greymoss\"&gt;Gilner Greymoss&lt;/a&gt; and to find out what was troubling the gnome, thinking he was spouting nonsense, but Velen told him that they could not afford to make careless assumptions. He later requested the champion priest to go into the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, and to recover the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Light\"&gt;Spark of Light&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sol\"&gt;recruit a potential ally&lt;/a&gt;. When Alonsus learned about a few defectors among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, he sent the champion priest to save them. Upon returning with &lt;a href=\"Mariella%20Ward\"&gt;Mariella Ward&lt;/a&gt; and her followers, he said that it was times where they could not refuse any form of help, and thus, he welcomed them as their new allies. Later, Foal sent the champion priest to &lt;a href=\"Micah%20Belford\"&gt;Micah Belford&lt;/a&gt;, in order to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. After freeing &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus commented that the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; priests would rejoice at Natalie's return, and the Conclave as well, knowing that Velen's prophecy was fulfilled.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; rushed to Faol and explained that she has been working with &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt;, and the Highlord of the Silver Hand, to translate a codex that detailed the Legion's plans to establish an invasion point at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;. She then asked to take a small group of priests to accompany the paladins in their search for the demon world known as &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, as if the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; was there, they would find him. After he accepted, Alonsus told her to return to the temple at once when she had any information the Conclave could act on. Later, an urgent message from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; of the Silver Hand revealed that both groups have been captured by the Legion. After rescuing the paladins and priests from Niskara, the intel on the planet confirmed that the Legion was going to attack the Netherlight Temple. Consequently, Faol asked the Hight priest to go beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, to ask for the help of their leaders. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; agreed to aid the Conclave, and all that remained was to prepare for the attack of Balnazzar.\nEventually, the Legion found the Netherlight Temple, and Alonsus told the High Priest to inform the paladins to arrive at the temple at once. After the long struggle against the Legion, thanks to the aid of the holy dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and the paladins of the Silver Hand, Balnazzar was no more. To celebrate their victory, Alonsus gave the title of High Priest to their leader, and told them that their artifact was evolving with them.\nLegionfall.\nDuring the meeting of order hall champions at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, Faol was the representative leader of the Conclave who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Alonsus had it brought to his attention that a curious contagion was spreading through a small coastal region within &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. The local tribes have abandoned the area for fear of catching this ailment that currently has no known cure at this time. The &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aelthalyste\"&gt;Aelthalyste&lt;/a&gt; traveled there when her companion &lt;a href=\"Roland%20Abernathy\"&gt;Roland Abernathy&lt;/a&gt; fell ill with the contagion and told the High Priest to lend them a hand. Eventually, with a cure in hand, he informed the High Priest that the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; needed its attention for using it on their allies and to prevent the contagion from spreading.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in order to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to restore &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' destruction, Alonsus Faol graciously welcomed the king of Stormwind. The Archbishop's warm and friendly demeanor managed to change Anduin's perceptions of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, he came to see the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; as just ordinary people in another form, and was shocked when Alonsus also introduced him to his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; leaders addressed the Conclave about the plight of Azeroth and recruited them to their efforts, Alonsus commended Anduin for his leadership and as a fellow priest, invited him to take part in Conclave affairs whenever he wished.\nLater, Alonsus was doing his part in organizing the healing efforts by traveling to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; cities and spurring them to support their cause. When King Anduin returned to Netherlight Temple to discuss with Faol and Calia the progress of their mission, Anduin transitioned the conversation to be about his plan to formalize a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between the Forsaken and their human loved ones. Anduin sought to enlist Alonsus' aid in his endeavors. However, Alonsus had doubts about the two races' ability to move past their prejudices or theirs to overcome the obstacles that sought to oppose such a unity. Yet with Calia's urging, Alonsus agreed to work with his fellow priests to lay the groundwork for the event. He later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to relay King Anduin's missives to &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Vellcinda Benton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, which concerned the proposal of the Gathering. When &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; reproached Alonsus for fraternizing with the Alliance &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, Faol claimed he was politically neutral as he was not a member of the Horde, but a simple priest of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. He remained in the Undercity for a few days to address any questions or concerns about the Gathering. According to Blightcaller, at one point he suggested that Faol pledge fealty to Sylvanas and the Horde, but the archbishop demurred, saying he preferred \"'to serve the Light rather than kings or queens.'\"\nOne late evening, King Anduin summoned &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and reunited them with Alonsus Faol, officially dressed as he was in life as an archbishop, in a last-ditch effort to convince them of the righteousness of his cause. Genn was outraged that Anduin would traumatize them by using an abominable version of their old friend in order to make a point. He accused Alonsus of manipulating the king, but Faol retorted to Greymane that his hatred of him stems from fear; fear that if he acknowledges the Forsaken as people, then he would also be acknowledging that his son died for nothing. Though Genn was about to assault Faol in fury, Turalyon stopped him as he would not permit violence in a sacred place. Faol tried to convince Genn, his rage and pain prohibiting him from understanding a truth that could change his perceptions, but Genn wanted to cling to hatred and sorrow as it was what fueled him to fight. Faol sympathized but when he asked if he would still hate the Forsaken if Faol came to him with a Forsaken Liam, Genn was shaken to the core. Unable to face the truth, Genn howled in fury and fled the Cathedral. After Genn left the cathedral in rage, Turalyon told Faol that he &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemed&lt;/a&gt; what was once a good man and had stolen his form, and if there were anything left of his old friend Turalyon would kill him in mercy. But when Faol told Turalyon to look for the Light within him, Turalyon did not strike; when he did indeed find it, with tearful joy he knelt in front of the archbishop who gave him a blessing. Overjoyed Turalyon changed his mind about the Gathering and immediately admitting his views had been wrong, offered his help to Anduin.\nDuring the Gathering, Alonsus and his fellow priests supervised the event and provide the participants with their blessings. However, the Gathering ended in tragedy, and Calia was killed on the field by Sylvanas. He took her corpse back to Netherlight Temple and regretted authorizing her participation in the event, but miraculously, Calia's body was not decomposing. With &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance, Saa'ra, Alonsus, and Anduin raised Calia back to life, but as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; touched by the Light. The Archbishop then offered to teach Calia how to be an undead walking in the Light to better serve her people, which she agreed to.\nElegy.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; began to flee &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; ' command. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; mentioned he has sent someone to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and asked the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s to provide assistance for the newly arrived kaldorei &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, saying that he was certain that Faol would be glad to assist them.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Faol was amongst the Forsaken within the ruins. It is unclear if he has decided to join the Forsaken, and thus the Horde, or if he merely wished to aid the Forsaken as they recovered their city.\nAs a champion follower.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Class Hall champion&lt;/a&gt;, Alonsus Faol is a Discipline Priest with the following abilities:\nHe can also be assigned as a &lt;a href=\"bodyguard\"&gt;bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;:\nDeath and remembrance.\nAlonsus Faol died prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was just a child. He was buried at &lt;a href=\"Faol%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Faol's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, a graveyard in the now-plagued &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, located near the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Alonsus%20Faol%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; and fountain were once standing in front of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, honoring all the hard work done by Faol after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, notably his raising funds to help rebuild the city and to reestablish the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the monument was replaced for unknown reasons by a statue dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe leader of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt; during the war was Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and his apprentice was a devout lad named &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;. At the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; formed and began mustering its forces, several abbots openly wept as they realized that their pacifist &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s would need to learn the arts of war; but Archbishop Alonsus Faol saw an opportunity to unite the sword and the chalice to create a new breed of holy knights: &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who were mighty with the hammer as well as the holy magic of the divine. He founded the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and began training paladins immediately.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\", he was called \"Farol\" (likely a typo). Prior to the Second War, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; Faol of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; created an elite fighting force of divine knights \u2014 champions imbued with the Holy Light\u2019s power. The archbishop ordained many warriors into this new order called the Knights of the Silver Hand, the first of whom was Uther. The &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Hammer of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; is a mighty weapon forged when Archbishop Faol created the Knights of the Silver Hand, and the archbishop bequeathed it to the order\u2019s first Grand Master \u2014 Uther the Lightbringer.\nIn Hearthstone.\nAlonsus Faol appears as the first in the Paladin's adventure, in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"The kindly Archbishop has called on your service as war rages across your homeland.\""}

He was researching an affliction that he had called the \"&lt;a href=\"Worgen%20Curse\"&gt;Worgen Curse&lt;/a&gt;\". He believed he would find a cure to this curse, and although it would not cure the transformation, it may allow the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to retain their minds after the transformation. He believed that these good-minded worgen could retain their abilities and help them defeat the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and other evil powers. Alphus believed that if he was funded then he could create this \"cure\".\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; once ran into him in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and had a chat with him. Alphus gave him a copy of his research. Once Alphus Wordwill finally got his funding, he began work on the cure for the curse. He needed protection as he and his servants moved through the forest gathering reagents and conducting tests. He had people sneak into &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; and drop the cure into the water supply, then sneak out and observe the changes over several days. This activity undoubtedly angered &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s mysterious overseers. Alphus hopes someone will slay Shadowfang's evil lords to permanently stamp out the curse's evil."}

Some players play multiple characters at around the same level, keeping them roughly equal in power. In those cases, players often simply use the term \"alt\" to refer to a character other than the one they are currently playing.\nUses.\nAlts are created for a number of reasons.\nVariety.\nPlayers often create alts to have different gameplay, roleplay, or social experiences. They may be created to alleviate boredom, or to try something new after reaching a milestone like the &lt;a href=\"level%20cap\"&gt;level cap&lt;/a&gt;. \"World of Warcraft\" includes eleven &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es, thirteen &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s in two &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s, eleven primary &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;PvP-&lt;/a&gt; and non-PvP &lt;a href=\"realm%20type\"&gt;realm type&lt;/a&gt;s to provide many gameplay options which can only be experienced with alts (or paid character modification services). These choices are equally meaningful in &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt;, which may itself vary between alts on Roleplay or non-Roleplay realm types. Roleplayers may also develop different names, personalities and backstories, and utilize different gear between characters.\n\"World of Warcraft\" does not reveal which characters belong to the same player by default, which allows players to choose who they would like to make aware of different alts. This allows alts to be more or less involved in &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; activities, have smaller, larger, or completely different groups of friends, or even be completely socially isolated. This choice is diminished somewhat if players choose to become &lt;a href=\"Real%20ID\"&gt;Real ID&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BattleTag\"&gt;BattleTag&lt;/a&gt; friends with others, since those friends will be able to see any character being played, but players are free to use those features as widely or narrowly as they like - and, of course, those friends may be more likely to respect players' wishes with regard to use of alts.\nReinforcing other characters.\nSome alts are created on the same &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; to increase the power of a player's main, or to create a team of characters all mutually reinforcing each other. Many &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s in the game require materials not available to single characters without help. For instance, a &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailoring&lt;/a&gt; recipe may require ingredients obtained only by &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;\u2014or both\u2014while a single character may possess only two of those types of &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s at a time. With alts, a player can work other professions, and avoid problems with availability of materials, at the expense of spending extra time leveling up. A character may even be enabled to learn an unconventional mix of crafting professions if an alt knows two gathering &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s. For instance &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; is normally taken with &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt; to avoid relying on other players for materials, but engineer/scribes are feasible if miner/herbalist alts exist to supply them.\nAlts created primarily for gathering resources for other characters are commonly known as farming alts. &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;s are popular for this purpose since they begin the game at level 55 and therefore have a head start at gaining access to all the areas in the game where resources can be found. Farming alts may be used to supply other characters of the same player, or simply to gather materials to &lt;a href=\"auction\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt; and make gold.\nBank alt.\nA bank alt or \"mule\" is an alternate character that is usually level 1 and sits in a trade &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. This character's primary use is for:\nOther reasons.\nSome alts exist primarily:\nThese types of characters are not always played in the normal sense; see their respective pages for more information.\nFunctionality on a single account.\nMost players have a single \"World of Warcraft\" account, which allows up to 50 characters to be created at a time across all servers.\nFeatures.\nAlts on the same account, realm and faction can send &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; to each other. Items and gold normally take one hour to deliver when mailed to characters outside of the sender's guild (assuming the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Mail\"&gt;Guild Mail&lt;/a&gt; perk), but mail sent to alts will arrive instantly, allowing for easy transfer of crafted, collected, or purchased items. &lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;Bind to Account&lt;/a&gt; items such as &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s have even more freedom, and can be mailed to any alt on any faction and &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlts on the same realm and faction can be in the same &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; and use the same &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt;. There is no account-based restriction on using the guild bank to transfer items or gold, although different alts may have different guild ranks with varying bank privileges.\nRestrictions.\nAlts on the same account cannot be logged into the game world simultaneously. This prevents such alts from directly supporting each other in combat (known as &lt;a href=\"multiboxing\"&gt;multiboxing&lt;/a&gt;) and from transferring items directly using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Limited-duration items can only be given to other characters using the trade window, and consequently cannot be passed directly to an alt. Alts also cannot buy each other's &lt;a href=\"auction\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt;s, preventing transfers between &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; alts on the same account using the auction house.\nUse of multiple accounts.\nThere is no restriction on the number of accounts you can have, but each costs an account fee per month. Alts on separate accounts circumvent the item transfer restrictions placed on alts on the same account, and can still send and receive &lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;Bind to Account&lt;/a&gt; items as long as all the accounts are registered under the same &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account. However, few players pay for a separate account just to occasionally trade items; the primary use of alts on separate accounts is &lt;a href=\"multiboxing\"&gt;multiboxing&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrial accounts.\nYou could run an alt on a &lt;a href=\"trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; account, but that trial account would not be able to trade, use the auction house, nor mail or receive items, so a trial account alt cannot get around the trading restrictions of a same account alt.\nYou can multibox with trial account alts, but gearing your alts is a problem, since you cannot directly share. The best you can do is run as master looter on your main to allocate items that drop. You will also quickly exceed the level limit for trial accounts. Anyone serious about multiboxing will probably prefer to run paid accounts.\nAlt-itis.\nPlayers who have a large number of mid-level characters rather than a few high-level ones are sometimes jokingly accused of suffering from \"alt-itis\". Symptoms include:\nThis term is almost always used in good humor, despite the usual implication that it's a sign of indecision. The most common causes of alt-itis are:\nMany sufferers of alt-itis are proud to wear the label.\nAlternate terms include:"}

It was situated in the foothills and mountains of the land known as the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly ruled by &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;King Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac was the weakest &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in the Alliance and a relatively small contributor of soldiers and supplies.\nThe Alteraci people are scattered, many of them form what is now the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;. The masks worn by Syndicate members are orange, just like the &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;national color&lt;/a&gt; of the fallen kingdom.\nHistory.\nOnce the home of the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci tribe&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac was founded during the third millennium &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Arathor\"&gt;Empire of Arathor&lt;/a&gt; expanded across southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The early human settlers built a city nestled in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, likely exploiting its position on important trade routes through the mountains. The settlement grew into a powerful city-state around the same time as &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the centuries passed, Alterac had grown to be culturally distinctive from those in the imperial capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, yet all the while remaining staunchly loyal to its authority. Its army had grown to be one of the strongest in the empire, likely from its position on the empire's northern frontier. Alteraci explorers were among those (along with Gilneans) to map out the lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and initiate diplomatic relations between Arathor and Ironforge.\nIndependence from Arathor.\nAlterac's independence did not come out of a revolution or formal decree. Instead, independence grew slowly as Arathor began to decline. Strom's leadership was willing to surrender its authority to the city-states within its borders rather than deal with affairs themselves. By 1,200 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac was fully independent once the last of the Arathi emperors left Strom. It was a relatively small kingdom compared to the others. The capital came to be known as \"&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt;\", likely to distinguish itself from the kingdom's name. Most of the nation's territory was rugged and mountainous terrain of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Second War.\nBefore the coming of the orcs, the human kingdoms of Lordaeron faced challenges and obstacles from each other as the games of politics played out. Amidst those nations, there were no two rivals like Alterac and Stromgarde. The proximity of the two and the apparent ambiguity of their mountain borders had led to several wars and skirmishes. On more than one occasion, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; led the armies of Stromgarde into battle against the honorable &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; of Alterac. The tension of their repeated discord was noticeable at the Alliance summit as Perenolde glared at Trollbane. It is conceivable that this discord had alienated Alterac and its leader from the other Alliance nations who had positive relations with Trollbane. This alienation, in turn, would contribute to Perenolde's willingness to turn on those allies midway through the Second War.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; happened, Alterac was a sizeable kingdom, with several towns and forts besides its &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom owned the southern shores of &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and also owned land east of the &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt;, notably the area near &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second War.\nWhen news of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac, led by King &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, was initially reluctant to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Perenolde initially asked if the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would be open to negotiation, but after seeing every other kingdom eventually join, and fearing being left alone to fight the Horde, Alterac finally decided to join the Alliance.\nSome Alteraci soldiers joined &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s armies and loyally fought against the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, thought in lesser numbers than those sent by &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, as the Horde ravaged its way through the southern realms up to the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Perenolde started fearing for the safety of Alterac. He directly contacted &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; through a messenger bird and secretly met with him. Impressed that Doomhammer was able to speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden started finding the orc a cultured and honorable warrior. The two leaders negotiated an agreement: in exchange for free passage through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and other means of help from the kingdom, Doomhammer would keep his soldiers in check and not kill Alteraci citizens or raid Alteraci settlements. The Warchief even promised that after his conquest of Lordaeron, he would place Alterac under his protection, so that none may violate it, keeping the realm safe. Pleased with this agreement, Perenolde came back to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;his castle&lt;/a&gt; and announced to his general staff that starting immediately, Alterac would renege its vows with the Alliance and side with the Horde instead. Not all in the Alteraci leadership agreed with this decision, but they still obeyed their king.\nPerenolde arranged for a convoy of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; passing through &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; to be ambushed by &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, organized a peasant revolt in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; to cover mining operations there, and attempted to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; by employing &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s to tamper with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Perenolde also allowed the Horde through his kingdom unimpeded through mountain passes in Alterac leading towards &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. To accomplish this, he ordered his military leaders to garrison several northern mountain passes and avoid several south routes. Alteraci agents were eventually embedded into some of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;orc clans&lt;/a&gt;, rendering them any assistance necessary.\nAlterac sailors and soldiers were eventually caught fighting for the orcs during various battles of the war, including the major naval &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;battle of Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;. After Perenolde's treachery was uncovered, the army of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the small kingdom. &lt;a href=\"Hath\"&gt;General Hath&lt;/a&gt; reluctantly confirmed Perenolde's treason once confronted by the king of Stromgarde. He then dispatched his troops to join Trollbane's in halting the orcish advance through the mountain passes.\n&lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; later marched his forces into Alterac and declared martial law, deposing the traitorous Perenolde and imprisoning him. The custody soon turned to a mere house arrest, confining Perenolde to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;his palace&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of his family on close watch, and the kingdom was put under Alliance control. As a sovereign king, he could not be exiled, executed, or simply imprisoned (in order to avoid worrying the other kings that the same reaction would occur if they disagreed on anything). The other kings wanted him to abdicate his position as king, so that he could be executed as a lesser noble. However, he refused, knowing it would mean his death. His kingdom had been put under martial law as a temporary solution on &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion. Alterac's treasuries were also added to the Alliance's in order to finance the incoming measures that would happen after the war.\nAlteraci survivors, particularly the dethroned king, later aided &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s forces during the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s quest to steal magical artifacts to open new &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt;. During an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish attack on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the Horde's defeat, Perenolde had the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; stolen by his spies in an attempt to use for future leverage. The Book was taken by an Alterac &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; but was ultimately traded to the Horde to rid his lands of the vengeful troops of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing attacked the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; holding the troops. His son &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden&lt;/a&gt; was disgusted by the action of his father, knowing it would destroy everything he had done to try to clear the family name.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nFollowing the end of the war, Thoras Trollbane demanded that the eastern portion of Alterac be annexed to Stromgarde in recognition of its efforts and sacrifices during the conflict. King &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron was undecided on what to do, thinking about giving the throne to Perenolde's son, &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of Gilneas also joined the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;dispute&lt;/a&gt;, supporting the claims of a nephew of Perenolde, &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken refuge in Gilneas. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as Lord Daval Prestor, attempted to magically convince the leaders of the Alliance into making him Alterac's new ruler. Although he succeeded, and King Terenas planned to give control of the area to Lord Prestor, the plan was abandoned when Prestor \"disappeared\" (following Deathwing's defeat at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;).\nAt some point &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; died, leaving the door open for &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to at least partially annex the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. At the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, and its inhabitants considered him their lord, with the citizens also taking up arms for Lordaeron. A new resistance against them had appeared, however, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, led by former Alteraci Prince Aliden after he rose up in the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt; under the tutelage of his new mentor &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; in Year 28, the old Alteraci territories continue to be disputed between the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt;, and the Syndicate brigands scattered across &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth War.\nFollowing the destruction of Lordaeron, Horde forces sought to occupy Alterac ruins, hoping to establish a defensible base of operations for the Horde in Lordaeron. In response, Alliance sent scouts to investigate the established fortifications and determine the numbers of local forces. No offensive, however, has been done to contest the region.\nGeography.\nOccupies almost the entire &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Alterac is divided by the &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt;. The main routes: Crossroads in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;. Following the borders from and extrapolating to &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;WOW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; did not belong to Alterac, in the north the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt; ridge is the main arable land of Alterac and its gorge between the Alterac Mountains is presumably called Dandred's Fold in honor of the &lt;a href=\"Dandred%27s%20Fold\"&gt;settlement of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, in the south ending with Alterac/Hillsbrad Fingers - from west to east - &lt;a href=\"Gavin%27s%20Naze\"&gt;Gavin's Naze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corrahn%27s%20Dagger\"&gt;Corrahn's Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sofera%27s%20Naze\"&gt;Sofera's Naze&lt;/a&gt; and an unnamed 5th hill south of Strahnbrad. Here is the famous &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. It is noteworthy that the &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt;, judging by , flows down from the tops of the mountains, and does not cut through the mountains like a channel. If it appears that this is a man-made channel or canyon, it is likely that the eastern part of Alterac is a completely different mountain range.\nResources.\nOres:\n&lt;a href=\"Silver\"&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt; - Near tin deposits (They often go in tandem), in the northeast of the highlands and at the foothills + at Growless Cave\n&lt;a href=\"Tin\"&gt;Tin&lt;/a&gt; - Rarely on the western slopes - Gavin's Naze and slightly north.\n&lt;a href=\"Mithril\"&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt; - veins also from the Headland, rarely from the western foothills of the Highlands and in the North of the Highlands themselves - creating a kind of mirrored question mark\n&lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; - About the same place as iron, but rarely Uplands, also found in the Transitional part to the Western Plaguelands\n&lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; - Found near and around the Headland, Highlands, Uplands and at their foothills + at Chillwind Point\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Granite\"&gt;Alterac Granite&lt;/a&gt; - Deposits are found in the Four Fingers, at least in the Darrow Hill caves.

Alterac's honor has been blemished ever since. During the war, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attempted to conscript some Alliance nobles to help them in their campaign, and the weak-willed nobles of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; readily agreed to help the orcs overthrow the Alliance leaders and take &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With the defeat of the Horde came the punishment for these traitors: exile from their former holdings. These exiles would eventually form the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;.

It was the site of the last and most decisive battle of the war.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; allied with the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for the elves teaching &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. While the magi trained, Thoradin had his generals establish a stronghold at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; as a staging point for their future offensive against the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;. While the generals also created forts in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt; further north, Alterac Fortress would remain the humans' most important northern holding.\nAfter the One Hundred finished their training months later, Thoradin led twenty thousand human soldiers to gather at Alterac Fortress before marching toward Quel'Thalas. The One Hundred stayed behind, hidden in the fortress. Thoradin's army attacked the Amani host in southern Quel'Thalas and then retreated back to Alterac with the trolls in pursuit. Upon reaching the Alterac foothills, the Amani besieged the stronghold while the humans defended it and the high elves attacked the trolls' rear guard. After days of battle, once the humans and elves had worn down the trolls, the One Hundred emerged from the fortress and combined their powers with the elves' sorcerers to create a firestorm that destroyed most of the Amani army, including their ruler &lt;a href=\"Jintha\"&gt;Jintha&lt;/a&gt;. The surviving trolls fled and were easily defeated by the elves and humans, ending the war.\nAfter the Troll Wars, some humans migrated to Alterac Fortress and the smaller forts in the Eastweald and turned them into flourishing trading outposts.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt; presumably developed around the fortress. However, the fortress is described as having been located at the base of the mountain range, whereas the city is high in the mountains. Furthermore, their locations on maps do not line up exactly; while the city is in the west-central part of the mountains, the fortress is depicted as having been further to the northeast, loosely corresponding to the location of &lt;a href=\"Crushridge%20Hold\"&gt;Crushridge Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20Hollow\"&gt;Slaughter Hollow&lt;/a&gt; in \"World of Warcraft\"."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, generals of Arathor established the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the mountains, and the final and most decisive battle between the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the combined human and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; armies took place at the foot of the mountains. As Arathor began fracturing in the centuries after the Troll Wars, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; was established among the peaks and came to hold dominion over much of the northlands.\nSecond War.\nDuring the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; sent a contingent of &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s south to survey the supposed &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish threat for themselves. Shortly after passing through the Alterac Mountains the elves were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; troops and brought to a prison camp near &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, the treachery of the humans of Alterac was revealed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and an army was sent to the Alterac Mountains to strike the traitors at their heart. An Alteraci prison camp was also situated near &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt;, containing captured &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaranian&lt;/a&gt; citizens.\nAfter the end of the war, military outposts maintained by &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; were built along the borders of the Mountains. The question of what to do with the mountains led to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;heated debates&lt;/a&gt; within the Alliance. These military outposts were later raided by the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; back from the Alteraci.\nAt some point &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; at least partially annexed the Alterac Mountains. At the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, and its inhabitants considered him their lord, with the citizens also taking up arms for Lordaeron. A new resistance against them had appeared, however, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, led by former Alteraci prince &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; after he rose up in the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt; under the teachings of his new mentor &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nAt some point, the mountains were invaded by &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.

Though they regrouped after the Alliance's retribution for their attack on &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, they were thoroughly defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on its march to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.

Here, the orcs still controlled &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and were allied with &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nKel'Thuzad opened a portal for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; near Dalaran. After Archimonde was summoned he summoned a spell that destroyed Dalaran.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the area near Dalaran was a battlefield between the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.

The undead were led by the &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to use the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to raise dead beasts in the area, including &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"behemoth\"&gt;behemoth&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the years that followed, the ruins of the city of Alterac were claimed by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge%20clan\"&gt;Crushridge clan&lt;/a&gt;, led by warlord &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt;. What little &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; activity was left in the region was centered around the entrances to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, where the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the orcish &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; vie for supremacy.

Its fingers, originally controlled by the Syndicate, turned into &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; camps, were sabotaged by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde claimed the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Ruins of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, fortifying them as defensible base for their operations in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and to fight Alliance forces from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Alterac Mountains are high peaks rising up north of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and spreading to the border of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in the north and &lt;a href=\"The%20Hinterlands\"&gt;The Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; in the east. Covered with snow at their highest point, these mountains were once the location of some major human settlements. Now these settlements lie in ruins and are controlled by hostile forces. The mountains themselves are home to several kinds of high-altitude flora and fauna, such as yeti and mountain lions. The rare herb &lt;a href=\"Wintersbite\"&gt;Wintersbite&lt;/a&gt; was found here.\nThe mountains are surrounded by green lands having the &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Point\"&gt;Chillwind Point&lt;/a&gt; to the east and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; settlements of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nThe farmlands of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; were located in the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Alterac Mountains have traditionally been a home for the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The settlements were all bases of peaceful activity, and were in the beginning at peace with each other.\nOnce inhabited by noble &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, Alterac is a shattered realm struggling to survive the wars' carnage. An organization called the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; is strong in this region. They are a group of thieves who were once &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; nobles and now seek to reclaim their lands \u2014 and any other lands they can lay their hands on \u2014 by any means necessary. They battle for control with the huge &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s that has taken over &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHostile factions control the few settlements that remain in the mountains.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attempted to conscript some Alliance nobles to help them in their campaign, and the weak-willed nobles of Alterac readily agreed to help the orcs overthrow the Alliance leaders and take Lordaeron. With the defeat of the Horde came the punishment for these traitors: exile from their former holdings. These exiles would eventually form the Syndicate and take back the Alterac Mountains from the Alliance.\nLike all of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s regions, Alterac suffered horrendously when the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; blazed through the continent. The &lt;a href=\"Perenolde%20family\"&gt;Perenolde family&lt;/a&gt;'s current scion, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, is a high-ranking Syndicate member who &lt;a href=\"Dandred%27s%20Fold\"&gt;resides&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt;. The Syndicate struggles to regain control of this wild land, while ruins dot the mountainsides and Crushridge ogres patrol their territory.\nThe Syndicate kidnapped a wealthy &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; merchant's son and they didn't want ransom but help in driving the ogres from Alterac City. &lt;a href=\"Murrik%20Doubletoe\"&gt;Murrik Doubletoe&lt;/a&gt;, the captured dwarf's father, hired outside help to advise him and either rescue his son or defeat the ogres.\nPeople and culture.\nTwo major factions control the Alterac Mountains: the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; ogres. The Syndicate is a complicated network of bandits who were once Alterac nobles. These men and women operate mainly in the Alterac Mountains and the surrounding area, but fight, murder, lie and steal to reclaim their ancient lands. They are out for themselves, though it would work with others if doing so helped them meet its ultimate goal. Syndicate agents dress in brown and black when on the prowl, but don their aristocratic finery in their holds.\nThe Crushridge ogres are cunning, massive, and strong. Leftovers from the Second War, these ogres have thrown off orc rule for their own primitive ways. They live in Alterac City and kill whatever they can. The ogres and the Syndicate fight a continuous guerilla war.\nThe Syndicate's private war and the ogres' mindless slaughter are foolishness. Alterac shares its northern border with the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, so a Scourge invasion is only a matter of time. Such an attack would spur the Syndicate to battle against the undead, and the ogres would fight to stay alive. Their numbers, however, are too few.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; have taken a liking to the Alterac Mountains and defend them fiercely against the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s invading the area.\nGeography.\nThe Alterac Mountains are not only high and temperate but also cold and misty. Few fertile valleys lie within the peaks, and those that do are fallow. Rainfall is high and the sky is often overcast with gray clouds, making the region drear. The Crushridge ogres and the Syndicate have driven away most native wildlife, but &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s still inhabit the deeper caves. Alterac resembles &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, but warmer. Huge pine trees tower over the landscape and occasional green meadows and tenacious shrubs can be found amid the gray, rocky peaks.\nTo the south are the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, east is the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, west is &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; and north are the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. A magic field closes off &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, to the southwest. Its &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the local surroundings, but wisely do not concern themselves with Alterac's affairs.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; book \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; is labelled as part of the Alterac Mountains and Hillsbrad Foothills.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20tribe\"&gt;Winterax tribe&lt;/a&gt; dwell in the mountains and valleys of Alterac, and are hated foes of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs and both the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled ', much of the story takes place here. Along with familiar locations like the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;home of the Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac is home to snowy deciduous forests and an insolated &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish workshop&lt;/a&gt;. It is also inhabited by a number of species not found here in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" or ':"}

The central mountains have been overrun by &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, while the organization called the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; controls &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; and other areas. Dalaran was enclosed within an impregnable magic shell before the city was lifted in the air and moved to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. A high, wooded region, the Alterac Mountains see much rainfall and its skies are constantly overcast. Crushridge ogres and the Syndicate, a wicked group of rogues led by fallen human nobles, clash repeatedly for control of this land.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe ruins of the city of Alterac has since been claimed by a tribe of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and the majestic city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was annihilated by the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20war\"&gt;Third war&lt;/a&gt;. The Dalaran mages warred against the Forsaken while they rebuilt their city, only to move the city to Northrend via powerful magic. What little &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; activity is left in the region is centered around &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; and the entrances to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the orcish &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; vie for supremacy.\nGeography.\nThe Alterac Mountains are high peaks rising up north of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and spreading to the border of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; in the east. Covered with snow at their highest point, these mountains were once the location of three major human settlements. Now these settlements lie in ruins and are controlled by hostile forces. What remains of the third settlement, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;the city of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, is now a crater. The mountains themselves are home to several kinds of high-altitude flora and fauna, such as yeti, mountain lions and the rare herb &lt;a href=\"Wintersbite\"&gt;Wintersbite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no flight paths, dungeons or raid dungeons in the Alterac Mountains. However, the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a high level PvP &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;, lies within these mountains. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Ruins of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; are home to many ogres. They used to be elites until &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt; and the area was considered a &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe layout of the Alterac Mountains zone may be confusing. It is effectively divided into two subregions. Apart from the mountain pass leading to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Point\"&gt;Chillwind Point&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; at the north, the \"outer\" green zone encircling the actual mountains has no clear-cut borders, instead smoothly transiting into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. It is the outer zone that contains &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Chillwind Point, the Uplands, and the southern coast of &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"inner\" zone, containing the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Ruins of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, looks very different. It is a snowy highland region surrounded by mountains, sharply transiting into the outer zone outside Stratholme. A traveler entering the inner area by road from Hillsbrad Foothills may mistake it for the entire Alterac Mountains zone, making it seem much smaller than it actually is.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D14\"&gt;Topographic map of Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;\nBattlegrounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;: Both the Horde and Alliance entrances to Alterac Valley can be found in these mountains, just below the snow line.\nNotable characters.\nThe Alterac Mountains are home to several characters of note. At the entrance to Alterac Valley, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Haggerdin\"&gt;Lieutenant Haggerdin&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the Frost Wolves, and &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Laggrond\"&gt;Warmaster Laggrond&lt;/a&gt; has similarly declared war on the Stormpikes. At his manor, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; attempts to teach adventuring rogues the true skills of their trade. And at Dalaran, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers to the jungles of Stranglethorn in search of his missing daughter.\nQuests.\nBoth Alliance and Horde quests in the Alterac Mountains begin in the low 30s and continue into the low 40s. The quests, for the most part, come from &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; which border the mountains. For some reason, most of the Horde's Alterac Mountains quests are categorized as Hillsbrad Foothills, though the Alliance quests seem to be more properly categorized. Alterac is unique in the game in having no proper quest hub for either faction. For this reason, many of the quests obtained in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; send players north into the Alterac Mountains.\nWild creatures.\nThe Alterac Mountains are also home to &lt;a href=\"Narillasanz\"&gt;Narillasanz&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Frostwolves, however, chose to remain in the valley rather than joining Thrall in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and their relative peace has since been challenged by the arrival of the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Expedition\"&gt;Stormpike Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormpike Expedition\u2019s desire to mine and plumb the underexplored caves for relics has invited conflict with the Frostwolf Clan, but opinions are divided on who struck first. Were the dwarves who arrived in the valley peaceful explorers who were massacred by the orcs, or did they plan to poach and conquer?\"\nDescription.\n\"Hidden within the Alterac Mountains, Alterac Valley is the home of the Frostwolf clan. The Stormpike dwarves have established a foothold in the valley and seek to plumb its depths for riches and links to their ancestral past. A large-scale battleground, each side attempts to destroy each other's tower fortifications and slay the enemy General (Vanndar Stormpike or Drek'Thar).\"\nBesides its humanoid settlers, the valley is also home to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt; brought from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory and politics.\nLong ago, before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; exiled a clan of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s called the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, father of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;) to a hidden valley deep in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; for refusing to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. It is here in the valley's southern reaches that the Frostwolves eked out a living until the rise of Thrall's new Horde.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter Thrall's triumphant uniting of the clans, the Frostwolves, now led by the orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; Drek'Thar, chose to remain in the valley they had for so long called their home. In recent times, however, the relative peace of the Frostwolves has been challenged by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Expedition\"&gt;Stormpike Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stormpike Expedition have set up residence in the valley to search for natural resources and ancient titan relics. It is likely that they did not know of the Frostwolf orcs' connection to the area when choosing to visit the valley. Despite their intentions, the dwarven presence has sparked heated conflict with the Frostwolf orcs to the south, who have vowed to drive the interlopers from their lands. The Stormpike dwarves sent in an initial expedition, the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, to search for ancient relics of their past and mine for natural resources and were attacked (they felt) without provocation by the territorial Frostwolves.\nAdditionally, the Ironforge dwarves believe they have a right to the lands as well, and Magni Bronzebeard has issued a \"sovereign imperialistic imperative\" to the Stormpike Guard to take the land for the kingdom of Ironforge. Other connections to ancient dwarves (previously Earthen) are the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s that are found in the northern part of the valley.\nAt this point in time both factions (possibly even the troll faction as well) believe they have historical connections to the valleys and want to take them back. Note that the &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20tribe\"&gt;Winterax&lt;/a&gt; gave up on the valley and went to look for greener pastures.\nThe Shattering.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had been defeated, Drek'Thar was declared incapable of fighting any longer in Alterac Valley. The fighting in the Valley had been called to a temporary ceasefire in the aftermath of the Lich King's downfall as per a truce signed between the Horde and the Alliance.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; mobilizes from Alterac Valley to assail the Horde forces in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, setting up in areas around the entry way into the valley. &lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Balinda%20Stonehearth\"&gt;Captain Balinda Stonehearth&lt;/a&gt; come out from Alterac Valley several times to meet and organize with &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, though they are ultimately forced to retreat back to the Valley after the Horde intervenes at their various outposts.\n&lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; is shown to be enfeebled by this time, having to be wheeled out of the valley by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Galvangar\"&gt;Captain Galvangar&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; at the Horde's entrance to the valley. There, he refuses to allow the Frostwolf clan to aid with, what he considers, the dishonorable tactics of the Forsaken in Hillsbrad; and is shown returning to the valley.\nIn terms of the battleground, Alterac Valley appears not to have been updated to reflect recent lore developments since the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 most notably with &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and remains an active battleground.\nDragonflight.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, the valley has been peaceful and relatively quiet for several years.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt;, and their children visited &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Keep\"&gt;Frostwolf Keep&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Drek'Thar and discuss &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;'s future. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and an orc adventurer came to speak to Drek'Thar about bringing back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. Aggra suggested the creation of a new rite, the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, and after the adventurer proved themselves worthy of being the first to undergo the rite, they, Eitrigg, and Thrall's family returned to Kalimdor to prepare the Kosh'harg. Several of Alterac Valley's Frostwolves subsequently came to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to attend the festival.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nThe valleys of Alterac, in the context of where the Frostwolves were in \"\", were referred to as the \"Frostwolf Settlement\". The region was also known as the \"Dwarf Highlands\" in interviews, and as the \"&lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;Northlands&lt;/a&gt;\" in design docs.\nThe region was home to &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Town&lt;/a&gt; and featured &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"squirrel\"&gt;squirrel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20beast\"&gt;snow beast&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt;. Some hot springs could also be found in a sealed cave containing the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Durotan\"&gt;Axe of Durotan&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntry to the valley.\nAlterac Valley has its own entrances in the game world, found in northern &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance entrance is due north of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, while the Horde entrance is north-east of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. However, as with all battlegrounds, players can also queue for Alterac Valley through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;. Players can queue for Alterac Valley from level 45.\nFaction viewpoints.\nAlliance viewpoints.\n&lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; has been given orders from Ironforge against making peace with the orcs, and appears to agree with the orders. He dismisses the orcs as \"savages trying to halt Ironforge's sovereign imperialistic imperative\". He wants to slaughter all orcs including Drek'Thar, believing that when the General falls, the land will finally turn over to its rightful owner, \"Ironforge\". See also, Vanndar's book .\n&lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Rotimer\"&gt;Lieutenant Rotimer&lt;/a&gt; clarifies that the \"sovereign imperative\" originates from Ironforge, and was issued by King Magni Bronzebeard. He claims that they are fighting a brutal battle in the valleys of Alterac. The cannibalistic Winterax trolls attack them from one side and the savage Frostwolf Clan from the other. He believes both must be exterminated in the name of King Magni Bronzebeard. \"The taking, culling, and turning of that land is a sovereign and territorial imperative to the kingdom of Ironforge.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Wing%20Commander%20Ichman\"&gt;Wing Commander Ichman&lt;/a&gt;, said he had spent three years in the hell hole. Three years as a prisoner of war to who he believed were \"damnable Frostwolf Clan\". He believes he was made to sit in their tower and listen to them endlessly whine about the bridge to Dun Baldar. About how \"unfair\" the war was... even if \"War isn't fair!\". This is a humorous reference to player complaints about how the Dun Baldar bridge is a 'choke point'.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Brigadier%20General\"&gt;Alliance Brigadier General&lt;/a&gt;s believe that the Horde was quite right when they said that Alterac Valley is Frostwolf Territory, it was never Ironforge territory. They claim that Stormpike Expedition arrived as peaceful visitors to the area in search of ore and relics. They believe that the Frostwolves reacted with the most brutal and uncivilized act of aggression the Alliance has experienced. They never want to forget the brave dwarves that perished in that \"cowardly unannounced attack\".\nProspect Stonehewer lets it slip that he recently plundered a few treasures. It is likely from the Frostwolf clan as they offer the same reward and the weapons all have an ice theme. It may also be from the Winterax trolls.\nHorde viewpoints.\nDrek'Thar sees the valley as Frostwolf territory and that the Stormpike Expedition has no right to take their land away. He has no intention of making peace with the Stormpike, instead wishing to execute them all to the last man (Vanndar himself) following the Rules of military conduct. He believes that the Stormpike have copied the Frostwolves' defense plans and knows exactly how the Frostwolves' own forces are set up, although Vanndar would claim otherwise (this is likely a reference to the gameplay balancing of the battleground). Drek'Thar wants players to ask Vanndar to surrender (likely knowing that he would refuse), and orders his forces execute him whatever the response.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Warbringer\"&gt;Horde Warbringer&lt;/a&gt;s, claim that despite what others might have heard, that the truth is that \"the Stormpike Expedition invaded Frostwolf Territory\". They believe that the day the Horde allows the Alliance to invade Horde lands without a forceful response is the day they will hang up their axes and live the rest of their lives in shame.\n&lt;a href=\"Ravak%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Ravak Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the war-zone by the Elder Crone to research the other races. More specifically, he was to collect gnome samples. Magatha was primarily interested in their survivability. They believed, that the gnomes \u2014 while pitifully weak and minuscule \u2014 exuded great resilience both in and out of combat.\nThe Wing Commanders of the Frostwolf Clan wanted hundreds of pounds of flesh from the Stormpike soldiers, lieutenants, and others to feed to their fleet of War Riders. They wanted the riders to consume their enemy.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Louis%20Philips\"&gt;Commander Louis Philips&lt;/a&gt; believes his brother is undoubtedly the most dangerous of the four Stormpike commanders. He believes that, perhaps if he is slain, the Banshee Queen could make his brother what she made of him, and show him the error of his ways...\nBattleground overview.\nWith up to 40 players on each team in this battleground, Alterac Valley is one of the largest battlegrounds available. Until the inclusion of Isle of Conquest, it was the only battleground to allow such large numbers of players.\nPrimary objectives.\nThe goal of Alterac Valley is to reduce the opposing faction's reinforcement count to 0. Each team starts with 700 reinforcements. There are a number of ways to reduce reinforcements, named below, but killing the enemy General does it instantly.\nSecondary objectives.\nThe primary bases are &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Baldar\"&gt;Dun Baldar&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Village&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde.\nFor information relating to balance issues in Alterac Valley, please see &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%20Tactical%20Overview\"&gt;Alterac Valley Tactical Overview&lt;/a&gt;.\nNPC officers.\nEach side in the Valley has one General and one Captain.\nThe Generals, and , stay inside their faction fortresses at the far north and south ends of the map. When a General is killed, the match is over. Generals are tough, raid-level bosses; and typically require coordinated tanking and DPS to take down. If a General is drawn out of his fortress, his health will reset to full.\nGenerals are guarded by several Marshals (Alliance) or Warmasters (Horde), and they cannot be pulled separately. Each general starts with four, but each one is linked to one of the four towers and dies when the tower is destroyed. Each Warmaster and Marshall adds a stackable buff that increases damage and health by 25%, so the general begins with +144% health and +144% damage, which makes him very difficult to kill without any towers destroyed.\nThe Captains, and , stay inside the more central bunkers of Stonehearth Outpost and Iceblood Garrison. As long as these captains are alive, they will periodically grant a 20% health buff and a size increase to all members of their faction. They are fairly tough bosses that can be taken down by a skilled 5-man group. \nIn addition, both factions have a number of non-elite NPCs that assist their side. These NPCs spawn at all graveyards and towers, and a small number of road patrols. When a graveyard is captured by a faction, the NPC guards for the graveyard spawn immediately. NPC players in AV can be buffed, healed, bandaged, and many other spell effects apply to them, like paladin auras or the AoE buff of Battle Standards.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, the number of NPCs was severely reduced. On some servers, this has led to a strategy that is known as \"the race\" or \"the zerg\". In this strategy, both sides bypass the main enemy group and rush the graveyard nearest the enemy base, quickly clear the two bunkers in the base, pull the Marshals, and then pull the General. Each side may also kill the opposing captain and claim a mine or easy Graveyard on the way, but the goal is still to rush the General without directly engaging players of the opposing faction. This leads to a faster-paced game which can be easily won or easily lost, providing more honor per hour than protracted games with the same win rate. \nThe safest route is to leave some defenders to at least slow the opposing team's attack, but to still maintain an overpowering offense; to give up some ground, but not too much. The way some do it is to run most of a faction as fast as possible to the enemy base and then some of the team will use their recall to go on the defense team and slow the progress of the enemy. This provides enough time to let one side win while the other is held up by the defense.\nSimple guide.\nIf you've just visited Alterac Valley (AV) a few times, and quickly want to know what's going on, here's a short and simple overview. \nGoal.\nThe goal in AV is to reduce the opposing faction's reinforcement count to 0. The most direct way to do this is to kill the enemy general, which will immediately drain all reinforcement points from the enemy and end the round. Other activities which reduce reinforcement points include killing enemy players, capturing towers/bunkers, and killing the enemy captain.\nThe two generals are raid-level bosses that can be found in their fortresses at the two ends of the map \u2014 Vanndar Stormpike (\"Vann\") for the Alliance north, Drek'Thar (\"Drek\") for the Horde south. A rather elaborate system of NPCs, fortifications and graveyards fills the map between the generals. The general is accompanied by guards, who will disappear as towers are destroyed. The General alone is relatively easy for 10 players, the General with one guard is much harder, with 2 guards is very difficult, and with 3 or 4 is nigh impossible even for a whole team.\nBoth sides can do quests to improve themselves and their NPCs, and spend quite some time capturing mines etc, but usually that's not done. It is far more efficient (considering reputation and honor gain) to just rush the enemy buildings and burn them ASAP, and then kill the enemy general.\nRush game.\nA \"Rush\" game is the most effective way of battling in Alterac Valley, because it ends the fight quickly, which means more bonus honor. It is however also one of the hardest to master. One of the main focus points in a rush game, is not to have any defense, but to push as many people possible to the last two graveyards, and thereby preparing for the vital takedown of Drek/Vann, while bunkers/towers are being captured simultaneously. The key to succeeding a \u201crush\u201d game, is to proceed efficiently, only sending as many as necessary to capture and guard the first two towers and eliminate Balinda/Galvangar, while the rest rush forward to capture all objectives as quickly as possible.\nOffensive game.\nIn offensive games, a strong emphasis is put on offense. Usually at least 30 people will take part in the attack, and at most 10 will try to delay the enemy. The defense needs to be aware that they do fight a losing battle, nevertheless it's usually the quality of the defense which decides the final outcome of the battle.\nTurtling.\nThe name given to a defensive game. A \"turtle\" can happen either because the team planned it, or because all of their forward graveyards were lost and their entire team resurrects on defense. If planned then the typical Horde strategy is to send defenders to Iceblood Tower and the small one-way chokepoint that provides access to Iceblood Graveyard which prevents any Alliance players from racing to the Frostwolf Relief Hut. If unplanned the horde tend to fall back to hold the towers at Frostwolf Relief Hut. The Alliance have effective chokepoints at Stonepike Graveyard and the bridge to Dun Baldar. The key to the defensive game is keeping your casualties to a minimum, allowing you to win the game by reinforcements. Defensive games take a long time and give minimal bonus honor in the event of a loss, making them an unpopular and usually last resort strategy.\nHorde.\nThree graveyards are usually taken \u2014 Stonehearth, Stormpike and the Aid Station. Stonehearth GY is usually skipped by the players that rush to Dun Baldar, as Stormpike is important for those that want to stay on the offense.\nAlthough it seems there's a narrow passage through which all Horde forces must pass to reach Stormpike, advanced players will know that there are several approaches to the graveyard flag. Horde can go up the mountain to the right when approaching the choke then circle around near the mine or come down the cliffs above the graveyard. Horde can also come under the Dun Baldar bridge. The Alliance defense usually focuses on Stormpike, and it is not an unknown occurrence that Horde completely fails to take it. If Stormpike GY has been taken, the Ally forces will defend the bridge next, which is a choke-point that supposedly cannot be bypassed. However, there are reports that some horde have discovered a way to climb the cliffs to the south of Dun Baldar and enter the base that way.\nThe main choke point for defense is the opening in the fence between the Frostwolf towers. A secondary choke point happens at the fence area between Iceblood and Tower Point. When Alliance tries to defend Iceblood GY, they'll position themselves between the flag and the fence. If Tower Point is destroyed or the Relief Hut has been captured, it is clearly a \"turtle game\" if the Horde continues to choke at this secondary point. Those on defense that want the extra PVP honor will fallback to the main choke point and avoid turtle games. Advanced defensive players will first position themselves in Iceblood Garrison and will fallback to the main choke point once Galvangar is down.\nThe Relief Hut is bit easier for the Alliance to capture than for the Horde to capture the Aid Station. The position of the Relief Hut makes it easier for the Alliance to avoid aggro on other Horde NPCs besides the flag guards. The Aid Station is more open and closer to nearby NPCs, which makes them within pull/train/pet range. It is better for the horde to fallback to the main choke early and defend the Relief Hut rather than the open area of Frostwolf Graveyard &amp; flag.\nBefore the Horde entrance was moved south, it was common for the Horde to rush an offensive game with little to no defense and often win, the race. The movement of the entrance gave the Alliance an extra 10\u201320 seconds to maneuver uninterrupted on the field. so now the Horde barely gets in the door of Iceblood Garrison at the same time the Alliance shows up right outside it. At the same time, the offensive Horde players that went straight to Balinda have barely entered the field of strife and have another 10 seconds till they reach Stonehearth Outpost. Obviously, Horde will lose their Captain's buff faster than the Alliance if there is no defense at Iceblood. Offensive players that go straight to the Aid station are also at a disadvantage compared to Alliance that go straight to the Relief Hut. The Horde players have to traverse the narrow road with higher chance of being interrupted by the Alliance than the Alliance do while they run through the open area of Frostwolf fields. The Alliance can travel much straighter and more efficient route from the Frostwolf field to the Relief Hut, while the Horde has to run to Stormpike Graveyard, on one side of the map, and then across the map again to get to the Aid Station.\nIt is not uncommon to see players encourage no defense at all on the Horde side, which will make it quick for the Alliance to gain bonus honor. Those that encourage this say it is to avoid turtle games, but a turtle game can be easily avoided when the defense falls back early to the main choke-point where all Horde players on defense can easily pick up honor kills. Others that encourage no defense also claim that it is good game if all towers have been destroyed. Claiming that the honor gained is worth the loss to the offensive race. However, you may notice that the people who made the claim rush the Aid Station and will wait there while all towers get destroyed, there by gaining easy honor for doing very little. That is also a sure way to lose, as with no defense in the Horde base is a guarantees the Frostwolf towers to be quickly lost, which means a quicker win for Alliance. One can easily suspect that the people that encourage the no defense on Horde plays are there to help the Alliance win. If you see players encourage no defense, ask them \"if the raid will run into no Alliance defenses when raid crosses the Dun Baldar Bridge.\" To compensate for the extra 10 second head-start the Alliance has on Galvangar, some may merely encourage no defense get extra people Balinda to get her down fast. If you do an all-out offensive start like this, be sure to have the extras immediately recall to base to defend main choke once Balinda is down.\nAlliance.\nThe four important graveyards are Snowfall, Iceblood, Frostwolf and the Relief Hut. The Alliance often does not defend Stonehearth and so the Alliance caps Snowfall at about the same time as the Horde caps Stonehearth. A danger of this strategy is that if the Horde assault Snowfall before the Alliance has capped it, the Alliance have only Stormpike to resurrect in. When the Horde assault Snowfall while they also hold Stonehearth the Alliance is often forced into a turtle at Stormpike. The best way to counter this is by camping Balinda the next round or try to predict if the Horde will do it and just camp Balinda until either the Horde get tired of being ganked at Balinda's or they will give up Snowfall Graveyard. If either one of these happen you can contiune without holding Balinda. However holding Balinda gives you 150 honor to the alliance at level 80 and another 150 honor per each blue tower at the end of battle. However, often Alliance does not cap Frost Wolf Graveyard in order to force Horde players running back to defend to respawn farther away from the assaulting force. Additionally, Alliance usually does not defend Stonehearth Graveyard because it forces the Horde to respawn in an offensive position if they are not closer to a more southern graveyard, forcing the Horde respawns to travel back in order to defend (or AV-hearth from trinket).\nAbout half of the Alliance raid will ride to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Galvangar\"&gt;Galvangar&lt;/a&gt; (Iceblood Garrison) while the remaining half of the group will break off and ride directly to the Relief Hut and capture the Relief Hut graveyard and then work on the Relief Hut towers. After Galvangar is killed, the raid continues and captures Iceblood Tower, Iceblood Graveyard and Tower Point. If the Horde are defending the choke point just before Iceblood Graveyard, the Alliance will stay mounted and ride past them to either Frostwolf Graveyard or the Relief Hut. The danger of fighting at the choke point is that the Alliance do not yet control a forward Graveyard, so if you die you will end up back at Stormpike Graveyard. A common mistake that groups will make is fighting the Horde defense at each successive Graveyard. If they are defending Iceblood and you fight them and capture the Graveyard, then the Horde defense is at Frostwolf Graveyard and you'll have to fight them again. It is important to capture the Relief Hut first to avoid having to fight a moving wave of Horde defense. \nOn the final assault on Frostwolf Keep, the Alliance captures the Frostwolf Relief Hut and 2 more towers. They normally wait until the Relief Hut is fully captured and the 4 towers are burned before attacking Drek'Thar. Note: Drek is worth 83 honor and each tower is worth 62 honor. But, always keep an eye on the Batttleground map and look at your Defense back up at Dun Baldar. If your defense is gone along with your towers and graveyards you can bet that the Horde are already attacking Vanndar. Waiting for towers to cap while not keeping an eye on what is going on up North will cost you a win and give you less honor.\nIf any mob near Drek is pulled, all mobs and Drek come along. All of the mobs in Drek's room are linked, which means if any of them are kited or feared outside then Drek will reset to 100% health. Then, Drek'Thar is finally attacked. Due to the proximity of the AV entrance cave for Horde, Iceblood graveyard and Frostwolf graveyard are both often recaptured.\nAn effective strategy is to send one or more Alliance directly to the Frostwolf camp or Relief hut (stealth classes excel in \"ninjaing\" these graveyards as long as they can take down the guards, usually with Area-of-Effect attacks), bypassing all other objectives. This advance team prepares the way for the main offensive by capturing the East and West Frostwolf Towers and the Frostwolf Relief Hut. Speed is an essential quality to a winning strategy. It takes 4 minutes to capture a Graveyard or burn a Tower, so it is best to do as many of these things in parallel as possible, but it is important to balance this with defending each of the Towers.\nThe Alliance can also use priests to defend the Dun Baldar Bridge, by Mind Controlling any Horde that attack and running them off the bridge.\nWhen the Horde are playing a defensive game, it is common for Alliance players to try to rush south, but doing this often gets them killed. Instead, Alliance players should defend Stonehearth or push Iceblood Graveyard, kill the Horde healers, and try to ninja the Iceblood Graveyard flag while the Horde are fighting at the chokepoint.\nFrostwolf towers and Dun Baldar bunkers.\nFor horde, a typical base defense strategy is for hunters to place freezing traps on the ramp by the Frostwolf towers to slow the Alliance and while the NPC archers and horde AOE and ranged attacks cut them down as they come up the steep ramp. Horde also often kite Alliance pets or players into Drek's keep to aggro warmasters and Drek's wolves into the battle. Horde can also try to aggro the wing commanders into the battle as they stand nearby. Horde often run into Drek's keep for cover and to heal.\nFor alliance, the strategy is similar in that hunter freezing traps and AOE and ranged attacks on the Dun Baldar bridge are effective. The NPC archers in the bunkers aid greatly in the fight. However, the horde often send a stealthed rogue or druid into the bunkers to kill or despawn the archers ahead of the main horde offense. Due to a bug, the archers often despawn when the bunker is assaulted. To protect the archers, a hunter can keep freezing traps and flares on the bridge to prevent stealthers from getting in the base ahead of the horde offense. Kiting horde pets or players back to the druids up the path by the North bunker may draw the druids into the battle. Fleeing to the druids may also serve as a sanctuary for Alliance players to heal. The several NPCs in Dun Baldar help to slow the horde advance.\nPersonal quests.\nThere are a number of quests that can be completed in Alterac Valley for reputation and rewards. They are broadly identical for Horde and Alliance, so they will be described in general terms here. These quests provide rewards, such as gold, to a character, but the rewards will not affect the outcome of a battle and are taken from, and turned in to, quest-givers located outside the instance. Other \"Battle Quests\" are available from quest-givers located inside the instance and formerly would have been part of viable strategies for winning the battle. Those quests are described near the end of this article and are of only historical interest now.\nReputation.\nAs you fight in Alterac Valley, you earn reputation with either the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. There are two vendors for each faction; one inside Alterac Valley and one outside in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. For the Alliance, the NPC within the battleground that sells vendor rewards is in the Dun Baldar South Bunker.\nNote that in Alterac Valley all reputation with the Frostwolf Clan and the Stormpike is shared amongst \"all combatants\", whether or not they are partied with you. However some turn-ins will give reputation with one of the four main primary factions. This faction reputation is not shared.\nStormpike/Frostwolf reputation is gained in the following ways:\nRepeatable reputation quests\nAt the end of the game, extra rep is gained for each of the following conditions:\nFaction rewards.\nAlterac Valley items are available by spending honor. Though some of the Frostwolf and Stormpike factions items have different names and artwork, their bonuses and equip effects are identical. Unlike those from &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, Alterac Valley rewards are not available for upgrades. Most rewards require level 55 or 60.\nExperience in AV.\nAll battlegrounds award experience when the team completes objectives. Experience gains are percentages based on the total experience needed to level for a player. The following figures assume you wear all possible heirlooms that give experience bonus (chest and shoulders).\nIt is thus possible to gain 5.76% of a level from one match just by winning, up to 8.16% for a win with all towers still up and 9.06% for additionally rescuing all the wing commanders.\nIt will take 18 wins to complete a level, or 22 losses, assuming your team destroys the four towers, and loses your four towers and kills Galvangar or Balinda.\nOther sources.\nA relatively small amount of XP is also earnt by killing mobs in AV, modified depending on the distance of other same-faction players. Closer leads to less XP gain, farther leads to greater.\nBattle quests.\nIn addition to the personal quests mentioned earlier, there are a number of \"battle\" quests associated with the instance. Unlike the \"personal\" quests mentioned earlier, these quests are accepted and completed while within the instance and, except for some initial quests, these quests are infinitely repeatable. In addition to the reputation provided, these \"battle\" quests were often worth completing in the past because NPCs can be upgraded or additional NPCs can be summoned once enough players complete these \"battle\" quests suffient numbers of times. The NPCs involved often were enough to turn the tide of a battle. However, since it is time consuming to complete the quests, the quests were worth completing only when the battles would last several hours or even days, as was originally the case. It is very unusual for anyone to bother with these quests anymore.\nUnit Upgrades.\nYou can complete a collection quest to upgrade some of your stationary troops. Players, officers, and roaming, mine and tower units are exempt from this bonus. Upgrading troops through armor scrap turn-ins will also result in your team's General enabling a periodic buff to your melee and spell damage. This buff scales from 10% at the Seasoned unit level, 20% at the Veteran unit level, and 30% at the Champion unit level.\nBoth Alliance and Horde players gather armor scraps from the corpses of enemy players and guards. As armor is gathered, boxes of supplies visibly build up next to the forge. Once enough supplies are gathered, a person with high reputation can instruct the smith to upgrade units to the next level. The friendly troops will now be much more powerful. \nGround Assault.\nTo start a ground assault you must gather supplies. In order to retrieve the supplies, you must gain control of the mine either &lt;a href=\"Irondeep%20Mine\"&gt;Irondeep Mine&lt;/a&gt; (north) or &lt;a href=\"Coldtooth%20Mine\"&gt;Coldtooth Mine&lt;/a&gt; (south). To gain control of the mine, a player must defeat the boss residing in that mine (all mobs are non-elite and are aprox lvl 52/62/72 respectively).\nOnce you have control over a mine the miners will start generating supplies for you to return to your base. You must have the respective quest in order to pick up &lt;a href=\"Coldtooth%20Supplies\"&gt;Coldtooth Supplies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Irondeep%20Supplies\"&gt;Irondeep Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. If you speak with the Quartermaster, you'll be informed of the number of supplies needed for the ground assault to begin; as more supplies are collected, the pile nearby the Quartermaster will grow.\nAfter all the materials are gathered, a player with or higher reputation can direct the Quartermaster to launch a ground assault - which will spawn a group of elite NPCs that will move forward through the zone attacking enemy players and NPCs. Additional commands must be given (by clicking on them, provided your reputation is high enough) to send them further in to attack. After the attack is over, there is a period of waiting before you can order another charge.\nCavalry Assault.\nYou can create and command cavalry provided you complete the requisite quests found in your base's stables. Initially, players must capture rams or wolves by taming them using the tools they are given by the Stable Master ( &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Training%20Collar\"&gt;Stormpike Training Collar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Muzzle\"&gt;Frostwolf Muzzle&lt;/a&gt;). These tools are fragile and will break after one attempted use (successful or unsuccessful), after dying or when leaving the battleground. After the stables are full, a message will be broadcast across the valley. Players must also collect pelts from the opposing side's wild mounts: Horde must slay &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Ram\"&gt;Alterac Ram&lt;/a&gt;s and the Alliance must hunt the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wolf%20%28Alterac%20Valley%29\"&gt;Frost Wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter all the necessary components have been gathered, a player with high or higher reputation must give the command for the cavalry to ride. Additional commands must be given (by clicking on them, provided your reputation is high enough) to send them further in to attack. After the attack is over, there is a period of waiting before you can order another charge.\nUltimate Unit.\n and , located inside the faction fortresses, will accept &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Crystal\"&gt;Storm Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Soldier%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Stormpike Soldier's Blood&lt;/a&gt;, which are dropped by fallen characters of the opposite faction. When enough of these items are turned in, the Druid or Primalist will move through the valley, accompanied by a group of elite guards, until they reach the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt;. Primalist will go to the area south of &lt;a href=\"Snowfall%20Graveyard\"&gt;Snowfall Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; and north of &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Garrison\"&gt;Iceblood Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and Archdruid Renferal will go to the area west of &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Bunker\"&gt;Stonehearth Bunker&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonehearth Outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey will then start a summoning ritual, which requires ten players to click on their summoning circle. When this summoning is complete, &lt;a href=\"Ivus%20the%20Forest%20Lord\"&gt;Ivus the Forest Lord&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Lokholar the Ice Lord&lt;/a&gt; will be summoned. These are tough raid-level bosses. They will spend some time on the Field of Strife killing whatever they see, and will then start to move towards the enemy base. These bosses are, unfortunately, plagued by evade bugs and are fairly simple to train into areas where they can easily be killed. The standard Horde strategy is to train Ivus to the entry tunnel and to kill him there. But if they are guarded carefully, they can easily turn the battle and end the match.\nAerial Assault.\nThrough rescuing lost Wing Commanders and completing a series of quests, you can gain the ability to summon aerial units that patrol from your base to the center of the valley. Alliance and Horde players gather three different items. Each item can be turned-in to a specific Wing Commander once they have been rescued. After you have brought the requisite number of the particular items needed, players of or higher faction reputation can receive a beacon to place on the map. The beacon, once placed, orders an air strike that lasts for a time. If the wing commanders are not rescued, you will be unable to turn in the items needed. These particular items will disappear if you leave the battleground.\nOnce you have rescued the appropriate Wing Commanders and turned in the required number of medals or amount of meat, you have two options for each flight (assuming you have the required &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt; reputation level.)\nPlacing A Beacon.\nYou can request a beacon from any of the Wing Commanders that must then be planted on the battleground. (All beacons share a 30 minute cooldown before you can deploy another. If you want to have multiple beacons deployed, other players must deploy them.) The beacon takes 60 seconds to arm, during which it can be disabled by the opposing faction. When the beacon arms, it will summon an &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Gryphon\"&gt;Aerie Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"War%20Rider\"&gt;War Rider&lt;/a&gt; to patrol the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt; and alert nearby ground troops there when they spot the enemy.\nOrdering A Strike.\nThis will launch the Wing Commander by air to assault the enemy's base. Each Wing Commander will leave to patrol a specific area of the enemy base, and support ground troops there. Since the wing commander leaves the base to lead the attack when you order a strike, you can not pickup a beacon afterwards (if you have not already done so).\nAV battle quest summary.\nNote: Once you order a strike, you will not be able to pick up that wingman's beacon - it's best to pick up the beacon 1st before ordering an aerial strike.\nDevelopment.\nAlterace Valley was one of the first two battlegrounds to be added to the game, along with &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"patch%201.5.0\"&gt;patch 1.5.0&lt;/a&gt; in June 2005.\nAlterac Valley was originally conceived as a persistent non-instanced zone. Quests and NPCs were added in order to give players things to do when no players from the opposite faction were around. When the battleground became instanced, the original design persisted, including quests that took players away from the main battle and NPCs with a good chance of killing players. \nOver time, many of the non-PvP focused elements have been scaled down or removed altogether. Other changes include adjustments to the zone's starting areas and bases to even balance between factions, and the introduction of the reinforcements resource mechanic, turning the matches from unlimited battles that often raged for hours or days at a time, to far shorter and more manageable matches.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\n is a three-lane battleground in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" where the Alliance and the Horde fight for control of the territory.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Killing the General ended the game. In patch 2.3, it is also possible to win without killing the General by reducing the enemy reinforcement count to zero. \nThe Alliance General is &lt;a href=\"Vanndar%20Stormpike\"&gt;Vanndar Stormpike&lt;/a&gt;. He is located in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Baldar\"&gt;Dun Baldar&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde General is &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;. He is located in &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Keep\"&gt;Frostwolf Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Generals must be killed inside their keep. If they are &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d outside they will &lt;a href=\"leash\"&gt;leash&lt;/a&gt; back inside. Note that Drek'Thar is guarded by two elite wolves, Duros &amp; Drakan, which are dangerous opponents in their own right. Duros &amp; Drakan re-spawn when Drek'Thar does so they often have to be killed many times.\nBoth Generals are guarded by several powerful NPCs: Up to four Warmasters guard Drek'Thar and up to four Marshals guard Vanndar. Both types have very powerful melee attacks, including a cleave effect. These mobs can be kited outside the keep in which they reside, and indeed must be (preferably one at a time) in order to kill them without the interference of the enemy General. Poorly managed pulling of Marshals/Warmasters can often cost one side the game.\nBoth the Generals, wolves, and Warmasters/Marshals can be buffed and/or healed by players of the same team. When defending against the opposing team it can often be advantageous to assist these NPCs, because if the entire attacking group is defeated they will reset to full health.\nCaptains.\nHorde.\nThere are 2 Captains in Alterac Valley, one for each side. The Captains periodically buff all &lt;a href=\"Player%20Character\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; allies in Alterac Valley with a size increase and a 20% HP buff. If your captain dies, this periodic buff is disabled, and troops that normally spawn around the Captain cease to spawn. Also, the opposing side will receive more buffs providing their Captain is still alive. \nAfter patch 2.3, the Captains became much more important. When one side's captain dies, that same side now loses a large number of reinforcements. A Captain's death is also worth more bonus honor than before.\nThe Alliance Captain is &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Balinda%20Stonehearth\"&gt;Balinda Stonehearth&lt;/a&gt; who resides in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%23Stone%20Hearth%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonehearth Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde Captain is &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Galvangar\"&gt;Galvangar&lt;/a&gt; who resides in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%23Iceblood%20Garrison\"&gt;Iceblood Garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Lords.\nHorde.\nBoth the Alliance and the Horde have the capability of summoning very powerful NPCs with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Arch%20Druid%20Renferal\"&gt;Arch Druid Renferal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Druids of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; (for the Alliance), or &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Thurloga\"&gt;Primalist Thurloga&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Shaman%20%28Alterac%20Valley%29\"&gt;Frostwolf Shaman&lt;/a&gt; (for the Horde). The Alliance can summon &lt;a href=\"Ivus%20the%20Forest%20Lord\"&gt;Ivus the Forest Lord&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde can summon &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Lokholar the Ice Lord&lt;/a&gt;. These are monstrous elites that require virtually the entire raid to destroy. Moreover they can be healed and buffed by aligned &lt;a href=\"Player%20Character\"&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt;. The Elemental Lords were typically killed by &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt; them to one's General and letting him kill the Lord; however, as of patch 1.11 no NPCs will attack either lord.\nWing Commanders.\nHorde.\nEach side has three Wing Commanders who start the game captured by the opposing faction, and must be rescued. If they survive the run across the map to their home base, they will accept turn-ins of medals/flesh, eventually enabling an air strike on the opposing team. (Easter Egg: The Wing Commanders all have similar names to pilots from the movie \"Top Gun\".)\nGuards.\nGuards are a plentiful and powerful force in Alterac Valley. At the start of the match they are level 55; however, they hit much harder than a standard level 55 mob, but their health is about the same. Guards become more powerful as their side turns in more and more Armor Scraps.\nRemoved NPCs.\nCommanders.\nHorde.\nCommanders were removed in patch 2.3. Commanders were often located in towers or bunkers. They were more powerful than lieutenants, and also had an aura called the \"Grip of Command\" which gave 15 health and 10 mana per second. Killing a Commander disabled some troops from re-spawning. Some of the commanders can now be found in &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20NPCs\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;.\nLieutenants.\nHorde.\nLieutenants were removed in patch 2.3. Pre-2.3, lieutenants were scattered about the respective sides of each faction. There were six on each side. They usually guarded key structures. They also provided an 8 health and 10 mana per second buff to allies within proximity. For details on each lieutenant, use the links below. Some of the lieutenants can now be found in &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp%20NPCs\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each side has 4 of these buildings, and 3 house an enemy &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%23Wing%20Commander%20Quests\"&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/a&gt;. 2 of the 4 house a &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%23Commanders\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt;. These towers have ranged attackers posted inside them that shoot enemies outside the structure. Towers and Bunkers can be destroyed if an enemy player captures the &lt;a href=\"flag\"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; inside. This will prevent the ranged fighters from attacking and allows an opportunity to save your &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley%23Wing%20Commander%20Quests\"&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/a&gt;. Once a flag is &lt;a href=\"cap\"&gt;cap&lt;/a&gt;ped it must be held for 4 minutes before the Bunker/Tower is destroyed. Once a tower is destroyed, it is gone for the rest of the battle. (Changed from 5 minutes in Patch 2.3) Moreover, when you destroy a tower, a Warmaster/Marshal will spawn in your General's room, and a Warmaster/Marshal will disappear from your enemy General's room. These NPCs are very powerful and will greatly delay the offense of the opposing team.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcements were added. Destroying Bunkers and Towers will decrease the opponent's reinforcement count by 75 reinforcements.\nAlliance Bunkers:\nHorde Bunkers:\nGraveyards.\nGraveyards are where dead &lt;a href=\"Player%20Character\"&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; resurrect upon death. If you die in Alterac Valley you will resurrect at the closest graveyard that your side controls. Capturing graveyards is therefore a critical part in the Alterac Valley assault because it allows &lt;a href=\"Player%20Character\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements to arrive much more speedily. After capping the Graveyard &lt;a href=\"flag\"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; it takes exactly 4 minutes (As of Patch 2.3) for the Graveyard to cede control to your side\nBy capturing a graveyard you change the resurrection location to that new graveyard. PCs resurrect at the closest graveyard. When a graveyard is under control, it is protected by 4 troops. At the start many of your Graveyards are protected by Lieutenants and Commanders. There are 7 Graveyards in total:\nMines.\nThere are 2 mines in Alterac Valley: Coldtooth Mine and Irondeep Mine. At the beginning of the battle, each Mine has a complement of humanoid NPCs, and one named NPC. If the named NPC is killed by your faction, the mine will flood with aligned troops and will cede control to your side.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.11\"&gt;Patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt; Mines have become significantly easier for individuals to capture, and many classes can easily solo each mine. Most groups in each mine are linked three pulls, with two workers and either a caster or melee overseer. Each individual within these groups has around 1000 to 1200 hitpoints and are easily brought down. Some of the alcoves house larger numbers of NPCs, either four or five, and there is a patrolling route of five NPCs throughout both mines. The named leader inside both mines, regardless of alignment, is no longer elite, and can usually be killed single-handedly, allowing control to switch over. As a result, mines have become largely insignificant in Alterac Valley, due to the change in pacing of each game and how easily gained and lost they become, and can sometimes be ignored throughout an entire game.\nMining supplies inside the mine can be looted and returned to base, provided you have the corresponding quest.\nAfter a mine is taken, your troops will begin to spawn wiping out the mine of neutral NPCs.\nAfter taking a mine, the original enemy mine boss will eventually respawn to try and retake the mine. Be sure to kill this boss when he respawns and you will continually have access to the mine.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of reinforcements, mines will grant 1 reinforcement every 45 seconds. If your faction controls both mines, you will gain 2 reinforcements every 45 seconds.\nIrondeep Mine.\nStore supplies for mining quest.

Guarded by kobolds.\nNote: The kobolds have an annoying fire damage aura that can knock you out of stealth, take care in sneaking around the mine, fire resist gear can help. Kobolds, unlike Troggs, will run and can bring friends if not killed quickly. Also, despite being very easy to kill, they can cause a high amount of melee damage after repeatedly applying &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;.

Strategically insignificant. Involved in Proving Grounds Quest for Alliance.\nWildpaw Cavern.\nLocation of Gnolls. Strategically insignificant. Involved in Proving Grounds Quest for Horde.\nField of Strife.\nThe Field of Strife is not a building, but rather an open expanse in Alterac Valley where the intial fighting begins. It is located in the middle of Alterac Valley. It contains no key structures, a few scattered NPCs for both faction, and is important for summoning &lt;a href=\"Ivus%20the%20Forest%20Lord\"&gt;Ivus the Forest Lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Icelord\"&gt;Lokholar the Icelord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Field of Strife is also an important site for Alliance (and probably Horde) to launch an aerial offensive, with each Wing Commander, having successfully received enough collected medals or flesh, asking for a beacon to be planted in either the west or east crater. This beacon must be protected for one minute, and if done so successfully, an aerial assault will launch."}

{"id": "71594", "revid": "906439", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=71594", "title": "Alterac Valley tactical overview", "text": "Graveyards.\nFrostwolf Graveyard.\nIt is a flat, fairly open area with no natural advantage for either force. Both sides have seen this as biased against them, but ultimately it is a level playing ground in a confrontation, barring the owner's closer spawn point.\nNotably, the open area is beneficial for ride-by NPC kiting, and its proximity to the nearby mine can give some NPC support via kiting.\nTowers/Bunkers.\nCommanders, who stand near their respective flags, can be kited.\nAlliance Advantage: Tower flags are not covered by archers.\nHorde Advantage: Towers are slightly harder to climb.\nIceblood Tower.\nA group of ranged characters encamped on the tower can effectively control the roads leading to Iceblood Garrison and Iceblood Graveyard.\nTheories on real/perceived imbalance.\nRace Games.\nQuite simply, Alterac Valley was not designed as a PvE battle to be decided in under 20 minutes, and the removal of superfluous NPCs (&lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;) does not address the placement of the remaining NPCs, the terrain, or how good the opposing defenses are with a skeleton defense\u2014or quite often, no player defenders at all. These were designed to compliment the other NPCs, and a lively PvP battle.\nAnother factor to consider is the level of thought put into by players who don't want to be in the battleground for over half an hour, and the level of organization in an average [PuG]. Presumably, AV being a PvP arena after all, there is a counter available to either side for whatever is put in their way. Change however comes slowly in a disorganized mob, so better tactics are slow to filter through. For instance, from this author's view (Alliance), I can see no real reason why Horde players would not attack SP from above and behind, pretty much exclusively, from what is referred to as the high road. It's not intuitive however, but then it may change in time.\nAt this time, Alliance does have a significant advantage; issues such as the placement of NPCs in the two bases, which used to be balanced by other issues in a fuller game, and the terrain itself when used in race games, cater to the lowest common denominator of the two forces. \nThis is simply a reflection on the playerbase, and how they have chosen to play, rather than issues of balance inherent in the map, which is after all, objectively, being abused to gain as much honor as possible.\nCulture.\nGroups of players who believe they can win, will usually win; players who believe they will probably lose anyway, will not try as hard, and thus generally lose. If your opponent has a force of 40 who have some level of trust and organization, and you a force of 30 with 10 AFKers, bots, stealthers, fishermen and grinders, you are already at a disadvantage. \nWhat begins as a being decided by a combination of skill, gear and organization, becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as a loss will often result in another loss, a win in a win, as a pool of players become entrenched as either winners or losers in each battlegroup. Thus a supposed bias will emerge, while a neighboring battlegroup can have an alternate view on bias.\nIt should be noted in support of this, that the current prevailing attitude of &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt; onwards is similar to a pre-&lt;a href=\"patch%201.10\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt; (for some servers at any rate) situation that saw one side not caring whether they won or lost. It would seem that Blizzard's actions can have a resounding impact on player contribution within this battleground.\nLimited experience.\nAs AV has moved from its traditional long encounters to a cynical exercise in milking the system, players are not exactly endeared to the map (not that the previous versions were universally popular, or free of players focused exclusively on the rewards), a common sentiment being to get out of there as soon as rep/marks/honor permits. Short games where essentially the same strategy is played out ad nauseum, also leads to a narrow range of experience. How much can a player know of the tactics an enemy uses on attack, if they themselves never defend? How quickly can counters be discovered when players are encouraged not to search them out?\nThis leads to a playerbase that is largely inward-looking and ignorant when determining what their opponent faces\u2014delivering an entrenched and narrow-minded view of AV."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; advanced deeper in continental &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler got scared for his life, and bargained directly with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; - Alterac would let the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s travel freely through the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and even provide assistance to them in other manners, and in exchange the Horde would promise not to ravage its lands.\nHowever, this treachery was eventually discovered, and after the war &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; led Alliance troops into Alterac, declaring martial law and taking Perenolde into custody. The custody soon turned to a mere house arrest, confining Perenolde to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;his palace&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of his family on close watch, and the kingdom was put under Alliance control. As a sovereign king, he could not be exiled, executed, or simply imprisoned (in order to avoid worrying the other kings that the same reaction would occur if they disagreed on anything). The other kings wanted him to abdicate his position as king, so that he could be executed as a lesser noble. However, he refused, knowing it would mean his death. His kingdom had been put under martial law as a temporary solution on &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion, actually the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s guise. Daval Prestor started maneuvering to sow the seeds of conflict between the various kings of the Alliance, a plan that would take time to come to fruition.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Crown Prince Aliden&lt;/a&gt; was trying his best to clean his family's stained name, Aiden secretly ordered his agents to steal the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; in order to use it as a bargaining chip. He ultimately traded it to the Horde to rid his lands of the vengeful troops of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; that occupied it. Deathwing attacked the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; holding the troops. His son Aliden was disgusted by the action of his father, knowing it would destroy everything he had done to try to clear the family name.\nDay of the Dragon.\nEven after the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the crisis was still ongoing. None considered Prince Aliden a possible successor, being seen as too pampered and as being cut from the same cloth as his father. &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;King Thoras&lt;/a&gt; now wanted Alterac split in two between Lordaeron and Stromgarde. King Terenas still debated the merits of either annexing Alterac to his own kingdom or setting upon its throne a new and more reasonable monarch, one that would be friendly to Lordaeron. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn&lt;/a&gt; supported &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was afraid that Gilnean influence in the region would threaten Kul Tiras' naval sovereignty. Deathwing, still under the guise of Daval Prestor, manipulated the leaders into making him the future king of Alterac. This worked for a time, but drew the suspicious attention of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, who were conveniently left out of the negotiations by the black dragon. Prestor tried to have the Kirin Tor ostracized by the other Alliance leaders and even secured a betrothal to Lordaeron's princess, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia&lt;/a&gt;, in order to reinforce his political position. Ultimately, however, Deathwing's plans were foiled when he was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and forced into hiding.\nResolution.\nWith Deathwing's disappearance, his magical influence on the human kings waned away. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; reinstated his protest against Daval Prestor's taking ascension, and even Lord Admiral Proudmoore joined him on this. King Terenas announced that a second check into the so-called noble's background left many questions unanswered, and the wedding was canceled.\nAt some point &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; died, leaving the door open for &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to at least partially annex the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. At the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, and its inhabitants considered him their lord, with the citizens also taking up arms for Lordaeron. A new resistance against them had appeared, however, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, led by former Alteraci prince &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; after he rose up in the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt; under the teachings of his new mentor &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;."}

Thoradin was confident he could conquer the tribe if given enough time, but he knew the cost would be very high and decided to change his tactics to prevent needless bloodshed. He marched up the mountain with only his greatsword &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt; in hand to challenge Ignaeus to a duel. Before long, Ignaeus emerged from the forest, his skin dyed red with his own tribal markings. Ignaeus was bigger and stronger than Thoradin, but the Arathi leader used the foggy weather to his advantage to avoid Ignaeus' swings and disarm his foe. Rather than killing his opponent, Thoradin then plunged Strom'kar into the earth and extended the hand of peace, thereby winning the Alteraci to his side.\nThe tribe became part of Thoradin's new nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; while Ignaeus became one of the king's most prominent generals. When &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; began encroaching on Arathor's borders prior to the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, Ignaeus and his northlanders stalked well beyond Arathor's borders, slaughtering any trolls they came across.

There are an infinite number of separate alternate, possible timelines, creating the multiverse. Some are nearly identical, only differing in a few key events. Additionally, there are several methods of &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt; that can alter the history of a universe's timeline. &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragon\"&gt;Bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s exist to keep the main timeline inviolated and the order of events progressing as the fates intended.\nMechanics.\nThe flow of time.\nIn all known realms of the cosmos, time flows forward, ever forward. Chaotic energies in places like the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; can affect how quickly it flows, but it only flows forward.\nOnce an event happens, it cannot be changed. These events and choices, made up of all creatures and forces in the cosmos, join together like a river, sharing the same reality. Different choices and different possibilities naturally spin off the river of time like small creeks and estuaries, ebbing and flowing for a while. If these shades of what could have been are left alone, they will eventually dissipate into nothing. If efforts are made to preserve them (or alter them), they can indeed remain in existence indefinitely. They can even be made to feed back into the main river\u2014dead creatures can seemingly \"live again,\" and the past (or future) may literally come back to haunt you. This is not a natural phenomenon, and the inhabitants of the main timeway will often find these experiences to be quite alarming.\nBut the only timeway that has a permanent effect on the cosmos is the main timeway. Creatures like the bronze dragons, who have command of temporal magic, can see all the countless tributaries of alternate universes and timelines, and they can even move back and forth along the stream to observe the past and the future.\nIf that main river is disrupted, it could spell doom and disaster. All life on Azeroth depends on time to flow ever forward. Without the surety that the sun will rise and set each day, the seasons would not pass, the cycle of life would become meaningless, and all living creatures would eventually die from being unable to sustain themselves. It is the most sacred mission of the bronze dragonflight to keep that from happening.\nOf Death and the Shadowlands.\nIn a September 2020 interview with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//lorekeeper.net/en/contents/\"&gt;Lorekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, lead narrative designer &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Danuser\"&gt;Steve Danuser&lt;/a&gt; was asked about how alternate timelines relate to &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nLorekeeper: We\u2019ve done some stuff that\u2019s involved with time travel and alternate realities. What happens to those souls when they pass on? Do they go to the Shadowlands?\nSteve Danuser: \nIt is currently unknown how souls within alternative timeways that don't exist within the main timeway, such as &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Menethil\"&gt;Uther Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, those from an alternative timeline making their home in the main timeway, such as &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, or those from alternative timeways who became demons when their main timeway counterpart didn't function in this system.\nAlternate universes.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nThis alternate timeline appeared in the novel \"\", it was a highly different version of Azeroth witnessed by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; while chasing &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this world, &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; died as an infant while under the care of &lt;a href=\"Tammis%20Foxton%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Tammis Foxton&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Clannia%20Foxton%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; sobered up and raised an army of strong, loyal men. Blackmoore himself led the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Battle of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, killed &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer%23Alternate%20timelines\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and brought an end to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, rather than being put in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, either became slaves to the people of Lordaeron or members of his private army. Any wild orcs had a very large bounty put on their heads. The Foxton family was not as successful - after failing to raise Thrall, Tammis was demoted to cleaning stables and eventually, he and his wife passed away.\nBlackmoore returned triumphantly to Lordaeron and, in a swathe of destruction, he and his orcs killed several of the most stalwart defenders of humanity and dethroned the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Menethil\"&gt;House of Menethil&lt;/a&gt; by killing &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. His army also killed &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. He then became the self-proclaimed King of Lordaeron, assisted by his duplicitous chief advisor, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. He even had Doomhammer's plate reforged into a suit of armor for himself. Lordaeron's rightful prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, fled southward with his &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Menethil\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; to the kingdom of Stormwind, where &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; took his old friend in. Despite the safety of Stormwind, Arthas and Varian fully intend to break Blackmoore's control over Lordaeron. Thus no &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, nor &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were ever created and kingdoms like Dalaran and Quel'Thalas were not destroyed. However, Dalaran and &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; have severed ties with the chief advisor and their allegiance was more with Stormwind than Lordaeron. Similar to the standard timeline, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; is consort to Alexstrasza (indicating she was liberated from the Dragonmaw clan) but still disguises himself as the Kirin Tor mage Krasus. He had a high elven apprentice named &lt;a href=\"Devi\"&gt;Devi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point very recently, Blackmoore mysteriously vanished. The &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; recruited him to enter the main timeline and kill Thrall before Thrall had a chance to stop the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. When chasing the missing Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu, Thrall found himself in Hillsbrad Foothills] in this world, with &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; threatening to sell him for the bounty on wild orcs. Thrall was able to convince Taretha of his identity, using a pendant that the Taretha from Thrall's memory had given to him. The two traveled to Dalaran and Krasus to gain answers on what was going on with the timeways. During their discussion, Thrall realized that time was an illusion and all that mattered was the single moment. Closing his eyes, the alternate timeline vanished before Thrall and he found himself facing Nozdormu.\nThough the novel seemingly depicts this alternate universe collapsing, &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt; clarified that it represented Thrall and Nozdormu escaping its grasp more so than it being destroyed.\nBefore entering the \"Blackmoore's reality\", Thrall met his parents in an alternate timeline.\nWar Crimes.\nWhen the time came to free &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and escape to alternate Draenor, &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; summoned multiple alternate versions of Azeroth's heroes that fight their original counterparts, causing chaos in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and distracting everyone while the two make their escape. These counterparts came from alternate timelines including, but not limited to:\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate timeline Draenor&lt;/a&gt; is the main setting of the \"\" expansion. With the intent of gathering an army capable of defeating the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to bring &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to this particular timeline because certain differences \u2014 such as Garrosh never being born and Ner'zhul's mate, &lt;a href=\"Rulkan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt;, surviving \u2014 were advantageous to his plan. Garrosh used his knowledge of the future to convince to turn on , kill &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, and unite the orc clans into a technologically advanced &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. This Iron Horde then used a shard of the shattered Vision of Time to link their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; with the present day of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;prime Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in order to invade.\nPrince Malchezaar.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt; has the ability to travel between alternate timelines, considering his quote \"\" This may explain why he has a &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl%20%28item%29\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; axe despite &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously having the one &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; used to kill &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the Burning Legion resides within the Twisting Nether which transcends all realities.\nIllidan.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vandel\"&gt;Vandel&lt;/a&gt; was undergoing rituals to become a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, upon eating a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s heart \"he saw not just one universe but a near infinity of them, a complex fractal structure, where new worlds were born each minute from the decisions made a heartbeat before\" and the Legion was destroying them all.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; burnt Illidan's eyes, the night elf received powers through which he could send his soul into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, the Twisting Nether, and alternate universes.\nMechagon.\nIn an alternate future, &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; activated the &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt; reversing the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; from races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Christy%20Punchcog\"&gt;Christy Punchcog&lt;/a&gt;, his research was corrupted and his device flawed. The activation of the device ignited the skies and burned the flesh of most every living thing. Those with enough mechanization survived. &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; is largely in ruins with most of its citizens slain after &lt;a href=\"Bondo%20Bigblock\"&gt;Bondo Bigblock&lt;/a&gt; sold them out in exchange for full mechanization. &lt;a href=\"Izira%20Gearsworn\"&gt;Izira Gearsworn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christy%20Punchcog\"&gt;Christy Punchcog&lt;/a&gt; have survived, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; was taken alive and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rusty%20Prince\"&gt;fully mechanized&lt;/a&gt;.

Likewise, the alternate Izira Gearsworn - who recognized that the adventurer was there due to a time anomaly - told the adventurer to deliver a &lt;a href=\"Visual%20Holo%20Sphere\"&gt;Visual Holo Sphere&lt;/a&gt; to her main universe counterpart to also ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt; could prevent the reality from coming to pass.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire%20Campaign\"&gt;Black Empire Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance and Horde traveled into timelines where the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;his forces&lt;/a&gt; ruled over the world and its twisted citizens - &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20the%20Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Visions of the Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20the%20Twisting%20Sands\"&gt;Twisting Sands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Twilight\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Twilight&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nDuring their search for &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siaszerathel\"&gt;Siaszerathel&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer traveled to a &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Future\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; have won the war.

The worlds include Azmerloth, &lt;a href=\"Azmourne\"&gt;Azmourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.Z.E.R.O.T.H.\"&gt;A.Z.E.R.O.T.H.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azwrath\"&gt;Azwrath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azq%27roth\"&gt;Azq'roth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlands\"&gt;Warlands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ulderoth\"&gt;Ulderoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAltered timelines.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe events of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; were altered by the involvement of several time travelers from a few years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. While most of the major outcomes remained the same as before, some things were changed like the preservation of blue dragon eggs, killing &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; being planted a thousand years earlier.\n&lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the interference of the Infinite Dragonflight, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s escape from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; has deviated slightly from how it originally occurred. &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; was captured so she would be unable to create the diversion that allowed Thrall to escape. Instead, time-traveling &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from year 26 created the diversion, aided him in escaping, and freed Taretha from the Infinites. Taretha's and Thrall's memories of these events were subsequently altered so he would believe things occurred as they originally did.\nThe infinite dragonflight also tried to disrupt the events of &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, which were all preserved.\nEnd Time.\nOne of an infinite number of potential outcomes, the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; timeway depicts the desolate future of Azeroth should Deathwing fail to be stopped. Nozdormu has identified a powerful anomaly that exists in this moment and bars access to the past - and hope of retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The tormented echoes and his future self - &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; - was attacked and killed. The timestrand of the End Time timeway was overwritten, giving Azeroth's protectors the opportunity to avoid this potential outcome. However, Nozdormu states that he will still fall to madness in the future.\nWell of Eternity.\nThe final moments of the War of the Ancients were disrupted once more when the adventurers and Nozdormu took the Demon Soul. After the death of Deathwing in the present era, the artifact was returned to its place in time.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe alternate universe of the \"Warlords of Draenor\" expansion already existed prior to Kairoz and Garrosh's arrival. However, their arrival 35 years into the past of this universe has changed the course of history for this timeline. As it was meant to unfold, Grommash drank Mannoroth's blood and made the orcs slaves of the Burning Legion.\nTimeways.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; act as a crossroads for the various tunnels called timeways, and through them, one can travel back and forth along the ebb and flow of time. They are infinite in numbers. Currently, there are at least 3 known timeways (the &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;) marked as 'trouble spots' that are under the attack of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and that the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; were trying to preserve. They accepted the help of the mortals from the ranks of the Horde and Alliance. The malicious flight's goal is to destroy the true timeway. The master of the Infinite dragonflight tasked &lt;a href=\"Aeonus\"&gt;Aeonus&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the disruption of key moments in the true timeway. The Caverns' timeways were protected and its participants' memories were restored so the timelines continue as normal.\nThe Caverns also have a timeway portal to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and it was initially hinted that the place is under the attack of the Infinite dragonflight but the dragons had no presence there.\nDuring the Cataclysm era, Thrall was tossed to one timeway and materialized in Hillsbrad during the Year 0 of a timeway branch. which began his journey through realities in order to find the missing &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Time\"&gt;Aspect of Time&lt;/a&gt;. In the novel, it seems that the term timeway was used in meaning of a reality / universe. The timeway branch was later referred to as \"...in one of the alternate histories of a malfunctioning timeway\".\n&lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; believed that Thrall from the true timeway wasn't destined to be killed by &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; from a completely different timeway. If he succeeded, all timeways would fall apart. Nozdormu was lost in the timeways because he was searching of how he would become the leader of the infinite dragonflight.\nDuring the war against Deathwing, another timeways appeared in the Caverns - the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; (which was blocked by the first one). &lt;a href=\"Alurmi\"&gt;Alurmi&lt;/a&gt; archived its events. The maddened echoes (Sylvanas, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;) spawned from the timeways that Murozond (Nozdormu tricked by the Old Gods in the future) shattered.\n&lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; created the artifact &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; and had the &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Stone\"&gt;essences&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;'s creatures collected. He speculated that the isle moved from one timeway to another. The artifact allowed him to see through the timeways various visions - in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and the Caverns of Time. When he saw the vision of &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, he wasn't sure if this takes place in this timeway.\nAround the time of the Invasion on Pandaria, timeways were in flux. Nozdormu no longer had control over them and stated that it is now the duty of Azeroth's races to deal with them. Around that time, the mortals and the bronze dragons allied and formed the group &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;. The bronze dragons can still travel through the timeways but they no longer have knowledge about them. Some dragons believe that they should use their remaining power to manipulate them. During the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the former Warchief of the Horde escaped with the help of Kairozdormu, who spent his whole life studying them, through a timeway portal and materialized in an &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point in the future, Nozdormu will shatter the timeways and begin to live outside of time as the corrupted dragon Murozond.\n\"Warcraft\" film universe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" film universe&lt;/a&gt; is an alternate, separate version of the main &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounded around the 2016 film \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20%28film%29\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the film universe is shared by the prequel comic ' and prequel novel ', and is expected to be used for any future film sequels or literature.\nNotably, the film universe does not appear to be simply a different timeline, created by a deviation in key historical events, but rather a subtle reimagining of the main universe, with some contradictions best explained by the unavoidable practicalities of producing a successful film. Director &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Jones\"&gt;Duncan Jones&lt;/a&gt; explains the main reasons for making such changes are to resolve contradictions; to simplify and streamline; for brevity; and on occasion to make things cooler."}

Use a lure at first. Orgrimmar requires a fishing skill (with &lt;a href=\"fishing%20lure\"&gt;fishing lure&lt;/a&gt;) of 75 to ensure that none of the fish get away, and has a skill limit up to skill 75. Each point of skill short of 75 is a percent that your catch will get away.\nA method to quickly catch Old Crafty for higher-level characters involved a bug that appears to have been fixed in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.8\"&gt;Patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;. After obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Crocolisks%20in%20the%20City\"&gt;Crocolisks in the City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, go to Orgrimmar and fish in any of the bodies of water inside the city walls \u2014 make sure you have autoloot disabled. You will find that you may fish up a &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Crocolisk\"&gt;Baby Crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;, so do not loot it, but release it and fish again. A high probability exists that your next cast will fetch a &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Crocolisk\"&gt;Baby Crocolisk&lt;/a&gt; and/or an Old Crafty.\nThere are further complaints in some cases of people catching many Old Craftys (or the Alliance equivalent fish, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironjaw\"&gt;Old Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt;), but in some cases being unable to loot them. While petitions have been filed with GMs regarding this problem, the responses are to the effect that the functions and loot tables pertaining to fishing are working as intended.\nAlliance version.\nThe Alliance version of this fish is &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironjaw\"&gt;Old Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt; which can be caught within the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. These two fish are the only off hand trophy fish that give a stat bonus, both give +5 to Stamina.\nAchievement.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; added &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt;s including &lt;a href=\"Professions%20achievements\"&gt;Professions achievements&lt;/a&gt;.

These immense mountains of flesh, physical manifestations of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, grow like cancers within the worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour Old Gods \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 ruled the planet of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during its primordial age, forming what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; arrived, they sent their armies, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, to shatter the Old Gods' citadels and crumble their empire. Y'Shaarj, however, proved much too strong for the titan-forged to defeat, which prompted the titan leader &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; to reach down his arm and tear Y'Shaarj apart. This created a giant gaping wound in the planet's crust from which the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; lifeblood of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the nascent titan, was hemorrhaging.\nRealizing that the Old Gods had embedded themselves too deep in the world's surface to be removed without destroying Azeroth itself, they instead decided to have the Old Gods imprisoned deep below the surface of the world to contain their evil forever. The &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to study the eldritch monstrosities and find a solution to their existence, inadvertently created a fifth Old God, &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. It was subsequently &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20seal\"&gt;sealed&lt;/a&gt; within the research facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, now located on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough incapacitated and, until recently, forgotten, the Old Gods still to this day influence the very people and events of Azeroth. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, they are one of the most powerful and reoccurring threats found in the \"Warcraft\" series of games and books, especially during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; where they attempted to bring about the end of the world, the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, and during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, with the recreation of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith C'Thun and Yogg-Saron defeated, Y'Shaarj and G'huun deceased, and N'Zoth presumably gone as well, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; declared that Azeroth was made free of the grasp of the Old Gods. Nevertheless, the dark influence of the Old Gods lingers like a blight in places where they once held power.\nKnown.\nThe Old Gods' sole purpose is to corrupt a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; into a being of unimaginable evil, a \"&lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;warped titan&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"dark titan\". Should the Old Gods succeed, the warped titan would consume all matter and energy in the universe, bringing all of existence under the void lords' will.\nY'Shaarj.\nUnlike the other Old Gods who were merely imprisoned, Y'Shaarj was ripped out of Azeroth and slain by the titans themselves. Its remains fell back on the land that would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and its essence, seeping into the soil, would spawn the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; gathered its remains, notably the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, which they placed under guard beneath the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; that settled in the surrounding regions where Y'Shaarj's essence still polluted the land were gradually transformed into a race called the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. Ages later, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; unearthed and managed to restore it using the magical pools of the Vale. Following the heart's excavation, the mantid, who worshipped Y'Shaarj, flew to Garrosh's side, with the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;s standing guard over the Old God's heart. After the heart's power was drained during the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final confrontation&lt;/a&gt; with Garrosh at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the last gasp of Y'Shaarj faded from existence.\nThe Three.\nThe current primary goal of the Azerothian Old Gods is to escape their titanic prisons. Whereas in ancient times the Old Gods used to wage war against each other, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt; leading the armies of N'Zoth against the forces of C'Thun and Yogg-Saron, these three have now formed an alliance that the few mortals who have the knowledge call \"the Three\", destined to further their goals and influence the oblivious world. The Three were responsible for manipulating the events during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20Trilogy\"&gt;War of the Ancients Trilogy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, but also for the corruption of Neltharion into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, or for the transformation of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nN'Zoth.\nN'Zoth was the first Old God to be neutralized by the titan-forged. It was imprisoned in an underground prison some distance west of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, but has since notably been responsible for the formidable growth of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; after its creation by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth was a driving force behind the actions of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. After being freed from its prison, N'Zoth ordered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; to claim the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; in its goal to manifest &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth. Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; invading &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt; ultimately seemingly killed N'Zoth, with the forges he sought to claim being channeled into the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nC'Thun.\nC'Thun followed after N'Zoth's fall and was sealed in the titan-forged research station of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; settled within the confines of C'Thun's prison. The captive Old God's foul presence slowly warped the aqir's forms over time, molding them into a race known as the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. 975 years ago, C'Thun sent its qiraji armies to ravage the world in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Though they almost succeeded in conquering nearly the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the qiraji were defeated by the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. They raised the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;, an enchanted barrier that would contain the insectoids for centuries to come. Recently, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; followers conducted a ritual to shatter the Old God's bonds. C'Thun awakened the thousands of qiraji and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; laying dormant in Ahn'Qiraj and beneath &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and rallied them for war. Though they almost conquered Silithus, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; combined their armies in a force called the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the Old God before it had time to regain its full strength.\nYogg-Saron.\nYogg-Saron, the last of the Three to fall, was imprisoned under the titan city of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;, the aqir that settled near Yogg-Saron's underground prison gradually evolved into a race called the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s due to their proximity to the Old God. Their kingdom would become known as &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt; grew, its roots pierced the prison of the Old God, granting him access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; which it would share with his Old God kin. Over time, Yogg-Saron also managed to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; who guarded Ulduar, and slowly broke through all but the last of its restraints. But thanks to the combined might of the Alliance and the Horde, aided by brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, the Keepers were freed, and together they defeated Yogg-Saron.\nG'huun.\n&lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; was an Old God born from the result of experiments by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. It was quite less powerful than the other Old Gods, but still represented a potentially world-ending threat to Azeroth. It was imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. It was eventually killed by the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and the defensive systems of Uldir.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nFrom the moment the universe came to be, dark spirits within the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; sought to twist reality into a realm of endless torment and chaos. These &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s, envious of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;'s power, pooled their power and created the Old Gods to exert their influence over a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; in its most vulnerable state: before it had awakened. Not knowing which planets contained titan &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s, the void lords then hurled their creations out through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that some would smash into a nascent titan. The Old Gods began contaminating mortal worlds and everything else they touched in their blind search for a world-soul.\nBeing creations of the shadowy void lords and physical manifestations of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, the old gods are deeply intertwined with the dark force, and can control it directly. Many mortal followers of the eldritch horrors make frequent use of shadow magic, and &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Shadow\"&gt;shadow priests&lt;/a&gt; who derive their power from the Void stray dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods. The ritual dagger known as &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; was used by dark priests of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; at its height.\nThe Black Empire.\nLong ago, the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; became threatened by a group of Old Gods. These entities of chaos and destruction wreaked havoc on the world. Plummeting down from the Great Dark Beyond, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; slammed into Azeroth's surface, embedding themselves in various locations of the world. A miasma of despair soon enveloped everything that lay in their writhing shadows as they spread their corruptive influence across the land, all the while sending their tendrils down through the world's crust, towards the planet's defenseless world-soul. Two races, the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; (or \"faceless ones\") and the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, arose from the organic matter that seeped from the Old Gods' massive bodies, becoming fanatically loyal servants that built great citadels and temple cities around the colossal forms of their masters. The greatest of these structures was built around Y'Shaarj, the most powerful of the Old Gods, and the holdings of the Old Ones would soon spread over Azeroth, eventually forming the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrived, the Old Gods enslaved the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that had once raged freely on primordial Azeroth, though not before a &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20wars\"&gt;brutal war&lt;/a&gt; in which the four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who had previously been bitter rivals of one another, banded together in an attempt to fight the Old Gods' fledgling empire. Though the elementals were mighty, they could not stand against the constant swarm of n'raqi and aqir. Without the native spirits of Azeroth to counter the Old Gods' influence, the borders of the Black Empire crept over much of the world. As perpetual twilight descended, the world spiraled into an abyss of death and suffering.\nAt some point during this period, the four Old Gods became aware of a temporal incursion by adventurers and two dragons from the distant future, but seemed to give the incident little mind, content to simply observe.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;, having now been enslaved by the Old Ones, led their respective armies in an eternal conflict that ravaged the world to no end. Meanwhile, the n'raqi servants of the Old God N'Zoth raged war with the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring their journey across the cosmos, the titans eventually made their way to Azeroth and encountered the elementals, who vowed to drive the Pantheon back in the name of their dark masters. Upon discovering the deep and insatiable hunger for destruction in the Old Gods and seeing them as immensely evil, the titans initiated a war with them. Fearing that their enormous forms would severely harm or even kill Azeroth's world-soul \u2014 the most powerful one yet encountered by the Pantheon \u2014 the titans instead created mighty servants to do battle in their stead. Known as the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, these beings waged war against the elemental servants of the Old Gods, eventually managing to defeat them and seal them within the newly-created &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Once the titan-forged started to make their way towards the bastion of Y'Shaarj, however, the titans feared that their servants would not be able to stand against the Old God's might. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather himself, reached down through Azeroth's skies and heaved Y'Shaarj from the surface of the world. The Old God was instantly ripped apart, but in the wake of its death, the lifeblood of Azeroth's world-soul rushed to the surface in a great wound later known as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The Pantheon realized that the Old Gods had burrowed too deep to be excised from Azeroth without killing the nascent titan, and so they ordered their servants to instead imprison the vile gods, rather than killing them. The campaign of the titan-forged to contain the remaining three was long and brutal, but eventually they succeeded in containing the Old Ones below the surface of the world.\nC'Thun was bound within the great fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, located closely to the titan-forged stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, and N'Zoth was imprisoned in a similar way, though it is not known exactly where (possibly deep below Azeroth's oceans). Yogg-Saron was the last Old God to be imprisoned, even unleashing its enormous &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi generals in an attempt to halt the advance of the titan-forged, but eventually it was bound beneath the titan city of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; under the watch of six &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEarly imprisonment.\nDue to the influence of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and the other Old Gods, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, one of the many races created by the titans, began to succumb to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The same thing happened to the &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, eventually resulting in their fleshy bodies, as opposed to their original stone composition or metal design. The vrykul, who had originally had iron skin, also began producing &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;a smaller and weaker mutation of themselves&lt;/a&gt;. The Old Gods had presumably intended to subvert the titans' work from within, and to a great extent they succeeded; the titans were loath to unmake the world except as a last resort. Thus, many of the mortal races of Azeroth had their nature suspended between order and chaos, between their titanic birth and their Old God-originating corruption.\nKnowing that they would soon depart a world full of deep corruption, the titans took several measures to contain it as much as possible. The Keepers created earthen to inhabit specific areas they had sealed off, and the Keeper &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; was made Prime Designate of Azeroth. Through the keepers, they also created the five &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, designed to watch over and protect the world in their absence.\nThe great &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, a monstrous proto-dragon who rampaged through what would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and who was stopped by Keeper &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and the future Dragon Aspects, was hinted to have been manipulated by the Old Gods. Though the Aspects were charged with protecting Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s affinity with the depths of the world would eventually prove to be his undoing.\nAfter the loss of most of his dragonflight during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; hid in isolation for thousands of years, slowly going mad. &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; believes that Malygos's insanity was caused by the Old Gods.\nThe fall of the Keepers.\nAfter an affair with Keeper &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;'s wife &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s guilt and fear made him susceptible to Yogg-Saron's corruption. Under its influence, he killed Sif, and blamed &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, resulting in a war between the frost giants and Thorim. Loken then stopped it with his own army from the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. This army was infected with the curse of flesh that Yogg-Saron had designed, and which began to spread rapidly through the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged races&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Thorim retreated to his throne and fell into a depressed stupor that would last millennia.\nDriven further to desperation and madness by his own actions, and fear of reprisal by &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt; or the Pantheon, Loken began to willingly bow to Yogg-Saron's power, hoping to use it to selfishly save his own skin. He murdered Keeper &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, who was about to find out the truth about Loken, though the mechagnomes transferred Mimiron's consciousness into a new mechanical body. With the power of Yogg-Saron, Loken was able to ensorcell Keeper &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; and Keeper &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; into complacency. Loken then convinced &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, to seal off the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and managed to imprison Odyn and the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; within. The last threat remaining was the &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; Algalon. Loken modified Ulduar's systems and appointed himself as the new Prime Designate, giving himself control over the titans' alert systems, and damaged these to prevent anyone else from calling Algalon.\nHighkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;, who had found out about the Pantheon's deaths, was driven into despair by the loss of his creators and locked himself away from the world. The remaining Keepers, Tyr and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, gathered earthen, mechagnomes, vrykul, and a &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;watcher&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;, and led an exodus to the south to escape Loken's wrath. They also stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, which had recorded the history of all the events that had unfolded, hoping to show them to the titans. Loken sent two of Yogg-Saron's &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi minions to stop them, but Tyr sacrificed himself to allow the group to escape. The vrykul remained behind to honor the Keeper at the site of his death, while Archaedas successfully led the rest to refuge within &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; where they secured the Discs and entered hibernation.\nTo maintain its hold on the Keepers in Northrend, Loken included, Yogg-Saron kept them all complacent and dormant within Ulduar, content to maintain the victory it had accomplished instead of risking losing it by overextending itself.\nWar of the Ancients.\n10,000 years ago &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; wanted to open a portal for &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; that was powerful enough for him to manifest in his full glory. In turn, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; contacted each of her fellow aspects. It was one of the most respected of these dragons, the black dragonflight's leader Neltharion the Earth-Warder, who proposed a plan should the worst truly be coming to pass. Alongside his old friend &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion proposed that a simple golden disc, imbued with the power of each of the Aspects in turn, could be created that would be so powerful that no force on Azeroth or indeed even from outside could possibly stand against it. Should all these strange portents really be true, dragonkin would be ready. Convinced by Neltharion's arguments, the other aspects agreed and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; was created.\nUnknown by the other Aspects, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; had found himself intrigued by the whispers of the Old Gods, who were pinned within the very earth he was assigned to watch over for an untold time. These entities knew full well who Sargeras was and what his appearance signified for Azeroth. Having worked over the course of thousands of years to subjugate Neltharion, they now sought to make use of their newest and most powerful weapon. The Old Ones wanted to divert the power of Sargeras' portal to themselves and crack Azeroth open and after eons of imprisonment, they would be free. However, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; gained the Dragon Soul and used it alongside his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to close the portal, unknowingly preventing the release of the Old Gods.\n10,000 years later the Old Gods invaded &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s realm and managed to open a rift in time, that, as they had planned, tossed some beings back through time, beings that would change the way the War of the Ancients took place, and give Sargeras a new chance to enter the world, and therefore give them a new chance to set themselves free. Their plans were crushed yet again by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, who were sent back in time by Nozdormu. This was a backup plan from the Old Gods' initial attempt to rip time apart and change history so they were never imprisoned in the first place, which was blocked by Nozdormu with great effort.\nThe birth of the Emerald Nightmare.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, an eerie greenish ore began to emerge across Azeroth. The ore, which would one day be named &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, was extremely troubling to the night elves, particularly its dark properties and abrupt appearance. They sought to contain the outbreak, and the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; conceived a plan to use branches of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, to accomplish this. He planted the branches across the world, particularly focusing on a large deposit of saronite in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. The branches grew into trees, which seemed to successfully contain the substance, and the tree in Northrend grew into a World Tree in its own right. Fandral named this tree &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Crown of the Snow\".\nFor a time, Andrassil flourished. But its roots ran too deep, touching Yogg-Saron's prison. It drove the native &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s of Northrend to violence and bloodthirst, and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; realized that Andrassil itself had become corrupted. To stop the corruption's spread, they destroyed the tree and renamed it Vordrassil.\nThe full extent of the damage to Azeroth caused by Andrassil would not become apparent for many, many years. Unknown to the druids, Yogg-Saron's contact with a World Tree had allowed it access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. It spread this access to its fellow Old Gods, with N'Zoth taking particular interest in corrupting this new front. And so, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; was born.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nOver vast stretches of time, C'Thun sought to subvert and corrupt. Its &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; would come to C'Thun and conquer for it, the titan complex that lies today in the sands of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress temple of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. C'Thun waited, until at last its forces had grown strong enough to contest the hated &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; for dominion over &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; itself. Thus began the War of the Shifting Sands, which would see corrupted titan creations like the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; battle side by side with &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; hordes and qiraji leaders to push the night elves out of Kalimdor. C'Thun's plan nearly succeeded. At first, the night elves held fast and defeated the qiraji in several battles, thanks to the brilliant leadership of the &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt; Fandral Staghelm. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral's son&lt;/a&gt;, the kaldorei were driven out of Silithus by the qiraji, and victory for C'Thun seemed nigh. But the combined forces of night elves and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s drove the frenzied qiraji back. Still, those forces could not hope to win out against the Old God itself in its den. Rather than risk such an apocalyptic conflict, a solution was enacted that sealed the qiraji and C'Thun up inside their very fortress, the city complex of Ahn'Qiraj itself, by a magical barrier called the \"&lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;\". Fandral Staghelm, entrusted with the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; used to seal Ahn'Qiraj, shattered it out of bitterness over the death of his son.\nRecent history.\nAfter their defeat on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his surviving minions of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; sailed west to the mysterious continent of Kalimdor, drawn in by the whispers of the Old Gods. They were followed by &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, who was eager to hunt down the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Gods noticed Illidan, and his hunger for power intrigued them. Illidan cast a powerful spell to summon the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and they answered. A group led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; pledged themselves to him. They did not come because of their shared history, nor did they respect his &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic power. They came because the Old Gods willed it. They were aware that his quest to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; could spark a new war on Azeroth, one that would envelop the undead, demons, and world's nations. With this chaos, Cho'gall and his cultists could awaken the Old Gods relatively unopposed. They saw Illidan as useful in this regard, and they were confident that he could bring a new age of conflict. The Old Gods sent the naga to aid him in his campaign against the Lich King. If the former elf became troublesome, they could order the naga to cut out his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted heart.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe world of Azeroth, at large, first experienced the might of an Old God when C'Thun began to find ways to get qiraji past the Scarab Wall. This was noticed by the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; who marshaled the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the threat the Old God posed. After much preparation, the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was recreated and the Scarab Wall was opened, and the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was forced to face the qiraji army. Ultimately the combined Alliance and Horde forces succeeded in pushing the qiraji back into the city, after which Alliance adventurers ventured into the city itself and toppled the qiraji leadership, and defeated C'Thun itself.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War in Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Cho'gall entered Ulduar and sabotaged Yogg-Saron's prison. With a greater amount of its power restored, Yogg-Saron swiftly cemented its grip on the Keepers, including Loken who had resided in Ulduar's &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Now fully under the Old God's sway, Loken sought to free Yogg-Saron completely. To this end he used the Forge of Wills to create his own personal army made of iron, fashioned as a mockery of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20giant\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe irons came into conflict with the invading Alliance and Horde forces who had come to destroy the Lich King and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. During the course of this conflict, Loken was able to enslave Thorim as well but was killed some time later by adventurers. This set off Algalon's alert systems, while Yogg-Saron's power reached a peak, leading &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to alert the Alliance and Horde in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; of the dire situation in Ulduar. Adventurers were sent into Ulduar to deal with the disaster, and during the course of their assault they freed the Keepers and defeated Yogg-Saron, forcing it back into dormancy.\nStormrage.\nAfter the War in Northrend, the world of Azeroth became seized by an endless, cursed slumber. This state was brought on by a power within the Emerald Nightmare, and Malfurion Stormrage led a group to discover just what that power was. What they ultimately discovered was that the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion's ancient nemesis, had been transformed by the Old Gods into the monstrous Nightmare Lord. Xavius sought to merge the Emerald Nightmare with Azeroth and thus gain control of both. Malfurion was able to stop his plans, and together with a group of his closest friends and allies, killed the satyr. The Nightmare retreated into the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, but Malfurion sensed great darkness within and realized Xavius had merely been a pawn to a much darker entity. Unable to purge the Nightmare within the Rift, and realizing they were needed elsewhere, Malfurion and Tyrande sealed off the area around the Rift, imprisoning Xavius' &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; within. They agreed that this matter would need to be dealt with another time.\nCataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Old Gods caused much of the suffering the Aspects experienced. The madness of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the Emerald Dream turned into a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the altering of the &lt;a href=\"timeway\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt;s, the attack of the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the construction of a monster out of alternate , and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cult\"&gt;Twilight Cult&lt;/a&gt; were all intertwined into a dreadful conspiracy of the Old Gods to destroy the Aspects and the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s forever, and with it all chance of order and stability. The Aspects were shocked by this.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; launched the Alliance and Horde into war, their conflict brought accompanying adventurers to the shores of the hidden land of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. There the Alliance and Horde forces discovered a strange corruption known as &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; that fed off negative emotions. Though believed to be tied to the land's last ruler, &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, and his attempts to save his people from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the true source of this corruption was not fully known at first.\nAs the war in Pandaria dragged on, Garrosh grew increasingly desperate to win and descended further into bloodlust and megalomania. To this end he had the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; excavate the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; in search of a mysterious artifact. What they found was the still-beating &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart of the deceased Old God Y'Shaarj itself&lt;/a&gt;; the true source of the Sha. Garrosh's lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; claimed this terrifying relic for the Horde, and a short time later Garrosh used the waters of the Vale to fully rejuvenate the Heart. He then took the Heart with him to his new base, the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, and hung it in &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;his throne room&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh intended to use the Heart to power his new organization, the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, after it showed him a vision of his conquest of Azeroth using its power. Using the Heart he transformed Malkorok into a twisted &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt; and forged a &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;new axe&lt;/a&gt; for himself.\nThe Alliance and Horde, working together and led by a group of adventurers, laid &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;siege to Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to stop him. The adventurers were able to fight through the Underhold to confront Garrosh directly. During the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;battle with him&lt;/a&gt;, he drained the Heart's power in a desperate attempt to achieve victory. Even this act was not enough, and Garrosh was defeated, with the power of Y'Shaarj draining away and leaving nothing but a &lt;a href=\"Fading%20Breath\"&gt;Fading Breath&lt;/a&gt; that soon vanished from existence.\nWar Crimes.\nThe Old Gods were indirectly involved in aiding Garrosh's escape to an 's past, as the True Horde's remnants were aided by the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in crashing Garrosh's trial.\nLegion.\nWhen an traveled to Azeroth and ushered in a &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion by the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's defenders became desperate for anything that could help stop them. While an adventurer traveled with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and Brann to Ulduar as part of this search, they discovered that Yogg-Saron's influence still haunted Ulduar, though not enough to be anything more than a minor threat.\nThe newly formed &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s sent their greatest champion, and eventual leaders, to find ancient and powerful artifacts to use as weapons against the Legion. Some of these involved fighting ancient forces of the Old Gods. Of note, the dark blade Xal'atath was recovered during this period by the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the course of the Burning Legion's invasion, they received help from the resurgent Emerald Nightmare, which had successfully begun beyond the Rift of Aln once more. Leading the Nightmare was a resurrected Xavius, the Nightmare Lord, and under his control large parts of the Dream had already fallen to corruption; including the Dream's versions of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moonglade%20%28Emerald%20Nightmare%29\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. While Xavius worked to aid the Legion, he and the Nightmare were still firmly under the control of the Old Gods. They seemingly aided the Legion as they delighted in the chaos the demons caused and hoped to keep their mutual enemies' attention focused on the Legion, allowing the Old Gods to work their manipulations in the background.\nUltimately Xavius was killed once more, this time in the Rift of Aln, and the Nightmare dissipated almost completely. However, a small &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Remnant of the Void&lt;/a&gt; indicated that it still had not been completely destroyed.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the Legion's defeat and the Alliance and Horde breaking out into &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;open war&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Gods, particularly N'Zoth, sought to take complete advantage of the situation.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth and Azshara worked to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt;, transforming them into &lt;a href=\"k%27thir\"&gt;k'thir&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance emissary discovered an ancient power being used by the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; that drew from a mysterious death realm called &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to them, this was an offshoot of the Emerald Nightmare.\nMeanwhile, on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the artificial Old God &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; had forged a pact with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; to escape its imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;. In return, G'huun would become the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of Zul's new troll &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;. A C'Thrax named &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt; was also resurrected, thanks to the hunger for power of the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; and his troll ally &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;. G'huun's forces sought to destroy the seals keeping it imprisoned in Uldir. Zul and Mythrax were ultimately successful in this, leading a massive army of G'huun's zealous &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; worshippers in an attack on &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Though Zul was slain in the assault, Mythrax was able to launch an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;seal in Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and destroy it.\nAfterwards, G'huun's influence began to rapidly spread through the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting spirits and throwing the plane into turmoil. When the Zandalari princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde emissary, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; discovered this from the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, they decided the time to assault Uldir and put a stop to G'huun was now. A group of Horde adventurers, led by Talanji, descended into the depths of the titan complex and successfully defeated the so-called Blood God. To prove to the Zandalari that the monstrosity was dead, &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin's glaive&lt;/a&gt; was dipped in its blood.\nWhile Azeroth's chosen champion was trying to empower the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; relic, the Old Gods attempted to interfere with the ritual, sending some n'raqi to attack the adventurer.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; was able to use the &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite&lt;/a&gt; collected by the Heart of Azeroth to break the chains binding N'Zoth after activating the titan device in the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt;. With the set staged for N'Zoth's release, an ancient corruption took root across Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, the Sleeping City, has awakened. Under N'Zoth's command, the armies of the Black Empire threaten to engulf the world and reshape it according to their &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;master's vision&lt;/a&gt;. Nightmares dwelled within &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;-shrouded heart of the ancient Black Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth ventured deep into the horrific realm to confront mad heralds and inscrutable horrors, and ultimately go eye-to-eyes with N'Zoth itself for one final confrontation against the Old God in a fateful battle for Azeroth's survival.\nUltimately N'Zoth (along with Ny'alotha) was destroyed when the Heart of Azeroth fired the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;, upon it. In the aftermath &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; declared that Azeroth was finally made free of the grasp of the Old Gods.\nPower and strength.\nPowers.\nOne of the Old Gods' most notable abilities is their psychic power, being able to mentally twist the thoughts of most beings and take full control of them. Entire armies of &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; would turn against themselves under the influence of the Old Gods, and even the weakest of the Old Gods was able to completely corrupt one of the strongest of the Keepers. Even confined, their mental abilities can reach out to nearly anything around them in the form of dark whispers.\nOld Gods have also immense power over Void and &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Twilight\"&gt;twilight magic&lt;/a&gt; and can spread a seeping miasma from their bodies. Their corruption is strong enough to transform a pure world-soul into a twisted abomination. They are so confident in their corruption that Xal'atath stated all things could be corrupted, and are willing to wait millennia for it to bear fruit, showing incredible patience. Only awakened titans are known to be able to fully resist the corruption of the Old Gods. Organic matter seeping from the Old Gods' blighted forms gives birth to hideous minions, such as the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, who serve their masters with fanatical loyalty.\nThey've also proven tricky to deal with on a permanent basis, particularly if they've already begun to burrow into a planet with a world-soul. Y'Shaarj has demonstrated that even killing an Old God is not necessarily an end to their evil, as even a single fragment of it became a curse on Pandaria for millennia. The Old God that attacked &lt;a href=\"Fyzandi\"&gt;Fyzandi&lt;/a&gt; also illustrates this principle, as even after its death, the wasteland where it had dwelt remained, and the lingering power of the Void was sufficient enough to drive those who entered the wasteland to madness.\nWhispers.\nSince the dawn of life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Gods have been whispering to the subconsciousness of beings at the surface, subverting their thoughts and feelings, and sometimes driving them to great malice, complete insanity, or both. The old whisperings urge one to do dark, terrible things. They are subtle whispers that eventually become indistinguishable from one's own thoughts.\nThe most notorious and tragic victim of the Old Gods' whispers is &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt;, the once-mighty &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; who had been empowered by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; with dominion over the deep places of the world. Yet, not even Neltharion's great wisdom and power proved capable of breaking the grip the old whisperings had on his mind, causing the Earth-Warder to eventually lose all his sanity. Neltharion renamed himself &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, seeking the genocide of all non-draconic life, the enslavement of the other dragonflights, and the release of his masters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt; momentarily heard the whisperings when they held the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; in their grasp. Malfurion has since stated that \"&lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Ysera's noble brood&lt;/a&gt; had fallen victim to the old whisperings\", as well. This was a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"highborne\"&gt;highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; too heard the whispers moments before what would have been her death during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. She accepted the Three's offer: Azshara and her Highborne would be saved, but they would become servants of the Old Gods. They were subsequently transformed into the monstrous &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most striking historic account of the old whisperings, however, is found in the myths of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes. According to them, their goddess, the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, heard the whispers of the \"Old Ones\" in the time before time but was unswayed by them. She created the world and the elements so she could give birth to her children, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, in a place safe from the Old Ones' corruption, and for a time the elements kept the darkness of the depths at bay. However, after the creation of the tauren and while the Earth Mother slept, the Old Ones stretched their influence across the land and whispered to the tauren, teaching them of hatred, greed, sorrow, and war. A number of the tauren were swayed by the whispers and began unleashing the elements on each other, while others \"lost their light\" after the darkness invaded their minds and took from them their very selves. The Earth Mother ultimately sacrificed herself, embracing the land and giving all of herself, in order to keep her creations safe from the corrupting shadows, while An'she and Mu'sha took up a place in the skies where they could chase away any traces of shadow their mother could not hold. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that the beings the tauren stories speak of were the Old Gods, and that their whispers penetrate even into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll the Old Gods encountered by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to date have whispered to them throughout the fights, trying to convince the heroes of Azeroth to turn on their allies and give in to loneliness and despair. For all the mystical and military might the Old Gods command, it is perhaps these whispers, and their penchant for manipulation, that are their greatest ability.\nThe Hour of Twilight.\nAn ancient prophecy speaks of the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, the final days of the world and if the Old Gods that were chained long ago had their way set in motion, this chain of events would enact their final vision to remake the world in their image. \nThis, however, may be one variation of the prophecy, as the Pale Orcs of Draenor had also heard of an Hour of Twilight, one whispered to them by the Void lords themselves, stating that the Hour of Twilight is when the Void will consume all existence.\nOther names.\nThe Old Gods have been called various different names by different individuals and organizations.\nMortal worship.\nThe Old Gods' crazed worshipers seem to spring from all of the world's cultures and peoples. The Old Gods are asleep and imprisoned deep beneath the earth, yet their power is so vast that their maddening, destructive taint seeps out from their prisons and appears to tear away at the sanity of some of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s inhabitants. To what extent sentient beings can fall under the influence of the Old Gods in this manner is not well understood, but those who hear the Old Whisperings most clearly have joined together in a coalition that is known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of these followers and cultists have lost every ounce of their sanity and have become completely unpredictable and malevolent, or were forever changed, for example into &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"elemental%20ascendant\"&gt;elemental ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s. Through the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"ogre-mage\"&gt;ogre-mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful champion of the Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight's Hammer became the focal point for mortal worship of the Old Gods. Large groups of the Twilight's Hammer have been observed to settle at or near sites where they believe the Old Gods or their minions are sealed away; many await C'Thun's awakening in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, while others appear to serve &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe largest concentrations of the Twilight's Hammer, however, were located at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, within a region of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; that is now referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, a race cousin to the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nerubians\"&gt;Nerubians&lt;/a&gt;, still worship &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, an Old God killed by the Pantheon in ancient times.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Old Gods are the main focus of the third expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\": . In addition to adding legendary card versions of the four Azerothian Old Gods, the expansion added a myriad of different cards related to the eldritch beings in some way \u2014 mainly in the form of &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt;, mortal cultists and \"what-if\" corrupted versions of existing characters such as the () or (&lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; was the primary focus of the expansion, and was accompanied by a total of 16 different minion cards who either buffed C'Thun in various ways or activated unique effects if C'Thun had been buffed a sufficient amount of times.\nA mechanical version of C'Thun named appears in \"\". This version was built by &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Boom\"&gt;Dr. Boom&lt;/a&gt; \"for some reason\" and, contrary to the goal of its organic counterpart, seeks to end all flesh.\nThe Old Gods returned in the sixteenth expansion, \"\", having been awakened on &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to a new set of legendary cards for the Azerothian Old Gods, the set also added a legendary card for &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; as an alternate hero for the Warlock class as a pre-order bonus. Additionally, four cards - , , , and - were added, calling back to the Old Gods' original effects.\nInspiration.\nThe names and overall nature of the Old Gods are an homage to the various group of deities from the Cthulhu Mythos in the works of (first stage), (third stage), and the \"Call of Cthulhu\" RPG. C'Thun and Yogg-Saron are named after and the . N'Zoth's name is most likely derived from of 's shared . Furthermore, the story which concerns the titans' imprisoning of the Old Gods is an inspiration from the story proposed as the ancient outcome of the war between the Elder Gods (represented in the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s) and the Outer Gods (represented in the Old Gods). An alternative name of the Old Gods is the Elder Gods."}

In &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;recent times&lt;/a&gt; its members either serve the Old Gods directly or had allied with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, to achieve their own objectives with the support of the Old Gods.\nAlthough they suffered a &lt;a href=\"War%20between%20the%20titans%20and%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;crushing defeat&lt;/a&gt; long ago at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Old Gods along with most of their minions had been imprisoned, the Old Gods' activities on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; have been steadily increasing, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, when they launched a &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;major offensive&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to escape their prisons, crush opposition and return to power, until eventually being pushed back by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nMembership.\nMajor members.\nOld Gods' creatures and creations.\nThe Old Gods have spawned and favored many creatures throughout the ages for their servitude:\nTwilight's Hammer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; Cult was originally a clan composed of the &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the planet &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; founded by the ogre-mage &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; as a destructive cult hell-bent on bringing about the apocalypse. Based in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; since the defeat of the Horde during the Second War, in the midst of the cataclysm they have been found recruiting members of both the Alliance and the Horde with doomsayers proclaiming the imminent destruction of the world itself and promising its members glory and power. Other than the Horde and Alliance they have influenced weaker or desperate factions, including the almost extinct sand trolls and the rebellious Dark Iron dwarves. Led by Cho'gall and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Council\"&gt;Twilight Council&lt;/a&gt;, they attempt to claim the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; for the Old Gods who they believe to be the world's true masters, and eventually all of Azeroth itself. More recently with the fall of Cho'gall at the hands of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, now dubbing himself the \"Twilight Father\", and later the \"Twilight Prophet\", has risen to guide the remains of the cult but eventually he is taken down as well and the clan was been splintered. Some have traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; of the heroic &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, hidden beneath the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. There, led by an &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Deacon%20Farthing\"&gt;former Alliance bishop and now traitor&lt;/a&gt;, they attempt to resurrect a C'Thrax named &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Another branch was found attacking &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; alongside the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt;, who hears the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mantid%20Empire\"&gt;Mantid Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiving in what is now called &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the mantid are the oldest inhabitants of the western part of the continent and followers of a dead Old God Y'Shaarj. Throughout countless millennia, they awaited for his return, until his heart was discovered and subsequently revived by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nCountless ages ago, N'Zoth's armies waged endless war against the forces of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.

However he suffered wounds too great in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and had to retreat into Deepholm to heal himself, where he beat the stone dragons into submission to serve him. In his absence, his mate Sintharia and their children Onyxia and Nefarian took over his dragonflight. With the Cataclysm, Deathwing and his flight returned and resurrected Sinestra and Nefarian as undead, the latter which resurrected his sister Onyxia. Reinforced by Sinestra's creation the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, they allied with the elemental lords Ragnaros of the Firelands and Al'akir of the Skywall, and together with the Twilight's Hammer they work to bring the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; Many other dragonkin have been corrupted and changed by the old gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; is a renegade group of various races made of troops from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; that managed to avoid capture and reject the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Now under the control of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Black Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, they are based around &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and have forces from &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, though they are stronger in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Horde wages war against both the Alliance and the Horde, and used to fight the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and its master &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; until the return of Deathwing and his alliance with the Elemental Lord of fire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;Nazjatar Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the end of the War of the Ancients, after the Shattering happened, Queen Azshara and the Highborne tried their best to keep the waters at bay, but struck a pact with a mysterious power that turned them into the reptile Naga. Now as underwater inhabitants in a sunken city they worked their way into shaping a underwater empire, enslaving many aquatic races like murlocs, and taming many beasts like tube wyrms, couatl, dragon turles and snap dragons, with Azshara leading them and against beings like &lt;a href=\"Leviroth\"&gt;Leviroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. The empire's capital city is known as &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Old Gods created the Emerald Nightmare and transformed Xavius, first of the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, into the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;, Xavius was defeated. Now revived, he has rejoined his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;former allies&lt;/a&gt; and spreads the Nightmare in their name. But his true loyalties still remain with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mantid%20Empire\"&gt;Mantid Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen N'Zoth was freed from &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;his prison&lt;/a&gt;, the new queen of the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; pledged her swarm to the Old God, making raids into the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Cult of the Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cult of the Void is a cult of worshipers who covet the gifts of the Void.\n&lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; is where Yogg-Saron was sealed, but it wasn't strong enough to stop his influence from spreading over the millenniums, corrupting the Prime-designate &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, the other &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Frejya\"&gt;Frejya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;), and other titanic constructs, like &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s and their creations. With control over the Forge of Wills, the corrupted Loken started creating a new army like many other's of the titan's creation's (earthen, giants and vrykul) but made of iron instead of stone and empowered by runes. However the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; together with the Kirin Tor and the Horde mounted an offensive against Yogg-Saron's forces and managed to kill him and save the corrupted watchers, except for Loken which was killed earlier by heroes in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and with the death of the Prime designate, Algalon the observer came to Azeroth to judge its corruption in order to re-originate it.\n&lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Kingdom\"&gt;Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nAhn'Qiraj is a fortress city in southern &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and it's the home of the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. They first threatened the world with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, where they were sealed inside their own fortress city. They tried a new offensive but utterly failed against the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, ending with the death of the Twin Emperors, rulers of the qiraji, and with them their master C'thun. Cho'gall and the Twilight Hammer took over Ahn'Qiraj while he mutated, and tried using C'thun's corpse to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; the soon-to-be Guardian.\n&lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nA coalition of disparate factions in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, spearheaded by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Dark Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt;. The prophet has pledged his allegiance to G'huun, seeking to break the entity out of its prison beneath the titan research facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, known as the children of G'huun.\n&lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The meddlesome force focused on destroying the true timeway. They are helping the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; to bring about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, though their reasons for doing so are not entirely clear.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Firelands%23Denizens\"&gt;Firelands minions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nRagnaros allied with Deathwing when he was promised to burn Azeroth together with his minions. Without Therazane or Neptulon interfering, he decided to start with the world tree of Nordrassil with the support of the Twilight Hammer, prompting the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s to oppose him. He was beaten back to the Firelands by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, and after some days of preparations, the druids are prepared to &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20Invasion\"&gt;invade the Firelands&lt;/a&gt; and kill Ragnaros forever.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skywall%23Denizens\"&gt;Skywall minions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;.\nFree from the imprisonment of the Skywall, Al'Akir and his air elementals joined forces with Deathwing in an attempt to obtain the re-origination device the titans left in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. To fight the Tol'vir, his ancient enemies, he called the support of the Conclave of Wind and Skywall's many denizens.\nBeyond Azeroth.\nMore Old Gods exist beyond those four known on Azeroth, but it takes significant power to summon them. Their influence can be seen mostly in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nSecondary leaders.\n &lt;a href=\"Ateena\"&gt;Ateena&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"General%20Vezax\"&gt;General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Vek%27nilash\"&gt;Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Vek%27lor\"&gt;Vek'lor&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;Paragons of the Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;\nFormer leaders.\n &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;"}
{"id": "34800", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34800", "title": "Old Gods speculation", "text": "Old Gods speculation contains theories and speculation related to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilled by re-origination on other worlds.\n&lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; came to Azeroth to determine whether Old God infestation had gotten so bad that re-origination was necessary to get rid of them. When he was defeated, he said: \"I have seen worlds bathed in the Makers' flames, their denizens fading without so much as a whimper. Entire planetary systems born and razed in the time that it takes your mortal hearts to beat once.\" Given Algalon's function, it's probable that those other planets were re-originated to exterminate Old God infestations.\n&lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; said during an interview that the titans had killed \"a lot\" of Old Gods. However, on Azeroth, there had only been one confirmed death of an Old God by titans (&lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;). These other Old Gods the titans killed were likely due to the re-originations Algalon spoke of.\nPossibly Old God related creatures.\nPresence of the Old God.\n&lt;a href=\"Presence%20of%20the%20Old%20God\"&gt;Presence of the Old God&lt;/a&gt; is a maw located in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; which resembles C'thun. They also both share the same model. The maw is located at the bottom of some water in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Quarry\"&gt;Weeping Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, and moves and seems to be alive. This is probably an extension of Yogg-Saron, but may be a separate creature.\n&lt;a href=\"Ryun%27eh\"&gt;Ryun'eh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe former member of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theldurin%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Theldurin the Lost&lt;/a&gt;, speaks of \"a doom approaching\" and he is afraid of it. It's known that \"they\" are imprisoned under surface and if they are freed and rise to the surface, it will be death for everyone. He says he \"cannot utter their names or they may hear\" him, though he mentioned one name - \"Ryun'eh\". Theldurin wants to get the &lt;a href=\"tablet%20of%20Ryun%27eh\"&gt;tablet of Ryun'eh&lt;/a&gt; that is hidden in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, in an ancient chest crafted before the works of any dwarf.\nLike C'Thun and Yogg-Saron, this name appears to be based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft (a city ).\nForgotten ones.\nSeveral forgotten ones, like &lt;a href=\"Soggoth\"&gt;Soggoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One%20%28Ahn%27kahet%29\"&gt;Forgotten One&lt;/a&gt;, are actually &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;forgotten ones&lt;/a&gt; of Northrend are massive and powerful tentacle-bearing aberrations living in the deeps. Forgotten ones seethe below, eager to return to the world above. One of these ancient, terrible beasts lay imprisoned beneath &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, until &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to melt away the polar ice-caps surrounding &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and crush &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, accidentally broke the beast's prison. Before it could act, however, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, and a small army of undead &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s crashed into its prison, and even weakened as he was, Arthas managed to defeat it. Since the Old Gods of Azeroth have been identified, the forgotten one is likely a minion of the Old Gods or a portion of Yogg-Saron.\nDefeating the Old Gods.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, the plan of the titans was to try and kill the Old Gods without killing their host, Azeroth itself. It is confirmed that mortals can't kill an Old God completely unless they find a way to do that.\nMortals can kill Old Gods.\n&lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; by ripping it out of the surface of Azeroth. The rest were defeated and imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. It might be that mortals killing Old Gods, such as &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, can be achieved because these Old Gods were in a severely weakened state from their imprisonment, and were just making their way back onto the world stage.\nThough free and fully awake, it is possible that C'Thun was only able to regenerate to a fragment of its former strength. This would explain how modern adventurers from the Horde and Alliance were able to kill it in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nYogg-Saron had not yet broken through the last of its restraints, and the adventurers had aid from several &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watchers\"&gt;titan keepers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Gods can never be completely destroyed.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"Faceless\"&gt;Faceless&lt;/a&gt; proclaim that the Old Gods \"are outside the cycle\" of life and death. Though the titans have killed several Old Gods across the Great Dark and the adventurers are stated to have killed C'Thun and Yogg-Saron, the theme that death is not the end is frequently raised in \"Warcraft\". All things have souls that carry on to some form of afterlife. These spirits can be brought back to life or undeath. C'Thun drove &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to resurrect it.\nSome dead characters have been able to whisper through pieces of their bodies, such as &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;his skull&lt;/a&gt;, C'Thun through its corpse, and &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;its heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Old Gods are creations of the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s, it's possible that, much like &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, they can be remade again and again so long as they don't perish within the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. This appears increasingly likely to be the case, with statements being made that this rule applies to all creatures from planes outside the mortal one, with creatures of Death, the Light and Order all being suggested or stated to operate similarly.\nOld Gods and expansion speculation.\n&lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; is currently active on Azeroth and could likely be implemented in a future expansion or content patch. Check the &lt;a href=\"Rumored%20Expansions\"&gt;Rumored Expansions&lt;/a&gt; for some of the possible settings for future expansions. N'Zoth's prison should be located south of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fifth Old God.\nIn response to the retcon regarding the number of Old Gods present on Azeroth, a suggestion was made that there were, in fact, five Old Gods who landed on Azeroth, but one of them was completely and utterly obliterated to the point that none remember its existence. This possibility is echoed in the possible origins of &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, and further suggests that the other four Old Gods were responsible for its annihilation. Whether this will ever become anything more than in-universe &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;rumor&lt;/a&gt; is unknown."}

The Darkspear tribe has set up its new village here, just as the tauren founded their new home in nearby Mulgore when they freed themselves from the oppressive grasp of the centaur.\"\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nInfiltrate Theramore.\n\"The Human patrols block your passage to Theramore Isle. The stealthy Blademaster Samuro has offered to help place some Unstable Concoctions at key locations around the Human Shipyard. The ensuing explosions will be more than enough to distract the Humans, allowing you to make a break for the island without fear of cannon fire.\"\nHuman Survivors.\n\"It seems that Jaina Proudmoore is still faithful to her pact with Thrall. Someone else must be behind these Human incursions. Jaina has offered to help discover the culprit, but a more pressing matter has come to her attention. The Human settlement in question is under attack by strange creatures from the sea that call themselves the Naga. Find and save any surviving Humans so that Jaina will help you identify the Human aggressors.\"\nEscape Theramore.\n\"Admiral Proudmoore's forces are ruthless and harbor only hatred for the Orcs. Thrall must be warned about this impending Human invasion. You must capture one of the Humans' transports and use it to escape the harbor. The future of Durotar hinges upon your success.\"\nEnlist the Tauren.\n\"The time for battle against Admiral Proudmoore's navy quickly approaches. You must speak with Cairne in Mulgore and ensure that the Tauren hold fast to their support of the Horde.\"\nRescue Cairne's Son.\n\"The Centaur have returned to plague the Tauren, and this time they've taken Cairne's son, Baine. You must seek out Bovan Windtotem and his white Tauren. Their mystical powers may be able to help you discover the whereabouts of the vile Centaur and rescue Baine before it's too late.\"\nEnlist the Ogres.\n\"The Stonemaul Ogres have fallen under a ruthless new warlord named Kor'gall. Though you are only half-Ogre, the opportunity to win the Ogres to Thrall's side could prove invaluable. Seek out the Stonemaul Ogres and secure their allegiance.\"\nTrial of Strength.\n\"The Ogres trust only those with great strength. To earn their respect, you must run Kor'gall's Gauntlet by defeating a fierce assortment of dangerous foes.\"\nTrial of Blood.\n\"Though you've proven yourself a powerful Ogre, the Stonemaul clan will only follow the strongest leader. You must defeat Kor'gall in single combat without the use of your items. The winner shall reign supreme over the Stonemaul clan.\"\nFirst Blood.\n\"Thanks to your efforts, the Horde stands ready against Admiral Proudmoore's mainland forces. Though Proudmoore plans to unleash his army against the Orcs, you now have the chance to turn the battle upon him. Crush his forces and demolish his stronghold!\"\nOptional Quests.\nKhan Gragtor.\n\"A nearby Orc village has been torn asunder by Khan Gragtor and his Kolkar tribe of Centaur. It would seem that several Orcs were taken as unwilling slaves to do the Khan's bidding. You must raze the Centaur camp to the ground and cut Khan Gragtor to pieces to show that such vile actions against the Horde will not be tolerated.\"\nBloodbeak's Rage.\n\"Although Samuro is eager to help the Horde, his previous mission weighs heavily on his mind. He has been tracking a Wildkin named Bloodbeak the Berserker, who tore a path of destruction through Samuro's home town. Given the opportunity, Bloodbeak will surely strike again while the powerful Blademaster is away. Slay Bloodbeak, and answer Samuro's call for revenge!\"\nThe Kodo Poachers.\n\"The vicious Stonetalon Harpies are destroying the Tauren's Kodo herds. Though normally quick to stop such incursions, the Tauren hunters are away searching for Cairne's lost son. Find the Harpy den and destroy the foul poachers to win Cairne's trust.\"\nStandard of Durotar.\n\"Thrall is constructing a new banner for the Orcs, but it is more than a mere strip of cloth. It requires several rare ingredients that can only be found on creatures of the wild. With the items in his possession, Thrall can enhance the Battle Standard of Durotar with powerful enchantments that will help in the upcoming conflict with the Humans.\""}

Their ranks consisted originally only of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, soon joined by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and later by &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRise of the Horde.\nIn the years following the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; flight from their home planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to escape the wrath of their brethren who had joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; dedicated himself to hunting down these exiles, feeling betrayed at &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s refusal to accept &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' 'gift'. Having pursued Velen's draenei across many worlds, Kil'jaeden decided to employ a new strategy when his agent &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; discovered their presence on the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. So far, each time the archdemon had sent the Burning Legion directly after the draenei, Velen's exiles had simply left their planet aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". Kil'jaeden now wanted to attack them with a less obvious threat, one which would have them stand their ground instead of flee. He planned to use one of Draenor's native species\u2014the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014to destroy Argus's exiles, believing that the draenei would not realize the threat until it was too late.\nTo this end, the demon lord contacted a weak and crippled orc called &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; who the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; had just refused, offering him a taste of shadowy power. He sent Gul'dan to the ambitious chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and the new &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; convinced Ner'zhul to take him as &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; apprentice. Kil'jaeden then appeared to the elder shaman first as his deceased wife &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt; and then directly as himself, being able to convince Ner'zhul that the draenei were, in fact, plotting the wholesale destruction of the orcs and that they needed to be crushed swiftly before it was too late. Ner'zhul was respected among the orcish clans, and through the advice of their shaman each chieftain eventually followed his orders to militarize and prepare for conflict against those they now perceived as malevolent invaders plotting to destroy them. Soon orcish raiders began killing isolated draenei hunting parties to hone their skills and equipment, with &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; leading the charge. As skirmishes continued happening, at some point the orcish shaman stopped hearing from the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, depriving them of their spiritual powers. This left the orcs at a disadvantage against the draenei &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and what were supposed to be certain victories for the orcs turned to humiliating defeats against smaller draenei parties.\nThis last turn of event made Ner'zhul suspect something was amiss. He made a pilgrimage to the holy site &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the real spirit of Rulkan who revealed that he'd been deceived. Ner'zhul returned to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, intending to back out of the agreement he'd made. To his horror, Gul'dan had already discovered the intended treachery and reported it to Kil'jaeden. With Ner'zhul now disgraced, only kept alive in humiliation to witness the downfall of his people, Gul'dan officially took his place. Gul'dan soon began to spread the Burning Legion's demonic influence to the other orcish clans. He promoted Blackhand as the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; leader of the united Horde, and oversaw the creation of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who wielded the demons' power as their own instead of relying on fickle spirits as the shaman of old did. The first orc warlocks other than Gul'dan were from the Blackrock clan, but more and more shaman volunteered for warlock training to replace their lost elemental powers. Blackhand also ordered the new warlocks to artificially age every orcish child in order to bolster the ranks of the Horde with a plethora of fresh soldiers. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade. Over time, the vast prairies the orcs had called home for generations withered away, leaving only red barren soil. The demon energies were slowly killing the world. Gul'dan's most trusted warlocks and &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s formed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to control orc society from behind the scenes.\nAs the Horde waged war on the draenei, Gul'dan dispatched his &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"half-breed\"&gt;half-breed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; with care and precision. Influential orcs who expressed doubt or dissent were often found dead shortly after a skirmish with draenei forces. The wounds inflicted by &lt;a href=\"%3AAnguish\"&gt;:Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3ASorrow\"&gt;:Sorrow&lt;/a&gt; did not look as if they had come from orcish weapons, so Gul'dan and Garona were never suspected. Her quiet work aided the Horde in securing victory against the draenei, and then her blades helped maintain control in the war's aftermath. Life on Draenor withered due to the presence of fel magic, but tensions within the Horde stayed manageable. Whenever they didn't, Gul'dan gave the command, and Garona obeyed.\nThe Horde's war against the draenei picked up the pace and the orcs struck out against the greatest and most fortified of draenei locations, &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;. They destroyed Karabor with relative ease but found trouble assaulting Shattrath. To overcome this roadblock, Gul'dan took the opportunity to seal the Horde's loyalty to the Legion by feeding the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; to twelve clan chieftains of the Orcish Horde. They were overcome by a demonic bloodlust that soon spread to the rest of the Horde and gave them the strength and fury to break through Shattrath's defenses and destroy it. With the draenei believed extinct, Kil'jaeden left Draenor and abandoned the orcs, ushering the &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst and Second Wars.\nWith their world dying and without significant enemies to fight, the orcs turned on each other. Gul'dan realized that unless he found a new enemy for the Horde, it would consume itself. Fortunately, Gul'dan was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, a human mage possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; (leader of the Burning Legion), who promised power and glory in the lush world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Together, Gul'dan's Shadow Council and Medivh created the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Tens of thousands of orcs crossed the portal, and soon the Horde marched through to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; where they clashed with its inhabitants and began the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a rocky beginning, the Orcish Horde was ultimately victorious and conquered the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, but shortly afterward suffered an insurrection for leadership that would ultimately prove to be the Horde's undoing.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand's second-in-command, turned on the Warchief when Gul'dan was rendered comatose and seized power. He destroyed the Shadow Council and nearly killed Gul'dan, but the warlock awoke just in time to bargain for his life. Orgrim grudgingly agreed to spare Gul'dan's life in exchange for the creation of a legion of undead spellcasters. These new &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s proved a valuable asset to the Horde, as well as the allegiance of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, in their push northwards into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horde laid siege to the capital, Gul'dan and his loyalists abruptly abandoned them to seek the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. With almost half of their standing forces gone, including the death knights, the Orcish Horde was forced to retreat and give Lordaeron the time it needed to regroup.\nSoon the tables were turned and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. In this battle, the Horde was soundly defeated and Orgrim Doomhammer was taken prisoner. The remaining orcs fled for the Dark Portal, with the Alliance in hot pursuit. When &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Dark Portal's structure, the orcs lost their morale and were quickly captured and put in &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;Alliance Internment Act&lt;/a&gt;, where they suffered from demon blood withdrawal. This marked the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the Old Horde.\nBranches.\nEven after its defeat, the Old Horde's ideals still lived on in organizations connected to it. \nThe Horde of Draenor.\nThe loose alliance of orc clans that remained on Draenor during the Horde's invasion of Azeroth. It was led by Ner'zhul who, at the request of &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, had agreed to rally the remaining orcs on Draenor. He planned to open new portals to other worlds for the orcs to conquer. The Horde of Draenor eventually clashed together with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; when it stepped through the Dark Portal to defeat the orcs in their own home. Most of the Horde of Draenor was wiped out by this war, and even more of it when Ner'zhul's new portals tore Draenor apart. The Horde of Draenor is also referred to as the new Horde, given how it was created in the wake of the Old Horde's defeat.\nThe Shadow Council.\nThe Shadow Council was founded by Gul'dan after he surpassed Ner'zhul as Kil'jaeden's lieutenant. It functioned to gather, infiltrate, and corrupt the various orcish clans in order to make them Kil'jaeden's weapon. As such, the Shadow Council \u2014 and its founder and leader \u2014 can be credited for creating the Old Horde. Although the Old Horde was defeated in the Second War and the Burning Legion was once more defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadow Council still lives on. Their main base in Azeroth seems to be &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt;. Several minor organizations are working under the Shadow Council \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; being one of them.\nThe Burning Blade clan.\nOne of the orcish clans from Draenor which, like the other clans, fought against the Alliance in the First and Second War. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, of which the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; (#The Dark Horde|see below) is heavily composed, members of the Burning Blade clan are avid worshipers of demons and practitioners of demonic magic. They are also known for their deadly &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s, who apparently swore an oath after the Third War to free the clan from the demons' clench. Still, many of its members are still devoted to demonic magic. They can primarily be found in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; where they're plotting the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, as well as in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; where they've erected &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The Burning Blade is considered dangerous enough for the New Horde to plot to destroy them with.\nThe Dark Horde.\nA group of orcs, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and goblins \u2014 mostly originating from the Blackrock and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans \u2014 made their home in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in upper &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Blackrock Mountain was seized from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; dwarves and used as the Old Horde's headquarters during the Second War. The orcs were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the Alliance of Lordaeron's victory at the Dark Portal. In the aftermath of the Horde's defeat, survivors returned to Blackrock Spire under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; arrived shortly after and became the new leader with Rend and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; as his subordinates.\nThe Fel Horde.\nThe remaining orcs of the Horde of Draenor \u2014 having become &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s from demon blood \u2014 that made their home in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; was their headquarters. Rallied by &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; after Draenor's shattering, the fel orcs in Outland became &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s servants when he overthrew Magtheridon in a coup d'\u00e9tat after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, who in the aftermath of the Second War helped gather the artifacts needed to open Ner'zhul's new portals, acted as their leader under Illidan. He referred to the Fel Horde as the \"true\", \"real\", and \"only\" Horde. Indeed, the Fel Horde was possibly the branch which resembled the Old Horde the most.\nMembers and allies.\n &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; - Allied with the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; after their leader, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; was rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; by Horde warriors.\n &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre clans&lt;/a&gt; - Some ogres followed the orcs through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; - Seeing a great profit potential in the Second War, the Steamwheedle Cartel agreed to exclusively deal with the Horde, but after the lost war decided it would be more profitable to be neutral.\n &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; - A group of the old Horde's most elite warlocks. Most of the faction was slain by the second &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; - These noble creatures were subjugated by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw Clan&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; - These servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s briefly allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; out of convenience.\n &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; - A traitor &lt;a href=\"human%20kingdom\"&gt;human kingdom&lt;/a&gt; that allied with the Horde during the second war and later temporarily allied with the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They have since engaged in hostile relations with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;Death knight order&lt;/a&gt; - Order of undead magic users created from the corpses of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the spirits of the slain orcish &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; - Was one of the original orc clans and part of the Horde of Draenor. All of its members seem to have been forcibly turned into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; - A clan formed by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; for his personal protection. It later betrayed the Horde to look for the Tomb of Sargeras and was slaughtered by the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;. A few ex-members such as Drak'thul survive but none known have rejoined the Horde. They captured &lt;a href=\"giant%20turtle\"&gt;giant turtle&lt;/a&gt;s.\n &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; - A clan led by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall was made the leader of an orc clan after its previous chieftain was executed for disobeying the Shadow Council. The clan's name was then changed to Twilight's Hammer; its original name and that of its former chieftain were stricken from all records. Under Cho'gall's leadership, the clan became increasingly nihilistic and eventually &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;sought the destruction&lt;/a&gt; of all creation. This was true of their clan even before the orcs joined the pact with &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\n &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;) / &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Warchief Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;) \n &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Chieftain Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Chieftain Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Chieftain Durotan&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Chieftain Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Chieftain Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; - \nUnknown leadership - \n &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Chieftain Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Chieftain Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Hurkan%20Skullsplinter\"&gt;Chieftain Hurkan Skullsplinter&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Chieftain Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Chieftain Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Chieftain Kargath&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Mogor\"&gt;Mogor&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Chieftain Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Chieftain Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Chieftain Dal'rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Chieftain Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Steamwheedle\"&gt;Trade Prince Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt; \nIn the RPG.\nHistory of the Horde.\nThe Horde's history begins in hellfire, when the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was contacted by an extraplanar being called &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul was tricked (much like the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; had been) into thinking that &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was a spirit. Though he had dedicated much of his life to balance and nature, Ner'zhul was lulled by the archdemon's offers of power and was convinced to abandon his teachings in favor of a new path: that of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. The consequences were dire. Once he had learned the basics of manipulating this new infernal magic, his fame grew. Others soon abandoned the old ways to follow his new, quicker path to the manipulation of the natural world.\nIt took years before Ner'zhul realized his error. By this time he had convinced many to follow his dark path, and the orcs waged war against the draenei. Ner'zhul helped in the first efforts to unify the Horde into a cohesive unit, but when he saw what had become of his race \u2014 and what it was still becoming \u2014 he denied Kil'jaeden. He refused to compel the orcs to drink demon blood. Kil'jaeden, furious, found a new pawn in the form of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, one of Ner'zhul's strongest apprentices, who shared none of his master's honor or compassion. Where Ner'zhul had been held back by a lingering feeling of guilt and regret, Gul'dan's greed and ambition allowed him to grow even more powerful and cruel than his former master. He became Kil'jaeden's instrument of destruction on Draenor, leading the newly founded Horde to levels of brutality never previously conceived of by the orc race. He did not have Ner'zhul's compunctions and convinced the orcs to drink the blood of the demonic pit lord &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;, which irrevocably tainted the orcs who consumed it.\nThe orcs, the traditional \"fathers\" of the Horde, slaughtered the few other creatures living on their world and turned to fighting each other; at this point, the only race they might have called allies was the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. At this point in time, only the single-headed ogres existed \u2014- massive, single-minded warriors who served as little more than walking siege engines for the orcs as they plundered and conquered.\nWith their aggression heightened by demon blood, the orcs easily overpowered the draenei. The ensuing slaughter united the orcs under a single mantle for the first time; thus, the Horde was born. Gul'dan continued to influence the Horde from the sidelines, but he still desired yet more power and influence. To this end, with Kil'jaeden's assistance, he founded the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadow Council was a collection of the most vicious warlocks the Horde had to offer. United, these warlocks found it easy to bend the orcs of the Horde - leaders and peons alike - to their will. The overwhelming majority of the Horde did not even know of the Shadow Council's existence, and this covert existence was the Council's greatest strength. Kil'jaeden, now satisfied with the orcs, cut off contact with them and with Gul'dan. Without significant enemies to fight, the orcs turned on each other. Gul'dan realized that unless he found a new enemy for the Horde, it would consume itself. Soon after this, Gul'dan was contacted by a powerful being known as &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, a possessed &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, offering a world called &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; that was ripe for the picking. Medivh even created a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; connecting the two worlds. Gul'dan orchestrated the orcs to bring their army, the now-massive Horde, through the portal. The construction and use of the first Dark Portal marked the beginning of the Horde's invasion of Azeroth, and thus the start of the First War.\nBy this time, a large percentage of the orc race had been affected by the taint of demons and was thoroughly under the sway of Kil'jaeden and his followers. This is not to say there were no virtuous orcs at this time; many heroes of the First War refused any contact with the demons or were blissfully ignorant of their existence. The first successful assaults against the humans lulled the orcs into a false sense of superiority. The orcs, a warrior race, had expected every settlement to be armed; the farms they pillaged during their initial incursions led the orcs to believe that all humans were like the simple farmers they swiftly put to the axe. Thinking an easy victory was at hand, the orcs moved toward &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; at Gul'dan's urging; Gul'dan believed if he took Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; would grant him the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormwind proved an overwhelming shock to the Horde. The &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; guarding the city's entrance put up the first fight the orcs had seen, but they still managed to push their way through the gates. By the time they realized that this minimal resistance was a trap, it was far too late. Armored cavalry flanked the Horde's disorganized group, crushing warriors under the hooves of their mounts (creatures unfamiliar to the Orcish Horde) and striking down even the mightiest of orcs with their lances and blades. The orcs learned to call these mounted warriors &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and cursed the world that had cost them victory for the first time. Shamed, the orcs retreated, hounded by these knights of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt; every step of the way. Gul'dan concealed the final steps of the orc retreat with a wall of impenetrable fog; this simple spell may have saved the Horde from complete destruction.\nFurious, the warchiefs blamed each other for the failure, and the Horde's fractured remains threatened to tear asunder the entire organization. Gul'dan knew he needed to act quickly to salvage what he could; to this end, he convinced the Shadow Council to do something unheard of. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;; he would lead the entirety of the orc race, not just his own (already formidable) clan. Many challenged the mighty Blackhand in these early days, but all were crushed, either by Blackhand's own prowess or Gul'dan's shadowy enforcers. Another unusual player emerged from the darkness at this time: &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, the now-legendary &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; assassin. Garona was a lowly servant of Gul'dan, tasked with recording the war in writing; the mighty orc warriors held little value in reading and writing, and the warlocks had little interest in spending their time chronicling history.\nThe humans proved to have even more tricks up their sleeves; the archmagi of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the priests of &lt;a href=\"Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; added much-needed magical support to the human armies as the battle was joined in earnest. It seemed that the catastrophic assault on Stormwind may have cost the orcs too much, but at a key point in the battles, the mighty Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; disappeared. In Lothar's absence, the human forces were left with inferior leadership and fell back to Stormwind's walls. Anduin returned for only a short time, routing the orcs briefly, before disappearing again; it was learned later that he had initially sought the &lt;a href=\"%3ATome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;:Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, but his second departure was far more significant. With help from Garona and the apprentice mage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar slew his life-long friend, the traitor Medivh, in his tower. Gul'dan attempted to wrest the secret of Sargeras's Tomb from Medivh's mind as the Guardian died, but a psychic backlash slammed Gul'dan as Medivh perished.\nAt the same time, Garona infiltrated Stormwind, where she assassinated the mighty King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; before Lothar had a chance to return. With the king slain, morale fell, and Stormwind fell with it. Lothar arrived only in time to gather the surviving forces and retreat to the north; the orcs had won the First War.\nVictory cost the orcs much; while Gul'dan remained comatose, Orgrim Doomhammer gained the title of Backstabber by slaying Blackhand and taking the mantle of Warchief of the Horde. While Orgrim was unusually loyal for an orc, he had uncovered the existence of the Shadow Council, and the truth about their manipulations of Blackhand. Doomhammer led a surprise assault on the citadel where the Shadow Council resided and slaughtered nearly every warlock. Gul'dan awoke with a blade at his neck, and was forced to pledge his fealty to Doomhammer, whispering promises of vengeance under his breath.\nThe orcs followed the humans north, enjoying the conquest of yet more land. The fledgling Alliance rose to combat them, but the Horde too proved capable of finding allies. The forest trolls had long hated the humans and elves, but proud Zul'jin initially refused to join with the Horde; this changed when the troll leader was captured by human forces in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, and rescued at &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s command. With trolls, ogres, and orcs fighting side by side it was not long before the enterprising goblins saw the potential profit in aiding them. Dark magic brought the Horde the remainder of their allies.\nGul'dan was furious at the slaughter of his council, but he found little difficulty in training others to follow his path. Kil'jaeden whispered secrets to him again for the first time since Medivh's coming, and at the demon lord's coaxing, he learned to command the dead. Gul'dan learned to stretch his consciousness into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and found the souls of his fellow warlocks eagerly awaiting a new host. His first attempts at resurrection and raising the dead met with failure; the flesh of his necrolytes and apprentice warlocks proved too weak to house the spirits of these ancient warlocks. When the Horde laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, they were repelled for a time by a massive artifact; a powerful &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;, enchanted with ancient magic of unknown origin. Gul'dan perverted the artifact, slicing it into great slabs to construct the first &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan called his minions to the altar, sacrificing many of them in dark rituals to ensure his success. His efforts were not without fruit; Gul'dan first experimented with the living, and used the runestone's magic to create a new breed of warlock that would not so easily fall to Doomhammer's swords: the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, the first of these new ogres, was fanatically loyal to Gul'dan for his gift. Together, the two created yet more ogre magi and prepared for the next step of their plan. Doomhammer, having betrayed his own master, was highly suspicious of others; Gul'dan convinced him that &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, the sons of Blackhand, planned to turn against him. Doomhammer disbanded Rend and Maim's legions of &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s and dispersed them to save his own hide, but this weakened the Horde's mounted cavalry in the process.\nGul'dan, of course, had the solution \u2014 he would create an army of undead riders, loyal only to Doomhammer. This concept pleased the warchief, although he clearly did not trust the warlock, and with good reason. This situation bought Gul'dan time, however; and while his initial experiments with Cho'gall failed, the two gathered orcs and ogres around them, forming the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans. As time went on, Orgrim demanded results; Gul'dan, not yet prepared for war with the warchief, searched desperately for a solution. He realized he had been working only with the bodies of his own ground troops; he needed trained riders, with bodies built for mounted combat. In a stroke of insane genius, he placed the spirit of one of his former companions, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, in the corpse of a mighty human knight. To his surprise, Gorefiend took control of the body, and perhaps more importantly, still proved capable of channeling dark magic while his spirit was encased in the skeletal shell. Thus, the first &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; was born.\nEven with death knights and ogre magi, the Horde suffered many defeats early in the Second War; this could partially be attributed to the strength of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, but the main reason was far more blatant: the Alliance had air support. The mighty &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; rained lightning from the heavens on the helpless ground forces of the Horde, evading the counterattacks of the Horde's spellcasters and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"axethrower\"&gt;axethrower&lt;/a&gt;s. The veterans of the war knew the Horde desperately needed their own beasts of the skies but found none to answer their call.\nThen an orc chieftain, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt;, through mysterious resources, uncovered an ancient talisman said to be capable of tremendous wonders. The only trouble was that it did not respond to shamanistic spellwork, no matter how great Zuluhed's effort. That led Zuluhed to turn to the only warlock he felt he could trust, a warrior loyal to &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. Thus &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; inherited the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. With this object, the orc was able to call upon great feats of magical power \u2014 but the Soul's true secret was the power to control &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn time, even the mighty &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonqueen, succumbed to the power of the Demon Soul. Chained within &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Nekros forced her to produce an army to serve as the airborne cavalry of the Horde. The &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; served the orcs, knowing their queen would be destroyed if they did not, with only a handful managing to escape or resist. &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt; took credit for Nekros's victory, and his Dragonmaw Clan led the reds to war. With the dragons at the orcs' sides, the Second War ground to a near stalemate; but somehow the Knights of the Silver Hand and their allies managed a push to the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, led by none other than the champion Anduin Lothar.\nLothar was separated from the main body of his troops in this, perhaps one of the greatest of all of Azeroth's battles. Amid the chaos, he fought with Orgrim Doomhammer; some say he was defeated in single combat, others claim that he was ambushed and slain by a group. Regardless, his blade fell from his dead grasp, though it did not lie cold for long. One of Lothar's lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, took up the rallying cry, \"For Lothar!\" which spread among the troops of the Alliance until the piercing howl struck fear even into the hearts of the mighty orcs. Turalyon's unbridled assault pushed the Horde back again and again, forcing them all the way to the Dark Portal.\nSomewhere around this time, the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, learned the truth of Gul'dan's contact with demons. He spoke against Gul'dan, and the Horde banished his clan to the frozen tundra of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in punishment. In time, he gathered more information and proof, and sought Orgrim Doomhammer. He explained to Doomhammer the truth about Kil'jaeden, and Doomhammer believed him and sent Durotan off for a few days with an armed escort while he considered what to do. One of the guards, however, was a traitor; he called in assassins who killed Durotan and his wife, leaving only their infant child alive. Lord &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, a cunning man, found the baby in the forest and took the orc child as a slave, naming him \"&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAt the Dark Portal, the orcs stood proud, with Doomhammer refusing to retreat through the swirling gateway. As the battle raged on, Khadgar, once the apprentice of Medivh and now the Archmage of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde\"&gt;Nethergarde&lt;/a&gt;, began to channel the greatest destructive spell seen since the days of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands had died that day, but as a glow appeared in the sky above the portal, human and orc alike stopped for a moment to watch in wonder and anticipation. The pillar of light that Khadgar called pierced the portal and sundered it, shattering the massive gateway and the morale of the orcs along with it. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; led a retreat; the Alliance captured all others, including the Warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer.\nAs the humans pursued Kilrogg's remaining forces, Gul'dan led the remainder of his clan to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, no longer willing to wait to claim his godhood. There, he released the demons within the tomb, and a mighty battle ensued. It is unknown what demon finally took the warlock's life, but only a handful of his clan lived to tell the tale. Gul'dan never found the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;; it's likely the world would have been shattered if he had succeeded in his goal.\nKilrogg Deadeye, the last orc hero of the First War, led his people to another portal to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;; the orcs gathered several artifacts in order to summon the portal for their retreat. The Alliance, fearful that the Horde would return with greater numbers later on, sent some of their bravest to follow Kilrogg through the portal. With the Alliance hot on their heels, the Bleeding Hollow Clan reunited with the orcs who had remained on Draenor, and they braced themselves for a new battle.\nKilrogg found the orcs of Draenor under the control of Ner'zhul, the ancient shaman who had once refused Kil'jaeden. Many ancient clans were still strong in Draenor, and the humans found themselves outnumbered; Ner'zhul was quick to put Kilrogg's experience to good use, and they coordinated to devise the best possible tactics to defeat the humans.\nThe fighting on Draenor had not raged for long before Ner'zhul made an unusual decision that would change the course of history. The shaman no longer found Azeroth or Draenor suitable for his people, so he used his immense power to open another portal \u2014 and another, and another, each to a different world, potentially ripe for conquest. He didn't realize that Draenor couldn't handle that many portals at once. The world began to tear itself apart. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the humans who had followed the orcs through the portal thought that was pretty keen at first, until they realized that if Draenor exploded, the explosion might leak back through their portal and hit Azeroth as well.\nThe humans set up camp at the last portal back to Azeroth and defended it with their lives \u2014 not to protect the portal, but to shield Khadgar as he prepared the spell to destroy it. Nearly every human was slain as the orcs turned their full might upon the small group, but their lives bought the archmage enough time to finish his spell and shatter the portal. With no known world to retreat to, the orcs and humans fled to a random portal; some failed, and died in the blast as Draenor combusted. What remained of the orcs' homeworld was a blasted continent of floating red rocks in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, with only a handful of survivors, most of whom were horribly wounded. Kil'jaeden plucked Ner'zhul and his followers from Draenor after they entered one of their portals and stuffed him into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where he became the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;."}

In an effort to aid the troubled &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that foreshadowed the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; opened a part of the old city and attempted a titan ritual to commune with the earth but was turned into diamond. He stood rooted on what has become known as Magni's Dais. A long and winding path leads over the lava to the two doors of &lt;a href=\"Aegrim%27s%20Study\"&gt;Aegrim's Study&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Old Ironforge has always been present in-game, its entrance was originally closed off until \"\".\nHistory.\nThe Shattering.\nAfter Magni received &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; stone tablets from &lt;a href=\"Brann\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered the sealed gates of Old Ironforge to be opened for a ritual. The key took two dwarves to lift, and it took a ladder for them to reach the lock. After venturing through the door, a linear path led &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muninn%20Magellas\"&gt;Muninn Magellas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reyna%20Stonebranch\"&gt;Reyna Stonebranch&lt;/a&gt; to a large cavern. A surprisingly new-looking carpeted path led upwards to a broad platform capable of holding a large group, and an unadorned stone path led downwards. The ceiling is made of diamond. With an incantation scroll and a potion, Magni performed the ritual to become one with the earth. While listening to the incantation, Anduin called this place the \"heart of the earth\". The ritual seemingly worked, but turned him into a solid diamond statue.\nCataclysm.\nIn the opened Old Ironforge could be found a petrified Magni, Advisor Belgrum, &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Guard%20Dunstad\"&gt;Honor Guard Dunstad&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Ironforge guards&lt;/a&gt; and three large tomes being present. Orphaned children wanted to see the statue during the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;. Belgrum and Dunstad would give explanations to Alliance adventurers and the children about what had happened to Magni.\nLegion.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; started, &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; paid a visit to her crystallized father in Old Ironforge. All these years, Magni had watched over his daughter, but at this moment, Magni finally awakened. News spread through the city that the king under the mountain had returned, and Muradin and Falstad arrived to witness it. It was &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; herself who had released Magni, as she had foreseen the Legion's return. He asked for the dwarves to prepare themselves, and set out to warn the rest of the Alliance of the demons' imminent return.\nAs a result, Dunstad moved to the throne room, but Belgrum remained to explain the absence of Magni to visitors.\nSince Magni broke free from his crystalline chamber, glittering shards from his liberation now litter the floor and stairs.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhen King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and her son &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran&lt;/a&gt; took him to the chamber. Dagran found the scroll Belgrum read during the ritual and began reading it as well. As the two monarchs conversed, a guard found them and told them that Magni arrived to the city.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe long and winding path now leads to the &lt;a href=\"Aegrim%27s%20Study\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aegrim%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Aegrim Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. An adventurer was tasked with retrieving some of the crystal bits left behind by Magni when he awakened, to help reforge Aegrim's armor.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Hall of Thanes is a massive, natural cavern complex located in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s lowest depths. The area is a true marvel of organic stone formation: no &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; has touched this cavern with pick or chisel. Ironforge's kings are buried in the Hall of Thanes, and the old throne is here as well. Also within this cavernous area is the ancient, weathered &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Forge\"&gt;Iron Forge&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 perhaps the greatest &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifact ever unearthed. The dwarves do not use this holy anvil, but keep it near their honored dead and the seat of their power. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that as dwarves uncover more truths about their ancestry, they will find greater uses for the Iron Forge. He believes the titans must have given it to them for a reason.\nSpeculation.\nConsidering that the area is also known as the Assembly of Thanes, the &lt;a href=\"mountain%20king\"&gt;mountain king&lt;/a&gt;s of old might have met here before the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, it might also be that old kings are buried here as was the case in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;."}

The low elevation lava at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt; also used to be a source, but by patch &lt;a href=\"3.1.3\"&gt;3.1.3&lt;/a&gt;, fishing in this lava began yielding the error message, \"There aren't any fish here.\" \nFor Alliance, your best chance at getting this fish, while the off-hand stat bonus is still useful, is to train up your fishing skill in Ironforge. Do your initial fishing in a starting zone lake; Ironforge is frustrating when starting. Somewhere around fishing skill level 25 to 50, depending on your tolerance for missed fish, switch to fishing in Ironforge. Use a &lt;a href=\"Shiny%20Bauble\"&gt;Shiny Bauble&lt;/a&gt; lure at first. Ironforge requires a fishing skill (with a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20lure\"&gt;fishing lure&lt;/a&gt;) of 75 to have no fish get away. Up to skill 75, each point of skill short is a percent \"fish got away\".\nHorde version.\nThe Horde version of this fish is &lt;a href=\"Old%20Crafty\"&gt;Old Crafty&lt;/a&gt; which can be caught within the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. These two fish are the only off-hand trophy fish that give a stat bonus, both give +5 to Stamina.\nAchievement.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironjaw%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Old Ironjaw (achievement)&lt;/a&gt;"}

To reach him, you must dive into the water around Moonshrine Sanctum and &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; under the left side of the ruins. Thankfully the fight isn't tough and as long as you're careful not to run out of &lt;a href=\"breath\"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt; you shouldn't have any problems. Having a Warlock or Shaman to cast Water Breathing is helpful here. If you are unable to do this, it will be difficult to kill him quickly enough because the cave he is located in does not have an opening to the surface for air. Kiting him out of the cave may be a better option than fighting him inside it in this case.\nAlso note that Serra'kis regularly heals himself for a small portion of his health using a melee ability. With decent dps, this will not be a problem. Those groups with unusually low dps may not be able to overcome his healing, as can be the case when a weak group of 3 or 4 attempt Serra'kis."}

If you don't clear everything up to the room where you start the escort quest, there is a good chance that you will get adds and &lt;a href=\"Cryo-Engineer%20Sha%27heen\"&gt;Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen&lt;/a&gt; will die. If he dies, you can't redo the escort quest during that run - you will have to reset the instance.\nBefore you start this quest, make sure all party members who are on the prerequisite quest, &lt;a href=\"Safety%20is%20Job%20One\"&gt;Safety is Job One&lt;/a&gt;, hand it in before starting the escort quest (click on the Ethereal Transporter Control Panel - the floating cube). Then talk to him and start the escort quest.\nAs with all escort quests, stay near the NPC you are escorting - &lt;a href=\"Cryo-Engineer%20Sha%27heen\"&gt;Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen&lt;/a&gt;. If he gets too far away from you, you will fail the quest. So if you sit down to drink or eat, you may fail the quest. See above.\nTranscript.\nWhen the first member of the party clicks on the Ethereal Transporter Control Panel, &lt;a href=\"Cryo-Engineer%20Sha%27heen\"&gt;Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen&lt;/a&gt; appears.\nSeveral Consortium Laborers appear to help Sha'heen collect items to be teleported.\nHe walks to the glowing pillar in the center of the chamber.\n&lt;a href=\"Cryo-Engineer%20Sha%27heen\"&gt;Sha'heen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Consortium%20Laborer\"&gt;Consortium Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s begin to walk towards the previous circular room to the east.\nHe walks over to the nether collector in the middle of the chamber.\nAt this point, the first set of mobs spawn - 2 &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Theurgist\"&gt;Ethereal Theurgist&lt;/a&gt;s and 2 &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Spellbinder\"&gt;Ethereal Spellbinder&lt;/a&gt;s. Once Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen has finished with the nether collector here, he helps in the fight.\nOnce you have killed the first set of mobs that spawn,\nHe walks north into the Crescent Hall. The nether collector is on the west side of the curved room.\nAt this point, the second set of mobs spawn - 2 &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Ethereal Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and 2 &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Crypt%20Raider\"&gt;Ethereal Crypt Raider&lt;/a&gt;s. Again, once Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen has finished with the nether collector here, he helps in the fight.\nAfter you kill the second set of mobs, he walks north into the large rectangular chamber. When you enter, one &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Terror\"&gt;Nexus Terror&lt;/a&gt; has already spawned. During the fight with it, a second &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Terror\"&gt;Nexus Terror&lt;/a&gt; will spawn. If you pull the first one towards the southern part of the chamber (where you just entered), you can kill it without aggroing the second, and then take the second one by itself. Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen says the following during the fight:\nThe nether collector is at the north end of the room. Once the Nexus Terrors are dead, he walks over there and empties the collector. He gives you thirty seconds to rest - enough time to eat and drink - before moving on towards the entrance, and the last encounter.\nSha'heen walks out of the room through the west corridor, back into the next room where you battled the first boss, &lt;a href=\"Pandemonius\"&gt;Pandemonius&lt;/a&gt;. When you reach the semi-circular area in the middle of the room,\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Lord%20Xiraxis\"&gt;Shadow Lord Xiraxis&lt;/a&gt;, the boss, runs out of the corridor straight ahead, the one that leads to the exit.\nAt this point, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Lord%20Xiraxis\"&gt;Shadow Lord Xiraxis&lt;/a&gt; turns hostile and attacks. This fight is much like fighting the last boss in &lt;a href=\"Mana-Tombs\"&gt;Mana-Tombs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Shaffer\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;, except that aren't any &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Beacon\"&gt;Ethereal Beacon&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Cryo-Engineer%20Sha%27heen\"&gt;Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen&lt;/a&gt; will help you here from the start, as he as already visited all the nether collectors and wants to return to &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt;.\nKill Shadow Lord Xiraxis to complete the quest objective.\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Lord%20Xiraxis\"&gt;Shadow Lord Xiraxis&lt;/a&gt; does not drop &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Shard\"&gt;Spirit Shard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLeave the instance and turn the quest in to &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Haramad\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Haramad&lt;/a&gt;."}

The treachery of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; led to the death of his son, &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt;. After that loss, he entered a state of mourning and took to guarding the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Rymek\"&gt;Rymek&lt;/a&gt; approached the green dragonflight, Somnikus spoke at length with him and found a mutual understanding, even comparing him to Solethus. He placed his trust in the blue dragonkin and allowed him to see the portal with his own eyes.\nOnce Rymek revealed his true form, Somnikus felt great remorse for his role in the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;' assault on the Dream. &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; agreed to a plan that involved a theory conceived by her son, &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, to bring &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; back from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. By doing so, they would both regain the Aspect that was taken from them and defend the Emerald Dream. Gerithus's research, however, revealed one unavoidable cost: to bring Ysera back would require a sacrifice. Someone would have to take her place. Somnikus eagerly volunteered, for he did not feel it was right that he continued to live while his son did not. The green dragonflight rallied their druidic and centaur allies to defend the Ancient Bough and opened a portal to Ardenweald to meet with Ysera's spirit.\nYsera confirmed that an exchange would be possible, but told Somnikus that he could not take her place. He, like all dragons, was not predestined to come to Ardenweald upon death. Ysera's powerful connection to the Dream made her a great spirit of nature, the kind that did travel to Ardenweald, but Somnikus was not part of that cycle. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; took up the bond that was made with the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;. He remained in Ardenweald so that a reborn Ysera could return to Azeroth via the Emerald Dream.\nEnraged by Rymek's betrayal, Somnikus flew to Lunedane ahead of the other green dragons and was grievously wounded.

However, Song, who had been one of the most promising students of the late rebel leader &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt;, calmed their bloodlust. Having memorized many of Kang's philosophies, the secretive lorekeeper retold Kang's stories over and over again to the liberated slaves in order to remind them that Kang sought true justice, not revenge.\nSong walked from one end of the fallen &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; to the other for the rest of his life, sharing the stories of Kang's wisdom and encouraging everyone he met to find emotional balance within themselves. Others soon began to follow in his footsteps, and these so-called &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Lorewalkers&lt;/a&gt; became skilled storytellers and conflict mediators.\nDuring Song's travels, he became aware of a dark power that lurked below the land: the malevolent spirits known as &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, formed from the lingering essence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. Song hoped that by spreading Kang's teachings, he could help the various races nullify the sha and limit the Old God's influence."}

The manipulators of the Shek'zeer are too impatient to form a proper bond with their kunchong.\nTheir laziness will cost them dearly.\nStrike this tuning fork near the dread kunchong in the clutches - watch as they reel in confusion and lash out at their masters.

In a fit of rage, Thorim threw his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;, at Arngrim, who was in the middle of a battle against a clan of &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;frost dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion of Krolmir striking the ground killed all those nearby and froze the entire tableau for all time, which is known today as &lt;a href=\"Thunderfall\"&gt;Thunderfall&lt;/a&gt;.

Roused from his stupor, he vowed to take the fight against Loken. He enlisted the adventurers to help him to make up for his past sins and to regain the trust of the Sons of Hodir. Members of the Sons of Hodir also encouraged adventurers to aid them in order to heal the rift between Thorim and the rest of the frost giants.\nWhile the Sons of Hodir were grateful for the adventurers' aid, they remarked that much had to be done in order to repair their relationship with the keeper, with some being even doubtful that the relationship could be repaired. While Thorim prepared for the battle, adventurers were able to further prove their own worth to the Sons of Hodir, which allowed the hearts of the frost giants to soften to Thorim. He eventually made peace with them, and they in turn have helped him reach out to other frost giants to make amends.\nAfter the clash between the brothers ended with Loken capturing Thorim, King Jokkum sent the adventurers to avenge Thorim by venturing into &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, in order to kill Loken.\nMain quest chain.\nThe following quest chain will give you reputation for the Sons of Hodir.\nReputation.\nThe player will start as with The Sons of Hodir.

Following his example, they stayed in Draenor, or &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; as it is now called, to safeguard Azeroth from demonic threats.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;reopened&lt;/a&gt;, the Sons of Lothar were reunited with the Grand Alliance and led the Alliance's crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;.

A number of large internment camps, meant to house the captive orcs, were constructed in southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Guarded by both the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and the veteran soldiers of the Alliance, the camps proved to be a great success. Though the captive orcs were tense and anxious to do battle once more, the various camp wardens, based at the old prison-fortress of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, kept the peace and maintained a strong semblance of order.\nHowever, on the hellish world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, a new orcish army prepared to strike at the unsuspecting Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the former mentor of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, rallied the remaining orc clans under his dark banner. Aided by the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, the old shaman planned to open a number of portals on Draenor that would lead the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to new, unspoiled worlds. To power his new portals, he needed a number of enchanted artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To procure them, Ner'zhul reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and sent his ravenous servants charging through it.\nThe new Horde, led by veteran chieftains such as &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; clan), surprised the Alliance defense forces and rampaged through the countryside. Under Ner'zhul's surgical command, the orcs quickly rounded up the artifacts that they needed and fled back to the safety of Draenor.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, convinced that the orcs were preparing a new invasion of Azeroth, assembled his most trusted lieutenants. He ordered General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and the archmage, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, to lead an expedition through the Dark Portal to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. Turalyon and Khadgar's forces marched into Draenor and repeatedly clashed with Ner'zhul's clans upon the ravaged &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; over the next several months. They founded &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; as their primary base. The Sons of Lothar received erratic shipments of supplies and manpower from their homeworld then, as the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; switched sides several times during the late stages of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance Expedition eventually went on the offensive, but even with the aid of the high elf &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and the veteran soldier &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar was unable to prevent Ner'zhul from opening his portals to other worlds.\nNer'zhul finally opened his portals to other worlds, but he did not foresee the terrible price he would pay. The portals' tremendous energies began to tear the very fabric of Draenor apart. As Turalyon's forces fought desperately to return home to Azeroth, the world of Draenor began to buckle in upon itself. Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye, realizing that Ner'zhul's mad plans would doom their entire race, rallied the remaining orcs and escaped back to the relative safety of Azeroth.\nOn Draenor, Turalyon and Khadgar agreed to make the ultimate sacrifice by destroying the Dark Portal from their side. Though it would cost their lives, and the lives of their companions, they knew that it was the only way to ensure Azeroth's survival. Even as Hellscream and Deadeye hacked their way through the human ranks in a desperate bid for freedom, the Dark Portal exploded behind them. For them, and the remaining orcs on Azeroth, there would be no going back.\nNer'zhul and his loyal Shadowmoon clan passed through the largest of the newly created portals, as massive volcanic eruptions began to break Draenor's continents apart. The burning seas rose up and roiled the shattered landscape as the tortured world was finally consumed in a massive, apocalyptic explosion.\nAftermath.\nMany believed that they were killed by the cataclysm that destroyed Draenor; others believe they escaped to other worlds within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; through the powerful rifts opened by the shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;; and some others believe that they survived in the remnants of the world. After the reconstruction of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, five statues in the likeness of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; were placed within its &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; to inspire future heroes of the Alliance. To honor the leaders for making the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of Azeroth, these heroes of the Alliance Expedition were memorialized in stone to commemorate their heroic deeds.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was reopened by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;. In his wake, legions of demons came spilling through into Azeroth. The forces of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; were quickly rallied, and with aid from the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and numerous &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s the demons were pushed back through the Portal, securing it once more. The adventurers, not satisfied with securing only one side of the Portal, pressed through to Outland after Kazzak where they discovered what became of Draenor.\nVestiges of the Sons of Lothar, veterans of the Alliance that first came into Draenor, have steadfastly held on to their Hellfire outpost of &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt; and other Alliance strongholds. According to Khadgar, after the Sons of Lothar were trapped in this broken wasteland now known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, they did their best to survive. Over time they sensed that a new evil was closing in around them from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and believed the demons once again sought to claim Outland. They are now joined by the armies from Stormwind and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and together, they continue to fight demonic and native aggression, while also striving to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s Burning Crusade. Force Commander &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; leads the Sons of Lothar's campaign in Honor Hold, while &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; patrols the skies of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, is named after Alleria and is where most high elves reside, and &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;, is where the mages of the expedition settled. Sometime before the Dark Portal's reopening, Khadgar had used his magic to reach into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and found the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. He convinced them to come to Outland to aid in stopping the Legion's incursion on the shattered planet. Khadgar can be found in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, acting as an envoy to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; to coordinate with the faction and aid them in providing some stability and protection for Outland. Only Alleria and Turalyon have yet to be found as they were presumed lost during some horrific battle with the Burning Legion. Their son, &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt;, believes them to be still alive and continues his search for them. He traveled to Honor Hold with the Alliance armies and offered Commander Trollbane his services.\nAlthough many died during the Sons of Lothar's military campaigns, some continued to haunt their fallen holdings as restless &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. The Alliance soldiers stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Armory\"&gt;Expedition Armory&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and became the spectral &lt;a href=\"Unyielding\"&gt;Unyielding&lt;/a&gt;. The mages of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt; too were decimated; since the Kirin'Var mages died from a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; detonated by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; forces. Following the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; assault, the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naberius\"&gt;Naberius&lt;/a&gt;, had enslaved the fallen &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; as enthralled spirits.\nThe floating remains of Draenor, now known as Outland, has become a warzone. The Alliance and the Horde have occasionally skirmished for political reasons, but the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, savage Outland natives, and agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; have all threatened the Sons of Lothar with their machinations to dominate Outland. The Sons of Lothar employed adventurers of the Alliance to secure Outland from these threats and tame the shattered planet's savage lands.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and led the Alliance forces in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skuerto\"&gt;Skuerto&lt;/a&gt; complained about a \"pencil-pusher\" holding up Danath Trollbane's return to Azeroth.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; finally left Outland and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, marking the return of all of the expeditionary leaders to Azeroth at last.\nDuring the course of the conflict, it was discovered from a relic known as &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt; that Turalyon and Alleria were still alive, having become leaders in the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar reunited with the two of them on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and told them that Danath and Kurdran were both still alive. The three resolved that the Sons of Lothar would hold a reunion feast when the invasion was over.\nLeadership.\nThough Turalyon was the Supreme Commander of the Alliance following the death of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance Expedition itself was led by Khadgar, who had called for the army to be rallied at Nethergarde and led into the Dark Portal to Draenor. As Khadgar's task was by far the most important - to retrieve the Book of Medivh and seal the Dark Portal to save Azeroth from destruction - Turalyon and his lieutenants deferred to him when it came to ways to achieve that task. Otherwise, the command of the Expedition's forces fell under Turalyon's purview.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Alliance Expedition is also known as the Draenor Expedition."}

The threat level reduction increases with rank. Rank 1 has a 5-yard range, but every higher rank has a 10-yard range. \nThis spell is very mana-intensive; don't be surprised if you see your Succubus run out of mana frequently while using Soothing Kiss. \nSoothing Kiss can be set on &lt;a href=\"auto-cast\"&gt;auto-cast&lt;/a&gt;. The AI will cast Soothing Kiss when the Succubus gets aggro (or if a player hits her). It is not recommended if you wish to have the Succubus tank. \nThis spell is also of limited utility in solo-PvE; using this spell will cause the mob to attack the next target on the aggro list, and while soloing this target will undoubtedly be you. It is thus not recommended in situations when the player does not want to take damage. "}

Basically, the clock started when you received your first one, and did not reset until they disappeared or you had consumed them all. \nThis aspect of how the item works has not changed. Your stack of these will still be treated as a lump that all expire at the same time. In fact, by trading all of your candies to another player and getting new ones from a Handful of Candy, your old candies' expiration timers will be set to equal the timers on your new candy when they are traded back to you.\nThis item does not &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt; and can be transferred.
