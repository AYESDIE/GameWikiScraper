He broke the bodies of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, opened their bones and ate their marrow to prove they were not gods, and raised up their skeletons so others could see his victory. He built his hall too large for any family to fill, and soon his home was an empire.\nBackground.\nGog lived one thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yonzi\"&gt;Yonzi&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a small group of remnants from the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; that had been destroyed two hundred years before, learned of a critical cache of Apexis artifacts buried beneath the ruins of an Apexis settlement on the northwest coast of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; now occupied by the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; slaves. Ogron were too violent to barter and bargain with, but the ogres were more intelligent than the ogron, and more importantly, angered by their enslavement.\nThe arakkoa approached the ogres in secret and began to teach them the ways of the arcane. Because the ogres were descendants of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; who was in turn a creation of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, they were naturally attuned to the arcane. The arakkoa had never seen new spellcasting techniques developed so effortlessly and were delighted. One of the first ogres to master the power was Gog, who the arakkoa believed to be the perfect leader to incite rebellion. Gog did rebel, but not against the ogron: he targeted the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, whom the ogron and ogres revered and feared as gods. Though stunned, the arakkoa could not argue with the results. Gog did not only kill one gronn with his magic, but several. By his fifth, stories of his deeds were known to all captive ogres on Draenor, erasing their fear of both gronn and ogron. Under Gog, the ogres rose up against their ogron warlords and Gog was renamed Gorgog: \"King Gog\". The city became &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, \"Throne of the King\".\nThe arakkoa quickly moved into Goria to search for &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and artifacts in the ruins Goria was built on, but Gorgog denied them. As a sorcerer himself, he had no interest in giving away any potential source of power. The arakkoa left, but not for long. Yonzi and his arakkoa were infuriated and they decided to take the land by force. They launched a surprise attack on Goria in the dead of night, but Gorgog and his apprentice arcanists, as well as the countless newly freed ogres, fought back. The arakkoa were defeated and Yonzi was captured. His death was slow and gruesome. Despite the promise of undiscovered Apexis crystals, further arakkoa incursions into Gorian lands were few and far between afterward. In the slowly expanding &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; Apexis crystals became highly prized and eagerly sought out by ogre sorcerers."}

However, &lt;a href=\"Chieftain\"&gt;Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; took issue with this and exiled the family from the Warsong camp. Subsequently, Gorgonna and her family wandered the wilderness, until they were eventually ambushed by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; soldiers in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, where their parents were slain and the pair of sisters were taken prisoner and thrown into &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;. Following the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, Gorgonna and Krenna were amongst the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces that loyally followed &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeart of War.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was visiting &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, he got into an argument with Krenna that threatened to turn physical. However Gorgonna was able to step in and break up, as Krenna stormed away, Gorgonna explained to Garrosh her beliefs that the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s must suffer as penance for the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. She further revealed how their parents fought in the wars and drank the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. According to Gorgonna, they committed terrible acts in the name of the Horde, including attacking and murdering the innocent.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShe attempted to keep the damage caused by her sister &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20Krenna\"&gt;Conqueror Krenna&lt;/a&gt;'s heavy-handedness and lack of judgment to a minimum. For instance, Gorgonna sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with a letter to spare &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt;, a captured trapper, from execution. When the troll leatherworker, &lt;a href=\"Hidetrader%20Jun%27ik\"&gt;Hidetrader Jun'ik&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to substitute disguised grizzly hides for &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt; hides (his belief being that there would never be enough worg hide for her troops), Krenna ordered his leg broken and Gorgonna, seeking to make it look real, kicked him in the leg to make it look like she broke it.\nEventually, Krenna discovered Gorgonna's actions and challenged her to a duel to the death, along with the adventurers who aided her. Krenna was killed by Gorgonna and the adventurers in the Pit, and Gorgonna became the new leader of the Hold.\nGorgonna would later remark that with Krenna's death, the Horde was all she had left.\nDragonflight.\nAt some unknown point in time after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, her uncle &lt;a href=\"Gargok\"&gt;Gargok&lt;/a&gt; reached out, wishing to make their family whole again. Gorgonna made her way to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, where she discovered that the Warsong had been shattered by what Garrosh had become. As she found a new place to belong, she eventually proved her strength to all of the clan through &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, and became the clan's new chieftain, where she vowed to never let them lose their honor again. Thus she represented the Warsong at the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the clan leaders gathered inside of the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Barracks\"&gt;Razor Hill Barracks&lt;/a&gt; to pitch their clan to prospective orcish recruits; Gorgonna declared that Lok-Tar Ogar defined the Warsong, how the clan valued skill on the battlefield above all, how the clan was well known for their fearsome battle cries. However, she further stated that, they have learned the lessons of the past, and that they would never again sacrifice honor to achieve victory, with the fall of Garrosh ensuring that. Upon the champion requesting to join the Warsong, Gorgonna was glad to hear it. Se subsequently instructed them with hunting, tracking, and killing &lt;a href=\"Gor%27krosh\"&gt;Gor'krosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Long Knives, without their armor, in order to test their skills in battle. Following their success, Gorgonna accepted the &lt;a href=\"%22Long%20Knife%22\"&gt;\"Long Knife\"&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy on behalf of the clan.\nDuring the feast celebrating orc champions for completing the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, Gorgonna sat with her clan, where she informed &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; that as far as she was concerned he died with honor and continued to serve with honor in undeath. As the Kosh'harg festival neared its ends, Gorgonna cheered orc champions as the champion of their people."}

It was created when the massive giant &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain given life via the elemental powers of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, fell against the &lt;a href=\"Sporemounds\"&gt;Sporemounds&lt;/a&gt;. His corpse became the region of Gorgrond, while his head in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; became known as the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.\nGorgrond is home to the and the industrial heart of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their ancestral home, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, lies near the northern coast. However, the industrial efforts of the Blackrock are dwarfed by the perpetual war that rages across the region. Two groups of creatures, both descended from ancients, fight a furious, unending war to determine what form the region's landscape should take. Along the northern and western side of Gorgrond the mighty &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt; have created a barren desert with rocky mesas and hot-springs bubbling up from the ground. Along the southern and eastern side of the region the savage &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; have created a lush jungle with thick foliage and dangerous animate plant-life that waits to devour those foolish enough to stray into its depths. If either side triumphed over the other, then Gorgrond and all of Draenor would soon be transformed into the victor's favored environment. For the Blackrock, however, this war acts as perfect barricade preventing invasion from the south, allowing them to churn out weapons for the Iron Horde unopposed.\nWhen Draenor became &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Gorgrond was pressed together with &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. While Frostfire was the source of the rock spires that would become synonymous with the region, Gorgrond's presence is still felt through the arid climate and patches of forests.\nHistory.\nAn orcish legend indicates that Gorgrond was once a great &lt;a href=\"Earth%20giant%20%28Draenor%29\"&gt;colossus&lt;/a&gt;, the largest of its kind that has ever walked Draenor. When it fell, its body became the land, its spine the mountains, its blood the ore, and its will the savagery that rules this dangerous land. This myth likely grew from the fact that Gorgrond is actually the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, the massive elemental giant and servant of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, who died in battle against the monstrous &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is said that before &lt;a href=\"Tarlna%20the%20Ageless\"&gt;Tarlna the Ageless&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Gorgrond, the entire region was a barren wasteland.\n&lt;a href=\"Kormrok\"&gt;Kormrok&lt;/a&gt; once ruled Gorgrond, the creatures of the land slinking away from the giant &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;'s destructive fury, before he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and brought to .\nA small orc clan had a settlement at the edge of Gorgrond. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was a part of it, but due to his deformity, he was exiled. When he returned he used his newfound power, the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, to annihilate the settlement along with the entire clan.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAfter withstanding the Iron Horde's initial assault, you'll make your way into Gorgrond with a handful of allies to try to discover the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs' intentions and find a way to thwart any plans the Iron Horde may have. It's a perilous recon mission. If you're an Alliance player, you'll enter the zone from the eastern coast, where you'll get your first taste of things to come. You'll immediately encounter an elite group of draenei known as the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; holed up in a hidden encampment, fighting for their lives against vicious plant-like creatures. When the dust settles, your group will join the Rangari survivors and make a retreat to a clearing deeper in the zone.\nHorde players will enter the zone from the west, where you'll encounter the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. These maniacal orcs are volatile and bloodthirsty, capable of extreme brutality\u2014and as you experience Gorgrond for yourself, you'll begin to understand why. The Laughing Skull orcs are struggling to maintain their ancestral territory, but the brutality of being constantly assaulted by the warring factions of the zone has forged them into bloodthirsty savages.\nIn either case the adventurers will soon find themselves caught up in the ancient war between the Breakers and Primals. Which faction the player faces depends on which outpost building they select. Their efforts will ultimately secure them an ancient, possibly Titan, artifact that will give them control of the forces they defeated. This artifact is then used in an assault on the Iron Docks.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFor years after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was driven off of Draenor, the orcs and draenei lived together in peace. However, eventually, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived and drove the draenei to fanatically spread the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Some orcs joined willingly, while others had the Light forced upon them. The ogres of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%20clan\"&gt;Kor'gall clan&lt;/a&gt; also joined, and together this army became known as the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the led by fought against the Lightbound led by &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenor has been dying, and Gorgrond is considerably less forested than it was only a few decades before. The sky is clouded over, and there is a green tint in the air. The Mag'har and Lightbound both blame the other side for causing this. The Mag'har have reinforced much of Gorgrond with new walls and fortresses, possibly due to the loss of the natural barrier the jungle provided.\nGetting there.\nThe Horde can get here from &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; by traveling east through the &lt;a href=\"Bones%20of%20Agurak\"&gt;Bones of Agurak&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond%20Pass\"&gt;Gorgrond Pass&lt;/a&gt; which enters into the southern area of Gorgrond.\nGeography.\nGorgrond consists of two distinct regions, each reflecting the nature of its inhabitants. The eastern portion of the zone is filled with lush plant life and shimmering pools. It seems idyllic until you realize looks aren't everything. The creatures here are merciless in seeking out anyone who enters their territory. They will capture them, kill them, and then infest their corpses with plant life or mulch them into fertilizer. The northwest region couldn't be more different. It's a dry, barren wasteland, but with a beauty of its own. Rock formations mixed with geysers and sulphur pools create an unconventionally vibrant environment.\nCaution is advised while leveling through this zone as &lt;a href=\"Everbloom%20Wilds\"&gt;Everbloom Wilds&lt;/a&gt; is a level 100 area and &lt;a href=\"the%20Pit\"&gt;the Pit&lt;/a&gt; is a level 100 elite area.\nQuests.\nAlliance.\nChapter 1: We Need an Outpost.\nAfter the Alliance and draenei's total victory at the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Defense of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; proposed that the Alliance take the fight to the Iron Horde in Gorgrond. The champion, Yrel and Maraad led a small expeditionary force to the hostile region to strike at the stronghold and discover any ancient primal secrets or artifacts they might use in the war effort.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; outpost &lt;a href=\"Naielle%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Naielle's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, they found a destroyed village overrun by &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the survivors-- &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20D%27kaan\"&gt;Rangari D'kaan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Kaalya\"&gt;Rangari Kaalya&lt;/a&gt;\u2014asked them to kill the leader of the Botani &lt;a href=\"Harvester%20Ommru\"&gt;Harvester Ommru&lt;/a&gt; and his minions. The Alliance champion unexpectedly found and freed &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; trapped in a thrashing vine while slaying the encroaching flora. While they rounded up the other survivors of the massacre, Thaelin repaired his tank to drive the group to safety while the champion recovered a few other surviving Rangari and Thaelin's mole machine.\nFurther into the jungle, the party found &lt;a href=\"Highpass\"&gt;Highpass&lt;/a&gt; and Thaelin pointed out that this would make an excellent spot to build an outpost. The Alliance champion built a sparring arena and a lumber yard.\nChapter 2a: Supporting Your Garrison (Lumber Yard).\nWith the lumber yard built, the Highpass settlement now needed lumber to feed the mill. &lt;a href=\"Glirin\"&gt;Glirin&lt;/a&gt;, a recruit for the lumber yard, advised the champion that he learned from the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt; of a nearby botani settlement of &lt;a href=\"Tangleheart\"&gt;Tangleheart&lt;/a&gt; where they were quickly growing &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s with a special sap which could be harvested for the necessary timber. The champion set out to collect the sap and clear the botani presence. The champion was dismayed, however, when one of their lumberjacks &lt;a href=\"Frenna\"&gt;Frenna&lt;/a&gt; was found dead after harvesting began. Prior to her death, Frenna did discover that &lt;a href=\"Ontogen%20the%20Harvester\"&gt;Ontogen the Harvester&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for making the ancients hostile to non-primals and the champion took the initiative to slay the botani warlord, securing the area for Highpass to farm lumber for its mill. After returning to Highpass, Glirin joined the champion as a follower.\nChapter 3a: In the Land of Giants (Lumber Yard).\nWith the lumber yard now operational, Thaelin reported that he was not the only &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; that had come to Gorgrond. There were others, but they had gotten separated; Thaelin pleaded with the champion for help finding them. The champion, Thaelin, Yrel and Kaalya set out southward still deeper into the jungle to search for the others. As they were setting up camp, Kaalya made it clear she believed Yrel was naive and did not belong in the wilds of Gorgrond and it was the champion and Thaelin could to keep the two of them from fighting.\nKaalya found the trail of the Dark Irons near the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Razorbloom\"&gt;Razorbloom&lt;/a&gt;. While searching for signs of the dwarves, the champion found a journal entry indicating that the botani were feeding the dwarves plants that would, in time, enslave their bodies. The champion was able to rescue one dwarf that wasn't infested yet-- &lt;a href=\"Burrian%20Coalpart\"&gt;Burrian Coalpart&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but found it was too late for the others and burned their corpses. While collecting vengeance for the dwarves in &lt;a href=\"Evermorn%20Springs\"&gt;Evermorn Springs&lt;/a&gt;, the champion discovered that the botani had even managed to infest an &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;. Recognizing the danger this posed, the champion went out of their way to put the ogron down.\nAfter getting back to camp, Burrian informed the champion that the dwarves had discovered an artifact south of there, but they needed a botani power source to use it. The champion went back into the Botani settlement to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Waters%20of%20Utrophis\"&gt;Waters of Utrophis&lt;/a&gt; to power the artifact. After obtaining the Waters, Burrian directed the party to &lt;a href=\"Moira%27s%20Bastion\"&gt;Moira's Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron base that had become overrun by &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; prior to completion. The champion, Yrel and Kaalya purged the goren from the base and stockpiled ammunition for the expected counter-attack from the &lt;a href=\"primals\"&gt;primals&lt;/a&gt;. Hansel Heavyhands told the champion where the &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Genesaur\"&gt;Will of the Genesaur&lt;/a&gt; was located within the base. After retrieving it, the champion emerged to find a battle with the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt; already underway. With the help of Yrel, Kaalya and the Dark Irons, the champion killed Iyu and gained the means to use the artifact against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The champion returned to Highpass victorious and Kaalya agreed to join the champion as a follower.\nThe time for the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; had come. With the Will of the Genesaur, the Alliance forces had the power to control primals on their side. The siege of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; began quickly, and the genesaurs dominated by the Will slaughtered the Iron Horde grunts that moved to defend their base. Despite heavy losses, the Iron Horde was able to push back just enough to destroy the Will of the Genesaur before their lines broke completely and the Iron Approach was taken. The Alliance had won the battle and the invasion of the Iron Docks proper was ready to begin, but the victory was at the cost of the artifact that could have won them the entire war.\nChapter 2b: Supporting Your Garrison (Sparring Arena).\nWith the sparring ring built, &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Jonaa\"&gt;Rangari Jonaa&lt;/a&gt; informed the champion that a well-known draenei warrior--&lt;a href=\"Gladiator%20Akaani\"&gt;Gladiator Akaani&lt;/a&gt; lived in this region and was presumed dead but reports of a person matching her description were received recently. If she is alive, and could be recruited, she would be a powerful ally and an effective trainer for the arena. The champion set out to investigate and quickly found Akaani and a few close allies holed up near the settlement. Akaani explained that she and the others had escaped the Stonemaul gladiator arenas and agreed to serve the champion if they rescued the other gladiators still enslaved there. The champion rescued &lt;a href=\"Pitfighter%20Vaandaam\"&gt;Pitfighter Vaandaam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27kish\"&gt;Y'kish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruto\"&gt;Bruto&lt;/a&gt; and the four of them rescued and assassinated the chieftain of the Stonemaul, . With the Stonemaul crippled and the other captives freed, the group retreated to Highpass where the rescued fighters joined the champion's service. Pitfighter Vaandaam agreed to join the champion as a follower.\nChapter 3b: In the Land of Giants (Sparring Arena).\nWith the sparring ring open for business, Vindicator Maraad asked the champion to rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Erdanii\"&gt;Rangari Erdanii&lt;/a&gt;, who was dispatched previously to observe the ongoing struggle between the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;. When the champion arrived, they found the Breakers gaining the upper hand and the champion surgically killed a few &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; to rebalance the battle. Erdanii also noticed the arrival of the Iron Horde in central Gorgrond and asked the champion to investigate. The champion found the Iron Horde group and unexpectedly met the of &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. After saving &lt;a href=\"Nisha%20%28dread%20raven%29\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; from an attack by goren, Rexxar invited the champion back to his camp, where Rexxar and the champion nursed her back to health. Rexxar asked the champion to thin the number of Iron Horde grunts nearby, as they were encroaching upon his hunting grounds. While doing so, the champion found an Iron Horde missive\u2014orders to capture additional gronn for the ominous purpose of \"weaponization\".\nRexxar caught Rangari Erdanii lurking about his camp, but the champion vouched for her and he released her. Erdanii reported that she and the champion needed to investigate what the Iron Horde was up to, and the best way to do this would be to use the goren digging tunnels. Erdanii explained that she had learned from the Laughing Skull that the acid the goren leave behind in their wake could be avoided\u2014by making an armor out of their corpses. The champion completed the grisly task, and enduring the stench of the disguise plowed through the goren tunnels to find a dead Iron Horde messenger, whose body gave a clue as to the Iron Horde's operation. With this information in hand, the champion, Rexxar and Erdanii sought out Thukmar, believed to be in the Ogron leader Borogahn's lair. The champion killed Borogahn but found Thukmar already dead. His journal indicated they had found an artifact capable of controlling the Breakers. Unfortunately, the artifact was already gone.\nThe good news is that it wasn't hard to find. Nisha located the Iron Horde base where the artifact was being stored and tested against the captured gronn and magnaron. The champion, Erdanii and Rexxar attacked the base, killed its leader Captain Brak and stole the Heart of the Magnaron from the Iron Horde and immediately moved to use it against the Iron Horde.\nThe time for the assault on the Iron Docks had come. With the Heart of the Magnaron, the Alliance forces had the power to control Breakers on their side. The siege of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; began quickly, and the magnaron dominated by the Heart slaughtered the Iron Horde grunts that moved to defend their base. Despite heavy losses, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; was able to push back just enough to destroy the Heart of the Magnaron before their lines broke completely and the Iron Approach was taken. The Alliance had won the battle and the invasion of the Iron Docks proper was ready to begin, but the victory was at the cost of the artifact that could have won them the entire war. Rangari Erdanii agreed to join the champion as a follower.\nSidestory: Crimson Fen.\nAfter arriving at Highpass and establishing their outpost, Rangari D'kaan asked the Alliance champion to visit the nearby &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Fen\"&gt;Crimson Fen&lt;/a&gt; marsh to check in on a Rangari squad he dispatched to survey the area.\nThe champion arrived to find the entire squad either dead or missing in action, save their leader &lt;a href=\"Khaano\"&gt;Khaano&lt;/a&gt;. Khaano asked the champion for help recovering personal effects from the corpses of the rangari to return to their families and to slay fungal monsters that had abducted them in the first place. While doing so, the Alliance champion found an intact spore pod similar to those growing on the corpses. The champion brought it back to Khaano, who inadvertently opened it, inhaling the spores within.\nKhaano then revealed that the dead were the lucky ones\u2014the spores infested and enslaved the living. Khaano begged the champion to put the survivors out of their misery. Khaano also sends the champion to collect more of the mushrooms. While worried that he is succumbing to the fungus, the champion assists him anyway. Khaano voraciously consumed the mushrooms and went with the champion to the heart of the marsh. There, Khaano attacked and the champion was forced to kill him in self-defense.\nThe champion reported what happened in the Crimson Fen to Rangari D'kaan when they returned to Highpass. While dismayed about the loss of the brave Rangari, D'kaan thanked the champion for looking into it and warned the other Rangari not to venture into the marsh again.\nHorde.\nChapter 1: Your Base, Your Choice.\nAfter the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt;' victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;, proposed that the Horde take the fight to the Iron Horde in Gorgrond. The champion and Durotan led a small expeditionary force to the hostile region to strike at the strongholds there.\nVignettes.\nContinuing the tradition started on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Gorgrond has a huge number of &lt;a href=\"vignette\"&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;s, which are one-time events like killing rare mobs, looting treasure chests, or completing scripted events. Nearly all of the vignettes reward &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt; in addition to an uncommon or rare-quality item.\nGorgrond is unique in that there are treasures (just caches of &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt;, really) that are only available to players who choose one of the two buildings, either the Lumbar Mill or the Sparring Arena. The map below also displays the eight rare elite monsters tracked in the &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond%20Monster%20Hunter\"&gt;Gorgrond Monster Hunter&lt;/a&gt; achievement. For clarity's sake, the &lt;a href=\"Hardened%20Thornvine\"&gt;Hardened Thornvine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odd%20Boulder\"&gt;Odd Boulder&lt;/a&gt; nodes are not displayed on this map. See those articles for a map containing just those resources.\nAlpha Gorgrond.\nDuring the earliest alpha builds, the design of Gorgrond was quite different. As indicated by this quote from the official site, \"\"The industrial development of the Blackrock clan has left the once-glistening oasis of Gorgrond a desolate, rocky badland, its only remaining natural produce the steam that boils up from massive vents beneath the earth. Gorgrond has become the source of the Iron Horde's arsenal\u2014its &lt;a href=\"Foundry\"&gt;foundries&lt;/a&gt; churn out weapons, armor, and torrents of smoke great enough to be seen from neighboring lands.\"\" The zone was to be much more Iron Horde intensive with its wasteland state caused by their activity, not the Breakers. Additionally, the Iron Docks were in a different location (roughly where the Everbloom is in live), as was the Grimrail Depot. The train tracks covered a large portion of the zone, linking the sub-areas together. Finally, the plot seemed to involve entering the zone from the south and going northwards to the docks, and was known to be centered on a massive cannon superweapon, Maraad's growing pathological hatred for orcs, and far more explanation for Doomhammer's actions.\nAlthough the final build removes the majority of these aspects, some vestiges of the old design still remain. Certain paths the railroads took are now ogre-made roadways (such as one spot near Highpass), a location called Blackrock Station likewise became an ogre-made location instead. The terrain used in the Grimrail Depot's train section reflects the older, mixed jungle and desert terrain rather than the current divided version. And the entrance to the Iron Docks still contains hints of the cut Tankworks location, which originally led into the docks and would be the reason for the large rail cart in the former's entrance.\nThe alpha version of Gorgrond was later partially reused for the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; allied race storyline in \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", which takes place several decades after the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; ended, with the southern area of the region now a desert covered with Mag'har fortifications.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Nestled near several hills, the city had thousands of inhabitants and an ocean port. It was built on former &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; territory, and later the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; would build &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in the same location.\nHistory.\nThe place where Goria stood once belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;. Two hundred years after the fall of the Apexis, a group attempted to search for &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and other artifacts in the ruins, but they were occupied by the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; slaves. The ogron could not be reasoned with, but the arakkoa taught the ogres the way of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic and the slaves staged a rebellion. The city became known as Goria, but when the arakkoa attempted to take the Apexis relics, the ogres fought them off. Now sorcerers themselves, the ogres did not want to give up any potential source of power. The first ogre the arakkoa taught, and Goria's first king, was &lt;a href=\"Gorgog%20the%20Gronnslayer\"&gt;Gorgog the Gronnslayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a great war between the ogres and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter laid siege to Goria. Seeing no reason to waste countless lives in an attempt to break down the city's significant fortifications, the orcs were content to keep their distance on the surrounding hills and starve out their enemey. The Gorians believed they could outlast any siege thanks to their ocean port. Due to the tumultuous state of the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; were not as effective in calling on their powers as they once had been.\nHowever, as the months passed, the ogres found themselves unable to maintain their empire. Trade via the ocean was not enough; the ogres needed access to their network of land-based trade routes, which the orcs had severed. &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s revisited their &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; crystals, searching for a way to break the siege. In time, they discovered the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n legend about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and began experimenting with ways to create a similar affliction among the orcs. They succeeded, and soon the so-called &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread like wildfire through the orcs' encampments, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants.\nThe orc &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow shaman, realizing that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres and that the siege was now doomed to fail, beseeched the elements to destroy Goria. The orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that Molok would resume meddling with the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; if the orcs failed, and so the elements agreed to unleash their fury upon Goria. The shaman gathered outside the ogre city's mighty walls and witnessed the fury of the spirits. What happened next would never be forgotten. A roaring storm churned above the city as the ground groaned and trembled. Over several hours, lightning, fire and earthquakes ravaged the city, bringing down every wall and building, sealing off the escape routes and burning the ships in the harbor. When nothing but ash and rubble remained, the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole.\nUntold thousands of ogres died that day; none were left alive by the elementals. Only whispers of the event would reach the other Gorian cities and outposts, but those whispers would be enough to discourage any further tampering with the elements. The orcs were victorious, but they had suffered massive losses and witnessed a destructive power they never wanted to see again. Nelgarm and the other shaman were particularly frightened by the elementals' wrath and said that the need for a unified orc army had passed. There was little argument, and the clans returned to their lands.\nTwo hundred years after Goria was destroyed, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; arrived and built &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in the location where the city once stood. When the draenei did so, there was an explosion of anger within &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, the new ogre capital. It was seen as a unforgivable insult for these small, weak newcomers to build a city on the bones of the Gorian Empire's great capital, but Shattrath's sleek construction and otherworldly defenses gave the ogres pause. Nothing like their technology had ever been seen on Draenor before, and even their weakest apprentices had more refined and effective magical techniques than even the most advanced ogre sorcerers.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Hok%27lon\"&gt;Imperator Hok'lon&lt;/a&gt; seized control of Highmaul and declared that he would reclaim Shattrath from the \"usurpers\". He promised that Highmaul would become the center of a new, enlightened Gorian Empire once the draenei had been slaughtered. Highmaul's aristocracy threw their suppot behind Hok'lon, and the ogre army marched on Shattrath. Despite the ogres' greater numbers, the city's defenses easily repelled their first \u2014 and only \u2014 attack. As the ogres regrouped, the draenei launched surprise attacks from multiple directions, killing Hok'lon and his generals and leaving the ogres in disarray. The draenei then immediately returned to Shattrath as their leader, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on the city's ramparts and told the ogres, \"Go home, and you will not be harmed.\" The ogres fled, the grandiose war that was meant to revive the Gorian Empire having ended after a single attack. The Highmaul ogres never attempted a frontal assault on the draenei again."}

Filling, hence drinking, is free, and the brews are both &lt;a href=\"tipsy\"&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;inebriating&lt;/a&gt;) and provide &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; restoration and a &lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;well fed&lt;/a&gt; buff. Obtaining it provided the &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; .\nSource.\nDuring Brewfest 2008, the Blue Brewfest Stein was a quest reward from: \nUse.\n&lt;a href=\"Equip\"&gt;Equip&lt;/a&gt;ping an empty Blue Brewfest Stein, then using a &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Festive%20Keg\"&gt;Brewfest Festive Keg&lt;/a&gt; will convert the stein into a Filled Blue Brewfest Stein, containing a one charge sample of the beer from the barrel. The filled stein can then be used, drinking from it, which converts the stein back to an empty Blue Brewfest Stein. The imbiber get the effects of the particular beer that was sampled. The full or empty stein must be equipped to be used. \nVarieties.\nEach of the three Brewfest Festive Kegs contains a different sample brew, so, depending on what barrel the owner fills their stein at, their Brewfest Stein will have a different sample of brew. Each full stein with a different brew is a different item, as is the empty mug. There are two icons, one for the empty stein and one for the full steins. \nEach Brewfest Festive Keg is near to one of the brew vendor tents. Each brewer vends three different strengths of brew, but the breweries specialize in a low, medium, or high strength range of brews. Stronger brews are higher level, restore more &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, have stronger &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, and have a higher character level requirement to use. Each of three brews available from the Festive Kegs are the same as one of the three brews being vended by the brewer nearest that keg. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; brews are different brews but have equivalent effects. The Barleybrew dwarves' and Drohn's orcs' brews are the weak, low level range. The sample nearest them is the level one sample, the weakest at the Brewfest, and can be sampled by all attendees. Thunderbrew dwarves and T'chali's trolls have mid-range brews. The Gordok Ogres are shared by both factions, and have the strongest, highest level brews.\nNote: The Festive Kegs are neutral and inanimate. You should be able to use the opposing faction's Festive Kegs, if you can get to them. \nYou can fill your mug with any of the three brews. The only way to empty your mug is to drink it (use it). Drinking from your stein and refilling at a different Brewfest Festive Keg switches between brews. \nAnyone can fill their stein from any of the kegs. Since each beer has a minimum level associated with it, but the stein does not, you can drink a brew from your mug that has a higher level requirement than you are, but you will not get the buff. Instead you get a brief \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Hold%20Your%20Brew\"&gt;Can't Hold Your Brew&lt;/a&gt;\" debuff with a 'getting sick' graphic and a message warning you not to drink the big kids' drink. \nNote that the Alliance/Horde brews may be available in neutral cities as well.\nQuotes.\nThis is the flavor text for each brew. Note that the quotes for the 2008 Stein are different than the quotes for the 2007 Stein. \nNotes.\nDark Iron Dwarf invasion.\nYou fill at the same Brewfest Festive Kegs that the Dark Iron Dwarves attack when they invade. If the Dark Iron Dwarves succeed in destroying a Brewfest Festive Keg, you will be unable to fill your mug from that keg until it respawns. The destroyed keg will get a destroyed graphic with a caved in front, then disappear as the Dark Iron Dwarves depart. \nUniqueness.\nThe Blue Brewfest Stein is unique. Since the empty and filled forms are different, uniqueness might not apply, but the mug is soulbound and you only get the quest once in 2008, so you'll only have one anyway. "}

Though the threat of Human incursions into Durotar will always remain, the destruction of Admiral Proudmoore and his navy will severely hinder their ability to threaten the Orc clans.\"\nThe Battle.\nSeas of Blood.\nWith his companions &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"tauren%20chieftain\"&gt;tauren chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20brewmaster\"&gt;Pandaren brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar landed on the outlying island and defeated the Kul Tiras forces who were occupying the island. Having gained the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs quickly put the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; to constructing &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt;s, with which they then engaged the Kul Tiras armada. A furious battle on the waves ensued. The Kul Tiras forces used their fortifications and siege weaponry to shell the orc ships as they traded cannon fire with the human fleet. Although they were successful in destroying a good many of the goblin-made ships, Rexxar's forces were eventually able to sink all six of the Kul Tiras battleships, forcing the remains of the fleet into disarrayed retreat. With the blockade broken, Thrall quickly ordered his troops onto waiting transports, and began the invasion of Theramore Isle.\nTheramore Isle.\nThe gathered armies of the Horde, led by Thrall and Rexxar, landed upon Theramore Isle and unleashed their full fury upon the walls of the city. The Horde launched a three-pronged attack: the trolls and ogres attacked from the west, the tauren attacked from the south, and the Orcs attacked from the southwest. They met stiff resistance in the form of Admiral Proudmoore's elite guard, Theramore's powerful automated defense towers, and Jaina Proudmoore's own forces. The Alliance forces defended the Citadel fiercely, fighting with an intense hatred for the Horde whom they believe to be the same as the one that ravaged their homelands and many warriors on both sides perished. Their counter-attacks overran several Horde landing sites but finally Rexxar and his companions were able to fight their way through the heavy melee, defeating the Admiral's personal guard before engaging Daelin Proudmoore himself. Although Proudmoore was a ferociously powerful warrior and sorcerer, he was finally slain in the epic battle by Rexxar's party. With the Admiral's death, Rexxar ordered the rest of the Alliance forces to stand down; Jaina Proudmoore materialized, to mourn over the body of her proud, stubborn father.\nAftermath.\nHaving no quarrel with the remaining humans, the Horde returned to Durotar, leaving Jaina Proudmoore to rebuild her small empire. Thrall offered Rexxar a champion's welcome at &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which Rexxar refused, saying he was a lone wanderer at heart. However, the half-ogre considered himself as part of the Horde ever after, and was and is at Thrall's service, should the Warchief ever call upon the &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;'s considerable talents again.\nThe Horde and Theramore returned to peace, but all was not well across the sea. When the people of Kul Tiras learned of their Lord Admiral's death, they cried out for vengeance, but the other nations of the Alliance were not interested. Ordeals caused by the plague in Lordaeron were more immediate concerns, and the other allied leaders also had little pity for Daelin's own aggressive actions. The people of Kul Tiras furiously isolated themselves from the rest of the Alliance, but were not angry with all of the Alliance leaders. They instead nursed a bitter hatred only towards Jaina for betraying her family. A &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; was later immortalized about what happened.\nForces.\nKul Tiras:\nTheramore Guard:"}

Taoshi will only offer this quest from her position on the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; once enough realm-wide progress has been made, irrespective of the individual player's standing with the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch like with the previous progression quest, &lt;a href=\"To%20the%20Skies%21%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;To the Skies! (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, this quest mostly takes place in a single-player scenario called \"Stormsea Landing\". As the scenario can only be completed once, it is documented here and not in a separate article.\nObjectives.\nInfiltrate &lt;a href=\"Stormsea%20Landing\"&gt;Stormsea Landing&lt;/a&gt; and open the courtyard gate from within. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; to begin the mission.\nDescription.\nZandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to bolster &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen's&lt;/a&gt; army.\nIf we can capture the palace &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure.\nI have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nCompletion.\nWell done. That warship won't be raining fire on us again any time soon.\n&lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; has informed me that the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; will keep vigil over Stormsea Landing, freeing Kirin Tor resources to press the siege elsewhere. Taoshi will be there. I am sure she will be glad to work with you again.\nWe are all grateful for your contributions, &lt;name&gt;. Thank you.\nNotes.\nOnce enough realm-wide progress has been made, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; move over by the stables. Taoshi will offer this quest.\nOn accept:\nSpeak with her again:\nStage 1: Blending In.\nStep a few yards closer to Taoshi and Thunderwing:\nHop on. Taoshi will take the skyscreamer northward and attack the over-reaching guard:\nStage 2: Path of Smoke.\nWhile on Thunderwing, the champion has access to one ability:\nUse the smoke bomb to take out 10 totems. Taoshi will only allow ten to be taken out, so choose targets wisely!\nStage 3: Shadows in the Storm.\nOn foot, Taoshi buffs the champion with Infiltrating Stormsea Landing: \"Taoshi uses Wu Kao shadow arts to stealth herself and her ally, enabling the use of Knock Out on targets afflicted by Mark of Taoshi. May be detected by enemies within 5 yards or revealed by sentry totems.\" The champion will have a 5-yard-radius circle extending from it's position. So long as no zandalari get within that circle, the champion will stay stealthed. However, to use Knock Out, which is provided via the bonus action button, get behind the marked &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Wingrider\"&gt;Veteran Wingrider&lt;/a&gt; and inch forward until the red circle includes the NPC. This will bring up the bonus action button, so use it.\nIf the champion's cover is blown, Taoshi will drop a purple smoke flare on the ground that functions like a &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;:\nStep into it to regain stealth.\nAfter knocking out the wingrider on the right, Taoshi will inch foward and indicate two wingriders standing to the starboard side of deck. Another is patrolling behind them, so make sure to take the two standing guards out when the patrolling one isn't looking. Once those two are down, Taoshi will sneak foward and casually knock out the patrolling wingrider. Take out the next to marked wingriders to continue. Taoshi will neutralize another, then trap the two starboard siege weapons:\nTaoshi will mark one of two wingriders near the skyscreamers. Tap it and Taoshi will do her thing, then trap the two port-side siege weapons. Incapacitate the last wingrider to finish this stage.\nStage 4: Wetwork.\nFollow Taoshi forward, then get within range of Halu'kal and attempt to kill him:\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Halu%27kal\"&gt;Captain Halu'kal&lt;/a&gt; is a level-90 elite Zandalar troll with 2 million health. See his article for abilities and a full strategy.\nGet out of the Wallop area of effect and try to run away from the Keg Toss. Halu'kal will gain Well Fed on occasion, which will heal him and increase his damage output for ~12 seconds.\nOccasionally, a &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Wingrider\"&gt;Drunken Wingrider&lt;/a&gt; will awaken with a terrible Hangover. Take it out or not (it only has 788K health), but keep focusing on the captain.\nFinish him off:\nStage 5: Keep Quiet.\nTaoshi will tag along beside the adventurer. Assuming a decent path was made, move along it to get up the hill toward the gate. &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Spirit-Twister\"&gt;Zandalari Spirit-Twister&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Handler\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Handler&lt;/a&gt;s lead &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Conscript\"&gt;Zandalari Conscript&lt;/a&gt;s in patrols of the grounds. Steer clear of the patrols and also of the blue circles denoting the range of the sentry totems.\nShould the champion enter the detection radius of a sentry totem, the totem will move a beam of light in the direction of whomever it detected. If the beam reaches the intruder, it will break the champion's and Taoshi's stealth for 10 seconds.\nAlong the way, the trolls find out about the trapped siege weapons the hard way:\nKeep moving up the hill and get close to Hu'seng:\nStage 6: Light Up the Night.\n&lt;a href=\"Hu%27seng%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Hu'seng the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; is a level-92 elite &lt;a href=\"terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;terracotta warrior&lt;/a&gt; with almost 4 million health. See his article for abilities and a full strategy. \nHu'seng will likely start off with an Empower Axe cast. Start running away from him with help via the Fixate speed increase, but don't get too far that he starts casting Hook.\nAt 50% of total health remaining, Hu'seng will cast Cease, summoning chains that will root the champion in place. The chains only have ~100K health, so quickly destroy them before he gets his Desist cast off, which will hit all units in the marked area of effect for ~150K Physical damage.\nAt 20% total health remaining, Lei Shen will get upset and unleash a Lightning Storm upon the area. Standing in the pools will inflict 15K Nature damage a second, so move quickly.\nFinish Hu'seng off:\nLoot the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%27s%20Orb\"&gt;Gatekeeper's Orb&lt;/a&gt; from Hu'seng's corpse.\nFinal Stage: Breaking Out.\nTollow Taoshi up the steps to the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Crossing\"&gt;Bloodied Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and use the orb on the Deactivated Access Generator.\nThis completes the \"Assault the Shipyard\" portion of &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Isle of Thunder (achievement)&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollow Taoshi and interact with the portal to end the scenario and return to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with Jaina to turn in."}

One such exchange seemed to revolve around an unfamiliar Zandalari word, always surrounded by terms of conquest and power: Oondasta. Somewhere in Pandaria, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Ward\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Ward&lt;/a&gt; raises their mighty beasts as engines of war, and is putting the finishing touches on this Loa-infused monstrosity. The exact location, however, remains unknown...\"\nStrategy.\nTo start out, all members of the raid must be behind Oondasta or the 180-degree Frill Blast will &lt;a href=\"one-shot\"&gt;one-shot&lt;/a&gt; all but tanks using a defensive cooldown. Oondasta has a huge hitbox, so no players should be stacked up on top of one another, or the Spitfire Beam will chain and do a decent chunk of damage to a large part of the raid. The stacking Crush means tanks will have to swap, but as Oondasta is immune to taunts via Alpha Male, tanks will have to swap the old-fashioned way, or the stacking Crush will kill them before the Frill Blast does.\nAll spell-casters must pay attention to the Piercing Roar cast and not let it lock a school for 10 seconds, which is particularly annoying for healers. As the fight drags out, Oondasta will gain a stacking damage buff in the form of Growing Fury, which affects all of its abilities. After about 15 stacks, even Piercing Roar will start to one-shot members of the raid.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3\"&gt;Patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, the graveyard has been moved up to Oondasta's area, thus the previous strategies of either dragging Oondasta down to the beach or resorting to a 90-second graveyard zerg are no longer necessary. Players choosing to release and run back to their corpse (now a 20-second run) will still have to contend with the resurrection timer, however.\nLoot.\nPlayers involved in a successful Oondasta kill will have a chance of looting one of the following items, and can use a &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20Rune%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Mogu Rune of Fate&lt;/a&gt; for an additional chance. Should players not win loot, they will receive a &lt;a href=\"Shiny%20Pile%20of%20Refuse\"&gt;Shiny Pile of Refuse&lt;/a&gt; instead. Players can only receive loot or use a bonus roll for Oondasta once a week.\nIn Hearthstone.\nOondasta appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"Adorning devilsaurs with armor and feathers is a respected job in troll culture, although it has a high turnover rate.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are known to adapt to their environments, taking on aspects of their surroundings, which may account for the variety of oozes seen on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. Many of them have bones integrated into their bodies, with skulls being used as their head.\nSmaller oozes are sometimes known as oozelings.\nHistory.\nNo one knows what their motivations are or if there is any specific ecology behind their existence. An unproven and unpopular theory belonging to &lt;a href=\"Laris%20Geardawdle\"&gt;Laris Geardawdle&lt;/a&gt; is that oozes and slimes are tied to the creation of Azeroth, almost like a secretion of the planet.\nFirst War.\nThese slimes seek to eat the blood of the living. No &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; could have created these crawling masses, but yet they exist. They seem attracted to the heat of living bodies, and will seep through even the tightest armor to drain into the pores of their victims' skin and sap them of strength and life. They have no intelligence and drain heat as food. No magical properties have been found to exist within the slime, but nature is often a magik unto itself.\nNight of the Dragon.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Night of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\", a group of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; encounter an ooze in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. The creature is attacked by one of the dwarves, but as the dwarf's axe sinks into the ooze, the dwarf falls onto it and is sucked in. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt; tried to save him, but in moments, the dwarf's head was already turned into a skull, and they could see the thick beard begin to wither and dissolve. The victim could only twitch once as he was being dissolved to death.\nThe mass of oozes apparently can douse flaming arrows, unless the flame is fueled by oil, which will turn it into an inferno and kill them. Its mass will then also feed the flames. When faced with such an assault, other oozes will try to escape into water.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; slimes are found all around pools of water blessed by the touch of &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; decimated the area with attacks of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic magics\u2014the slimes supposedly crept up through the earth during these attacks. The adventurer could take a sample of slime from Felwood and place some of it into the various tubes and beakers on the table. As things begin to boil and spurt, the slime changes colors.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Chemist%20Fuely\"&gt;Chemist Fuely&lt;/a&gt;, the slimes in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; seem to be elemental in nature, but also something more. He stated that they remind him of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the felblood of the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggonar\"&gt;Aggonar&lt;/a&gt; spawned slimes at the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Aggonar\"&gt;Pools of Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Hierophant%20Thayreen\"&gt;Hierophant Thayreen&lt;/a&gt;'s ancestors once planted a tree in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. It was called &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and it was to become a world tree. For reasons long forgotten, after the tree was fully grown, they decided it needed to be destroyed. Its giant trunk splintered at three locations in the area to the north. Where the tree touched the ground, foul ooze began to crawl the earth. This slime is foul with a darkness far more ancient than their worldly forms would indicate. The land itself has a memory of this evil for as long as it has existed. Eventually, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; stated the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of old were wise to tear down Vordrassil, for its roots seep deep into the dwelling of an ancient evil. He then warned that the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s evil extended past Vordrassil's roots.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; apothecary &lt;a href=\"Winna%20Hazzard\"&gt;Winna Hazzard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bloodvenom%20Post\"&gt;Bloodvenom Post&lt;/a&gt; researched ways to use the demonic ooze here against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. However, with her experiments on the slimes, she transformed all the inhabitants of Bloodvenom Post into &lt;a href=\"Bloodvenom%20Slimeslave\"&gt;Bloodvenom Slimeslave&lt;/a&gt;s, except for &lt;a href=\"Altsoba%20Ragetotem\"&gt;Altsoba Ragetotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Assaults\"&gt;Black Empire assaults&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, Old God slimes often with many eyes inside were seen.\nShadowlands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; relies on slimes for their experimentation and creating slime constructs at &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Watch\"&gt;Plague Watch&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of the House of Plagues, many &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; were turned into &lt;a href=\"slime%20giant\"&gt;slime giant&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Stradama\"&gt;Margrave Stradama&lt;/a&gt; who had managed to maintain her mind. &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Mortimer\"&gt;Mad Mortimer&lt;/a&gt; performed an experiment that successfully turned him into two slime constructs and one slime. Other cases of slimes in Maldraxxus are animated flesh in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, the muck pools where &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s are made can generate muck slimes.\nLoot.\nThe following items are commonly dropped by oozes.\nTypes.\nRed blood type\nLava type\nAmber type\nBrown type\nVoid types\nIn the RPG.\nAn ooze is a mindless, amorphous, or mutable creature. They are also blind. Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to objects. Oozes eat and breathe but do not sleep.\nSpeculation.\nThe appearance of oozes appears to possibly be correlated to the presence of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; (and thus, potent &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies) on a planet, as speculated by &lt;a href=\"Chemist%20Fuely\"&gt;Chemist Fuely&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, ooze mobs called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blood%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Black Blood of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; are found in the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Mines\"&gt;Netherwing Mines&lt;/a&gt;. This is reminiscent of how &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; is often referred to as the \"Black Blood of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;\". On &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, it is stated that the appearance of oozes also referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Blood%20of%20Draenor%20%28mission%20mob%29\"&gt;Black Blood of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" is a result of the Void's influence on the planet becoming more pronounced. Thus, it can be speculated that Outland's Black Bloods appeared due to the attempted summoning of &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;an unnamed Old God&lt;/a&gt; a short distance away by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Conclave\"&gt;Dark Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, which was thwarted by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Thwart%20the%20Dark%20Conclave\"&gt;Thwart the Dark Conclave&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Guardian Medivh, possessed by , attempts to open the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, while wave upon wave of &lt;a href=\"dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; attempt to defeat Medivh in order to alter time and halt the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. This time sequence is set about a few months before &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt; events (circa 30 years before WoW). It takes about 30 minutes to fully clear the instance, starting from triggering Medivh until the last boss is dead.\nBackground.\nBut now the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; has been roused by an elusive threat: dark, sinister agents have infiltrated the timeways, embarking on missions to alter the course of the past, present and future. As a result, the bronze dragonflight has begun enlisting heroes to prevent the sabotage of key historical events. The balance of time is in jeopardy, and if the past is not saved... there will be no future.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Deep within the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, the brooding dragon &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; has awakened. Since the world was young, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of time is upheld. \"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Opening the Dark Portal begins with the five players entering the portal in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside, it is recommended that the players all pick up a &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Beacon\"&gt;Chrono-Beacon&lt;/a&gt; from before leaving the cave. The instance setting is a swamp which is filled with non-elite beast &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; that must be cleared. Once any player enters the area approximately 10 meters from &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the event will occur. If Medivh dies, the encounter will reset itself in 5 minutes and players will be able to pick up a new Chrono-beacon from Sa'at. The event begins with calling for assistance and a portal quickly opening in one of the four designated zones: the first of 18 total waves of &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;. Once a given portal has been shut or enough time has passed, a consecutive portal will be opened in a different zone and the entire encounter is timed from the opening of the first portal. At waves 6, 12, and 18, there is a boss encounter. All of the portals will spawn mobs that will seek to drain Medivh's shield and eventually kill him.\nLore.\nWhy should the Alliance help?\nSome have questioned why the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; should help in opening the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. After all, it was the opening of the Dark Portal that triggered the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dark Portal had never opened, the worlds of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; would have never been bridged. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s would have never arrived, and the wars never taken place. of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; claims that \"many lives could be saved\" and \"the resulting wars could be erased\". \nHowever, if the Dark Portal was never opened, it is explained by the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; that the Alliance would have never formed. Instead, the races that form the Alliance would have descended into a chaotic civil war. Azeroth would have then been mercilessly crushed by the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The Burning Legion would have then initiated an act of mass genocide, effectively destroying all life on Azeroth. This would have resulted in many more deaths than the First War and many others combined. Therefore, preserving time and opening the Dark Portal can be seen as \"the lesser of two evils\".\nWhy should the Horde help?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, having already succumbed to the demonic bloodlust on Draenor, would almost certainly have perished if they had never traveled to Azeroth. Draenor's wildlife had begun to die and the soil was turning to dust. Infighting was rampant, and had abandoned the orcs after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Azeroth was salvation for the orc clans.\nAs mentioned above, had the orcs not traveled to Azeroth they would not have been present to join the final Alliance against the Burning Legion. While the events of the second invasion would certainly have been very different without the orcs, it's likely the legion would have pressed through via another method. The native mortal races of Azeroth would then have been woefully unprepared to face the Legion.\nNotes.\nThe events in the instance do not coincide with previous accounts of the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. In other accounts, 's involvement in the actual opening was only &lt;a href=\"The%20History%20of%20Orcish%20Ascension%23The%20Mastery%20of%20Forces%20-%20Medivh%20and%20Blackhand\"&gt;hinted at&lt;/a&gt; or . These sources state that the portal was discovered by the warlocks of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and through their work, slowly opened. Even after the opening, it's told that it is only large enough to fit a single &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; through. There was also only a single scout sent through initially. Medivh is not heard from for weeks prior to the opening, and does not return until well after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; is under way.\nThis contrasts with the instance's depiction of Medivh actively channeling and calling out to Gul'dan as he does so, followed by an instantaneous opening of the full-sized portal, complete with stone arches, through which he greets a legion of orc warriors.\n\"\" depicts events so that the orcs built the Azeroth side of the portal after they came through the rift.\nRemoved attunement.\nIn 4.2, its attunement process was removed and it no longer requires you to run a prior CoT instance and complete the following questline:"}

Once inside, it is recommended that the players all pick up a &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Beacon\"&gt;Chrono-Beacon&lt;/a&gt; from before leaving the cave. The instance setting is a swamp which is filled with non-elite beast &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; that must be cleared. A path can be cleared straight south towards , but it is recommended to clear all trash in the areas where combat will occur during the event. Generally, only the islands and strips of land immediately across from Medivh need to be cleared, though a wider radius is safer until the group has a good sense of where the action will take place.\nThe mobs can be easily rounded up several at a time by one player on horseback, led back to the rest of the party, and then burned down with AoE attacks.\nOnce any player enters the area approximately 10 meters from &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the event will occur.\nIf Medivh dies, the encounter will reset itself in 5 minutes and players will be able to pick up a new Chrono-beacon from Sa'at. The non-elite beasts will not respawn.\nThe Opening of the Dark Portal.\nThe event begins with calling for assistance and a portal quickly opening in one of the four designated zones: the first of 18 total waves of &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;. Once a given portal has been shut or enough time has passed, a consecutive portal will be opened in a different zone and the entire encounter is timed from the opening of the first portal. At waves 6, 12, and 18, there is a boss encounter. All of the portals will spawn mobs that will seek to drain Medivh's shield and eventually kill him.\nWaves 1 through 5.\nEach of the first five waves of the event consists of one elite \u2014 either a melee-class or caster-class \u2014 that is tethered to the portal, and a stream of non-elite mobs. While the portal is open, adds will spawn every 15 or 20 seconds according to this repeating cycle: 1 Assassin, 3 Whelps, 1 Chronomancer. These adds will head directly towards Medivh, and must be dealt with or they will drain his shield and kill him.\nThe non-elites all do small amounts of damage, and can be easily killed by any class; &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; is not required, though abilities like &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snare\"&gt;Snare&lt;/a&gt; can be useful for managing multiple adds at once. It is recommended, however, that one player focus specifically on the spawning creatures, while all other party members focus on the tethered elite. Frost-specced mages can do quite well at this job; a combination of hunter and mage is also effective. The hunter's pet can be used as a tank for the adds while the mage burns each one down; this also generally allows for good positioning near the healer. However, you should be smart about who you choose to put on the adds. The characters in the party with the highest &lt;a href=\"dps\"&gt;dps&lt;/a&gt; should focus on the bosses, while a lower dps character (preferably also one with higher armor or a pet) should be assigned to the adds. The longer the boss stays up, the more adds will be spawned in total, leading to greater mana drained from the healer. If your mage has the highest dps, it is not wise to assign him or her as the primary add-killer, regardless of their ability to AoE.\nIf tanking is done by a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, they can stand on top of the portal and easily aggro the non-elite mobs using AoE &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;. If done properly, they won't even come close to Medivh. If you do not have a Paladin (who can deal continuous DPS to all the adds using &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shield\"&gt;Holy Shield&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Aura\"&gt;Retribution Aura&lt;/a&gt;), it is generally recommended that the tank holding the elite **not** attempt to aggro any of the adds, as they will almost immediately go after your healer. It may be possible to hold them like this if DPS is high, but it is generally simpler to let them through and have one or two ranged DPS focus-fire them down while everyone else stays on the tethered elite.\nOnce you destroy the elite in a wave, everyone should kill the remaining non-elites and rest up for the next portal. The key here is pacing: while the next portal will open immediately after you down the elite (or sooner, if you're slow), it's best to have healers and mana-based DPS classes drink up before they start in on the next rift lord/keeper. The longer you wait, the more adds you will have to deal with and the farther behind you will get on new portals opening, but if clearing the adds is going well, but you need not rush immediately from one portal to another if your group isn't quite ready.\nEach portal's elite will proximity aggro, but the adds will not (they walk straight towards Medivh until they are attacked). The DPS assigned to adds can take advantage of this by opening with a spell with a long casting time, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt;.\nWave 6:.\nHealth: 89,000\nMana: 33,090\nSpecial Abilities\nThis fight can easily be done by four players, while the fifth defeats the spawning non-elite mobs. Alternatively, you can all dps him down and then use a beacon to clean up the remaining adds. takes the place of the or that would normally spawn with portal six.\nChrono Lord Deja is an easy fight. The only ability of note is the Arcane Discharge. This is easily healed through, and the party member assigned to deal with the trash headed for Medivh should still be able to do so during this encounter.\nAfter Chrono Lord Deja is defeated, your group should have thirty seconds to a minute of rest before the seventh wave arrives, depending on how fast you killed him.\nHeroic: Pulls people towards him, making his chain attacks much harder to avoid. Additionally, his Arcane Discharge is much more frequent and damaging. It now deals around 4000 damage.\nWaves 7 through 11.\nSame as waves 1 through 5. Adds spawn according to this repeating cycle: 1 Executioner, 1 Chronomancer, 3 Whelps, 1 Assassin.\nWave 12:.\nHealth: 110,000\nMana: N/A\nSpecial Abilities\nYou have several options for dealing with his Mortal Wound debuff: \nThe Mortal Wounds ability is applied every 3 seconds instead of 6 if Temporus is under the Haste effect. Therefore, this ability must be spellstolen or removed immediately.\n&lt;a href=\"Temporus\"&gt;Temporus&lt;/a&gt; is one boss where it is highly recommended to allow the non-elite mobs to pass by, then when Temporus is defeated to drop a &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Beacon\"&gt;Chrono-Beacon&lt;/a&gt; near Medivh to clean up the remaining mobs. You may need to use beacons at some point just to deal with the amount of adds who have aggroed to the party and are attacking casters. Just be sure not to use the beacon too close to Temporus himself, as it will fail and be wasted.\nThe \"Haste\" buff increases run speed dramatically. Therefore, if your party has a mage spellstealing the Haste buff, then your mage should be the one assigned to drop a Chrono-beacon on Medivh about halfway through the fight. With the Haste buff, the mage can run to Medivh, drop off the beacon and be back to Temporus all within only 2 global spell cool-downs.\nIf the group has no mage, a priest can use Dispel Magic on Temporus, a warlock can summon his Felhunter and use Devour Magic or a shaman can use Purge to remove his Haste buff. As of Patch 2.3, Hunters can use a highrank Arcane Shot to dispel the buff\nRather than trying to evade and kite Temporus, a protection-specced warrior can tank and spank him. His \"Mortal Wound\" ability can be blocked and is on a ~6 second cooldown, so timely use of Shield Block can allow it to fall off.\nProtection paladins should easily be able to keep up 100% block through the whole fight if the Haste debuff is dispelled.\nThis fight can get tough if your tank has trouble blocking or dodging Mortal Wound. In this case, a Subtlety rogue can evasion tank Temporus for the first 30 seconds by using Preparation. After that, the tank can step in. If a feral druid is tanking and Mortal Wound has stacked too high, a priest may want to keep a shield up; the druid should still be able to keep rage. On a side note, Frenzied Regeneration is unaffected by the debuff, so it can be used to make a last stand, if necessary.\nBe warned that the threat reduction effect of Temporus' knock back ability can make it difficult for the main tank to maintain his top position on the aggro list. It is recommended \u2014 in spite of the urgency of this fight \u2014 to grant the tank some time to build up aggro before the damage dealers join in. It's advisable to have the party kill two or three waves of the non-elites before starting to dish out damage on the boss.\nHeroic: Has a 6 second duration spell reflect.\nWave 18:.\nHealth: 150,000\nMana: N/A\nSpecial Abilities\nThe final boss and wave of the encounter, spawns alone. He will immediately head towards and attack him. If Medivh's shield is in respectable condition, it is recommended that the party rest up before the battle. While Sand Breath is arcane damage, it appears that arcane resist gear does not dampen the damage dealt when he uses the skill. In any case, it is not so much a problem as it might look, as long as the tank faces him away from the rest of the party. That way the healer can focus on the tank.\nBesides his abilities, Aeonus hits for very high amounts on any players. This is compounded by the Time Stop ability, causing Aeonus to continue to attack the highest aggro target while healing is unavailable. If healing is kept at a maximum, Aeonus will quickly fall to focused dps. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"bubble\"&gt;bubble&lt;/a&gt;, of course) can be used to negate the effect of Time Stop, and give the tank time to use cooldowns such as potions or Shield Wall if need be.\nHeroic bosses and repeat attempts.\nAs in any other Heroic, players are saved to the instance and are given badges for the boss-kills (Deja, Temporus, and Aeonus). This instance is unique in that you can fail after defeating either of the first two bosses and be forced to begin again. In order to prevent players from farming in this way, the game gives regenerated bosses new names and denies all loot from them. If Chrono Lord Deja is defeated, he will be replaced by the on the next attempt. Temporus becomes the .\nGraveyard zerging Aeonus on Normal.\nIt is possible to &lt;a href=\"graveyard%20zerg\"&gt;graveyard zerg&lt;/a&gt; . Should a party wipe on the last boss, run back to the instance as fast as you can. If 's shield was around 100% when you began the Aeonus fight, it should be at about 30% when you &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;rez&lt;/a&gt;. Drink and eat up then engage Aeonus again. The fight will not reset until Medivh is dead."}

When installed as a separate addon, you can enable and disable addons, load addons that are LoadOnDemand, as well as get general addon metadata. You can use the included performance monitor to sort your addons by memory usage, memory increase per second, along with CPU usage if you have CPU profiling enabled.\nFirst and foremost, OptionHouse was designed to allow an easy centralized place to configure your addons. The library provides a way to categorize your options, and only creates those options screens which are access. In short, this addon will give you a nice place to configure any addons that use OH.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7324-OptionHouse.html\"&gt;Download OptionHouse at wowinterface.com&lt;/a&gt;\nThere is currently a beta library called HousingAuthority available that handles creation of widgets that can then be displayed inside OptionHouse, you can also see &lt;a href=\"OptionHouse/Widgets\"&gt;example widgets&lt;/a&gt; for some code examples for making the configuration widgets.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7515-HousingAuthority.html\"&gt;Download HousingAuthority at wowinterface.com&lt;/a&gt;\nAccess OptionHouse via the OptionHouse button in the Options screen that appears when you click the escape key.\nDongleObject OptionHouse API.\n:RegisterAddon(name[, title, author, version]).\nRegisters a new addon.\nRemarks.\nCurrently title, author, and version information is used on the addon management panel tooltips and on the tooltips for the addon in the centralized addon panel, if you use a different name from the addon's folder name then the extra information will not be loaded.\nAny registered information will override the toc values when displaying the tooltip in the addon management panel, however only the registered information is used on the centralized addon panel.\nIf only one category exists and no sub categories, then it'll default to opening it when the addon is clicked on the configuration tab.\nAn example of registering a category and a sub category.\n local OptionHouse = DongleStub(\"OptionHouse-1.0\")\n local OHObject = OptionHouse:RegisterAddOn( \"FooBar\", \"FooBar 1.0.0\", \"YourName\", \"1.0.0\" )\n OHObject:RegisterCategory( \"Test\", FooBar, \"ShowTest\" )\n OHObject:RegisterSubCategory( \"Test\", \"Sub Cat\", FooBar, \"ShowSubCat\" )\nOptionHouse Object API.\nOHObject:GetFrame(type).\nRemarks.\nThis was added in r553.\nIf you were referencing an OptionHouse frame directly by name you will need to update and use :GetFrame(type) instead.\nThe \"main\" type is for the main OptionHouse frame, this is the one that everything else is parented to, \"addon\" is for all of the configurations that addons register, \"manage\" is for the addon control panel, \"perf\" is for the performance panel.\nOHObject:RegisterCategory(name, handler[, func, noCache, sortID]).\nRemarks.\nIf we want to register the handler Foo and the function Bar with OptionHouse you'd need to do RegisterCategory( \"Category\", Foo, \"Bar\" ), if you want to just register the function Foo then you'd do RegisterCategory( \"Category\", Foo )\nThe function registered must return a frame, unless you specify noCache the frame will be saved and called instead of the function the next time the category is clicked. If you want to detect when the frame is used you must register OnShow with that frame and populate it yourself. When noCache is passed the function will be called every time and the frame will not be cached, useful if you want to use one frame for multiple options.\nFrames cannot have a width higher then 630 and a height over 305, if either width or height exceeds those numbers they'll be forced back to 630 and 305, if no width or height is specified then it'll default to 630/305. If no position is set then the frame will be positioned to TOPLEFT, &lt;OHOptionsFrame&gt;, \"TOPLEFT\", 190, -103, all frames will be parented to the OptionHouse configuration frame.\nThis applies to all frames and not just cached ones.\nThe function/handler will be called as: handler.func( handler, cat[, sub cat]) or func( cat[, sub cat])\nOHObject:RemoveCategory(name).\nRemoves a register category.\nBecause the entry is removed from OptionHouse, the frame cache for the category will be cleared and it'll call the registered handler and/or function the next time the category is clicked.\nRemarks.\nNo errors are generated if the category is nil or doesn't exist.\nOHObject:RegisterSubCategory(parentCat, name, handler[, func, noCache, sortID]).\nRemarks.\nThis functions the same way as OHObject:RegisterCategory() does for frame rules and arguments, parentCat has to be the same as the name you registered in OHObject:RegisterCategory(), and will be shown as a sub category of parentCat.\nOHObject:RemoveSubCategory(parentCat, name).\nRemoves a subcategory from a category, like OHOBject:RemoveCategory() the same issue regarding functions being called after the frame is created applies.\nRemarks.\nNo errors are generated if the category is nil or doesn't exist."}

Finally the option help function is called when the widget is moused-over. The mouse-over action is actually delayed to behave more like other UI elements outside of WoW. The code doesn't do any error checking so as such it is only provided as is. It has been pointed out that the behavior for the tooltips when using the help function is not the default in wow.

Grunt work is done by the warriors, but their cultural leaders are nearly always great shamanic practitioners. Many of the Oracles' leaders have the word \"Soo\" in their name. This may be a title, especially since &lt;a href=\"Jaloot\"&gt;Jaloot&lt;/a&gt; says that someday the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; can become \"Soo-Dryskin\" (dryskin is what the Oracles call most other races).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to the Oracles through the quest chain started by &lt;a href=\"The%20Part-time%20Hunter\"&gt;The Part-time Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. They are first introduced to the Frenzyheart Tribe, then switched over to the Oracles, and may choose whether to align with both factions through the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Hero%27s%20Burden\"&gt;A Hero's Burden&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited Rainspeaker Canopy, where they were well received by the Oracles, just like the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart tribe&lt;/a&gt; at their village, and this because of the diplomatic relations that &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; maintains with them. They were utterly fascinated by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and called him \"thraegar\", a strange word of &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;'s origin, and nodded solemnly when he said he spoke for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, which was expected because of their obsession with protecting titan technology.\nMembers.\nCompanions.\nWhile questing you can speak to &lt;a href=\"High-Oracle%20Soo-say\"&gt;High-Oracle Soo-say&lt;/a&gt; and obtain a Gorloc companion. There are three items available to summon companions Lafoo, Jaloot, and Moodle. Each companion has its own unique personal abilities.\nReputation.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, the Oracles and the Frenzyheart tribe are opposing factions, in which gaining reputation with one loses reputation with the other.\nDuring the lead-in chain, your faction reputation will increase first with the Frenzyheart tribe and then with the Oracles. \"This has no bearing upon your ultimate choice of faction\", so do not become confused. At the end of the chain, you will become with the faction you choose, and with the other. You must complete this chain to gain access to the factional daily quests.\nThe only way to gain further reputation is by completing the daily quests offered by &lt;a href=\"High-Oracle%20Soo-say\"&gt;High-Oracle Soo-say&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Soo-dow\"&gt;Oracle Soo-dow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Soo-nee\"&gt;Oracle Soo-nee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Rainspeaker%20Canopy\"&gt;Rainspeaker Canopy&lt;/a&gt;. Three daily quests, awarding a total of 1700 reputation, are offered each day. The daily quests on offer may vary from day to day (refer to the table below).\nFor players who wish to earn the &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20of%20Sholazar\"&gt;Mercenary of Sholazar&lt;/a&gt; achievement, it is advisable to gain exalted status with the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; first. Then, after you switch sides and become exalted with the Oracles, you can continue to purchase and open &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Egg\"&gt;Mysterious Egg&lt;/a&gt;s as long as you wish. Another advantage to long-term Oracles alignment is that you may continue to use &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Talisman%20of%20Ablution\"&gt;Oracle Talisman of Ablution&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs.\nYou will be unable to complete daily quests for the Oracles and will be attacked on sight because you are or better with the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who are the Oracles' sworn enemies.\nFrom to.\nOnce you choose the Oracles and become , the only way to raise your reputation is to complete the three daily quests offered in &lt;a href=\"Rainspeaker%20Canopy\"&gt;Rainspeaker Canopy&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe quest &lt;a href=\"Appeasing%20the%20Great%20Rain%20Stone\"&gt;Appeasing the Great Rain Stone&lt;/a&gt; is the same from day to day, but only two additional dailies are offered for any given day. One of these two is random from the three quests that require you to slay Frenzyheart Attackers, and the other quest is random from the remaining four dailies that have \"song\" in the titles.\n to : 8 Days\n to : 13 Days\nRewards.\nThe most coveted item from the Oracles is the &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Egg\"&gt;Mysterious Egg&lt;/a&gt; which can hatch into four different non-combat pets and also a VERY rare &lt;a href=\"Green%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Green Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt; mount. If you're not a pet collector, this reputation is also part of two &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracles\"&gt;The Oracles&lt;/a&gt; for getting exalted with the Oracles and &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20of%20Sholazar\"&gt;Mercenary of Sholazar&lt;/a&gt; for getting exalted with both the Oracles and the Frenzyheart tribe.\nThe non-combat pets in the Mysterious Egg are &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Hatchling\"&gt;Cobra Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Proto-Drake%20Whelp\"&gt;Proto-Drake Whelp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tickbird%20Hatchling\"&gt;Tickbird Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"White%20Tickbird%20Hatchling\"&gt;White Tickbird Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;. The Egg also yields &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Yolk\"&gt;Aged Yolk&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwitching Factions.\nTo switch factions from the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart tribe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"the%20Oracles\"&gt;the Oracles&lt;/a&gt; you must defeat &lt;a href=\"Artruis%20the%20Heartless\"&gt;Artruis the Heartless&lt;/a&gt;, a level-77 elite that is soloable by many classes. During the fight with Artruis, you are attacked by both an Oracle (&lt;a href=\"Jaloot\"&gt;Jaloot&lt;/a&gt;) and a Frenzyheart (&lt;a href=\"Zepik\"&gt;Zepik&lt;/a&gt;). You must leave Jaloot the Oracle alive and kill Zepik the Frenzyheart, then finish defeating Artrius in order for the Oracle &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Oracles\"&gt;Hand of the Oracles&lt;/a&gt; quest giver to appear. Completing this quest automatically boosts your rep to , but REDUCES your Frenzyheart-tribe rep to , so make sure you finish up anything you wish to do with the Frenzyheart before completing this task.\nNote that players outside of the party, or uncooperative party members, may kill the NPC you intend to save, so be aware of which quest you are accepting. However, there is no real danger of accidentally switching faction as the change does not occur until completing the daily quest offered by the NPC who survived. If the desired quest giver is killed, simply wait for Artruis to respawn and repeat the encounter."}

Valente&lt;/a&gt; published in the anthology \"&lt;a href=\"Folk%20%26amp%3B%20Fairy%20Tales%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Folk &amp; Fairy Tales of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\". It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Zoltan%20Boros\"&gt;Zoltan Boros&lt;/a&gt;. The story tells of an attempt by &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to save the soul of her sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nWhen Sylvanas died at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa felt her death immediately though she was far away. Vereesa termed herself the \"Sister of Sorrow\" due to the pain of having lost all her family, the last of which was the \"Sister of Courage\" because she died confronting Arthas and defending &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;her people&lt;/a&gt;.\nVereesa has a flashback of their childhood: Sylvanas wearing a crown of white roses and &lt;a href=\"%3Abloodthistle\"&gt;:bloodthistle&lt;/a&gt;, they catch and release a fish, and Sylvanas places the crown on Vereesa's head.\nIn her despair she wanders the world, eventually coming upon a gate of black glass with two statues of elves: one statue labeled \"Regret\" staring westward with ivy and chestnut burrs in her hair, the other labeled \"Acceptance\" staring eastward with short neat curls with a resolute expression. A &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; watcher appears, named Elomia, but her face was the same as the elven statue named Acceptance.\nBecause Vereesa did not try to coerce, threaten, or argue with her, but only offered her pain and grief, Elomia grants Vereesa a favor. If Vereesa can bring the soul of Sylvanas to her from where she is, she will be revived on one condition: she cannot touch her at all, not even a strand of hair.\nFirst she travels through a dense &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; of giant trees, giant stags, creatures with great wings and furry legs, and more. Vereesa felt this was where Sylvanas was supposed to be, but she was not there.\nThe ground opened up, screams issuing from the chasm, and she fell into a &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; of gray and red dirt with spires of rock the color of bruises. The realm was empty save for a fortress to the east. Vereesa did not understand why Sylvanas was here. She tries asking the denizens of the land: the &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s responded there is no courage beyond the curtain of fear, the stones responded there is no courage beyond the mask of virtue, and sky responded there is no courage beyond the shield of hope.\nThen the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Banished One&lt;/a&gt; appeared. Vereesa asked him if her sister is there. He responded, \"Not yet.\" She remarks she also has a hole in her chest. He responds, \"Everyone does. It is only that mine is easy to see.\" He tells her to leave, mocking her for trying to find her family, because family is only those people who can hurt you the most.\nHe makes the fragment of Sylvanas appear from , and she helps the soul out of the river using her cloak. But the Banished One blocked their exit. Vereesa tries to fight him, but he tries to hurt Sylvanas, and Vereesa pulls her back to save her, failing in her task. He reveals he gave her the chance to watch her fail, to teach Sylvanas that family always fails you.\nSylvanas turns into a crystal and goes to the Jailer while Vereesa is pulled back to reality, accepting the loss of her sister and losing the memory of this encounter."}

{"id": "69484", "revid": "41339159", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69484", "title": "Sister of steel", "text": "In this time of conflict, members of both &lt;a href=\"gender\"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;s take up sword and axe and shield and march to the frontlines. However, due to a long tradition, more men than women become &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s. As conflicts continue, men become noticeably scarcer in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;. More and more, women perform the tasks traditionally reserved for men, such as working at the forge. The sisters of steel are just such a group of &lt;a href=\"female\"&gt;female&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLong experience at the &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; toughens the sisters' skin and strengthens their muscles to the point where they can plunge their hands into fire without wincing, and blades rebound from their flesh. Some whisper that these abilities are due to more than just a mundane connection to the forge \u2014 that strange and ancient &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; is at work. Some sisters claim that they benefit from the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; shaper and forger of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. When the need arises, the sisters of steel lift the weapons they forged and move out to combat their enemies.\nThe first sisters of steel were &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and most members are &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Their allies are glad for their aid, though a bit bemused at their powers. The fact that a few &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; women belong to their ranks proves false the idea that their abilities stem from dwarf-only phenomenon. Whatever the case, the sisters' allies are glad to stand by their sides. Their enemies view them with a healthy mixture of respect and fear.\nIn these troubled days, many sisters routinely leave their forges to patrol areas around Ironforge, crushing &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and other enemies of their people. Some travel farther afield, supporting the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on distant battlefronts. Others, knowing their strength in combat and seeking to enhance their smithing skills, travel the world in search of rare materials.\nSisters of steel excel at soaking up damage and dishing it out. They wade into melee combat, smashing their enemies with maces and axes as bullets and blades glance off their stonelike skin. The sisters of steel are staunch members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but the rare defector is possible.\nThe sister of steel has \"Skin of Steel\". Her skin looks to be made of &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed at least part of her body is a form of rocky and/or metallic flesh. The sister of steel's weight doubles. As she trains, the time spent training and at forges adds muscle mass, and she becomes stronger. Soon, the sister of steel's impressive skin causes blows to glance away, reducing the damage or negating it entirely. As the sister of steel continues her transformation into stone, she has an increased chance of blocking critical strikes against her, and soon arrows simply rebound off her skin. Note that as this is a supernatural ability, it is negated in an \"anti-magic field\" or similar effect. If the sister of steel loses her skin of steel ability (temporarily or permanently, for whatever reason), she also loses much of the protection she had gained through transformation reverting back to original self. \nIn time a sister of steel surpasses her mortality through \"Steelflesh Ascendance\" and becomes a being of living stone and metal. Her type changes from &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;. She gains immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis and stunning. She is not subject to critical hits at all. She no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe. Her weight doubles (in total, she weighs eight times her original weight). Unlike most other living creatures, the sister of steel no longer has dual nature \u2014 her soul and body form one unit. If she is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection, don't work on her. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited wishes, wishes, miracles, or true resurrection to restore her to life."}

As the name implies, they are an order of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;esses dedicated to the worship and servitude of the moon &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;dess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The Sisterhood is led by the High Priestess of Elune, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt; are the elite of the organization. As followers of the mother moon, they can be found throughout the world, ready to heal the war-weary &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with her holy &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have existed long before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and formal worship dates back about 15,000 years.\nHistory.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe headquarters of the Sisterhood was originally the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, but the Sisters staffed temples and chapterhouses on the whole length and breath of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The temple was lost when Suramar was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, but the Sisterhood, under the leadership of high priestess &lt;a href=\"Dejahna\"&gt;Dejahna&lt;/a&gt;, escaped and flocked to the banner of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Lord Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. A few weeks after the abandoning of Suramar, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; was made high priestess following the death of her predecessor at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;. The Sisterhood continued to fight in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; after Tyrande's capture by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 under the leadership of first &lt;a href=\"Marinda\"&gt;Marinda&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first members of the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; were from the Sisterhood of Elune.\nThe Long Vigil and current times.\nFollowing the conclusion of the war and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Sisterhood continued in a less formal role (many of the Sisters became &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s), particularly during the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Vigil\"&gt;Long Vigil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the priestesses, along with other units, rallied under &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Though they suffered heavy casualties in pushing the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; back, the night elves were successful in temporarily ending this threat to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves freedom from the Long Vigil, Tyrande led a much more formal and religious Sisterhood of Elune from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sisterhood helped the troubled citizens of &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; commanded the Sentinels and the Sisters of Elune to help the inhabitants of the ruined Darnassus. Tyrande would later send some of the Sisters into Alliance-held lands in order to help their people recover from the terrible ordeals of the Nightmare. The priestesses of Elune were also the ones responsible for preserving Malfurion's slumbering body and keeping him alive even as unbeknownst to them, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; sought to slowly poison him to death.\nA branch of the Sisterhood of Elune, implied to be an ancient offshoot of the Suramar priesthood in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, was apparently given the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to seal the Legion's portal, and shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and the isolation of Suramar. &lt;a href=\"Lyanis%20Moonfall\"&gt;Lyanis Moonfall&lt;/a&gt; stated that her \"order\" has protected the sacred artifact at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years. Tyrande Whisperwind reunited with these priestesses ten millennia later and together, they successfully defended the Temple and slew the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, whereupon &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; directly intervened to purify the fallen Aspect as well as her Tears.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; destroyed &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande sent several priestesses there. Together with the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, they built &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s there.\nThe Sisterhood of Elune attempted to aid Malfurion Stormrage and their kin in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, with some &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28War%20of%20the%20Thorns%29\"&gt;priestesses&lt;/a&gt; rallied to the region to bolster the other kaldorei forces. Most of the Sisterhood of Elune, including &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, apparently perished in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; after refusing to abandon the remaining night elves in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. However, those who survived fought in Darkshore against the Horde forces immediately after Teldrassil's destruction, many having apparently lost their families, and enchanted &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Ward\"&gt;Lunar Ward&lt;/a&gt;s to assist their defenders, only to be slain by the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Priestess%20Maestra\"&gt;Moon Priestess Maestra&lt;/a&gt; was targeted by the Horde in Ashenvale at &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt;, controlling the pass between &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"Devout%20Priestess\"&gt;Devout Priestess&lt;/a&gt;es were slain in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; when the Horde &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War%20%28Faction%20Assaults%29\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their heavy losses and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the Sisterhood, including &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Priestess%20Lasara\"&gt;Moon Priestess Lasara&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Nightwreathed%20Priestess\"&gt;Nightwreathed Priestess&lt;/a&gt;es would join the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; in revenge for the Burning of Teldrassil, being infused with &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s power, and ultimately survived the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, witnessing Tyrande's victory speech at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; after the Alliance successfully reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, a group of priestesses of Elune tended to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Shrine of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;, singing prayers for the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nRole in the night elven society.\nThe Sisters are a major and active night elven political faction, and fulfill the role of magistrates, officials, and others for the night elven government. The highest-ranking of the Sisters are privy to the government's most important secrets, such as the original condition of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the power struggle that erupted between &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sisterhood of Elune is the highest echelon of the priesthood that serves the &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;dess of the moon, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The Sisterhood has remained exclusively female up until recent times. This is largely because of a common belief that the deepest mysteries of Elune can only be comprehended by women. Although the vast majority of Elune's priesthood is still comprised of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; women, the order has come to accept Kaldorei males into its ranks as well.\nThe Sisterhood has maintained its role since the days of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, over 10,000 years prior; although this role was significantly less political before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Owing to their military capabilities, the Sisterhood also played an active role in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where they joined with the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to curb the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They ultimately played a decisive role in numerous battles with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, acting as both, elite shock troops, and adept healers.\nAs part of night elf culture, priestesses are part of the rituals for their dead. A priestess ritualistically cleanses the body of the deceased individual in &lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;pools of moonlit water&lt;/a&gt;, combining &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to mend the dead body for a final viewing. Then, they sing arias that highlight the life and sacrifices of the fallen as a burial shroud is draped around the deceased.\nMembership.\nAll &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who served Elune were night elf women. However, after the devastation of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, they thought that the organization had drifted too far away from night elf society and decided to open up their group more to the world. As a result, although a majority of Elune's priests are still women, the order now welcomes men into its ranks.\nElune expected dedication from her priests, but she did not demand that they give her every waking moment \u2014 the Mother Moon was a kind, loving mistress. One of these dedications was called the Ritual of the High Moon.\nThe center of her worship was the Temple of the Moon in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande Whisperwind is her high priestess, but many priests, are found throughout the world, ready to heal the war-weary &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with her light.\nTraining.\nThe sisterhood trained its priestesses in war training and to learn to survive at times with minimal sustenance. There were even four periods of ritual fasting each year, done as a sign of dedication to the goddess."}

He was one of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted servants, acted as the master of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, and was by all accounts eager to use it to make more iron creations for his master. He liked to go on about how weak the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; were, and thought that flesh beings were weak and fragile.\n500 years ago, a dwarf named &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt; came to the Halls of Stone and asked the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; to have her deceased &lt;a href=\"Mithrios%20Stormsmith\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; \"remade\". However, they refused and were ordered by Sjonnir to kill her, as she was of flesh and therefore weak in their eyes. She fought the waves of iron dwarves until her axe shattered, but a spirit arrived in a wave of blinding light to save, and she fought her way out of Ulduar.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; when they raided &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. His dagger, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fleshshaper\"&gt;The Fleshshaper&lt;/a&gt;, ended up in the hands of those he thought so fragile.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"While some resisted Loken's corruption, Sjonnir the Ironshaper was eager to turn the Forge of Wills to a darker purpose. He considers his new creations vastly superior to the earthen, and will unleash them on any who defy Loken's will.\"\nTactics.\nRegular.\nHis lightning shield should be &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;led or &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;spellstolen&lt;/a&gt; quickly as this saves some damage throughout the fight.\nThe tank will need to gather the adds that are spawned throughout the fight. Watch for the little blobs as they will congregate in the middle of the fight zone and form into larger oozes. If you have an AoE tank, the adds should not be a problem, continue focus firing on the boss. If your group finds them getting out of hand and aggroing the healer, they can be dealt with quickly by the DPS.\nWhen he uses his AoE lightning attack, it is strongly recommend moving out of the way. Getting a full stack of the nature damage debuff means the oozes will likely kill the tank.\nHeroic.\nIt is strongly encouraged remove his Lightning Shield (priests &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;, shamans &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt;, warriors &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Slam\"&gt;Shield Slam&lt;/a&gt;, or mages &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt;), as the 1000 nature damage it does in normal is increased to 3000 in heroic.\nAn easy method is to have one DPS on the left press and one DPS on the right press, both killing the adds as they spawn. The tank keeps Sjonnir in the center near where he starts while the healer and the other DPS are on the walkway you come in on.\nAlternate heroic strategy.\nThis works well even if you have no one to deal with Lighting Shield or resist nature damage. This is probably the easiest and safest method.\nBasically, survive until you see the Slime / Blobb guys coming out around the center of the room. ALL DPS focus on the slimes at this point. Kill every one of them before they morph into uber slimes. At that point you'll have elite dwarves charging into the room to help you DPS boss down. \nAgain, simply avoid Lighting Ring (channeled attack), burn slimes as soon as you see them, and then burn boss.\nQuotes.\nThere you are! I think I've just about got this door figured out. Let me know when you're ready and I'll open'er up!"}

Cleansing a &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; bloodline or decapitating &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; might garner the appellation of \"dutiful,\" but it takes a true act of depravity to be called \"ruthless.\" Skadi earned his title long ago for relentlessly hunting down vrykul who sheltered the malformed infants, predecessors of humanity, condemned by &lt;a href=\"Ymiron\"&gt;Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAttacks and abilities.\nStage 1: Grauf.\nSkadi the Ruthless starts the fight by mounting his drake, Grauf. While mounted, Skadi will fly overhead and order Grauf to breathe freezing clouds onto players below.Skadi remains mounted until players fire three harpoons at Grauf by using the Harpoon Launcher.\nStrategies.\nSkadi is one of a very small group of Heroic bosses who are still (as of patch 3.3) able to cause noteworthy problems for a well-geared player group, and he is to be respected on that basis.\nThis fight is relatively complicated but not difficult once learned. The single most important thing is to keep moving around; Grauf's frost breath, and then Skadi's whirlwind, mean that characters who remain in one place, focused too purely on their rotation at the expense of all else, will likely end up dead fairly quickly.\nWhen the fight begins, Skadi the Ruthless will mount his proto-drake and fly up into the air, beginning a gauntlet style event. Your party must work their way about 150 yards up a hallway fighting 4-5 waves of 5-6 Frost Vrykul each. \nWhile you are fighting through the gauntlet, Skadi will fly over on his drake and cast a frostfog breath ability on the ground in long strips. Standing in the fog does ~3k a second. It is useful to have a member of the party aware of Skadi's movement so that you can predict and call which side of the hall his breath will be cast on. Grauf's breath will kill party members quickly if they are caught in it, so mobility and situational awareness are very important here.\n&lt;a href=\"Ymirjar%20Harpooner\"&gt;Ymirjar Harpooner&lt;/a&gt;s will drop harpoons that stick in the ground. Party members need to loot the harpoons along the way.\nWhen you reach the end of the gauntlet, there are three harpoon guns mounted on the edge of the keep. Occasionally you will see the emote that \"\" and a party member who has a harpoon needs to use the harpoon gun. An effective strategy is to assign a single player to collect the harpoons and fire them at Skadi. Several harpoons can be fired in one pass if the player is fast. The harpoons are labeled as \"Utgarde Pinnacle\" similar to the Tempest Keep label on the legendary weapons in the Kael'thas Sunstrider raid fight. This label causes any harpoons still in your inventory to disappear once you leave the instance, meaning if you wipe, you must recollect harpoons.\nAfter 3 hits with harpoons on both normal and Heroic, Skadi's drake will die and he will dismount. When he lands the tank must quickly establish aggro otherwise Skadi may immediately kill vulnerable group members. It is handy if hunters use misdirection (and rogues use tricks of the trade) on the tank in anticipation of this and begin DPSing immediately. From this point on the adds stop spawning and it is essentially a tank and spank, although the group will need to stay reasonably mobile, as his whirlwind attack can kill characters in its path. He has an ability that does ~6k damage to the tank and stuns him for 2 seconds. Skadi will also occasionally cast whirlwind, which hits for ~2k, and target a random party member (Warriors use disarm even on Heroic). The targeted party member must kite the boss away from the rest of party to reduce overall damage taken (Warriors can and should taunt while kiting backwards, this will pull the boss towards them during his whirlwind). Skadi will also occasionally throw a poisoned spear which will hit for around 6k and then DoT for around 2k every 3 seconds, healers must be fast to react to this as an already weakened player will die quickly from it.\nEasiest way to do it.\nThe gauntlet resets if everyone runs into the previous room so to make it easier, have four people stand in the previous room and let one person go in and start the event. Stay inside the doorway and kill the Ymirjar Harpooners (usually 2 adds at a time come into the doorway) until you gather the harpoons. When you have gathered the harpoons, go back into the previous room and the boss will despawn. Once he despawns, the group runs to the end of the hallway. One person will head back to the boss and start the event. Kill the mobs, paying especially close attention to the \"Witch Doctors\"\u2014who cast mostly at healers\u2014preferably killing these mobs as they spawn. Once you have downed the majority of the mobs, during the next boss pass have the person carrying the harpoons shoot the boss down. Then begin to clear remaining adds, and finally the boss. Beware: rushing to the Harpoon end and gathering in the doorway despawns the boss mid-combat.\nSpeculation.\nDue to his appearance and the fact he is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, he is probably one of them."}

The descendants of these Dark Irons were transformed by the evil inside Grim Batol, ironically caused by the curse invoked by their ancestors' &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; queen through the use of &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore animal than sentient being but not without cunning, they are described as being close in shape to a &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, but with clawed, paw-like hands, covered in black, coarse, scales on their bodies (even where there should be a beard), and a double-forked tongue. Their bodies are slightly shorter than the average dwarf, but have slightly extra width made up of muscle, from digging through earth with their bare hands. Their hands allow them to run as quadrupeds, and even scale cave walls and ceilings like spiders. Despite their stocky shape, they can move with far more swiftness than one would assume. Even when disarmed, they can fight with tooth and claw. A mouth full of sharp, reptilian teeth is used to devour any kind of meat they come across, no matter what state it's in; this causes them to have foul breath and a bite that can make a victim ill. Their eyes are red, much like modern Dark Irons, described as molten earth, blood red, and crimson. They tend to hiss, will howl when hunting, and their laughter sounds like someone choking on something. The skardyn will use their sense of smell to examine their surroundings, such as the earth, air, and what life there is around them when hunting (and presumably tracking). While there are male and female skardyn, even dwarves cannot tell the difference between the two genders.\nThe skardyn tend to wear ragged, brown hooded garments with armor, and use belts. They still use the markings of the Dark Iron clan on their garments, which decisively identified their origins. In terms of weapons, they have &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;s on their belts, use &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s with the same style from the War of the Three Hammers, and palm-sized, spiked balls made of metal, which are either tossed by hand or thrown using slings. They also favor &lt;a href=\"pike\"&gt;pike&lt;/a&gt;s and whips along with the axes. As the War occurred a few decades before the dwarven discovery of gunpowder, the skardyn also use the \"dwyar'hun\" (literally \"star bow\" from the older dwarven dialect), a long-range weapon akin to a tiny &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. It fires a tiny spiked ball carved from stone, with the spikes being at least two inches long (the \"star\"). So long ago that the weapon has been abandoned, modern dwarves would not recognize it unless having seen or read about it in the historical records.\nSkardyn have carried down the love of the pipe from their ancestors. Instead of the carved wooden pipes of the dwarves, they use curled pipes crafted from clay. What they fill them with is a mystery, as the only known substance that dead skardyn have been found with for smoking smells like old grass and mulched earth worms, something even the hardiest of dwarves would rather not experiment with. They also at least know of the ritual of &lt;a href=\"Gwyarbrawden\"&gt;Gwyarbrawden&lt;/a&gt; and the legends tied to it; whether they practice it is unknown. The skardyn speak a form of &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, even if they often talk in a manner that's unintelligible to other dwarves. They consider dwarves from the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; good eating."}

He is also accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Dalronn%20the%20Controller\"&gt;Dalronn the Controller&lt;/a&gt;, a necromancer. Both of them will fight at the same time when aggroed.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"It's a vrykul tradition to make unlikely partners work together. Some say it's to allow divergent abilities to complement each other; others say it's for the amusement of King &lt;a href=\"Ymiron\"&gt;Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, Skarvald and Dalronn are a perfect example of this custom. Between a vrykul's brawn and a human's necromantic arts, they will punish those who meddle with the Scourge.\"\nNormal.\nStrategy.\nKill Order.\nOne school of thought is that they should both die at roughly the same time. This strategy involves DPSing Skarvald down to 10%, kill Dalronn, and then finish off Skarvald. This is because Skarvald will randomly charge players, and when his spirit spawns it will do the same, usually towards the healer. Since the spirit has no aggro table, he may stay on the healer until the fight finishes.\nAnother is that with his casting times Dalronn is by far the easier of the pair to heal through and really doesn't have an aggro table anyway. This strategy involves having the tank build aggro on both bosses, but all DPS goes onto Dalronn. Once he dies you ignore his spirit and focus all attention on Skarvald.\nThere are no standard strategies that involve killing Skarvald first, as doing so is very likely to result in a wipe.\nPositioning and Distance.\nOne way to kill the pair is to position the entire group inside Skarvald's minimum intercept range. This eliminates the complications introduced by his charging and turns the fight into a standard tank and spank.\nThe other way is to tank the bosses right next to each other so the melee cannot be intercepted, but place the ranged DPS and healers as far away as possible. When Skarvald intercepts one of the ranged characters he will immediately re-aggro the tank (assuming the tank is top threat) and the time he spends running back to the tank is time he won't spend causing damage.\nHeroic Differences.\nDalronn.\nKill Order.\nNo differences here. Either kill both bosses at roughly the same time, or kill Dalronn first. Don't kill Skarvald first; he deals far too much damage to run around without an aggro table, especially with no minimum range on his intercept.\nPositioning.\nWith the removal of Skarvald's minimum range on his intercept all ranged DPS should stand at range.\nThe one exception is groups made up of one tank, three melee dps, and a healer. Skarvald won't charge targets in melee range (he'll punch them in the face instead) so in this kind of group makeup Skarvald will default to the healer every intercept, usually killing the healer on the second or third intercept. In this case even the healer needs to stay in or near Skarvald's melee range to avoid getting gibed.\nAdds.\nDalronn's summoned skeletons tend to aggro healers like most summoned adds do. However, they only have 10k hp and are vulnerable to every form of CC known (assuming said CC will work on undead).\nIn general the DPS can handle the adds so long as they \"all\" attack the adds. One person by themselves can get overwhelmed as the adds do hit harder than normal mobs of their level.\nIf the group has heavy melee dps, it will usually work better if a ranged DPSer grabs the adds from the healer and drags them to the tank. With two bosses most melee DPS will be going pretty heavy on the AoE attacks anyway.\nDPS\nHealers"}

The main tank and off tank should build aggro on the non-CC'd usher. If possible, the main tank should spell-reflect after he is afflicted with frost shock, reflecting the stun part of the spell. Unfortunately, the aggro-reduction is not reflectable. For the shackled mob, spell-reflect immediately.\nAggro discipline is the key to this encounter. Give the tanks enough time to build up threat before starting to deal damage, or the time lost resurrecting and rebuffing raid members will more than offset any time saved by DPSing early.\nIf your group can spare the healing, spam shackles on the raid target to gain reaction time from an Ice Tomb.

The reek of decay lured many scavengers to the refuse pit, including the great Ji-Kun. Ruthless and cunning, the monstrous bird devoured her rivals one-by-one until she held sole dominion over the shadowy tunnel.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"This fight takes place in a cylindrical shaft containing a large central platform with multiple nests located both above and below that platform. The encounter was designed to highlight the strong vertical elements of the terrain, without adding actual aerial combat which could have felt awkward. For example, players can gain and use a temporary flight ability to switch levels and deal with Ji-Kun\u2019s fledglings before they mature and pose a greater threat to the raid.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nJi-Kun's Flock.\nJi-Kun's young are located throughout the roost and progress through different stages of life. After a period of incubation Young Eggs of Ji-Kun will hatch into Hatchlings. When fed by Ji-Kun, the Hatchlings then mature into Fledglings. Both Fledgling Eggs and Mature Eggs will hatch into Juveniles.\nStrategy.\nTanks take turns to allow Talon Rake to fall off. It is not unusual for it to reach 2 stacks before the other tank's debuff falls off.\nDuring Downdraft all players run toward the center to avoid getting blown off the platform. If you have short-cooldown speed boosts like &lt;a href=\"Dash%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Dash (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;Death's Advance (death knight ability)&lt;/a&gt; these can be used. Tanks charge back to melee range as quickly as possible to prevent Ji-Kun from eating DPS who foolishly return to melee range before you.\nThe difference between success and failure is a good Nest Team. The job of the nest team is to travel to the various nests indicated by a red column of light to kill the birds hatching in the nest. The eggs in the active nest hatch into five Hatchlings. A good nest team will kill all the birds before they can spawn Juveniles. Defeating the birds in the nest creates red feathers that players can walk through to gain an &lt;a href=\"ExtraActionButton1\"&gt;ExtraActionButton1&lt;/a&gt; granting short-duration flight. These flight powers can be used to return to the main platform, or fly to other nests.\nThe nest team fails when the adds are able to spawn Juveniles. When Ji-Kun performs a Feed Young, these Hatchlings can convert into Fledglings. If there are Fledglings in the nest they can create a Mature Egg which will hatch into a Juvenile. The job of the nest team is to prevent this progression by destroying all the adds.\nSometimes the red column of light indicates an upper nest. The nest team must fly to an upper nest which is different from lower nests because they contain two Mature Eggs. If not destroyed quickly these Mature Eggs will spawn Juveniles which fly off to start wiping the raid.\nJuveniles fly above the main platform and bombard the players battling Ji'kun. They are out of range of players unless players use the Daedalian Wings.\nThe flight power of Daedalian Wings is temporary, and once it expires the player drops (either to a nest, platform, or into the pit) and there's a cooldown before the wings are usable again. Falling into the pit is not fatal, but the player is unable to act while the winds carry them back to the main platform.\n&lt;a href=\"LFR\"&gt;LFR&lt;/a&gt;.\nLFR mode is easier because once a player has acquired Daedalian Wings they usually retain the power of flight throughout the encounter. This durable flight power enables players to avoid Down Draft by taking flight at will and becoming immune to the pushback.\nHeroic Mode.\nConsidered one of the easiest Heroic modes,the only addition is than selected nests(nest 2,4,8,10,12 on 10Man and nest 2,6,12,17,22,29 on 25Man) will have nest guardians who melees and does a 180 frontal cleave to his highest aggro target. For this reasons, in this nest one of the tanks not tanking the boss should go and tank the nest guardian while the nest group kill the eggs then the guardians. If the group leaves the nest with the guardians alive, they will silence healers and wipe the raid.\nOn 10 man, the first two nests are ALWAYS lower nests; tanks should rotate to go to one of them and pick the daedalian wings to reach the upper nests when they need to tank a nest guardian there. It's important to not waste any daedalian wing charges and take new charges if possible, as on Heroic players only get three charges from a single feather.\nFor a specific guide about which nest each tank should go,you can check &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1295615-Heroic-Ji-kun-%252810-man%2529-1-or-2-nest-tanks\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Soon as Ji-Kun is low on HP,the raid should ignore the nests and burn the boss with Heroism.If the raid have high dps they can just go to the first round(or even less,depending on the raid dps) and then burn boss.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He holds that it's honorable to defend home and family no matter the cost. Outgoing, passionate, and not one for deep thought, he is always the first into the fray. Ji finds himself attracted to the practicality that defines the Horde. Although it will cost him dearly, he will decide to carry the Horde banner when he leaves the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Wandering Isle, Ji can be found as a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; trainer outside the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Grunt\"&gt;Orgrimmar Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s, when asked where the monk trainer is, comment that Ji watches the fights in the arena, and occasionally participates himself. He was later placed in charge of welcoming newcomers to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt;. As the leader of the Huojin, Ji would eventually come to be seated on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; as the pandaren representative.\nBiography.\nJi grew up in &lt;a href=\"Wu-Song%20Village\"&gt;Wu-Song Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nLi Li's Travel Journal.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was running after &lt;a href=\"Shu\"&gt;Shu&lt;/a&gt; to Wu-Song Village, but she lost his trail. Ji was there and advised her to find him by a method of &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nJi and [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] met the [[pandaren]] [[adventurer]]s sent by [[Master Shang Xi]] in an effort to recover the four elemental spirits. After recovering [[Huo]], Ji was unable to wake [[Wugou]] until the coming of the adventurers sent by Aysa. Afterward, Ji led an assault to the [[Morning Breeze Village]] to solve the [[hozen]] problem. When the elemental spirits were recovered, the pandaren discovered that the pain of [[Shen-zin Su]] was a thorn - [[The Skyseeker]]. Ji decided to blow up what was left of the Skyseeker, causing him to fall out with Aysa. With the battle between the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]] affecting their land, Ji chose to join the Horde at any cost. To prove his loyalty, he fought in the [[Ring of Valor]] against a gronn, an ettin, and a magnataur for [[Garrosh Hellscream]].\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nImprisoned by the [[Kor'kron]] and beaten unconscious, Ji was rescued by [[Aysa Cloudsinger]] during the [[Siege of Orgrimmar]] and taken out of the city. Begging him to live, Aysa promised that the two of them could return to the turtle and be together.\nWar Crimes.\nJi survived and served as a liaison for the Horde and [[Taran Zhu]] during the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, such as directing the Horde leaders to an appropriate temple for a discussion of Garrosh's defender.\nLegion.\n[[File:AysaJi Legion.jpg|thumb|Aysa and Ji teaching a class together.]]\nJi is present in [[Grommash Hold]] witnessing Vol'jin's death after the battle of the [[Broken Shore]].\nTrue to her words at the Siege of Orgrimmar, Aysa and Ji returned to the Wandering Isle. They can be found in [[Mandori Village]] after the isle becomes the monk [[Order Hall]], teaching monk trainees together.\nWhen a [[Horde]] player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Ji can be found in the [[Undercity]] alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During [[A Royal Audience (Horde)]], he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the [[High Warlord's Medal of Valor]] from the [[Warchief]], as well as an artifact appearance.\nJi Firepaw was not present for the Orgrimmar parade or the dinner as he was far away. His followers, however, participated in the feast.\nHe later arrived to the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]] with the other leaders.\nA Good War.\nDuring one of his daily inspections of Orgrimmar a few weeks before the [[War of the Thorns]], [[Varok Saurfang]] saw Ji demonstrating a form of unarmed combat to a new batch of monk students in the Valley of Honor. Firepaw smiled at Saurfang and offered a salute, which Varok returned before continuing his walk.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n[[File:Ji BFA.jpg|thumb|Ji Firepaw within the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]].]]\nDuring the [[Fourth War]], Ji accompanied the Horde forces to [[Dazar'alor]] and can be seen atop the main mast of \"[[The Banshee's Wail]]\". Ji later attended Talanji's coronation.\nWhen [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]] was arrested and [[Thomas Zelling|Zelling]] was killed for their parts in freeing [[Derek Proudmoore]] from Horde captivity, Ji believed Baine was right to act when he did lest his anger turns into a greater threat down the line.\nJi Firepaw supported Saurfang in his revolution against Sylvanas and traveled to [[Thunder Bluff]] to tend to the injured Baine because he had no wish to see Orgrimmar under siege once again. Baine and Ji were soon joined by [[Mayla Highmountain]], who was ordered by Saurfang to defend Thunder Bluff in case Sylvanas launched a counterattack. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a [[Mak'gora]], which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. A stunned Lor'themar ordered for [[Adventurer|champions]] to report what had transpired to Baine. After learning that Saurfang had passed, Ji remarked on the [[Huojin]] belief of it being better to die doing what is right than to live in the shadow of what is wrong. He then declared that Saurfang would have made a good Huojin and attended the High Overlord's funeral.\nSome time later, Ji made his way into the [[Orgrimmar Embassy]], where he sought to strengthen the Horde. Upon learning that a [[vulpera]] [[caravan]] had arrived at [[Grommash Hold]] he informed the [[Adventurer|Speaker of the Horde]] that they not only wished to address the Horde but had personally requested their presence. However, Ji warned that it wasn't the best time for guests and requested that the Speaker see them as they were able. This would ultimately start the chain of events that end with the [[Voldunai]] vulpera led by [[Kiro]] joining the Horde. When the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] [[Assault: The Warring Clans|comes]] [[Assault: The Black Empire (Vale of Eternal Blossoms)|under]] [[Assault: The Endless Swarm|attack]], Ji can be seen defending the [[Shrine of Two Moons]].\nIn the aftermath of [[N'Zoth]]'s death and the end of the [[Fourth War]], Ji and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the [[Alliance|Grand Alliance]], putting the [[Fourth War]] on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, [[Lor'themar Theron]] addressed the absence of a [[Warchief]]. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the [[Horde Council]] was created, with Ji representing the [[Huojin Pandaren]].\nShadows Rising.\nWhen a Horde Council meeting is derailed by a failed assassination attempt on [[Talanji]], the [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] queen and a key ally, Ji and the rest of the Horde leaders are forced into action. They empower the young [[Jungle troll|troll]] [[shaman]] [[Zekhan]], still grieving the loss of [[Varok Saurfang]], with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. Upon learning that the [[Alliance]] was aware of the [[Widow's Bite|unrest]] in [[Zandalar]], their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, Ji told Thrall that he wished to accompany him to said meeting.\nIn return, Thrall pointed out how the negotiation will require a delicate touch in contrast to Ji's wisdom in generally acting as swiftly as possible, and the council may not vote in favor of it. Though acknowledging that Thrall had a point, Ji was insistence and remarked how popular or not a [[Garrosh Hellscream|previous rogue]] [[warchief]] had almost cost his people the soul of [[Pandaria|their homeland]] and that the [[pandaren]] will forever wear the scars of Hellscream's cruelty. Thus, when the council meeting occurred, it was Ji who brought up a meeting with the Alliance, and in the end they voted unanimously in favor of Thrall and Ji to meet with [[Jaina Proudmoore]] and [[Anduin Wrynn]] in hopes that it would aid in the hunt and capture of [[Sylvanas Windrunner]].\nThe Horde and Alliance subsequently met on a boat at seas off the coast Zandalar. During the meeting, Ji grew outraged when Anduin accused the Horde of betraying the Alliance by allowing Sylvanas to have a refuge on [[Zandalar]]. While Thrall was quick to smooth over Anduin's worries in that regard, the orc and pandaren realized that the [[Widow's Bite]] were working with the [[Banshee loyalists]]. When Anduin mentioned how [[Mathias Shaw]] was taken prisoner by the [[Zandalari Empire]], Ji reassured the young king that the Horde Council did not execute prisoners without trial. However, Anduin retorted that he wished to have Shaw returned soon. When the waves threatened to upend the boat, Jaina ported everyone to safety with Ji and Thrall being sent to the shores of [[Dazar'alor]].\nSafely emerging from the portal the pair headed off to inform Talanji of what they learned only to be attacked members of the Widow's Bite within the city itself. They, with the help of the [[Rastari]] and [[Rokhan]], were able to deal with the attackers and revealed to Talanji the connection between their enemies. With their task complete, the pair returned to Orgrimmar, where the armies of the Horde were rallied.\nQuotes.\n[[File:Ji Firepaw in Orgrimmar.jpg|thumb|Ji outside the [[Ring of Valor]] in Orgrimmar.]]\nGossip.\nThe only true crime is inaction.\nHah! Waking [[Wugou|this guy]] is no easy feat! I've hit him, I've tried to pull him over with a rope, I've thrown my body into this gong, and nothing! Ah well, I've got more ideas to get started on.\nThe amount of time [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] spends practicing seems excessive... but you can't deny the results. Her form is beautiful.\nAysa? I don't know what to say to her. Should I tell her she's gorgeous, or would she find that creepy? Maybe I could tell her I admire her poise - but then she might think I don't have any personality!\nThis day seems to be one full of hard decisions. Having the courage to make them is gravely important, for the sake of us all. I did what I had to do, and we may have all been doomed if I had not\u2026 but sadly, not all see it that way.\nIt is time for me to leave Shen-zin Su, that those here might be free from the burden of my difficult choice, and that I might fight on for the sake of a much larger world.\nI've only known [[Korga Strongmane|Korga]] a short time, but he and I could be brothers if he were born in a different skin - he possesses bravery and honor that I would gladly stand beside. You too could be my &lt;brother/sister&gt;, after all we've been through together. I'm hoping you might join us, but I understand that there is much to consider.\nThese are my kind of people. You can really feel like they're going somewhere!\nAnyways, what can I show you about being a monk, friend?\nIt is always good to see you, [[Adventurer|&lt;name&gt;]].

Let us work together to strengthen the Horde!\nControversy.\nDuring the \"[[World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria|Mists of Pandaria]]\" beta, a forum post on the \"Mists of Pandaria Beta Feedback\" forum sought to highlight what some saw as a form of sexism. Ji Firepaw greeted female characters saying \"Hello, friend! You're some kind of gorgeous, aren't you? I bet you can't keep the men off of you! Join me! You and I are going to be good friends!\" To men, he instead said \"Hello, friend! You've got a strong look to you! I bet you're all the rage with the ladies! Join me! You and I are going to be good friends!\" This form was followed by a very long discussion.\nAs a result, this interaction was changed during beta. Ji now simply greets characters of either gender by saying, \"You seem poised and ready. I can tell we are going to be good friends.\" [[Zarhym]] commented that \"...Your feedback has been received. I don't think we need another 100+ pages of discussion about one line of quest text or this will end up being a very long beta.\"\nA reference to the controversy was added a few patches later. When Ji and [[Aysa Cloudsinger|Aysa]] are both at [[Morning Breeze Village]] he has some special dialogs that can be read above.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Pandaren characters]]\n[[Category:Monk characters]]\n[[Category:Monk trainers]]\n[[Category:Emissaries]]\n[[Category:Huojin Pandaren]]\n[[Category:Order of the Broken Temple]]\n[[Category:Quest givers]]\n[[Category:Unique voices]]\n[[Category:Wandering Isle NPCs]]\n[[Category:Orgrimmar NPCs]]\n[[Category:Siege of Orgrimmar NPCs]]\n[[Category:Temple of Five Dawns NPCs]]\n[[Category:Undercity NPCs]]\n[[Category:Dazar'alor NPCs]]\n[[Category:Stormsong Valley NPCs]]\n[[Category:Thunder Bluff NPCs]]\n[[Category:Vale of Eternal Blossoms NPCs]]\n[[Category:Destination: Pandaria characters]]\n[[Category:War Crimes characters]]\n[[Category:Before the Storm characters]]\n[[Category:A Good War characters]]\n[[Category:Shadows Rising characters]]\n[[es:Ji Zarpa Abrasadora]]"}

She was a hero of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, and became the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, just after the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a young girl from &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt; named Jiang was walking through the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt; when she heard a noise. A small &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; lay there on the ground, injured and near death. With a mother's gentleness, Jiang took the creature into her arms and into her care. She named him &lt;a href=\"Lo\"&gt;Lo&lt;/a&gt;, and they became fast friends.\nHowever, the townsfolk shunned Jiang, and begged for her to get rid of Lo before he became old enough to hurt her. During that time, the cloud serpents were feared by the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, as the beasts were seen as violent and aggressive creatures, and even to approach one was to flirt with danger.\nHowever, one day, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; army had pushed as far south as the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Jiang answered the call to arms and defended her people on the beaches. During one of the battles, Jiang nearly perished at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; spear, but just as the weapon was inches from her heart, Lo came to the rescue. The serpent, only half grown, swooped in and ripped the troll limb from limb. He then gathered up the wounded Jiang and flew her far from the battle to safety. When she was well enough, Jiang approached the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses, the warrior &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s who defended the land from the trolls and other dangers. She tried to explain to them how serpents could help, how Lo had saved her, and how she knew how to turn the tide of battle, but her words fell on deaf ears. The monks were mired in their own wisdom and chose to continue their defense in the way they sought fit, but their rejection only fueled Jiang's resolve.\nSeveral days later, the Zandalari had pushed in from the coast, and the pandaren champions stood their ground on the &lt;a href=\"Gong%20of%20Hope\"&gt;great bridge&lt;/a&gt; near Dawn's Blossom. The Zandalari numbers were vast, and their &lt;a href=\"bat%20rider\"&gt;bat rider&lt;/a&gt;s fought in such a way the pandaren had no counter to. Just as the battle was thought to be lost, however, Jiang swooped in on Lo, plucking the Zandalari from the bridge and striking down their bat riders.\nThe war would still take many months to win, but the tide of war had turned. Soon, Jiang started training other pandaren how to ride as she did, upon the backs of other serpents, and soon a small army arose. Flying into battle at Jiang's side, these serpent riders became known as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls knew there was little they could do to win by conventional means, so &lt;a href=\"Mengazi\"&gt;Mengazi&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the Zandalari forces, turned to his final tactic: resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, first emperor of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; which the pandaren had &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; prior to the Zandalari Wars. A battle erupted at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;, where Lei Shen's corpse was enshrined, and Jiang sacrificed herself to kill Mengazi and prevent the resurrection. The Zandalari fled, and the war was won.\nThere was great celebration throughout the empire, but also mourning, especially for Jiang. Lo was seen circling the skies above the Jade Forest for decades after the war, seemingly searching for his friend and rider. The other serpent riders honored Jiang's memory by codifying her teachings in the Order of the Cloud Serpent."}

Each player has twenty-four six-sided pieces that are stored in cylindrical canisters when the game isn't being played. Each one has symbols inscribed on it, including dots to indicate movement and an arrow to indicate facing.\nThe game begins with each player shaking out a half dozen cubes from their canister, centering them on the last row of the gridded game board, orienting them to their lowest value, and facing them toward the opposition. Each player then shakes out one more cube and compare the highest side. The player with the highest value is the one allowed to move first. These last cubes are then returned to the canister, and the game begins.\nA player can move as indicated by the piece's uppermost face and attack, or change the face by one side, then either move or attack. It's also possible to pick up the piece and roll it, randomly selecting a new side, then return it to its facing and play. A player can also decide not to move at all, instead drawing a random new piece by shaking and upending the canister. The first piece that falls out is put into play. If two fall out, the second is removed from play, and the opposing player is allowed to draw a new piece without penalty.\nJihui pieces include archers, cavalry, kites, knights (which can move far), warriors, and warlords. Each player also has a navy consisting of six ships. One of the ships' faces is the fireship, a very important piece that can destroy anything but is consumed in the destruction, removing it from play. Some players reportedly burn the piece. The only way the fireship face can come up for a ship is through the aforementioned method of rolling a piece to randomly select a new side. Only one of the ships in a player's navy can become a fireship.\nJihui encapsulates much of pandaren philosophy. It simultaneously encourages thoughtfulness and incorporates impulsiveness. It balances deliberation with chance, but chance can also be punished. For a player to lose to a foe who has more pieces on the board is not a great loss. To yield to a superior position, regardless of the pieces in play, is not considered an honorless loss. While the game's aim is to eliminate all the opposition's pieces, playing to that point is considered ill-mannered and even barbaric. Usually, one player finds themselves out-maneuvered and surrenders, though some rely on chance to turn their fortune around and achieve victory. Playing to a standstill, having both players' forces balanced, is considered the greatest victory of them all.\nLocations.\nJihui boards can be found in the following locations:"}

His &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; later returned, stole the powers of Hakkar and attempted to bring power back to the Gurubashi, enlisting the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt;.

It was in Zul'Gurub that Jin'do the Hexxer enslaved several high priests of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in summoning their dread god, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, into Azeroth. The presence of the Soulflayer presented a grave threat to the world, and, before Hakkar and his priests could dominate the continent, they were thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes mobilized from the four corners of Azeroth. Jin'do was slain in the conflict, but his restless spirit burned with shame at his failure, and it drifted in the spirit world, seeking a way to return.\nShade of the Hexxer.\nWhen Jin'do was defeated in Zul'Gurub, he survived as a weak and broken shade in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;. But Jin'do always had power over spirits. One by one he broke them to his will, and with each soul devoured he grew closer to ripping a hole through to the living world. Several years after the defeat of Hakkar in Zul'Gurub the Shade of the Hexxer attempted to revive the forces of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"Be%20Raptor\"&gt;Be Raptor&lt;/a&gt; the player controls and attempts to escape from Zul'Gurub, only to be confronted by Jin'do near the exit. After Jin'do explains his plans in great detail before allowing the hero to escape; it is revealed that he is trying to summon Hakkar and needs , who needs Ohgan'aka, for this task. He threatens to destroy you but instead evicts you from Ohgan'aka's body and challenges you to come back at a later time.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"Backdoor%20Dealings\"&gt;Backdoor Dealings&lt;/a&gt;, players observe a conversation between Jin'do and &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt;. Jin'do had recovered the bodies of &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Jeklik\"&gt;High Priestess Jeklik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt; and, knowing Zanzil's talent for raising the dead, came to him for help resurrecting them. Though agents of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Tribe\"&gt;Zandalar Tribe&lt;/a&gt; attempted to stop both rituals, they were only successful in destroying Jeklik's body and Venoxis was successfully restored to life.\nJin'do the Godbreaker.\nThe Zandalar tribe led by a mysterious prophet &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; called representatives from all tribes for a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. The prophet stated that troll civilization is nearing extinction and calls for war and unity of the troll race, with the intention of forging a new empire. Jin'do and his followers gladly accepted the offer.\nLater in Zul'Gurub Jin'do, now styled Godbreaker, is wrestling Hakkar into submission, holding him by spirit chains, stripping out his power into himself. The only way to stop the invincible Jin'do now is to release the captive upon the captor. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of \"Jin'do the Broken\". Hakkar then returns the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing."}

Jin'do recently found a way back into the world and enslaved the Soulflayer. Bristling with the dread god's terrible powers, Jin'do's plans to restore the Gurubashi empire to its former glory.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Welcome to the Great Show!\nJin'do fights players alone, dropping Deadzones on the ground to protect himself and calling upon the Spirit of Hakkar to empower his weapon with shadow lightning.\nStage Two: Spitting in the Face of a God.\nJin'do drags his enemies with him into the spirit world. He draws tremendous power from Hakkar's spirit, which is held captive by three large chains.\nStrategy.\nPre-encounter.\nBefore the fight begins, make sure to kill the two Gurubashi Spirit Warriors on either side of Jindo's stairs in order to release their spirits. It will be too late to kill them during the boss fight.\nPhase 1.\nThe first phase is relatively straightforward. Jin'do will create Deadzones that reduce both magic damage taken and casting speed by 90%; make sure to drag him out of these. However, when he casts Shadows of Hakkar, everyone will need to stand in the deadzone until the buff wears off in order to survive it. Phase 1 ends when Jin'do reaches 70% health.\nTips:\nPhase 2.\nAt 70%, Jin'do will pull the entire party into the spirit world, where he is draining the essence of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Jin'do cannot be attacked during this phase. Hakkar is attached to the ground by three chains. The end of each chain can be attacked and destroyed, but they are protected by Brittle Barriers. In order to destroy these barriers, you must pull one of the Gurubashi Spirits that you killed earlier up to the top of the temple. When they target someone with Body Slam, that person must stand on top of one of the barriers, as the Body Slam will shatter it. When the barrier is destroyed, kill the Berserker, destroy the chain, and then pull up another Berserker and repeat for the other two. The Berserkers will respawn in case they are killed before the barriers are broken. The fight ends once all three chains are destroyed.\nBesides the damage from the Berserker itself, there are other factors to watch out for in this phase. The first is that the Body Slam leaves a zone called a Sunder Rift that increases all damage taken by hostile units by 100%. This includes Berserkers, Twisted Spirits, and chains, but not players. The tank should, if possible, position the Berserker inside the zone. This will make killing both the Berserker and the chain significantly easier. Twisted Spirits can be kited into the debuff zone so they can also be killed quickly either with splash damage or single target damage.\nJin'do launches Shadow Spikes at random party members that do roughly 70k shadow damage. The impact point for these is clearly telegraphed, so move away from them. \nJin'do will also summon Twisted Spirits throughout this phase. Though they are relatively weak, having only 24K health each, they deal moderately high shadow damage. If they are not killed, they can easily overwhelm the group with sheer numbers. Twisted Spirits spawn at an ever-increasing rate, serving as the soft enrage mechanic for the encounter. As such, you should not get carried away killing spirits, but make bringing down a newly freed chain while it is still affected by the slam de-buff zone a priority for DPS. Ranged DPS should kill any spirits chasing the healer when no chains are available for attack. Spirits are susceptible to snares and roots, so Earthbind Totem, Frost Nova and similar effects are useful for giving the healer a breather while DPS are working on a chain.\nA simple procedure to follow is:\nThis strategy takes full advantage of the slam de-buff zones and minimizes danger to the tank from the Spirit Warriors' stacking frenzy buff.\nWait until the the current chain has been destroyed before pulling up the next warrior. The DPS have enough to worry about while attacking a chain, avoiding Shadow Spikes, and keeping Twisted Spirits off the healer.\nHealer protection.\nKeeping the healer alive is one of the challenges of this fight. The healer cannot survive long without assistance, so one or more other party members must neutralize the Twisted Spirits.\nTank healer protection\nThe tank may protect the healer by aggro'ing and tanking most or all of the spirits. In this strategy, the tank remains on the platform at all times and a DPS is assigned to pull up the Spirit Warriors. A hunter using misdirect is ideal for this task.\nThe tank moves about, performing AOE attacks such as Blood Boil or Thunder Clap. When not using these abilities, the tank attacks spirits individually to aggro them. DPS should take care when attacking the Spirit Warrior before the slam, as the tank may be generating less threat. The healer and tank stay near one another. The tank continues to pick up Twisted Spirits even while tanking the Spirit Warrior.\nThis strategy has the advantage that, with a sufficiently skilled tank, no DPS are needed to control the spirits. Thus, the chains will be destroyed quickly. However, it requires an experienced tank and greater coordination between the Spirit Warrior-puller and the tank. Also, the tank will be vulnerable if slammed, due to being inside the +100% damage zone while under attack by the Spirit Warrior and Twisted Spirits.\nDPS healer protection\nAt least two DPS may be required to sufficiently control the spirits. Ideally, one plate DPS or feral Druid will stay near the healer to attack Twisted Spirits at close range, while a ranged DPS will assist in killing and slowing/rooting them. These DPS must judge whether the healer is secure enough for them to spend time attacking the Spirit Warrior or a chain. Their goals will be firstly to keep the healer alive, and secondly to destroy the Spirit Warrior and the chain before the slam zone expires.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He is not considered a &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; and does not give &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; any specific abilities; however, many players consider him the hardest boss inside Zul'Gurub.\nStrategy.\nAssignments and preparation.\nAssign either one druid (in bear form) or three warriors to tank Jin'do. The bear will not get hexxed and will not lose aggro. If the main tank is a warrior, he will need two off-tanks, in case the main tank gets hexxed while an off-tank is brainwashed.\nAssign one healer to the main tank. All other healers spot-heal anyone in the raid as needed, as everyone in the raid can take damage from Delusions of Jin'do, the shades' Shadow Shock, and brainwashed characters. If you're using a warrior to tank, assign one priest or paladin to de-curse the hex on that tank.\nAssign one mage to kill the skeletons when Jin'do drops someone in the pit. Assign a backup mage, in case the primary one runs out of mana or gets cursed.\nApply a &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Prayer of Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; buff to everyone in the raid. Everyone except the main tank should wear whatever shadow resistance gear they have available. Healers may wish to use a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Shadow%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Shadow Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssign a hunter as the main assist to target totems as they pop up. Everyone else should assist him and help kill his targets. The macros below are a big help with this job.\nWarriors and priests, use up fear spells before the pull.\nDPS target priorities.\nWinning this fight is all about the DPS characters prioritizing targets. Jin'do summons shades and totems. They must be killed in the right order, or this fight is very difficult.\nJin'do's melee attack, while not insignificant against cloth wearers, is weak and not the main danger in the fight. The biggest dangers are Jin'do's shades. They must be killed as quickly as possible or they will multiply out of control and wipe the raid by interrupting heals and killing healers.\nThe healing totems are the next threat. They heal Jin'do much more quickly than it is possible to damage him. However, the totems themselves do not have a lot of hit points, and must be killed. Apply &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison%20IV\"&gt;Wound Poison IV&lt;/a&gt; to Jin'do to reduce the amount of healing he gets from this totem from 10,000 per tick to about 4,300 per tick.\nThe brainwashing totems are less dangerous than the healing totems and have more hit points, but are still a considerable threat and should be killed before dealing with Jin'do. In addition, warriors and priests should use up their fear spells so that they don't cast them on other characters when brainwashed. If Jin'do gets more than one of these up at a time, the brainwashed characters can cause a considerable amount of damage that should be going to Jin'do. \nWhen there are no totems up, DPS characters without Delusions of Jin'do can attack Jin'do.\nIn summary, the killing priority is:\nCombat.\nPull Jin'do once all the trash near him is cleared. There is no special technique needed for this. The tactics do not change throughout the duration of the fight.\nThe DPS characters must instantly and rigidly follow the priorities listed above. When a healing totem pops up, they must target and attack it as quickly as they can, without worrying about combo points, travel time, or the like.\nWhile priests and paladins remove the Hex spell from the main tank, mages and druids \"must not\" remove the Delusions of Jin'do curse.\nEvery character except the main tank that gets the Delusions of Jin'do curse must drop everything he is doing and attack shades. The pit mage must call for the backup mage and the primary healer must ask for a backup healer to take over on the tank.\nThe shades are invulnerable to all &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; and reflected damage effects. They must be killed with single-target damage. Because of this, the best way to do a lot of damage is by putting an instant-cast &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; on every shade. The shades do not follow the usual aggro rules, and will not leave their targets when attacked. Hunters and warlocks attack a shade with a pet; the pet will continue attacking the target until the shade dies, even after the pet's owner loses the curse. Hunters put &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Mark\"&gt;Hunter's Mark&lt;/a&gt; on one shade and leave it alone until later. The hunter can see the marked shade and kill it after the curse wears off.\nAgain, Damage Over Time (DoT) spells can be the key to winning this fight. Each shade has only around 2,000 hit points, so three DoT spells will kill one. Even priests must stop healing and switch to casting DoT spells for the duration of the curse.\nCharacters without DoT spells should try to kill two, three, or four shades every time they get cursed. Wipes on Jin'do are usually a result of the shades getting out of control and interrupting the healers' spellcasting, so attack the shades on the healers first. \nKeep Wound Poison and Mortal Strike on Jin'do over the duration of the fight. This will result in the totems healing about 4,300 points per tick instead of 10,000. This helps a lot.\nWhen Jin'do teleports someone into the skeleton pit, his screen will freeze for a second. He must run out of the pit and back into action while the assigned mage blasts the skeletons and gets out of the pit. Note that the main tank will not lose aggro when this happens. Jin'do will chase him down.\nThere are no phases. This strategy must be maintained for the whole fight.\nTake care of all the problems Jin'do causes, and hit him when you have a chance. Eventually, he somehow just ends up dead.\nTips.\nSome groups find it helpful to drain Jin'do's mana pool at the beginning of the fight and maintain a &lt;a href=\"Viper%20Sting%20%28hunter%20ability%29\"&gt;Viper Sting (hunter ability)&lt;/a&gt; on him, as he will not drop Powerful Healing Totems when completely out of mana.\nWarriors can cause a wipe by getting Brainwashed then casting &lt;a href=\"Intimidating%20Shout\"&gt;Intimidating Shout&lt;/a&gt; on the healers. Warriors and priests should use their fear abilities before the fight and whenever possible to keep them on cooldown.\nHunters are very useful in this fight. With their pet and Hunter's Mark, they can kill two shades after the curse wears off. Also, with their long range, they can stay away from Brainwashing Totems and easily switch between targets. Finally, they have an instant-cast DoT which allows them to cause a lot a damage when many shades are up.\nAs tempting as it might be, hunters should not use &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; on Brainwashing Totems. It will hit the brainwashed character.\nThis fight is a great chance for Arms-specced warriors and Feral-specced druids to shine. This is nice, as these specs are generally not desired for raids.\nDue to the constant switches to secondary targets, DPS characters do not need to worry about pulling aggro off of the main tank. Also, as healing aggro is split amongst the many shades, healers don't need to worry about pulling aggro, either. All-out DPS and healing is acceptable in this fight.\nIf your guild is having difficulty with the complexities of this fight, this boss is killable using \"Brute Force\". Apply Wound Poisons and Mortal Strikes, then have the melee combatants focus on the totems. Everyone else should ignore the spirits and attack Jin'do. The \"Skeletal Moshpit\" still applies, however. (Tested Sept 9th, 2006)\nIf your Guild is on the Alliance side, the strategy above is even more potent. Have all your healers and Casters grouped up in two Paladin groups with Concentration aura on. Have your DPS focus on the healing and brainwash totems and ignore the shades. \nIt is possible for a mounted rogue to kite three of the &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Servant\"&gt;Mad Servant&lt;/a&gt;s (imps) from the &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Edge of Madness&lt;/a&gt; area to Jin'do's area, where warlocks can enslave them and use their high-damage fireball attack on Jin'do for this fight. The catch is that with diminishing returns, these demons are likely to break free in the middle of the fight. Also, if they die, they summon non-banishable, non-enslavable voidwalkers that cause trouble. The imps' high DPS tends to pull aggro, so be ready to heal them if you try this.\nThis fight is not only very technical, it's also a DPS &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;. Your raid must be able to output enough damage per second to kill the shades and totems as fast as Jin'do can spawn them, and then have a little DPS left over to actually hurt Jin'do. If your raid can't keep up, you can come back with more DPS characters, try draining his mana, try enslaving the imps, or simply come back when your DPS gear is better.\nTargeting macros.\nThese macros will no longer work due to changes in WoW 2.0.1. Macros/AddOns cannot change your target.\nThis will make sure the most important target is always selected.\n /tar Jin\n /tar Brain\n /tar Powerful\n /tar Shade\n /script TargetLastEnemy();\nThe above macro sometimes has trouble with similar names being mind controlled. When mind controlled, they are considered enemies and the 'TargetLastEnemy()' does not function as one would like. The following macro (tested 7/19/06, works perfectly) works better, and has a check for the 'dead' healing totem (which is targetable with 0 health):\n /script t={\"Jin'do the Hexxer\",\"Brain Wash Totem\",\"Powerful Healing Ward\",\"Shade of Jin'do\"};for i=1,4 do\n TargetByName(t[i] ,true) end;if (UnitHealth(\"TARGET\")==0) then for j=1,2 do TargetByName(t[j] ,true) end \n end; \nThe above macro needs some minor adjustments to make it work such as backspaces before the first TargetByName and before the second end;. This makes it so that the entire script is one line and there are no errors when you execute it. Try the one below and it should work with no problem. Worked as of 11/28/06\n /script t={\"Jin'do the Hexxer\",\"Brain Wash Totem\",\"Powerful Healing Ward\",\"Shade of Jin'do\"};for i=1,4 do TargetByName(t[i] ,true) end;if (UnitHealth(\"TARGET\")==0) then for j=1,2 do TargetByName(t[j] ,true) end end;\n /target\nAdd in a cast function, for hunters (the 'PetAttack()' goes on the same line as the rest of the function):\n PetAttack();\n /cast Auto Shot\nThus, the hunter macro looks like:\n /script t={\"Jin'do the Hexxer\",\"Brain Wash Totem\",\"Powerful Healing Ward\",\"Shade of Jin'do\"};for i=1,4 do\n TargetByName(t[i] ,true) end;if (UnitHealth(\"TARGET\")==0) then for j=1,2 do TargetByName(t[j] ,true) end \n end; PetAttack();\n /cast Auto Shot\nThe above script (remove carriage returns as needed) takes into account the priority of targets and includes shades. It utilizes the {exactMatch} of TargetByName() to avoid targeting mind controlled group members.\nTrash mobs.\nThe mobs surrounding Jin'Do are some of the most challenging trash groups in the instance and are very easy to wipe on or take heavy losses. \nThe groups consist of two types of mobs:\nThere are the following groups in the area\nTo fight the groups, have hunters set a frost trap and freezing traps. Have the priests simultaneously mind control the voodoo slaves and use their rain of fire on the mistresses. When the slaves die, the mistresses will run for the priests, so the traps and timely taunts and frost novas will give the priests enough time to target a mistress and shackle it. Mage/warlock AoE is very dangerous to use due to the curse of blood and the not-insignificant hp of the mistresses.\nFor the pull by Jin'Do, directly mind controlling the slaves will aggro the boss. Do a simultaneous counterspell pull to force the slaves to run to melee while the priests cast mind control. Use a challenging shout and frost novas to group the mistresses up for the rain of fire treatment.\nLoot.\nJin'do drops several important items. High-end guilds will kill him for his &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Idol\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Idol&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to the best enchant in the game. In fact, they make trips to Zul'Gurub and kill only Jin'do and &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt; for this item.\nIn addition to several nice epic items, he also drops some of the best non-epic items in the game. These include the best non-epic hunter and rogue leg pieces, and the best non-epic hunter head piece.\nJin'do, along with &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt;, has a high drop rate on the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Kossack\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Kossack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Aegis\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Aegis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Tabard\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Tabard&lt;/a&gt;, which are otherwise rare.\nOther.\nWhen Bloodlord Mandokir yells his: \"Ding!\" when he levels up by killing 3 players, Jin'do the Hexxer replies with a \"Grats!\", which is commonly said in guilds when a guildmember levels up."}

{"id": "361508", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=361508", "title": "Jin'rokh the Breaker (tactics)", "text": "Jin'rokh the Breaker is the first boss encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he rewarded the most loyal and ambitious &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; trolls with power beyond their wildest dreams. The berserker Jin'rokh was one of the first to receive the King's blessing, and even though Lei Shen's gifts nearly tore his body apart, the troll is now capable of calling the fury of the storm in battle.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Long-time players may remember this guy as one of the Zandalari berserkers living on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale, back when the Zandalari were our friends. He was a quest giver in the assault on the original 20-player Zul'Gurub. He was a huge brute to begin with, but he\u2019s been imbued with even greater power by the Thunder King. He crackles with electricity, using both his raw strength and channeled lightning to destroy his enemies.\"\nStrategy.\nPlayers targeted by Focused Lightning must kite the lightning orb away from the group and let it hit them while \"not\" standing in any water or near any other lightning pools. Preferably they should probably kite it across the grates into the nooks on the sides of the room, as these are the most remote locations. When the ball of lightning hits the player it's chasing, it will leave a fissure on the ground. If another ball of lightning passes over an existing fissure, the raid will wipe. If the ball of lightning hits a player who is standing in a pool of water, the raid will probably wipe.\n30 seconds into the fight, and every 90 seconds after that, Jin'rokh uses Thundering Throw to spawn a pool of Conductive Water in one corner of the room. The pool of water starts small and grows over time to eventually encompass a full quarter of the room. The ranged DPS and healers should typically move into the pool when attacking, as it increases healing and damage dealt. However, it also increases damage taken, so if keeping up with healing is a problem, move back to dry land.\nTanks should taunt back and forth each time Static Wound is applied. The tanks should not stand in the pool under any circumstance. Many of Jin'Rokh's attacks, if they hit someone in a pool of water, will carry across the water and hit everyone else in the pool as well.\nIf a pool of water expands to cover a lightning fissure made by the balls of lightning, everyone standing in the water takes damage once. It's impossible to keep this from happening, as the water keeps growing to eventually cover the entire room, but it's possible to get out of the water to avoid the damage. However, the damage is relatively minor and can be healed through. One strategy is to place the fissures in the alcoves behind the grates, as those are some of the last places where the water reaches, and neither players nor lightning orbs are in danger of accidentally passing over them. Players can then stay in the water for most of the fight but get out before it reaches the fissures.\nWhen Jin'rokh winds up a Lightning Storm, get out of the water. All water that's appeared so far will become permanently electrified for the rest of the fight, but a new puddle will appear in about 30 seconds when the boss uses Thundering Throw again. The entire raid should gather together to make AoE healing easier, since Lightning Storm causes massive raid damage. This happens three times during the battle. Healers should use the best AoE heals they've got.\nIf the boss isn't killed by the fourth lightning storm, the entire room will be filled with electrified water and the raid will wipe. This occurs after six minutes.\nHeroic mode.\nOnce during each normal phase, Jin'rokh will target all the players but the tanks with Ionization, which leaves a magic debuff that deals high damage to the player and those nearby when the debuff wears off or is dispelled. Players can prevent the debuff from being applied if they use an immunity-to-magic ability at the moment the boss casts Ionization (e.g. rogue's Cloak of Shadows, death knight's Anti-Magic Shell, paladin's Divine Shield).\nPlayers should never be dispelled or let the debuff drop off in the water, as doing so will deal lethal damage to all players in the conductive water (450k, doubled by the water to 900k) and cause a wipe. They must always be dispelled (or let the debuff expire) out of the waters.\nOn the Lightning Storm phase the sparks and pillars formed by Lightning Strikes mean the raid can no longer stack on the boss for heals. Instead, they will have to dodge the incoming sparks and use personal &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s or healthstones. An alternative strategy is to go to one of the nooks of the room to allow healers to top players off while also dodging the incoming sparks.\nThe fight rinses and repeats with Ionization being cast once per normal phase. The boss will go berserk 6 minutes in, just as the 4th Lightning Storm has finished and the whole room is filled with electrified water. Your raid must kill the boss before this happens.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}
