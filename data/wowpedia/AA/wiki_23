The pandaren of the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; believe the cranes of Krasrang to be gifts from Chi-Ji, and their feathers are used to adorn garments and to fletch arrows.\nIt is said that each crane flock appoints a sentry who stands guard with a stone in its beak, so that, should it fall asleep, the stone drops and it awakens.\nThe Windfeather species of crane, found only on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, are capable of producing brilliant plumage, and are highly protective of their nests. The birds seem to have an affinity with the winds, and can smooth down their feathers, allowing them to strike rapidly at predators. The matriarchs of the species sing a soothing melody, calming the chicks when they are agitated. The males seem particularly fierce, and will ruffle their feathers to sweep a powerful gust of wind at attackers. The meat of the Windfeathers makes for a savory, if lean, meal. Their feathers seem to have the ability to lighten spirits, and may have magical properties. Crane chicks of the Timeless Isle sometimes sing a curious song that calms the nerves and soothes the soul. The feathers of the Windfeather crane are surprisingly light to the touch and will fly away with the slightest breeze.\nAs a mount.\nCrane mounts can be bought from , provided that you are &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are currently three crane mounts available : &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Azure%20Riding%20Crane\"&gt;Reins of the Azure Riding Crane&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Regal%20Riding%20Crane\"&gt;Reins of the Regal Riding Crane&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Golden%20Riding%20Crane\"&gt;Reins of the Golden Riding Crane&lt;/a&gt; (), but there are skins in the game files for additional crane mounts.\nAs a hunter pet.\nCranes are a family of waterfowl &lt;a href=\"Pet_abilities%23Cunning_abilities\"&gt;cunning pet&lt;/a&gt;s and are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starting at level 5.

He regales you with his inventiveness, describing his latest invention, the \"buzzbox\". He doesn't tell you what it does, or what it is for, but he does say that it needs constant maintenance. How are they maintained? They need parts from nearby creatures. A bit creepy, maybe, but he offers to pay you to fix them, and that's good enough for you. So off you go.\n&lt;a href=\"Buzzbox%20827\"&gt;Buzzbox 827&lt;/a&gt;, near the flight platform, happens to need 6 &lt;a href=\"Crawler%20Leg\"&gt;Crawler Leg&lt;/a&gt;s from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20Tide%20Crawler\"&gt;Pygmy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Young%20Reef%20Crawler\"&gt;Young crawlers&lt;/a&gt; along the coast. Easy enough to find. You insert them, and the buzzbox makes some grinding and banging noises.\nThe Buzzbox makes a humming noise and spits out the money Wizbang promised you. Wizbang's voice can be heard coming from the buzzbox, thanking you for the repair. If you're up for it, there's another buzzbox to be fixed. This one needs three &lt;a href=\"Thresher%20Eye\"&gt;Thresher Eye&lt;/a&gt;s to repair it. Wizzbang has a case of the hiccups, but is able to direct you to &lt;a href=\"Buzzbox%20411\"&gt;Buzzbox 411&lt;/a&gt;, along the coast considerably north of Auberdine. \nMuch like last time, you put the parts in the slot, it hums to life, spits out your reward and Wizbang thanks you. It seems, though, that he's drinking something he calls \"crawler wine\". Hmm...\n&lt;a href=\"Buzzbox%20323\"&gt;Buzzbox 323&lt;/a&gt;, the next one on Wizbang's list, is yet further north, along the road near the &lt;a href=\"Cliffspring%20River\"&gt;Cliffspring River&lt;/a&gt;. This one turns out to need half a dozen &lt;a href=\"Moonstalker%20Fang\"&gt;Moonstalker Fang&lt;/a&gt;s. You have a little trouble understanding the gnome, as he appears to be drunk enough to be slurring his words.\nStill, you find the fangs and bring them to the machine. This time, you can hear the sounds of static and the ramblings of Wizbang before you even put the fangs in the machine. Again, the machine grinds the teeth up as soon as you put them in, chucking out your reward in coins.\n... and there's &lt;a href=\"buzzbox%20525\"&gt;yet another buzzbox&lt;/a&gt; needing what you are coming to believe are less repairs than 'ingredients'. Over the boiling and dripping sounds coming from the machine, Wizzbang is just barely sober enough to tell you what is needed and where to find the last buzzbox.\nYou have no idea how or why, but apparently several &lt;a href=\"Grizzled%20Scalp\"&gt;scalps&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Grizzled%20Thistle%20Bear\"&gt;Grizzled Thistle Bear&lt;/a&gt;s are needed for this last one. So, bear hunting it is.\nAs you approach Buzzbox 525, you can hear Wizbang singing...\nover, and over again.\nIt's contributing to the delinquency of an inventor, but you've already got the scalps, and he's drunk of his own accord. Into the slot they go.\nWizbang, audibly &lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt;, confesses what you've pretty much guessed: that the buzzboxes are a combination of communication device and specialized still, making fine liquor. It seems the night elves of Auberdine don't much care for his trade in liquor, so he has resorted to subterfuge.\nRewards.\nAt least he's a friendly drunk. He set Buzzbox 525 up with a bottle of to share with you.\nAnd no, you can't really tell if it's thistle bear bear, just that it's alcoholic. And after all that running around gathering ingredients for that lush, yeah you do need a drink."}

This is intended as a starting point from which players can then learn the more complex details of the class.\nNotes.\nThe developers plan to release updated versions of the videos for \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", and will likely release guides to the other specs at some point.

{"id": "20648", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20648", "title": "Beta", "text": "In order to get useful and realistic feedback from real users, some software companies deliver pre-release software (a beta or beta trial) to a select number of users to try it out and report &lt;a href=\"bug\"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt;s, make suggestions, or just give significant customers clear evidence of the state of the product and dispel rumors of .\nWhat is a beta?\nIn terms of the software development, beta is usually the stage where all major feature implementation should be finished and the software is in the phase of bug fixing, refinement and stabilization before declaring a Final or candidate (sometimes called \"Gold\" as well). Sometimes major changes occur in this stage, but usually only in response to feedback during a beta trial.\nBeta, of course, comes after the alpha stage where major feature implementation usually occurs, is known to be unstable, and not generally fit for anything more than internal trial of carefully selected users. The stage before alpha some call \"Pre-Alpha\", \"Proof of Concept\", or \"Prototype\".\nThese stages are semi-formal within the software industry, so \"your results may vary\".\nClosed beta.\nA close beta version is one released to a select group for the same purpose, and is often preferred for commercial packages, so that a free beta does not become publicly available, allowing customers to evade the purchase of the product.\nOpen beta.\nOpen betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to potential consumers, and testing among an extremely wide user base likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find.\nThe beta experience.\nBetas (and in a few cases alphas) represent the earliest opportunity for players outside the development team and a handful of selected \"friends and family\" to experience a game or expansion. This often makes betas a very exciting time to be playing a game, with testers able to experience new features and explore new content months ahead of other players. \nAs well as providing an advanced preview of the game as it will be released, betas typically see extensive changes and developments, often including repeated iterations of major features, reworking and remodeling of zones and instances, and myriad tweaks and adjustments to player abilities. New abilities may be introduced, found wanting, and removed, without ever seeing release; while others may see a striking range of possible implementations before a final model is settled upon. The developers often use betas to try out outlandish new ideas, often expressly warning testers that the changes may well be bad ones. \nThis process lies at the heart of what a beta is: an opportunity to test ideas not merely in the small, internal laboratory of the developers' own experience, but in the wider world of a diverse population of players, with dozens of different approaches to playing the game, and thousands of different opinions as to the merit of the latest changes. Betas offer not only the chance to experience content and systems as they will never again exist, but the opportunity to gain a glimpse into the minds of the developers, as they iterate through possible models for the coming release. \nAccess to features and content within a beta typically expands from a very limited starting point, until full (or nearly full) access to all planned features is available. For example, expansion betas usually start with players only able to access the starting zone/s for the new expansion, with further zones slowly added over weeks or months. Major features and systems are sometimes only added late in the beta, and more trivial aspects such as terrain detailing and critter spawning often come only near the end of the beta. For these reasons, testers are often reminded for much of the beta that the full picture has not yet been revealed, both in terms of tweaks to existing features and the addition of entirely new ones, with testers and indeed players without access to the beta, reading reports on its development, otherwise wont to get an inaccurate picture of the state of the expansion. Nonetheless, feedback is often essential from testers long before balancing and adjustments have concluded.\nBeta testers also get the opportunity to witness some interesting and unintended bugs, including minor graphical glitches, broken events, quest lines and instances, and more extensive problems such as broken systems and server crashes. Some, such as terrain glitches causing player ghosts to spawn underneath graveyards (thereby trapping characters without hope of escape) may cause annoyance to all, while others, such as a broken ability allowing hunters to summon dozens of pets at once, may be gleefully exploited by many testers. Bugs may be frustrating, entertaining, or both, and often provide some of the most memorable moments of any beta test.\n\"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos\".\nThe \"\" beta started on 7 February 2002 with an initial wave of approximately 5,000 players.\n\"World of Warcraft\".\nStarting before March 2004, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; started signing up Closed Beta Test testers from an unknown pool of people using an undisclosed method of selection. The \"Closed Beta Trial\" ran for about 7 months ending in more widely available &lt;a href=\"stress%20test\"&gt;stress test&lt;/a&gt; and then an open beta before final release around the end of November 2004.\nThe \"Closed Beta\" was the first phase of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"stress%20test\"&gt;stress test&lt;/a&gt;. There were three servers and virtually no lag existed. This closed beta was also known as the \"First Stress Test\". The servers were split up into the following:\nDuring the closed beta, content was delivered in various \"pushes,\" beginning with the Human push. This was followed by Dwarf, Undead, Night Elf, Horde (orcs, trolls and tauren) and then the open beta. During most pushes, only the newest push's content was available -- human characters were unavailable, for instance, while players were testing the undead character experience.\nClassic Era.\nThe \"\" beta and &lt;a href=\"stress%20test\"&gt;stress test&lt;/a&gt;s were announced on 14 May 2019. The closed beta started on 15 May 2019 and ended on 12 July 2019. The Classic's &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Mastery\"&gt;Season of Mastery&lt;/a&gt; open beta started on 5 October 2021.\n\"The Burning Crusade\".\nStarting late September 2006, &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard started signing up Closed Beta Test testers for the first expansion, \"\", from different playing areas. The plan was to introduce additional players to the beta test in subsequent waves, thus people that didn't make it in the starting lineup still had a chance at a Burning Crusade beta spot prior to launch.\nThe Closed Beta started on 12 October 2006. They were split into two servers: Hellfire (PvE) and Blade's Edge (PvP)\n beta was announced and started the same day on 23 March 2021.\n\"Wrath of the Lich King\".\nOpt-ins for the public beta began on 3 July 2008; the beta began 17 July 2008.\nBeta keys were given out to &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt; and Blizzard &lt;a href=\"Worldwide%20Invitational\"&gt;Worldwide Invitational&lt;/a&gt; 2008 attendees and Blizzard also gave out Beta keys to various organizations (&lt;a href=\"fansites\"&gt;fansites&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) for promotional reasons.\n closed beta was announced and started the same day on 22 June 2022.\n\"Cataclysm\".\nThe Closed Beta started 30 June 2010 and then ended 22 November 2010.\n\"Mists of Pandaria\".\nPlayers who bought the &lt;a href=\"Annual%20Pass\"&gt;Annual Pass&lt;/a&gt; were guaranteed access to the beta test.\nOpt-ins for the public beta began on 20 March 2012; the beta began 21 March 2012.\n\"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft\".\nThe closed beta for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" started on 16 August 2013 and the open beta started on 21 January 2014.\n\"Warlords of Draenor\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"alpha\"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; test was officially announced to start on 3 April 2014 which presages the beta test, but with no time frame given.\nCards for closed Beta invites were given out at the &lt;a href=\"PAX%20East\"&gt;PAX East&lt;/a&gt; conference in April 2014.\nThe first beta testing began 27 June 2014.\n\"Legion\".\nLegion &lt;a href=\"alpha\"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; testing officially started on 23 November 2015. The beta testing began 9 May 2016.\n\"Battle for Azeroth\".\nBattle for Azeroth &lt;a href=\"alpha\"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; testing officially started on 7 February 2018. The beta started on 24 April 2018.\n\"Warcraft III: Reforged\".\nThe \"\" beta was announced on 29 October 2019 and started that same week. &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt; attendees and &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Ticket\"&gt;Virtual Ticket&lt;/a&gt; holders got instant beta access.\n\"Shadowlands\".\n\"Shadowlands\" &lt;a href=\"alpha\"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; testing invites started going out a couple days after 6 April 2020. The beta for \"Shadowlands\" began on 15 July 2020 and more invites went out to a bigger variety of players. Many content creators received \"access keys\" where winners would get their account flagged by Blizzard Entertainment on 2 September 2020 if they won a certain giveaway/event that was setup by the creator.\n\"Dragonflight\".\n\"Dragonflight\" alpha testing invites started going out on 14 July 2022. The beta started on 1 September 2022.\n\"Warcraft Arclight Rumble\".\nThe beta for \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Arclight%20Rumble\"&gt;Warcraft Arclight Rumble&lt;/a&gt;\" started on 17 October 2022."}

{"id": "319096", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=319096", "title": "Beth'tilac", "text": "Beth'tilac is a fire spider boss of the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; raid instance.\nWorld first \"heroic\" kill on 25-man achieved 5.7.2011 by Blood Legion - US-Illidan.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Cinderweb%20brood\"&gt;Cinderweb brood&lt;/a&gt;, Beth'tilac and her merciless offspring sate their appetites by sucking the magma and fire from the corpses of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. To provide her broodlings with added sustenance, Beth'tilac has woven a network of incendiary webs throughout her web to trap unsuspecting prey.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: The Cinderweb.\nBeth'tilac retreats to the top of her web at the beginning of the encounter.\nStage Two: The Frenzy!\nAfter she has performed Smoldering Devastation three times, Beth'tilac enters a frenzy. She lowers herself from the safety of the top of her Cinderweb and no longer calls for aid from her brood.\nTrash.\nThe trash leading up to Beth'tilac often has the theme of \"spiders attacking other trash\". Of these trash packs the final pack is the most challenging for inexperienced teams.\nIt consists of small, medium, and large spiders attacking a Flamewalker Cauterizer and a pair of Pathfinders. Start the fight by charging the Cauterizer. A second tank should pick up the spiders. Classes with AoE can destroy the smallest spiders but the Cauterizer should be killed as quickly as possible. Interrupt the Cauterizer's signature healing move (Cauterize). The Pathfinders can not be tanked and will be attacking healers and DPS indiscriminately. The pathfinders should be killed second. After all the flamewalkers are dead, polish off the spiders.\nIf you wipe, the entire trash pack will respawn and you have to start over.\nStrategy.\nDuring phase 1 Beth'tilac will hang out on the upper web and\nperiodically cast Smoldering Devastation. After the third Smoldering\nDevastation, she will descend to the floor. Phase 2 has a soft enrage\nwhere her Frenzy will stack to the point that healers can no longer\nkeep the tanks alive. The more damage you inflict on her during phase\n1 and the less healing she gets from Consume, the shorter phase 2 will\nlast and the better your chances of victory are.\nIf you don't leave enough DPS on the ground for phase 1, the adds will\noverwhelm the ground team or Beth'tilac will eat some ground adds and\nheal at the beginning of phase 2.\nAssign a tank, a healer, and some DPS (melee preferred) for the upper web.\nIn 25m raids, it is possible to send 2 healers up.\nThe rest (a tank, remaining healers, and remaining DPS) will stay on the ground.\nIf spinners are hard to control, it may be helpful leaving players with taunts\n(paladins, death knights) on the ground as well.\nPhase 1.\nAt the beginning of the fight she ascends the web and starts splashing the party with Venom Rain. As soon as possible pull down the Cinderweb Spinners to create climbable threads, one for each player who wishes to reach the top of the web.\nThe quickest way to gain access to a Cinderweb Spinner's thread is for a player to taunt the spider. Tank taunts are usually used, but &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Earth\"&gt;Unleash Earth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Distracting%20Shot\"&gt;Distracting Shot&lt;/a&gt; also work. Killing a spinner also grants access to the thread. Cinderweb Spinners do more damage while hanging from their thread than they do on the ground, so the ground team should continue taunting spinners as fast as cooldowns and the situation permit.\nTop.\nThe assigned tank, healer, and DPS should use the spinners web to climp to the top and attack the boss. The tank should go first and be quickly followed by the healer. DPS can wait for more threads to be activated.\nAvoid the meteors and the holes they make in the web. When Beth'tilac runs low on energy (which indicates an impending Smoldering Devastation) use the center hole directly under her to be safely lowered to the ground. Being struck by a meteor or walking into a meteor hole causes you to fall through the web and take falling damage. If this happens to the tank or healer, it can often result in a wipe.\nAfter she casts Smoldering Devastation you will get a new wave of spinners, taunt them down and go back up ASAP to end the Venom Rain.\nGround.\nThe team on the ground will have a kill order of spiderlings, then spinners, then drones. Alternatively, DPS assigned to ground duty may be divided into teams, with an AoE group handling Spiderlings, and the other group handling spinners and drones.\nSpiderlings will emerge randomly around the room in a group from one location at a time. They need to be slowed, knocked back, and AoE'd down before they can reach the drone.\nThe ground tank will mostly be managing the Drone. The drone should be pointed away from the raid so Boiling Splatter does not affect healers and DPS. The tank should also keep an eye out for spiderlings. If the drone gets close enough to spiderlings it will consume one, heal, and gain a damage/speed bonus. If the DPS is not able to kill spiderlings quickly enough, the tank must kite the drone away.\nIf the drone's energy bar reaches zero, it will climb to the top of the web and drain energy from Beth'tilac. This is undesirable as it shortens the time before the next Smoldering Devastation. It is possible for a second drone to spawn before the first drone runs out of energy. If this happens, it implies that you don't have enough DPS on the ground team.\nDuring this phase, the ground team should continue taunting spinners off their threads as quickly as possible. Paladins (with &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;) and Death Knights (with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Command\"&gt;Dark Command&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt;) are especially helpful here.\nAfter Beth'tilac casts her third Smoldering Devastation the fight transitions to phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nBeth'tilac joins you on the ground. Immediately make sure all adds are killed before she's lands, because if any Spiderlings reach her, she will Consume them and heal.\nPosition the raid in a triangle, with all of the healers and dps on one point, a tank on each of the other points, and Beth'tilac in the center. Periodically Beth'tilac will cast The Widow's Kiss on the current tank. The other tank should taunt as quickly as possible. The kissed tank will just have to stand clear of other players and wait for the stacks to count up to 10 at which point the debuff will disappear.\nThe stacking Frenzy is a soft enrage. The raid must burn through the boss's remaining health before Frenzy outstrips the healer's ability to keep the tanks and raid alive.\nHeroic Mode.\nA new type of add (Engorged Broodling) will spawn on the ground. This is a \"kamikaze\" spider that will cast Volatile Burst upon colliding with a target, killing itself and dealing a large amount of damage to nearby targets, and leaving a patch of Volatile Poison on the ground, which will damage and slow players standing in it. Assign 1-2 DPS (3-6 on 25m) to \"soak\" the explosions from the broodlings far away from the main raid, to avoid dropping patches of Volatile Poison in the raid.\nCinderweb Drones will periodically fixate on a random raid member for 10 seconds. The player must make sure not to kite the drone into any spiderlings, and should move closer to the tank to allow him to pick the drone up after its fixate ends.\nCinderweb Spinners that are left hanging will periodically channel Fiery Web Spin on raid members left on the ground, stunning them for the duration of the channel. This can be devastating if cast on healers given the high tank and raid damage on the ground. This makes quickly taunting down and killing spinners even more important on heroic mode.\nPhase 2 is unchanged, however, Beth'tilac's higher base health and damage leads to a greater DPS/healing check in the final phase.\nSolo strategy.\nStart the encounter by winding up a big attack on Beth'tilac, but don't pop cooldowns just yet. After she goes up top, kill a handful of hanging Cinderweb Spinners before going up, not just the one required. On top, pop CDs and blow her up, in an attempt to kill her before she casts Smoldering Devastation three times. Don't stand in fires. The damage she puts out is trivial, but she will leave the web after the third cast.\nShould she get off the third Smoldering Devastation cast and head back down, follow her down and quickly kill as many spinners as possible before they cast Fiery Web Spin (in Heroic mode only). If the channel goes off, the player will be stunned for 25 seconds, likely resulting in death. Pet classes as always can direct their pets to attack the spinners to kill them, stopping the channel. Also, kill any Cinderweb Spiderlings that get near her, as she will still heal for 10% of max health for each one she consumes.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When the time is right, you will be able to use it on Drakuru's &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood&lt;/a&gt;s and turn them against him. It's your only hope of defeating him.\nFight well. \nRewards.\nYou will also receive: \nProgress.\nHave you faced Drakuru in battle, &lt;name&gt;?\nCompletion.\nSo, it's done.\nWe still have much to do, but our work here will be much more manageable thanks to your efforts.\nPlease accept this as a token of our gratitude.\nNotes.\nTo get to the fighting stage, players need to talk to Drakuru. He takes you to the top of the necropolis, where he will stand in the middle of the large circular platform. There are four smaller platforms surrounding the large platform. Drakuru, now in &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Drakuru\"&gt;fighting form&lt;/a&gt;, will show off his might by summoning four &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood Troll&lt;/a&gt;s on the smaller platforms. Your disguise then fails and Drakuru realises your treachery. The fight begins. \nYou use the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Scepter of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to control a Troll and use it to fight Drakuru. After defeating him, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; arrives through a portal, finishes off Drakaru, and spares the player's life once again.\nYou can pick up &lt;a href=\"Drakuru%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Drakuru's Skull&lt;/a&gt;. Next to it is Drakuru's Last Wish. Use it to be returned to the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Reliquary of Pain&lt;/a&gt;. There you can summon &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Vadu\"&gt;Stefan Vadu&lt;/a&gt; for the last time and hand in the quest.\nThe scripted parts of the quest run as follows:\nDrakuru yells any of the following as you fight him:\nVictory:\nCompleting this quest is part of .\nNote that you don't actually have to \"do\" this quest to complete it. You can just watch someone do it (even someone who's not from your faction) and loot the head after the fight.\nStrategy.\nTo defeat him you must take control one of the &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood Troll&lt;/a&gt;s by using the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Scepter of Domination&lt;/a&gt; on it. The troll will work like a Hunter or Warlock combat pet, with a small action bar above your regular action bar. See the &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood Troll&lt;/a&gt; page for a description of his abilities. Spam Powerful Strike (pet action #4) to do a large amount of damage, Concussive Blow (pet action #5) to buy your troll some more time, and Blightblood Infusion (pet action #6) to heal yourself.\nMore than likely, players will lose their first troll. As soon as that happens, run over to another troll, take control of it and get it in the fight. After a Troll dies and while you are busy taking control of a new one, Drakuru will hit you with his Shadow Bolts. Try to get a Blightblood Infusion heal from a Troll just before he dies, and get a heal right away from the new Troll.\n&lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt; will stay in the center of the platform, but while he is not engaged by a troll he will fire his Shadow Bolt at you for about 1250 DPS. He will occasionally throw a crystal at the player (announced by an emote) which does AoE damage. You will need to get away and stay out of the affected area. \nClasses with ranged damage should stay on the edge of the platform, moving around the circumference as needed. When Drakuru starts throwing crystals, step aside just far enough to avoid the AoE damage. In time, this will move you all the way around the platform, but by the time you have come full circle, the older AoE patches will have gone.\nThis is probably also a good strategy for melee classes. The troll will do most of the damage anyway (about 3600 DPS), and this will keep you out of the way of the crystals. If you want to stay close in, then run away when the emote comes. If you stay, the AoE spot will be close to Drakuru, making it hard to stay in melee range.\nEither way it is probably the easiest to focus on the fighting abilities of the troll rather than putting in damage yourself.\nDo not step on a small platform with an untamed Troll on it. It will attack you and probably quickly kill you. To gain control of one, use your &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Scepter of Domination&lt;/a&gt; while standing on the big platform.\nDo not try to take control of a new Troll while your old Troll is still alive. You will lose control of the old one and it will attack you."}

It was Perenolde who provided the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s with the routes of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; strikeforce passing through &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. The rebellion at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; was also started by Alterac &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of concealing the Orcish &lt;a href=\"Gold%20mine\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; facility located there. The &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;High Command&lt;/a&gt; has decreed that the nation of Alterac has committed treason against the Alliance and their union with the Orcish Hordes must be broken. You must free those unjustly held by Perenolde and enlist their aid in launching an attack against &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac's capital&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nHaving interrogated the treacherous warriors of Alterac, and discovering that the Alliance had been betrayed, Lothar sent &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;'s force and others to Alterac. Rescuing the captive mages and peasants was of paramount importance, for Milan's force had no workers and no gold to train them. They formed a standard land attack group of knights and ballistae, then set out on the north road leading to the compound. Getting in was troublesome, but not difficult, since their ballistae had a slightly greater range than the enemy towers. After breaking in and freeing the captives, they sent most of the force back to town, but not before destroying all they could.\nWith workers plundering the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;, they then began fortifying the town with towers and &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, closing off all the paths but one for their troops to use. Next came the construction of &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt; for their knights, and soon after, the fortification of their &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;. Since their attack plan required only paladins and ballistae, their final construction was a &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;, and from then on, they concentrated on producing the necessary military units. Time and gold were also spent on the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; to provide the best possible weapons and armor. When they had gathered nine paladins and four ballistae in the courtyard, their force was deemed ready to make the assault.\nMoving out to the northeast, their paladins led the way for the slower ballistae, occasionally stopping to wait impatiently for them. At first they met with only a few enemies, but as they drew near the walls of the capital, greater numbers of Horde and traitorous human forces slowed their progress considerably. After they had leveled several towers and secured an open area within the walls, reinforcements were called for and sent out while the paladins practiced their healing arts on the wounded. Following the advice of their &lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt;, they decided to march north along the inside of the west wall. Taking out towers along the way and ignoring lesser structures until later. Soon they were inside the heart of the capital, but they had taken a great deal of punishment.

{"id": "43670", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43670", "title": "Bidding systems", "text": "Bidding systems refer to auction-style variable pricing in &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt; loot distribution systems. As in real life, there is an arbitrary number of methods to conduct an auction. The most popular are:\nBasic Systems.\nOpen Bidding.\nOn loot distribution, everybody writes their bids in the open raid channel. The loot master functions as auctioneer. The highest bidder gets the item and loses the amount of DKP he bid.\nSilent Bidding.\nWhen an item is due to be distributed, everyone interested whispers their bid to the loot master. The highest bidder wins the item for the amount bid.\nVariations.\nSpend one more.\nThe winner pays not the amount he bid, but just one more than the second highest bidder.\nTier bidding.\nBidding amounts are in set tiers, e.g. in multiples of 10; players bid at tiers, up to the DKP they possess (or in some cases, the next tier up, resulting in some players have small negative amounts of DKP).\nMaximum bid.\nItems may have a static maximum bid value; players may bid no more than this amount, no matter how many DKP they possess. \nMinimum bid.\nItems may have a static minimum bid value; the winner MUST spend at least this much, even if they are the only bidder on an item.\nClass restrictions.\nOnly high priority classes may be allowed to bid on an item, versus any player who can equip an item. This may be used to prevent situations where an individual member of a class values an item more highly (and has more points to bid) than members of a class for whom the item is more traditionally valuable. For example: a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; bidding on &lt;a href=\"Drake%20Fang%20Talisman\"&gt;Drake Fang Talisman&lt;/a&gt; and outbidding &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; who may get more benefit. Class restrictions (or priorities) are traditionally hotly debated.\nGKP.\nPlayers bid gold instead of regular Dragon Kill Points.\nAdvantages.\nThe subjective value of a drop is not fixed. The same item may be a valued upgrade for one raid member, and a minor sidegrade for another. In an homogenous and fair environment, bidding leads to the best possible item pricing and item distribution. Since everyone is free to bid as much as they can (up to their current DKP score), it's not automatically the person with the highest score who gets the item, if someone with a lesser amount is willing to spend more, he will get it. So items normally go to the raid members who value them most, for whom they are the greatest upgrades. On the other end, even small up- or sidegrades will be distributed and not disenchanted.\nDisadvantages.\nSince bidding is a free market, it introduces all problems of a free market. Most problems associated with bidding revolve around finding the right price, and therefore are systematically inherent. The system's balance is always disturbed if an item is sold either too cheap or too expensive.\nPlaying the System.\nBidding systems not only reward contribution to the guilds goals, but also reward \"playing\" the bidding system well. In order to gain maximum profit it is neccessary to \"read\" the situation, and to correctly assess when an item starts to become cheap (or whether it will remain rare/expensive for quite some time). This may actually develop into a meta-game with a strong luck factor.\nThe DKP Gap and Collusion.\nSee the extensive discussion in the &lt;a href=\"Loot%20system%23Loot%20System%20Discussion\"&gt;Loot system&lt;/a&gt; article.\nLowballing.\nA player may get away with an item for a very low price, because every other player on that raid didn't want or need it, even though other players in the system (but not in the raid) would have bid much higher.\nDraining.\nSometimes, one or more players enter a bidding contest with a specific player just to push the price of an item up, and thus drain the point pool of the player in question, ensuring that this player has to stay out of later bidding contests."}

These encounter scripts are activated when you target or mouse over a raid boss, or if any other Big Wigs user in your raid does. In most cases only one module will be running at any given time.\nIf you're looking for boss encounter scripts for 5-man dungeons, these are not in Big Wigs proper, but live in their own add-on; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/little-wigs.aspx\"&gt;Little Wigs&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelp us out.\nFeedback.\nPlease remember that we are always interested in hearing directly from you. About anything you want to share or ask. You may &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/addons/big-wigs/tickets/\"&gt;file tickets from our project page&lt;/a&gt; about anything, and you may also contact us on IRC; see the bottom here for details.\nThe comments on curse.com are rarely, \"if ever\", read or replied to by any of the Big Wigs authors.\nOpen.\nNote that the Big Wigs project - like 99% of all add-ons hosted on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/\"&gt;wowace.com&lt;/a&gt; - is open for free access to anyone who cares to join. The source code is open and free, and we welcome you to participate in the future development of Big Wigs.\nTranscripts and combat logs.\nIf you want to help us out with a new boss encounter that was recently introduced to the game, you can get our &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/addons/transcriptor/\"&gt;Transcriptor add-on&lt;/a&gt; that helps you record raw, relevant data for each encounter. Your help is appreciated, and also needed! Compressed output from Transcriptor may be uploaded alongside a ticket, or dumped on sites such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//dump.no/\"&gt;dump.no&lt;/a&gt; and linked from a ticket. Or you can even e-mail it to one of the authors.\nBut if you don't care for Transcriptor, a simple /combatlog will also help. Don't forget to tell us what raid size, difficulty, and encounter the log is for.\nAncient project history.\nTekkub, the original BigWigs1 for Ace1 author - back in the MC days, was inspired to write BW1 after his very first raid. He was horrified by the massive amount of spam his raid leader was creating with his boss mod. Getting messages all over the place for things he didn't care about (Hunters can't dispel a curse or interrupt a heal - well, they couldn't back then). He also found that the \"60 seconds until painful doom\" timer messages were such a waste. Why not use a simple timer bar to show this?\nOur goals.\nBig Wigs aims to be as efficient as possible (creating a lower memory per second footprint and using a lower amount of CPU than any other boss mod). When modules are written, every aspect of the encounter is inspected. Is add-on synchronisation required? Is target scanning required? What events are really needed? We also aim to have the latest encounter scripts released ASAP; not long after the first few attempts of a brand new boss, we usually have a working encounter script for it.\nCredits.\nThanks to all the wonderful people in #wowace on irc.freenode.net for help with transcripts, translations, libraries, etc. Visit the About screen in the Big Wigs interface options for a complete list of all authors who helped directly with source changes.\nIf you want to contact us on IRC, remember that all the main Big Wigs authors live in Europe, and the nature of IRC means you might not get a response for as long as 10 - yes, TEN - hours. Just stick around and eventually, I \"guarantee\" we will answer. If you have the patience of a goldfish, however, you might as well just stay away."}

She had bright pink hair that she binded up in ponytails. She was almost always unintentionally perky, even for a gnome, but didn't like that it caused others to not take her seriously.\nHistory.\nJaina was asked to take on Kinndy as an apprentice by &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, who described her as \"extremely promising, intelligent, and fiercely curious about the world.\" Although she was merely the tender age of 22, no more then a teenager for her kind, she quickly proved to be an excellent apprentice; the only area in which her talent seemed lacking was in conjuring baked goods. This frustrated Kinndy to no end, as baking was her &lt;a href=\"Jaxi%20Sparkshine\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;'s specialty.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Theramore with news that the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; had been stolen, Kinndy at first, used her harsh tongue at him, but later she was eager to help him figure out how the thieves had hidden it from the blue dragonflight. She made several trips to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to procure tomes and scrolls, and fervently poured through them for an answer. Jaina ordered Kinndy and Tervosh to inform inhabitants of Theramore about the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; army massing nearby. Later on, it was Kinndy's idea to have Jaina asked Kirin Tor for help. Kinndy was also one of the first people to notice the attraction that was growing between Jaina and Kalec and excused herself so that they would be alone together, implying her tacit approval. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; attacked Theramore Isle, Kinndy helped to magically enhance the western gate alongside &lt;a href=\"Thoder%20Windermere\"&gt;Thoder Windermere&lt;/a&gt;, and successfully prevented the Horde from breaching it. After the battle, she was emotionally drained and exhausted.\nShe was killed when &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the city with a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, her corpse bombarded with so much magic that she disintegrated into a pile of violet sand when Jaina touched her body. It was this moment, losing someone so bright, young and full of promise, that made Jaina snap.\nAfter her death, her &lt;a href=\"Windle%20Sparkshine\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; was given special permission to light the lanterns of Dalaran with dancing, laughing images of Kinndy. In the \"\" version of Dalaran, an image of Kinndy appears above the lanterns when her father turns on the lights every evening.\nA vision of Kinndy could also be seen amongst other people Jaina had lost in the past during her exile in &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt;."}

Having infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;, she was apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn%20Flamescowl\"&gt;Ritssyn Flamescowl&lt;/a&gt;, who later left her to lead a council that admonished her way of doing things. She blames herself for having followed blindly once before, and for trusting her mentor to look out for her best interests. She has been resenting Ritssyn ever since.\nLegion.\nNeeding to take down &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Huntmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to Kira for information on new &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s that Hakkar was breeding, which would be particularly dangerous to &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRequiring a live subject to examine, she sent out the Huntmaster to retrieve some bait. This would trick one of Hakkar's new fledgling felhounds at &lt;a href=\"Felbeast%20Dens\"&gt;Felbeast Dens&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt; into attacking, and the hunter weakened it enough to capture it in a cage that Kira provided. On inspection, Kira discovered that in addition to their natural immunity to magic, the felhound had an armor-like hide consisting of thick, layered scales, and doubted that most metals would be able to pierce it. Other than equipping the entire Unseen Path with &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s, she suggested fighting back with something that will exploit their weakness.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; of the Black Harvest came to her for her knowledge of demonic gateways, she refused to help freely. She claimed that her currency is power and knowledge, and only with either would it be possible to come to an arrangement.\nTo gain her trust, the First accepted to retrieve something of personal value to her that had been stolen by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, who\u00a0have been snatching anything with any sort of magical significance. Fortunately, they did not know how to access the power of her &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Artifacts\"&gt;Bloodstones&lt;/a&gt; contain a great deal of power that can only be awakened once they are fed. Yet this stone did not feast on fish and cakes, it hungered for blood: the more powerful, the better. Kira needed the First to nourish her stone with the blood of the demons of &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;, so that she may unlock its power.\nThe Bloodstone sated, Kira wished to use its power to bend the will of demons that would otherwise not be so easily controlled. Having never witnessed the direct effect of the Bloodstone's power on a demon before, she asked the First to use it on suitable test subjects, a &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20Imp\"&gt;few imps&lt;/a&gt; that she had procured. The test failed, the subjects died during the testing process. Nonetheless, the First had held up their end of the bargain, so Kira decided it was time for her to fulfill hers.\nKira made her way to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; with their summoning of a powerful gateway to the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. She did not lay eyes on Ritssyn, Kira was there to repay her debt to the First, not to speak to \"the hypocrite who chose the Council over his friends\".\nKira led the ritual of the gateway's summoning, during which Ritssyn acknowledged that her power had grown since the last time they met.\nWith the Council restored, Kira claimed that she would never be a follower again. Instead, she chose to stand beside the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the Netherlord&lt;/a&gt;, who she commends for doing right by their fellow warlocks, contrary to those who chose the pursuit of power over the needs of others, to which Ritssyn replies that it was never a choice for him.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nImps aren't ideal test subjects. They're easy enough to summon, but often too fragile for my experiments.\nI am here to repay my debt, and nothing more.\nYou did right by your fellow warlocks, which is commendable, and surprising.\nThe council is in good hands with you as its leader."}

Instead, it is separated into four subzones, which contain different types of mobs \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Row\"&gt;Wizard Row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Town%20Square\"&gt;Town Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20Yard\"&gt;Chapel Yard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Tower\"&gt;Violet Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in order to finish the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; once and for all, a group of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; established a base in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;'s territory. They called it \"Kirin'Var Village\", located on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Sea\"&gt;Devouring Sea&lt;/a&gt;. There they survived numerous orc assaults, however, a short time after they had settled, Draenor was torn apart. The explosion devastated the land and all that remains today are the islands making up the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. The surviving wizards remained in their village for seventeen years.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Daellis%20Dawnstrike\"&gt;Master Daellis Dawnstrike&lt;/a&gt;, along with his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; troops, attacked the village with more power than the wizards could imagine. In the end, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s forces used a &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Bomb\"&gt;Mana Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the one that eradicated the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, to completely destroy the village. Archmage Vargoth ordered his comrades to retreat to the local &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kael'thas was wiser and stronger than Vargoth remembered: in the moment that Vargoth and his men entered the tower, the elven prince sealed the doors with a curse on the tower to ensure that none of the wizards within would exit the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Tower\"&gt;Violet Tower&lt;/a&gt;. But despite Kael's efforts, one of Vargoth's apprentices escaped: &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nRavandwyr saw Kael'thas' plans and escaped, but was unable to warn his master in time. With no one by his side but his \"familiar\", Ravandwyr fled to the &lt;a href=\"Arklon%20Ruins\"&gt;Arklon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; but found the area being excavated by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. He had to instead flee to &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; settlement. Ravandwyr has sought help ever since from adventurers.\nCurrent state.\nKirin'Var Village is now haunted by many of its past's residents due to the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, and another apprentice of Vargoth, &lt;a href=\"Naberius\"&gt;Naberius&lt;/a&gt;. Wizard Row has been overrun by &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Invader\"&gt;Mana Invader&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Seeker\"&gt;Mana Seeker&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Mageslayer\"&gt;Mageslayer&lt;/a&gt;s due to the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Bomb\"&gt;Mana Bomb&lt;/a&gt; dropped there by Kael'thas' forces.

More specifically, they are governed by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. The Kirin Tor were members of the original &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and have also upheld an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; for over 2,000 years, with the Council of Six itself once included &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;' crown-prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, its sovereignty causing most contemporary human and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; mages to bow before it.\nOnce a secretive and selective &lt;a href=\"Organization\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; of magi that kept aloof from ordinary politics, it was also described as the most learned and puissant of the magical academies, guilds, and societies, advisors to the kings, teachers of the learned, and revealers of secrets. The Kirin Tor has since become one of the foremost factions standing against the threats posed to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s survival. Allied to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but remaining neutral in its conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they fought in recent years against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; becoming a focal point of the campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and serving as a neutral ground where the heroes of every kingdom could join together against their mutual foe.\nThe Kirin Tor became a reputation faction in \"\".\nHistory.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; became the chief center of learning for magicians throughout the land, its &lt;a href=\"Magocrats\"&gt;Magocrat&lt;/a&gt; lords formed the Kirin Tor as a specialized sect that was charged with cataloging and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known to mankind at the time. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; became the rulers of the Kirin Tor, and eventually replaced the Magocrats at the head of Dalaran.\nApproximately five hundred years prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, former prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to bring down the Kirin Tor with a curse that left all the wizards in the city unable to use their magic. Her scheme was foiled in part by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, consort to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and when Sintharia was defeated, most believed her to be dead when her own magic had been turned on her.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; distancing herself and giving birth to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; was without an official &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. They called on the Kirin Tor's accomplished magi to keep watch and safeguard the world. Likewise, at the Council's behest, the Kirin Tor sent agents to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and spy on the young Medivh, taking parts in his parties in the magical tower. The spies, however, always left empty-handed - Medivh made sure of it. The &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt;, a secret sect founded by the Kirin Tor, was later assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and to spy on the Guardian and his works.\nTheir members were present across all the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, notably in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was acquainted with the fellow wizards of the Kirin Tor in the realm.\nDuring the First War.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the resurgence of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;strange green-skinned creatures&lt;/a&gt; who attacked human settlements in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had thoroughly occupied the attention of the Council of Tirisfal and the Kirin Tor. The appearance of creatures never seen on this world, corrupted by demonic energies, far outweighed their concerns about Medivh. However, the Council still wanted to work with the Guardian and convinced the Kirin Tor to send another apprentice to Karazhan. For years apprentices had presented themselves to Karazhan, some sent by the Kirin Tor, others willingly, but Medivh was a severe master, and the slightest mistake led to being expelled, most of them only stayed for one day, the others less than a week. At the request of the Council, and recently learning that Medivh wished for the first time to have an apprentice, they sent the young &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; who came to be worthy of being the Guardian's apprentice and spent several years studying with the latter. Several mage instructors of the Kirin Tor saw an opportunity to gain new information and asked Khadgar to learn various information for them.\nDespite the war happening far away from them, the mages of the Kirin Tor still saw their fair share of troubles. Seven mages of the Violet Citadel died in mysterious circumstances, including &lt;a href=\"Guzbah\"&gt;Guzbah&lt;/a&gt; and archmage &lt;a href=\"Arrexis\"&gt;Arrexis&lt;/a&gt;. Besides Guzbah all of them were secretly members of the Council of Tirisfal.\nSome time after Medivh's death and the end of the war, Aegwynn gave &lt;a href=\"%3AAluneth\"&gt;:Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; to the Kirin Tor. The mages locked it in an &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;enchanted vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Second War.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor was present during the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;, represented by the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Archmage Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;. After heated debates, and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s encouraging speech to unite them, Antonidas pledged the support of Dalaran with the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;other kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; personally served as their liaison.\nAmong the mages that participated in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, some were the former students of the Conjurers of Azeroth who fell during the First War as they were unprepared for the rigors of warfare. Whether in their sanctum at the Violet Citadel in Dalaran or on the many battlefields of Lordaeron, the mages were resolute in their efforts to defend the people.\nThough the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by Khadgar and his fellow magi in the aftermath of the Second War, the Kirin Tor noticed that a rift remained that connected &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; together. At the behest of Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde\"&gt;Nethergarde&lt;/a&gt; was funded after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; by the various kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and built by the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. The archmages of the Kirin Tor, along with the help of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and the young king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, convinced the members of the Alliance that the high costs involved with constructing the fortress were well worth it considering the dangers involved with a possible \"second invasion\". The fortress was primarily staffed by members of the Kirin Tor, who were also tasked with stopping the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;taint&lt;/a&gt; that had &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; the orcish homelands and threatened to spread over all the continent. The magi managed to preserve the northern &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;swamps&lt;/a&gt; and the human realms beyond.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; that would follow between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, aided by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, found themselves able to successfully enter Dalaran's Arcane vault and steal the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from the Kirin Tor, a relic they crafted that could focus and amplify magical energies. When Gorefiend shattered the containment wards placed around the artifact, he attracted the attention of one of the most powerful leaders in the Kirin Tor, the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, who raced to investigate the source of the disturbance. He and a handful of magi battled the death knights in the vault, but the element of surprise was on the Horde's side, and one of the magi was killed before they escaped with the artifact. Antonidas gave chase for as long as he could, but once the death knights had reunited with the black dragons, they vanished into the skies. Antonidas would quickly inform Khadgar of the theft and, sometime after, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; would journey to Draenor in order to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; threat.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nFollowing the destruction of Draenor, the Kirin Tor studied the imprisoned orcs and their magics. The magi knew that elements of the Horde were still lurking throughout the Eastern Kingdoms. They wanted to learn as much as they could about their enemy in the event that another war broke out, and later found out that the defeated orcs had fallen into a strange lethargy, suffering from a withdrawal of the demonic energies that they had become addicted to.\nFor years, the Kirin Tor had watched &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt;, greatly troubled by her &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark teachings&lt;/a&gt;. After her death, they set out to scour her writings from history. Magi picked through the villages and cities Seline had traveled, gathering up every scroll and tome that she had penned. Her writings were then locked away in the Kirin Tor's vaults of Dalaran, hoping that would be the end of Seline's dangerous brand of magic. Yet despite their efforts, they could not bury the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;doctrine of balance&lt;/a&gt; she had preached.\nAt some point, it came to Antonidas' attention that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, another member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, had begun to experiment with the arcane art of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. As this threatened the safety and reputation of Dalaran, Antonidas and the other leaders of the Kirin Tor decided to put a stop to it. They had Kel'Thuzad's properties searched, and all items tainted by dark magic were confiscated and destroyed. Antonidas warned Kel'Thuzad that he would be stripped of his rank and holdings, and exiled from both Dalaran and Lordaeron, if he did not abandon that path. Kel'Thuzad chose to leave Dalaran and swore to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a representative of the Kirin Tor and the Alliance of Lordaeron, Antonidas held the position as one of the four jurors during the &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; of the paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other judges, he was shocked when Tirion admitted his guilt, which led the paladin to his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; and his exile.\nWhile the Alliance of Lordaeron was unaware of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;death cults&lt;/a&gt; forming in their lands before, the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, led to the departure of Gilneas and Stromgarde from the Alliance. However, several kingdoms made it known that they had no intention of letting the Alliance collapse, among them the nation of Dalaran.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, most contemporary &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; mages bowed to the sovereignty of Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. Elven &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es served the Kirin Tor as its agents. However, the city was noted for being politically aloof and secretive - magi of the Kirin Tor did not get involved in \"ordinary\" politics, and outsiders were rarely welcome in Dalaran, even visiting royalty.\nDuring the Third War.\nNear the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor took notice of a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;mysterious plague&lt;/a&gt; gripping the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;. As such, their Ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Kirin Tor were prepared to place the villages under strict quarantine. However, the King declared that there would be no quarantine without proof of these claims as the people of Lordaeron had suffered enough. Suspecting that the plague was magical in nature, the Kirin Tor sent &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to investigate, accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;envoys&lt;/a&gt; sent by King Terenas to assist her. The Kirin Tor eventually learned that their suspicions were not only correct but that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the organization, was responsible for spreading the plague.\nWhen the Third War began, some of the aspiring geniuses of the magocracy were allured by the dark arts and forsook their very souls, becoming &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s in service to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. When King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; fell, magi from Dalaran went to the ruined &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; along with other Alliance soldiers to deal with the rampaging undead army, but soon found themselves overwhelmed.\nUnder the direction of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; who wished to come to Azeroth to begin his invasion, the undead Scourge, led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; Arthas, prepared to invade Dalaran in order to claim the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, protected by the Kirin Tor since a messenger from Khadgar brought them the artifact before he destroyed the Dark Portal from Draenor. The idea of \u200b\u200busing this artifact to open the way for demons was from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the latter knowing that it would be possible to access it with the help of the now resurrected lich Kel'Thuzad, who had been one of Dalaran's rulers.\nWith the Scourge approaching Dalaran, Archmage Antonidas and the Kirin Tor readied themselves for battle. They evacuated most of the city's civilians, leaving behind only a small resistance force. Though these defenders were few, they were some of the greatest magi in the world. Not only that, as Dalaran itself was a weapon, whose magic coursed through the streets, and arcane barriers blanketed the city. Many of these wards would destroy any undead that touched them. In Dalaran, the Scourge met resistance every bit as formidable as that of Lordaeron or Quel'Thalas. Perhaps even more so. The Kirin Tor's magi battered the undead with barrage after barrage of arcane energy, wreaking havoc on the invaders. However, this frontal assault was nothing more than a diversion, while a small force of Scourge was led by Arthas in the city, accompanied by Kel'Thuzad and the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;. They killed the &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s maintaining the auras and arcane barriers, and met the Kirin Tor's leader Antonidas who faced them until his last breath, before claiming the Book of Medivh.\nWhile the Scourge prepared to summon Archimonde into the world, surviving wizards of the Kirin Tor had teleported in an army. As the Kirin Tor began their attack, Arthas ordered the Scourge to defend Kel'Thuzad at all costs; and despite their best efforts, the Kirin Tor failed in stopping the Scourge. Successfully summoned, Archimonde destroyed Dalaran completely, claiming its annihilation heralded the Legion's first strike against the mortal world.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;fall of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, surviving agents of the Kirin Tor such as &lt;a href=\"Jailor%20Kassan\"&gt;Jailor Kassan&lt;/a&gt; pledged their support to Grand Marshal &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, came to reside in Dalaran and fought in its defense; however, the elves came under Garithos' prejudice against their kind and were eventually imprisoned in the city's dungeons for consorting with the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, slated for execution. However, thanks to the timely arrival of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves were freed and eventually found their way to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; was fleeing the dungeons, he found the ghosts of Antonidas and several of his kindred, and finally released them, allowing them peace after so many months.\nWhile elves such as &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; would vouch for the Kirin Tor's innocence in these events, others like &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; would accuse the organization of looking the other way. What role the Kirin Tor had in this, if any, is largely unknown. They were, however, known to have partial control of the city. The destruction of Dalaran was a massive blow to the Kirin Tor, leaving its surviving members scattered and its leadership in disarray, while some of them fought and were killed by the pets of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the Kirin Tor cleared the naga from the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and sealed the place.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, the surviving wizards of the Kirin Tor returned to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and constructed a vast, magical dome around the heart of their city. Some believe it was for protection from the violence of these times, others say they merely wanted solitude, to study and plot. The shield was opaque and completely impenetrable by any known means warding off any new attack while the magi slowly regained their strength. The area and ruined outskirts of their city were patrolled by the wizards and their rock elemental minions, but the dome was powerful enough to destroy creatures that venture too close. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; was present among those who remained outside the dome.\nThey sent &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Ashcrombe\"&gt;Sorcerer Ashcrombe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to check on &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt;'s progress against the undead, ignorant to the fact that the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; had been driven mad with guilt over the fact that he summoned the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Kirin Tor also have forces stationed in &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Internment%20Camp\"&gt;Lordamere Internment Camp&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Dalaran also has a strong presence in Outland. Dalaran's army is largely responsible for the survival of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; power in Silverpine; without the aid of the magi, the town of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; would have fallen to the Scourge long ago. The Kirin Tor were also not knowledgeable about the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; at first, believing them to be just another clan of undead. The mages of Dalaran would eventually come into conflict with them, notably over the control of &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, after the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; failed to properly create a second &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, the elite magi of the Kirin Tor hid it away lest it unleash further deadly calamities. Fearing its unbridled power, the Kirin Tor entrusted its safekeeping to the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in order to secure it away from the hands of men.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; intended to siphon from every source of arcane power on Azeroth and dispose of the energy where no mage could reach it, the magi of Azeroth quickly noticed that something was amiss. A few powerful magi of the Kirin Tor were sent out to investigate, and when they arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, they were confronted by Malygos himself who hid nothing from them. He told them that the use of the arcane had put the Burning Legion's eye on Azeroth, repeatedly, and that now the armies of the Horde and the Alliance were abusing those energies to settle their factional disputes. He showed the magi the damage that had already been done to Azeroth, and demanded that they join his cause. Some high-ranking magi of the Kirin Tor were swayed by his argument, and they pledged themselves to the blue dragonflight. Others were horrified and attempted to escape, but none succeeded, as they were killed to stop word from getting back to the Kirin Tor. The magi who joined Malygos soon became known as &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, dedicated to erasing all resistance to the blue dragonflight's new purpose.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;, after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor finally uncovered what was happening at the Nexus, where Malygos and his dragonflight were draining away Azeroth's arcane magic, redirecting all the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s towards the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, and killing anyone who dared to oppose them. Archmage Rhonin and the ranking members of the Kirin Tor were shocked to learn that some of their own had defected to the blue dragonflight's cause. The danger posed by Malygos and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was so great that the magi of Dalaran did something unprecedented: they pooled their power and teleported their entire city to the skies above &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend, leaving only a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt; in its place. From their new vantage point, the city subsequently served as a base of operations for many actions taken against the growing threat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, while the Kirin Tor engaged the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; to stop Malygos's campaign, but progress was slow. The blue Dragon Aspect and his servants were too strong for even the great magi of Dalaran to contend with, and the presence of the Kirin Tor was indeed met with deep-seated revilement from the crazed Malygos, who made numerous attempts to destroy the city.\nIn time, the Kirin Tor proclaimed themselves &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; in the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and instead sought to help bridge the gaps between the two factions, starting with reaching out to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; for magical support against Malygos. Consequently, the elven population of the Kirin Tor underwent something of a split: the portion of the elves who converted to the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; philosophy took up the name \"the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;\", named for their leader, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the only non-human on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; who ensured the Horde a sanctuary within the city. Conversely, some &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; members opposed the notion of allowing the sin'dorei back into the Kirin Tor's ranks and formed the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to oppose it. Consequently, as base of operations, the Alliance was given the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; which was the base of the Silver Covenant. Its leader, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, however, held no political sway within the city, thus leading to the blood elves officially being readmitted as members of the Kirin Tor.\nThe Kirin Tor then called upon the factions to aid them. The idea of diverting resources from the war against the Lich King did not sit well with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, but both agreed that it was necessary, and joined the Kirin Tor in the Nexus War. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Kirin Tor to fight, later joined by representatives of the other dragonflights who had also grown wary of Malygos. Together, they attempted to contact the Aspect of Magic and convince him to end his destructive crusade, but their efforts were met with open hostility. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, an agreement between all the dragonflights, and both factions, the Kirin Tor assaulted the Nexus, and Malygos was ultimately killed before his vengeance could be fulfilled. The Kirin Tor then spent years reversing the damage done to Azeroth's ley lines, eventually restoring them to their former power.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; barely escaped from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, he immediately notified Archmage Rhonin of the Kirin Tor that a &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;living nightmare&lt;/a&gt; was stirring within the forgotten stronghold. The leader of the Kirin Tor notified the Alliance and the Horde, hoping they would see fit to set aside their differences again, but it was a failure because of the recently disastrous &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the Explorers' League and the Kirin Tor later implored &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde and the Alliance to join them in the final assault on the stronghold, and since the request came from neutral parties, they agreed. The assault was more difficult than anyone imagined, but they managed to reach &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Prison%20of%20Yogg-Saron\"&gt;prison chamber&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during the war, the Kirin Tor acquired the &lt;a href=\"The%20Idle%20Crown%20of%20Anub%27arak\"&gt;crown of the nerubian king&lt;/a&gt; and put it aside for the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, whenever they decided to coronate a new one.\nInterlude.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, most of the mages of the Kirin Tor, including Rhonin, were trapped in their nightmares. &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; and her remaining comrades, however, were holding against the shadowy attackers, despite their exhaustion.\nBetween the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Dalaran and the Kirin Tor remained in Northrend. At &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; left the region, while only &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Worker\"&gt;workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Summoner\"&gt;summoners&lt;/a&gt; of the Kirin Tor remain at the crater, some of them discussing that the area was unstable. They are friendly with members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but still hostile with those of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; following their conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; who also conquered &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the nation was invited by the leadership of the Alliance to send a representative to their diplomatic meeting in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the Council declined, citing its desire to retain its neutrality and continue to help bridge the gaps between the Alliance and the Horde.\nTides of War.\nYears later, as she learned of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s ambitions to conquer the whole of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; urged the Kirin Tor to support &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; armies massing at &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their initial reluctance to involve the neutral Kirin Tor into a conflict, the council agreed to send mages to help defend the island nation. &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; cast the decisive vote in support of Theramore, reasoning that to do nothing would be to implicitly support the Horde's expansionism.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s true plan - to detonate a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; over Theramore - was revealed, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed his life by teleporting Jaina and a few wounded defenders to safety. Rhonin pulled the bomb into the Theramore Tower, minimizing the damage caused by the explosion.\nIn the aftermath, the Kirin Tor, while refusing to launch an attack on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for Theramore's decimation, chose Jaina as Rhonin's replacement and as the new leader of the Council of Six and the Kirin Tor, with Kalecgos also joining the Kirin Tor. Due to &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal at the defense of Theramore, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;' credibility was damaged, though Aethas later denies responsibility and vowed to atone for Thalen's treachery. Soon afterward, many, if not nearly every member of the Kirin Tor who could come, attended the funeral ceremony for Rhonin, led by Jaina. It concluded as the mages and denizens sent small arcane orbs floating upwards.\nKalec also joined the Kirin Tor and stayed in the city for a time, but he saw distrust from the other magi, so he often found excuses to be away.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWhen Jaina Proudmoore discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; steal the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; by using Dalaran portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, she mobilized the Kirin Tor, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces, and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to purge the Horde from Dalaran. Though Aethas Sunreaver claimed he knew nothing of Garrosh's scheme, Jaina nonetheless chose to incarcerate him and his Sunreavers after Aethas refused to order his people to leave the city peacefully. Those that surrendered were imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; while those that resisted were put to the sword, after which Jaina pledged the Kirin Tor to Varian's war cause, effectively bringing Dalaran back into the Alliance (for game purposes Dalaran remains unchanged after the questline is completed).\nThe purge also put an end to Dalaran's alliance with &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, which had stood for over 2,000 years.\nIgnited by Jaina's fury, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; seek to seize &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Thunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; and the treasures contained therein, in the interest of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Composed of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; combined with war mages and warriors of the Kirin Tor. Their main goals are to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; from obtaining powerful artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Emperor Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; and to also fight the coalition of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; threatening &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Kirin Tor's expedition into the of thirty-five years ago was led by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. While the Alliance-Horde expedition was mostly busy dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar, feeling responsible for the release of after the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, leads agents of the Kirin Tor to track down the mad &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;.\nBased at &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor were friendly with the Alliance adventurers, but remain neutral with the Horde adventurers, as Jaina Proudmoore has ordered that all outsiders to Dalaran - especially the Horde - are not allowed on Kirin Tor grounds. Despite this, Khadgar says that as he is a member of the Council, his friends - regardless of faction - are allowed in, and if Jaina has a problem with it she can take it up with him. When Jaina arrives on Draenor, she expresses distaste that Khadgar allows the Horde to work with him at Zangarra. Jaina says the rest of the Council of Six would not approve and that she certainly does not.\nA Kirin Tor expedition was also sent to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. They asked the forces of &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; to help them with the natives. They were responsible for maintaining a supply line between Draenor and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but their holdout within the &lt;a href=\"Everbloom\"&gt;Everbloom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Bluff\"&gt;Violet Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, was overgrown by &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and most of its population &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt;. This turn of events nearly ended in a disaster, when the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yalnu\"&gt;Yalnu&lt;/a&gt; crossed the mage portal into the Kirin Tor overlook above &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, where he was stopped before he could muster his strength and infest the city or even worse.\nAnother Kirin Tor force, led by &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt;, fights the forces of and the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Socrethar's Rise&lt;/a&gt;.\nKirin Tor mages accompanied Khadgar to the and are seen at the entrance and at the site of the disabled Black Gate maintaining portals.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, a squad of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Battle-Mage\"&gt;Kirin Tor Battle-Mage&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; fought alongside King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the disastrous battle, Jaina Proudmoore and the Kirin Tor moved the entire city to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; with a giant &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt; spell, in order to aid in the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, hovering over &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. In the town ruins outside of Karazhan, a few mages of the Kirin Tor could be seen fighting alongside the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; mages, holding off the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic reinforcements from reaching the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;Master's Cellar&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the local forces of Dalaran in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; were trying to reconstruct the remaining ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt;, overseen by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Cedric\"&gt;Archmage Cedric&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Khadgar called for a vote to have the Horde return to Dalaran in order to have the Kirin Tor fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at its utmost capability. Jaina was vehemently opposed, especially after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, but she was outvoted in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; with only &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; voting \"no\" alongside her. Jaina left Dalaran and the Kirin Tor in anger and Khadgar became the council's replacement leader. When the council next assembled, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; was seen as the sixth in Jaina's place. The council later voted to allow &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; back into Dalaran, although not as a member of the Six.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had launched an attack on the city, the Council moved the city to the southern shores of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in close proximity to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, so it would once again serve as a hub for Azeroth's heroes at the front lines in the renewed war against the Legion when countless forces pour from the Tomb of Sargeras.\nIn order to fight the Burning Legion, the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; was reformed by &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Several members of the Kirin Tor, including members of the Council of Six, joined the ranks of the Tirisgarde. Some of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; who studied amongst the Kirin Tor also joined the Tirisgarde, convinced and led by &lt;a href=\"Esara%20Verrinde\"&gt;Esara Verrinde&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the unified Tirisgarde managed to capture the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, now used to power a weapon defense system located in the tallest spire atop Dalaran's &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhadgar asked the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; for help against &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; who had captured several Kirin Tor mages. The Archmage, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Baron&lt;/a&gt;, and the Huntmaster found them in &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, but they were too late, the mages have just been fed to Hakkar's felhounds.\nThe Kirin Tor also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, and supported the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and further incursions on the island, while the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Kesalon\"&gt;Kesalon&lt;/a&gt; was sent to scour the Broken Isles for anomalies and arcane artifacts.\nSome mages of the Kirin Tor were present on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde, Archmage Khadgar, and Aethas Sunreaver, in order to fight demons on the battlefield at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, and protect the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" from Legion's attacks.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, several Kirin Tor mages were seen among the gathered crowd at the memorial ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor remained largely neutral and did not provide significant assistance to either side, although &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; briefly attempted to reach them during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; remained in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; throughout the course of the Fourth War, and even after its conclusion.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Emissary\"&gt;emissaries&lt;/a&gt; of the Kirin Tor settled in both &lt;a href=\"portal%20room\"&gt;portal room&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, offering access to a portal for the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; of Orgrimmar, the recently renovated &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; was decorated with banners bearing the crest of the Kirin Tor, and one of their &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Magus\"&gt;magus&lt;/a&gt; maintained a portal for &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Golem%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Arcane Golems&lt;/a&gt; also regularly patrolled the Sanctum, similar to the ones used by the Kirin Tor. This seems to indicate that the Kirin Tor was involved in the renovations, remaining an ally to the Alliance, while maintaining its neutrality with the Horde during the war.\nHowever, some were able to join the ranks of the Alliance during the war, notably the Quartermaster &lt;a href=\"Tomas%20Riogain\"&gt;Tomas Riogain&lt;/a&gt; who replaced his tabard and was aboard the Alliance fleet who chased the remains of the Horde fleet sailing from &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. He managed to survive &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s trap and joined the survivors in &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt;, regretting having left Dalaran.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Keeper\"&gt;Kirin Tor Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s also assisted &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; in securing the &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Scale%20of%20the%20Blue%20Aspect\"&gt;Charged Scale of the Blue Aspect&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers visited Northrend once again. During their exploration, they reported that all that remains of the Kirin Tor on the frozen continent is the contingent watching the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Ledge\"&gt;Amber Ledge&lt;/a&gt;, and that their problems with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; were mostly ended since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; emerged, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was visited in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who informed him that ancient enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were returning to threaten the world and seek to cleanse Azeroth of the \"stain\" of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Realizing their oncoming threat, Khadgar agreed to help the blue dragon, and the Kirin Tor later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor worked to safeguard the wild arcane magic located all throughout the region and wanted to help &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; in reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; began to hunt the Kirin Tor mages since their arrival, as they detested their practice of arcane magic. After establishing &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Antonidas\"&gt;Camp Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, they came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. However, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, they were able to hold the line until Kalecgos arrived to fend them off. Khadgar led the mages to continue fighting the Primalists, notably in and around &lt;a href=\"Vakthros%20Range\"&gt;Vakthros Range&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization and headquarters.\nAs the elite cadre of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; in the known world, and the ruling conclave that leads the magical &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nation of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor has its own hierarchical structure to organize its activities around the world. The Kirin Tor held no other spellcasters as their equals for magical knowledge, indeed often sought to hinder those wizards who did not hold allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Kirin Tor requires years of study in magic schools, then to become the apprentice of one of their mages, in order to prove itself worthy of being integrated as a member of the organization. Thereafter, nothing advanced a wizard in the Kirin Tor quicker than reputation, although none of the senior council would have ever admitted to that base fact. As agents of the Kirin Tor, their mission is to collect knowledge and magical artifacts found across all Azeroth, and even beyond.\nThe Kirin Tor's headquarters is the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, an impressive building so named for its stone walls which gave off a faint violet light. Separately, the conclave's senior council met in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Air\"&gt;Chamber of Air&lt;/a&gt;, a room with no visible walls \u2014 the gray stone floor with its central diamond symbol stood beneath an open sky that shifted and changed rapidly as if time was speeding past within the chamber.\nLeadership.\nWithin the conclave, there is an inner council: the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Six&lt;/a&gt;, who are the actual rulers of the city. This governing body appoints one of their own as Head of the Kirin Tor (also known as Grand Magus of the Kirin Tor\"'); this master wizard is essentially the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Council of Six.\nThe Council of Six is the Kirin Tor high council of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. These six individuals are the leaders of both the city and all territories under the control of Dalaran. The Six are usually the most senior, but not necessarily the most gifted. They are chosen by several means, magic but one of them.\nThe Violet Council.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Council\"&gt;Violet Council&lt;/a&gt;, composed of nine of &lt;a href=\"Council%20Wizard\"&gt;Dalaran's elite wizards&lt;/a&gt;, was present to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Siege of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, spreading throughout the city to summon reinforcements and guard treasures, resources and experiments contained in the various vaults of Dalaran. One of them was present in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he summoned &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Prisoners\"&gt;various prisoners&lt;/a&gt; to help repel the undead forces.\nFollowing the defeat of the Kirin Tor, and as they have not been mentioned since the destruction of the city, the wizards of the Violet Council were most certainly eliminated by Arthas and his hordes of undead.\nMembership.\nThough primarily a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdom, the Kirin Tor has always housed a sizeable &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; minority. For over two thousand years, it was not uncommon for some of the long-lived elves to study and serve in Dalaran as well as &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Relations were strained between the two magical kingdoms after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and further compounded by Silvermoon's alliance with the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, however, the readmitted &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; continued tradition somewhat, even if they were excluded and subsequently readmitted in Dalaran in the last years. Most of the Kirin Tor's current high elf population is now part of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, a militant wing of Kirin Tor defenders. The Kirin Tor also has &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; in their ranks. The organization also seems to accept some of its members who became &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the only exemple being &lt;a href=\"Old%20Fillmaff\"&gt;Old Fillmaff&lt;/a&gt;, although he does not know that he is dead.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor recruited &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; mages in their ranks. At the same time, the gradual reintroduction of arcane magic into &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; society has in turn also slowly produced mages of that race. By the time Azeroth was ready to invade &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; on Draenor, night elf and &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; mages had joined the Kirin Tor, carrying out work such as maintaining a portal between &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Lion's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years following the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor recruited many races into its ranks, mainly from those of the Horde. On the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor expedition counted among its ranks the usual races but also &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran humans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagon mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; mages.\nDepending on their choice of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%23Schools%20of%20arcane%20magic\"&gt;school of arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;, their talent, or the function in which they specialize, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and agents of the Kirin Tor carry different titles which specify their work, as well as the studies and research they are in charge for the organization.\nThe elite of the Kirin Tor are the archmages, who represent the pinnacle of magical power. It is an honorary title given to the most powerful and experienced mages of the Kirin Tor, in which they obtain a position of authority in the hierarchy. They take care of directing their subordinate mages in their activities and missions for the organization, while some of them represent the Kirin Tor in other realms, notably as appointed Archmage in the Royal Court of one of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, they also continue to do their research on different types of knowledge and artifacts.\nNotable members.\nMembers in the RPG.\nThe following are stated to be members or former members of the Kirin Tor in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" but have no known connection to the faction in canon lore.\nCulture.\nThe magi of the Kirin Tor were private, mysterious, and powerful, but they kept to themselves save when needed. They usually didn't get involved in ordinary politics, nor did they do the ordinary political maneuvering such as inviting royalty to enjoy their hospitality. This, however, was not always the case. They arrange formal dinners - for their own members and for visitors in a large dining room. The magi are usually clad in the purple and gold robes of Dalaran with an embroidered symbol of the great Eye upon them. They also wear their Kirin Tor signets.\nThere is one thing every member of the Kirin Tor valued, it's their independence. According to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, getting even two wizards to work together was difficult enough, it was something their own brethren have never found easy, and the thought of managing more than that was almost beyond imagining. Among them, some hold themselves in a certain way above the non-mages. However, following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran, the once reviled mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; led his kind from the brink, and under his leadership, the mages of the Kirin Tor quickly began to work to the restoration of Dalaran, indicating a change in their behavior, notably to cooperate.\nWhile the Kirin Tor officially condemns torture, its members are not always opposed to using information obtained by others through it.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Archmage Antonidas was considered a living legend among the mages of Dalaran.\nWhen a mage of the Kirin Tor died, its relatives and those in contact with them received a letter from the organization, asking them to return to Dalaran any correspondence, money, information, or property, in particular any of their books on loan, that belonged to the deceased.\nIn Dalaran they used phosphorescent crystals, which beamed with a steady, constant glow, though a research spoke of reflective mirrors, elemental spirits bound within lanterns, and in one case, huge captive fireflies.\nMages dine in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and it is customary to serve wine with dinner, most often a bottle of &lt;a href=\"flamewine\"&gt;flamewine&lt;/a&gt; for which they have a fondness.\nDespite their busy schedules, most members of the Kirin Tor keep themselves in great shape through a strict diet and a robust exercise regime.\nThe mages seemingly celebrate an event called the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Scribes\"&gt;Feast of Scribes&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them had at least some semblance of order to their archives, with their most valuable tomes hidden away. A favored companion of Kirin Tor magi, the &lt;a href=\"%3AAlbino%20Snake\"&gt;:Albino Snake&lt;/a&gt; makes one wonder whether it's truly a snake or something else altogether.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, there was precious little information on Medivh, but every elder mage in Dalaran seemed to hold Medivh in awe. As befitting his title, the Last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; had amassed a vast collection of writings and artifacts that dwarfs even that of the Kirin Tor. Every scholar of the Kirin Tor said that it was an honor to be introduced to the most powerful mage of Azeroth, and an opportunity, they insisted, that was not to be missed. They also wanted to learn what knowledge he had hidden away in his library, what research he favored, and most of all, when he would form an heir.\nThe Kirin Tor and their &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; were considered as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s for centuries by the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, as they never have been fond of their methods, but who let them continue to exist because they don't practice dark magic and are somewhere necessary. Despite this complicated &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light%23Relations\"&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;, the Church ended up helping Jaina Proudmoore and the Kirin Tor during the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, hunting down the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kirin Tor has a very strict mentality and regulation regarding dark magics, severely punishing those who attempt to practice them in their ranks. Thus, the Kirin Tor makes sure to capture or eliminate the practitioners of dark and unholy magic, but also &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, aberrations, renegade mages, associates of evil organizations, dangerous creatures, and all threats to Dalaran and Azeroth. They use the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the main magically-shielded &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; complex of the organization, to store a number of powerful prisoners, in order to study and prevent them from threatening the world again.\nThe Kirin Tor doctrines frown upon making &lt;a href=\"Homunculus\"&gt;homunculi&lt;/a&gt;, but some understand the principles involved in creating them, one of them being &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nContrary to the teachings of the Kirin Tor, there are a great many who choose to delve into the secrets of magic by themselves. Considered to be non-sanctioned renegades by the Kirin Tor, these &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;rogue mages&lt;/a&gt; strive to expand their knowledge of magic and spellcraft beyond the constraints of what most other wizards believe to be safe or morally acceptable.\nStudies and education.\nThose with an affinity to magic may join the Kirin Tor in Dalaran. The city has magic &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;s where young mages and schoolchildren are trained and educated, the topics for study being &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and its nature.\nThe mentors of the Kirin Tor conclave were ambitious and insatiably curious about magic in all its forms. Their continual accumulation, cataloging, and definition of magic were imprinted on young students at an early age. Before the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Antonidas\"&gt;Archmage Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of teaching in some magic classes. &lt;a href=\"Simeon\"&gt;Simeon&lt;/a&gt; isn't a member of the Kirin Tor, but he dedicated his life to training young mages that would be their future.\nPupils practice and hone their skills and mastery over the types and forms of spells, with demanding and rigorous schedules, and clad in traditional apprentice robes, usually in Dalaran's academies such as &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. A large part of their study is to learn from their grand libraries. Students have dedicated practice chambers in the city, but in case of need, they may practice their spells in other areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; surroundings. They live in students' quarters. Summer was a very intensive time for the students. Dalaran is also a place to learn the history of the world. Students become apprenticed to archmages, typically asking the senior mages to be their mentor. Students are divided by year and level. To prevent apprentices from secretly using &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Familiar\"&gt;elemental familiars&lt;/a&gt; to complete their chores, the archmagi placed the ritual required to summon the creature across the pages of several spellbooks hidden throughout Dalaran. They are also prohibited from using scrying pools to post students of the opposite sex on a pay per view basis.\nAmong the first things learned by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; after becoming apprenticed were that strong emotions and wizardry didn't always mix well and that the worst sin a mage could commit was arrogance, and also the easiest. As a child, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; learned from most of his lessons that &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20wizard\"&gt;non-Dalaran mages&lt;/a&gt;, wild, untrained, and self-taught wizards without restraint, control, and thought, always ended in the same fashion with a bad end, and sometimes, though not often, destroying a large amount of the surrounding countryside with them. He also learned that the stress of the magical energies the magi wield can turn their hair gray, which has happened to many mages in the past. Students are warned about rings of power, magical inscriptions carved into the floor, and are taught about the four rules of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%23The%20laws%20of%20arcane%20magic\"&gt;laws of arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the law of sympathy. Other topics of study are &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt; and their meanings, and &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Members of the Kirin Tor have to know the flora and fauna of Azeroth for a variety of reasons, many of them dealing with survival. Thousands of years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and by the era of the opening of the portal, every wizard studied the legends of the demon horde, better known as the Burning Legion. Most of those who had claimed dealings with them had generally turned out to be of questionable states of mind.\nAbjuration is the most important school for a young mage to study. Its most generalized spell is the mana shield, effective but very difficult for a novice to master, as it often takes months of practice to even conjure a simple mana shield. With time and experience, some magi of the Kirin Tor develop certain abilities, such as the \"sixth sense\" that told them through a feeling of unease that something is \"off\". Or the sensitivity to tell the difference between one mage's magic and another, as every wizard wielded the forces of magic differently, the same to differentiate arcane and demonic magic.\nHistorically, &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s have long been only men, as there was considerable resistance in Dalaran to women taking up the profession in spite of the city's tradition of training &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es and female &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;s. No Kirin Tor sanctioned female wizards appeared to have existed prior to 800 years ago, when &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. It has been difficult for &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to become wizards, as she even faced considerable obstacles in her ambition to be more than a mere sorceress. Fortunately for her, she was able to convince &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; to care more for her magical talent than her gender, and she became a fully qualified wizard in record time. In recent years, these restrictions are no longer present, as more women &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Wizard\"&gt;wizards&lt;/a&gt; were formed, and are now present in the ranks of the Kirin Tor.\nAt the Violet Citadel, an order of mages, the former students of the fallen Conjurers of Azeroth, has been forced to discover untapped magical forces to command in their war against the ruthless orcs. Determined to avoid a similar fate, these mages have undertaken a regimen equally demanding on body and soul, thus dedicating themselves to the command of more aggressive and destructive magiks.\nGenerally, outsiders were not welcome to study, but some expectations could be made, such as was the case with Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who convinced his father and Archmage Antonidas that the Kirin Tor's knowledge was valuable for him as future king.\nPhilosophy, research, and inventions.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the philosophical question that the mages were arguing about in the halls of the Kirin Tor was whether when you created a flame by magic, you called it into being or summoned it from some parallel existence. To which &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; replied that when a mage creates fire, all they do is concentrating the inherent nature of the fire contained in the surrounding area into one location in order to call it into being.\nAccording to Medivh, the philosophical debates in the halls of the Kirin Tor were buffle and blow, as they seek to place rationality upon the world and regulate its motions, like when the seasons fall one after the other with lockstepped regularity, except that magic is precisely the art of circumventing the normal.\nThe Kirin Tor possesses an (or was the) Advanced Research and Illumination Sect, which &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; joined very young.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; excelled at magical research and investigation.\nThe Kirin Tor have divided the eldritch arts into eight or nine different &lt;a href=\"Arcane%23Schools%20of%20arcane%20magic\"&gt;categories&lt;/a&gt;. All schools of magic can be combined to create formidable spells that utilize multiple sources of power. Mages are cautioned about the dangers of combining multiple types of magic. There are also multiple spells and branches of arcane research forbidden to members of the Kirin Tor.\nThey also contributed to the creation of spells, such as the slow spell as the Kirin Tor developed a technique that envelops a person in a field that reduces kinetic energy. The mages also discovered a way to bring out the potential of the warrior's fighting spirit and essentially wreathe them in their own spiritual energies in the spell inner fire. This has had the overall effect of making the Alliance warriors more resistant to damage and better able to deal damage.\nResearching into banned fields of magic such as &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; magic is expressly forbidden by laws almost as old as the Kirin Tor itself. Necromancy is highly illegal and should be avoided at all costs. They only discussed having a basic understanding of its use, as any practitioner of necromancy is the enemy of the Kirin Tor. Those who persist are censored, stripped of their power and influence, and banned from the kingdom, as was the case with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Levia%20Laurence\"&gt;Levia Laurence&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad eventually considered Kirin Tor to be set in their archaic ways.\n&lt;a href=\"Time%23Arcane%20magic\"&gt;Chronomancy&lt;/a&gt;, or time &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, is a young field of research for the Kirin Tor. \nThe official teachings in the Violet Citadel and the Kirin Tor are that &lt;a href=\"Demonology%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demonology&lt;/a&gt; is to be eschewed, avoided, and abjured. Any attempt to summon demons is to be found out and stopped at once, and those involved are to be expelled, or worse. Just as the possession of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-inscribed tomes of demonic spells must be punished, and the books confiscated, as they are considered &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, &lt;a href=\"Guzbah\"&gt;Guzbah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korrigan\"&gt;Korrigan&lt;/a&gt; researched demon lore and demon worshipers respectively. What the Kirin Tor originally had at their disposal was a collection of folk legends and the reports of the local authorities involving demon worshipers. Even during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor's knowledge of demonic forces was limited. In all of the Kirin Tor's research into succubi and other &lt;a href=\"sayaad\"&gt;sayaad&lt;/a&gt;, they have come to one conclusion - they are not to be trusted.\nMembers of the Kirin Tor also researched &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elven history&lt;/a&gt;, or weapons, and some of the mages or the city's artisans deal with &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=\"Deucus%20Valdera\"&gt;Deucus Valdera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Egan\"&gt;Patricia Egan&lt;/a&gt; research and learn new alchemy recipes together, and then sell them.\nOther fields of research are other-worldly &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt; and beings done by &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt;, as well as research on &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and seemingly on &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;-related artifacts such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Artifacts\"&gt;Bloodstone Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; joked that there was not much documentation on &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s as most of the researchers got eaten. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; laughed and said that there might be some truth to that. The mage &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; was their resident expert on dragon lore. Seemingly, he didn't reveal to Antonidas his identity, and instead he called this knowledge his research.\nAs a result, the Kirin Tor has written several publications related to magic, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic\"&gt;The Schools of Arcane Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Monthly\"&gt;Kirin Tor Monthly&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%23Authorship\"&gt;various books and reports&lt;/a&gt; by Antonidas or &lt;a href=\"Khadgar%23Authorship\"&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; by Khadgar. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, they have access to knowledge none could guess at, and it has saved Azeroth more than once.\nTo ensure safe and fast teleportations with the &lt;a href=\"%3Ablink\"&gt;:blink&lt;/a&gt;, specific rules and boundaries were created by the Kirin Tor, and must be adhered at all times, while immense resources of the organization were being spent to perfect this already nearly flawless spell to avoid any other accident. Other regulations were also created by the Kirin Tor for &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;polymorphism&lt;/a&gt;, or the use of &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt;, with notably dimensions to be respected, taxes to be paid, and permits to be obtained.\nDalaran - especially the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn%27s%20Gallery\"&gt;Aegwynn's Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; - holds libraries, archives, and research laboratories, the latter's library being capable on its own to rival with &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;'s even in its current disarray. There are also a few private libraries and secret collections. Among these collections, some of the rarer parchments need to be protected from sunlight, thus requiring reading them in rooms while wearing gloves, in order to not damage the fragile paper. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the great libraries were burned, and countless generations of knowledge had been lost, but with the restoration of Dalaran, the libraries too were restored. Currently, the main library from before the city's destruction still stands, and it uses protective wards. A recognition spell in order to enter it safely is used on the wards, and each mage who consigned a book to the great library put his or her own warding seal on it.\nThe mages of Dalaran created &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s to perform manual labor and guard their mystical holdings. They also created the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to focus their magics in an effort of reconstruction. To control &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, the wizards of Dalaran may use magical stone tokens.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage%20tower\"&gt;Mage tower&lt;/a&gt;s hold ominous secrets that none but the mages of Lordaeron dare to explore. As extensions of the Violet Citadel in Dalaran, these towers allow the mages to research arcane spells, unfettered by the affairs of the temporal plane.\nThe Kirin Tor also contributed to the Alliance by donating materials for &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Altars of Kings&lt;/a&gt; that harness the derelict life forces of fallen human champions. The specifics of this building's magical properties were among the most guarded secrets in all the human realms.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor intended to study a &lt;a href=\"%3ALey%20Line%20Tuner\"&gt;:Ley Line Tuner&lt;/a&gt; to combat Malygos, an &lt;a href=\"%3AArtifact%20from%20the%20Nathrezim%20Homeworld\"&gt;:Artifact from the Nathrezim Homeworld&lt;/a&gt; to gain a better understanding of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Curse%20of%20Flesh%20Disc\"&gt;:The Curse of Flesh Disc&lt;/a&gt; to learn about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowerful mages of the Kirin Tor who wield as much power as Archmage Rhonin, former leader of the Kirin Tor, often use arcane bindings to steady the magic unleashing from their fingertips.\nKirin Tor also have portal crystals at their disposal.\nReputation.\nAside from &lt;a href=\"championing\"&gt;championing&lt;/a&gt;, Kirin Tor reputation can also be gained by completing Dungeon and Heroic Dungeon dailies, and Dalaran (&lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest%23Cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest%23Jewelcrafting%20Quests\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest%23Fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;) dailies.\nIn \"\", reputation can also be gained by completing Kirin Tor &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMost classes start at a standing with the Kirin Tor. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, however, automatically start at level with them. Because of this, it is possible for a mage to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Tabard of the Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; at level 1.\nWhen you reach &lt;a href=\"exalted\"&gt;exalted&lt;/a&gt; status with the Kirin Tor, the achievement &lt;a href=\"The%20Kirin%20Tor%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;The Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; is awarded.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Kirin Tor is a &lt;a href=\"lawful%20neutral\"&gt;lawful neutral&lt;/a&gt; and independant organization, although they (and many of its members, both past and present) has strong ties to the Alliance. Made up of 120 members, divided in several levels of importance and influence, the Kirin Tor is a sect of wizards trying to study and record all of humanity's magic, and determined to rebuild the fallen city of Dalaran.\nHistory.\nLong ago, most wizards lived in Strom, where things were difficult, and so some of them fled north, where they created the city of Dalaran with the help of the high elves. More wizards followed, and the city became a haven for magi and a center of arcane study. They used their arts to make Dalaran magnificent and to protect it and its more mundane residents, who in return provided basics like food and trade. Unfortunately, with nobody to control them the magi cast spells whenever they liked, and the constant magic tore at reality. These tears acted as beacons to the Burning Legion, luring them back to Azeroth. Demons slipped through the gaps, terrorizing the locals until the ruling Magocrats were forced to turn to the elves for aid. Elf wizards quickly realized what had happened and warned that humanity would have to give up magic to avoid the threat completely. The Magocrats didn't like that, and instead proposed selecting a mortal champion to protect them from the Legion. This Guardian would have access to all their might, and would form a secret defense for the world. The elves agreed and, through the newly formed Order of Tirisfal, provided guidance in the selection. At the same time, the Magocrats set some of their number to research and catalog all human magic. These wizards became the Kirin Tor.\nEven the Kirin Tor, however, found itself powerless to stop Prince Arthas and his forces when he led the Scourge through Lordaeron. Arthas acquired the spellbook of Medivh and Kel'Thuzad used it to summon Archimonde, who destroyed Dalaran. The city was left in ruins. Some felt the devastation was well-deserved, since Kel'Thuzad had himself been one of the Kirin Tor (before he left to form the Scholomance). Since Kel'Thuzad was responsible for creating the Plague of Undeath and releasing the Scourge upon the world, many felt the Kirin Tor should share in the blame and the consequences.\nFollowing the Third War, they were able to reclaim their city. They erected a glowing dome around the entire city, powerful enough to destroy anyone who touches it, while they worked to rebuild their fallen city.\nOrganization.\nThe Kirin Tor has a ruling council of six archmagi. The council meets to discuss important issues and vote on matters \u2014 no single member holds sway, and the majority vote decides every issue. In case of a tie, the members reconvene a day later, during which interval each member considers his or her vote and all relevant information.\nBeneath the ruling council are the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmagi&lt;/a&gt;, each of whom is given tasks as the council sees fit. Archmagi do not hold specific positions or responsibilities, beyond the general loyalty to the Kirin Tor and to the world, and the standing obligation to study new human magic whenever it appears. In reality, however, some archmagi have been given the same tasks so often they have essentially assumed responsibility for those jobs. Thus one archmage might be in charge of cataloging all wands, while another handles researching and cataloging all illusions. Several of them work to monitor and maintain the city's protective dome.\nMagi are the lowest members of the Kirin Tor and answer to the archmagi. Any archmage in the sect can issue orders to a mage, provided the instructions still fit within the organization's goals. As with archmagi, however, most magi settle into specific positions and tasks and work exclusively for one archmage. The ruling council can change this at any time but rarely does so, unless they feel a mage has become a problem in his current position, or if they need him for a different task. Most magi are allowed the freedom to pursue their tasks and studies in whatever manner they choose. Despite the fact that they are the lowest members in the hierarchy, many magi possess great power.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; came, any human mage was welcome in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. They found peers and a place to stay and to work in peace. Magi with an eye for detail and a strong focus on research were offered membership in the Kirin Tor. This process could take anywhere from a few months to several years \u2014 the ruling council did not invite magi until it was sure of their abilities and allegiances. The Kirin Tor became even more cautious about admittance after &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; defected and took many other magi with him.\nLocations.\nBefore Dalaran's destruction, the Kirin Tor was the city's ruling power. Dalaran was not a large city, but it was a beautiful place of towering spires and glittering streets, and the people there were happy and well protected. The Kirin Tor's headquarters was the Violet Citadel, an impressive building so named for its stone walls which gave off a faint violet light. The building had many libraries, research chambers, testing rooms, classrooms, meeting alcoves, and bedrooms. The ruling council, six members in all, met in the Chamber of the Air, a room with no visible walls \u2014 the gray stone floor with its central diamond symbol stood beneath an open sky that shifted and changed rapidly, as if the time sped past within the chamber."}

He is slightly wary of outsiders but is a skilled &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; describes him as being hard to keep track of, as he is \"always on the move, always working on some big plan\". &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; initially considers him to be overly passive in the face of sethrak aggression, but Kiro himself urges &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s not to mistake his caution for hesitance. He states that he will defend the vulpera with his dying breath, but just \"prefer[s] to avoid taking that breath today\". Kiro values practicality, as shown when he told Meerah not to keep a journal she had found, because it had no use and would just take up space in their wagon.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Kiro and his people joined the Horde and sometime later was given a spot on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\n&lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, one of the members of Kiro's caravan, warned him that the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; would eventually attack and that the vulpera needed to make a preemptive strike against the snakemen, but Kiro insisted that they instead keep their heads down and continue to quietly do business. Eventually, Nisha was proven right when the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Burrows\"&gt;Abandoned Burrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter escaping from the Abandoned Burrows, Nisha and a recently arrived &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; travel to Vulpera Hideaway to find Kiro tending to the adventurer's wounded friend &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt; after she was found by &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Kiro and Meerah, the adventurer heals Kaja. Kiro offers to help the adventurer and Kaja in their search for the missing &lt;a href=\"Warguard%20Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt; if they help the vulpera in turn, and sends the hero to retrieve some stolen knickknacks from the Faithless at the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Maw\"&gt;Serpent's Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, Kaja, Meerah, and the adventurer leave the Hideaway and travel south to search for Rakera. After finding the warguard, the group continues to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;, where they encounter Kiro and Nisha along with &lt;a href=\"Julwaba\"&gt;Julwaba&lt;/a&gt; and her sethrak friend &lt;a href=\"Serrik\"&gt;Serrik&lt;/a&gt;, who is dying from &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; venom. Nisha explains that she and Kiro are merely passing through Zul'Ahjin on their way to the Faithless empire. Kiro offers to help heal the sethrak and sends the adventurer to gather ingredients for an antivenom that succeeds in saving Serrik's life.\nKiro and Nisha, along with Meerah and other vulpera, later continue to the Faithless' stronghold in the north to take the fight directly to the sethrak. Kiro and Nisha work to rescue vulpera slaves while Meerah organizes caravans to carry them to safety. Some time later, the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; join up with them. After the hero helps Nisha free vulpera slaves in the &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Crater of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;, Kiro sneaks off to the Faithless' &lt;a href=\"Feeding%20Pits%20%28Vol%27dun%29\"&gt;Feeding Pits&lt;/a&gt; to continue sabotaging the sethrak behind the front lines. While Kiro himself sabotages the Faithless cannons on the upper levels of the compound, the adventurer travels through the &lt;a href=\"Slithering%20Gulch\"&gt;Slithering Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and sets fire to the sethrak slave markets on their way to the beast pens. Once at the Feeding Pits, Kiro sends the champion to take out the Faithless' &lt;a href=\"krolusk\"&gt;krolusk&lt;/a&gt; tamers and unleash a stampede of &lt;a href=\"crawg\"&gt;crawg&lt;/a&gt;s by killing &lt;a href=\"Crawg%20Tamer%20Traskniss\"&gt;Crawg Tamer Traskniss&lt;/a&gt;. Kiro and the adventurer then ride back to the other vulpera at &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Vorrik's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; using a stolen &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Krolusk\"&gt;Battle Krolusk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Faithless emperor &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; is ultimately defeated, Kiro can be found back at the Vulpera Hideaway with Meerah and Nisha. He tells the adventurer that they have proven themselves a true ally to the vulpera and that they will always be welcome in the caravan.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s death in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Kiro attended the king's funeral in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. He expressed disbelief at the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s actions and stated that the vulpera would do what they could to help the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was present in &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation.\nJoining the Horde.\nThe vulpera eventually decided to join the Horde in order to explore the world beyond Vol'dun. Kiro traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; alongside Meerah and Nisha to speak with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of his people, but Baine was forced to decline giving them membership as troubles facing the Horde's current allies had stretched the faction's resources thin. The vulpera decided to offer their help, with Kiro sending Nisha and Meerah to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; respectively while he and his mount &lt;a href=\"Sasha%20%28hyena%29\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to help with work on an outpost near &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the Horde adventurer, Kiro found that the Horde's &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014led by &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Magrok\"&gt;Foreman Magrok&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were revolting and refusing to work on the outpost due to poor treatment by the Horde. To appease them, Kiro decided to arrange a feast and sent the adventurer to gather meat from the nearby wildlife, collect ore so he could repair the workers' broken tools, and give promotions to some of the peons to help build confidence. Once the feast was underway at Crushblow, Kiro sent the adventurer to challenge and defeat Foreman Magrok to ensure there would be no further revolts. With the peons now back to work, Kiro headed back to Orgrimmar. Once Meerah and Nisha completed their tasks as well, Baine realized that he had been wrong to dismiss the vulpera so quickly and offered them a place in the Horde, which Kiro gladly accepted. As a member of the Horde, Kiro can subsequently be found in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; next to Meerah, Nisha, and &lt;a href=\"Nilsa\"&gt;Nilsa&lt;/a&gt;, playing his flute.\nKiro later had &lt;a href=\"Hagashi\"&gt;Hagashi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; at the Vulpera Hideaway, put together a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Vulpera\"&gt;small memento&lt;/a&gt; to give to &lt;a href=\"Vulpera%20%28playable%29\"&gt;vulpera adventurers&lt;/a&gt; in appreciation of their efforts to prove their people's worth to the Horde.\nShadows Rising.\nHaving joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, Kiro was present at a council meeting when an assassination attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally. He was not present at the meeting that sent &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. Declaring that Zandalar was still &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;their home&lt;/a&gt; and that it should be healed from the treachery within, Kiro voiced support for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nSince Kiro is a healer, can be seen wielding a hammer and shield during the campaign against the Faithless, and owns at least one &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;, he is most likely a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;."}

Responsible for many of the atrocities during Krastinov's rule over Scholomance, Kirtonos fed on the blood of his innocent victims. To appease his master, Doctor Krastinov had to provide the gargoyle with more and more blood.\nIn later days, Kirtonos was a rare visitor to Scholomance. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Innocents\"&gt;Blood of Innocents&lt;/a&gt; was not easy to obtain around &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; now that most of its inhabitants were dead. Only the ghosts remained, plotting the gargoyle's demise. \nStrategy.\nKirtonos the Herald is an optional boss that needs to be summoned in the small alcove near &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoning%20Room\"&gt;The Summoning Room&lt;/a&gt;. There is a brazier that requires the use of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Innocents\"&gt;Blood of Innocents&lt;/a&gt; (be sure no one is outside the gate at the top of the stairs when you use the blood \u2014 the gate shuts). Kirtonos will fly through the window, transform to his humanoid form, and engage you.\nTank him at the top of the stairs. He has a knockback attack and if he sends you out the window, you will zone out of the instance.\nNotes.\nOn the way to the Stratholme Live side, after clearing the gate trap, you will see a sign in front of you at the fork in the road. This sign reads &lt;a href=\"Kirtonos%20Bros.%20Funeral%20Home\"&gt;Kirtonos Bros. Funeral Home&lt;/a&gt;. It is speculated that Kirtonos once lived in Stratholme before the war. \nHow or if this is connected to his vampirism is unclear. Although, if he has always been a gargoyle, it probably is not connected to him. It is possible however that, being a funeral parlor, Kirtonos fed on the blood of the deceased, as his business dealt with them."}

Surviving the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, she was kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt;, but managed to escape on her own. She then decided to live in peace in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHer clutch was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; had gone mad during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and delivered to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and later to the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, she opposed her brother Arygos and Malygos and sided with those who opposed the Blue Aspect's war. Shortly before the war ended, her mate &lt;a href=\"Jarygos\"&gt;Jarygos&lt;/a&gt; was killed and Kirygosa went missing, believing she fell in a battle.\nIn fact, Kirygosa was kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; shortly before she was to lay her first clutch of eggs. The cult experimented on her unhatched children, continuing &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s research into the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; forced her to witness the attack on &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and was held captive there. She was planned to be forced to mate with &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, the five-headed dragon deciding that the child of an Aspect would be strong enough to bear living chromatic offspring. Before this happened, however, she was able to escape and returned back to her flight and told everything she learned about the cult as well as of the betrayal of Arygos to &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. When the temple was liberated, Kirygosa searched the cultists' bodies but the body of the Twilight Father was not among them.\nTides of War.\nKirygosa was one of the few remaining dragons at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. When a group of dragons escorting the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; to a safe location were murdered, Kiry, alongside &lt;a href=\"Alagosa\"&gt;Alagosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banagos\"&gt;Banagos&lt;/a&gt;, investigated the sight before &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; flew off to chase the artifact down. She was left to be the voice of Kalec in the Nexus while he was gone.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the Focusing Iris vanished again and Kalec returned home, defeated. Kalec told her what had happened and Kiry believed that there was a distinct possibility the Iris was taken this time by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Kalecgos returned yet again, Kirygosa told Kalecgos that there were only a handful of the blue dragons who still stayed behind at the Nexus. When Kalec asked her what she would do without anything holding her back, Kiry responded that she would go see places where the oceans didn't have ice, and where the winds weren't cold. Kalecgos disbanded the blue dragonflight then, and Kirygosa told him that if she was ever needed, to look for her in tropical climates. As of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Kirygosa was living quietly in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, enjoying a permanent summer.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, Kirygosa has left Stranglethorn Vale and moved to &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. She has befriended the people of the town and even has her own little home. She dances and shoots magical balls, to the entertainment of several &lt;a href=\"Village%20Cub\"&gt;Village Cub&lt;/a&gt;s. She enjoys the Jade Forest's lack of frost and snow as well as its warm winds. When Kalecgos asked her to join the reforming blue dragonflight on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Kiry declined because she was truly happy in Dawn's Blossom.\nAlternate timeline.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; where Kalecgos and Go'el were unable to stop Jaina Proudmoore from destroying Orgrimmar, Kirygosa and almost the entirety of the blue dragonflight were killed in a following war, leaving just Kalecgos alive but mad.\nQuotes.\nThough the village is small, we take great pride in our crafts and cherish our relationships with each other.\nMail.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"Blue%20is%20My%20Favorite%20Color\"&gt;Blue is My Favorite Color&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer receives the following mail from Kirygosa.\nThe mail also contains a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Kirygosa\"&gt;Letter from Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;."}

Alongside &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, it was freed from its &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; prison by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Keeper Loken&lt;/a&gt; and sent to battle &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Keeper Tyr&lt;/a&gt; after the latter stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Zakajz, Kith'ix survived the battle with Tyr and came to rest near the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It was reawakened thousands of years later and rallied the insectoid &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; into founding the empire of &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;waging war&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, until it was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the spot where the city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; was later built.\nBiography.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Kith'ix and &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; served as the empire's most ruthless and cunning C'Thraxxi generals. When the empire fell, they and other &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; were sealed away in underground chambers by the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, the traitorous keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; unearthed the tombs of Kith'ix and Zakajz and sent them to slay Tyr and reclaim the discs. Sensing &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s influence on Loken's mind, the two readily obeyed the keeper. Kith'ix and Zakazj overtook Tyr and his allies in the lands that would become the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing for his allies' lives, Tyr chose to hold off the C'Thraxxi alone so his companions could escape. The C'Thraxxi grappled with Tyr for six days and nights, torrents of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; energy ripping through the glade. In the end, Tyr sacrificed all of his remaining power and life force in a blinding explosion of arcane energy that killed Zakajz and nearly killed Kith'ix. Despite being gravely wounded, Kith'ix survived and blindly fled southwest before collapsing at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and falling into a deep hibernation. Reeling from its presence, the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting the area buried Kith'ix beneath the earth so that no other creature would disturb it.\nKith'ix's resting place, which appeared as a small mound of blackened stone, was forbidden by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;. The loa warned the tribes' mystics of severe consequences should they disturb the black stones. Though it remained undisturbed for thousands of years, eventually the sentient dagger &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; led the troll &lt;a href=\"Zan%27do\"&gt;Zan'do&lt;/a&gt; and his followers to the forbidden mound, where they discovered that it was not rock but the hide of some monstrous creature. Believing it to be an undiscovered loa so powerful that the other spirits were afraid of it, they performed profane rituals\u2014offering blood sacrifices and plunging Xal'atath into its hide\u2014to awaken the C'Thraxxi general from his slumber. Kith'ix brutally slaughtered the trolls in recompense.\nKnowing it would please the Old Gods to see the trolls' civilization annihilated, Kith'ix reached out with his mind and found the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, who had hidden deep underground since the fall of the Black Empire. The C'Thrax rallied the insectoid swarms to reclaim the surface of Azeroth once more. As both Kith'ix and the aqir expanded their power, they constructed a vast subterranean empire known as &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;. When Kith'ix judged their strength sufficient, he led them out of their tunnels to sweep across the land. Though the trolls were formidable foes, the aqir were unlike anything they had ever faced. Many smaller tribes were completely consumed by the swarms. Kith'ix himself proved an extremely powerful foe as well, unleashing the dark powers of Xal'atath upon the trolls. However, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; rallied the tribes against this new foe and summoned the loa to fight by their side, tearing through the aqiri ranks and even wounding Kith'ix.\nThe aqir were forced to retreat and the gravely wounded Kith'ix fled to the northeast with its closest aqiri followers to regain its strength while the rest of the insectoids continued the war against the trolls. Unwilling to leave their enemies unchecked, the Zandalari sent the most ambitious tribes to hunt down the aqir and establish new strongholds across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; tracked Kith'ix's trail far to the northeastern woodlands, cutting through an unending mass of aqiri guardians. In a final battle, the entire tribe launched a suicidal attack on Kith'ix and its remaining minions. Only a tiny fraction of the Amani survived, but the C'Thrax succumbed to its hunters. Atop the site where they had killed Kith'ix, the trolls established a settlement which would one day grow into the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. With the C'Thrax gone, the aqir no longer fought with as much ferocity and the war\u2014which continued for several more centuries\u2014shifted dramatically in the trolls' favor."}

{"id": "14585", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14585", "title": "Kiting", "text": "Kiting is the act of running away from an enemy while staying in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; with them. It may involve staying out of &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; range while delivering damage, or it can mean luring an enemy to another location on purpose. When used as a damage tactic, kiting is best suited to &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es who deal most of their damage from range and are weak in &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; range. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and ranged &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s frequently rely on it.\nKiting is mostly used to allow the player to defeat the enemy without allowing them to get close enough for the player to take melee damage. In this form it is only useful against targets that are at least primarily melee types; ranged types can often still deal a substantial amount of damage while being kited, especially if the player and their target's maximum range is the same. Since kiting usually reduces a player's damage output, it is only useful for this purpose when the enemy's damage output is reduced by an even larger amount. Since many ranged attacks can only be used while stationary, &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;s can be extremely useful for this type of kiting.\nKiting can also be used for the purpose of moving a target to a more desirable location. This can be because of incoming additional enemies; the desire to move the enemy to where allies can assist you in defeating them; or more specific positional requirements of many PvE boss encounters. For high-health targets such as outdoor bosses, kiting can often be used to lead the mob to significant distances. One popular example of this is the drawing of a world boss to a crowded location such as &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, where other players are often encouraged to join in attacking it. This can be used to enable the kiting player to defeat the target, or simply for the purpose of wreaking large amounts of havoc. World of Warcraft has a history of players kiting bosses in this way.\nKiting relies on a target's desire to remain within a certain range of the player; if the player removes themselves beyond this range, the target will usually attempt to follow. Mobs will only continue to follow the player for a few seconds after the player last dealt damage to them; the player must therefore regularly deal damage to the mob in order to prevent it from resetting, and running back to its previous position. Some, such as &lt;a href=\"rare%20mob\"&gt;rare mob&lt;/a&gt;s, may have specific boundaries to prevent them from being kited beyond certain areas. Kiting a player requires merely that the attention of the target is kept focused on the kiting player.\nThe term comes from the fact that the player character is pulling along a trailing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; in the same manner a person flies a kite.\nCaster kiting.\nNotes:\nHunter kiting.\nJump-kiting.\nNote: This is quite a challenging technique, so it takes some time before you can perform it smoothly.\nSkirmish kiting.\nMuch easier is to simply run sideways ... that way the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; will remain \"in front\" of you, even though you are running away from them. This is because \"in front\" is defined as a full 180\u00b0 arc.\nAdditionally, the hunter can drop a &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt; if the mob looks to be gaining ground.\nKiting in instances.\nSome instances have mobs that cannot be crowd controlled. It is better if the tank can double tank the mobs or if the group has an off-tank to handle one. However, if both options are not feasible, a skillful hunter (sometimes mage) is the best at kiting one of the mobs. Nevertheless, given the limited space inside instances, as well as the importance of keeping aggro of the kited mob so that it will not turn to your healer, kiting in instance is much harder than in an open area."}

The Paragons have been given their own chamber within the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; and will stand against anyone who dares enter Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, where the revived heart was moved.\nWhile 'Klaxxi' is the correct term for the organization in general or as a whole, 'Klaxxi'va' appears to be both the descriptive term and title for individual members of the Klaxxi.\nBackground.\nA council of mantid elders known as the Klaxxi are the stewards of mantid history and culture, and their goals are much more long-term than those of the empress. These mantid elders are untouched by the corruption and insanity that has overtaken the remainder of the mantid swarm. They seek to replace the corrupted empress. They recognize that the empress has lost her mind and that swarming Pandaria will mean little if their entire civilization is given over to the sha in the process. Although they are initially reluctant to accept the aid of outsiders, they eventually embrace the player's role as the substitute \"Wakener\", granting access to their unique arms and armor.\nAlthough the Klaxxi are wise and powerful, there aren't very many of them. But they do have access to the &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;s: mantid champions from past eras who were preserved in amber at the height of their strength and buried all over the Dread Wastes. Some of them are war masters, others are ingenious alchemists or master assassins. The Klaxxi can sense the presence of their paragons, and are able to communicate with them over great distances. The Klaxxi are usually also responsible for giving paragons their second names.\nAs an institution, the Klaxxi is an ancient organization that possibly began as a priesthood of some sort, dedicated to the Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. In the mantid's old tongue, \"klaxxi\" meant \"priest\".\nThe Klaxxi ride massive &lt;a href=\"Amber%20scorpion\"&gt;scorpions&lt;/a&gt; into battle against their enemies. A carapace hardened by amber provides superior protection while on the battlefield.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Kil%27ruk%20the%20Wind-Reaver\"&gt;Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver&lt;/a&gt; once promised, when the Old Gods - specifically &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; - returned, the mantid pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen Klaxxi'va were revived and empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"These Mantid Elders are untouched by the corruption and insanity that has overtaken the remainder of the Mantid Swarm. They seek to work with the races of Pandaria to restore their Queen to glory.\"\nGuide.\nReputation with the Klaxxi is gained via normal questing through the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. Completing the main Klaxxi storyline will get adventurers up to . After that, seven daily quests each worth 130 rep are offered each day. Getting to will unlock two additional daily quests.\nAdditionally, adventurers can collect &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Amber%20Shards\"&gt;Dread Amber Shards&lt;/a&gt;, which are a rare zone drop from any mob in the Dread Wastes. will collect 5 in the repeatable reputation quest &lt;a href=\"Seeds%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Seeds of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, which rewards 250 rep.\nDaily quests.\nKlaxxi dailies are focused around a particular hub each day. Some hubs have \"hidden\" dailies, which start by killing an otherwise unremarkable elite NPC in the area.\nAugments.\nAs Klaxxi paragons are wakened, they can be asked to provide adventurers a buff while questing in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. Only one enhancement and one augment may be active at a time.\n\u00b1 Upon reaching exalted with the Klaxxi and doing the final quest chain, Malik is no longer available to give this buff. It is given by his &lt;a href=\"Halberd%20of%20the%20Unscathed\"&gt;Halberd of the Unscathed&lt;/a&gt;, located on the weapon rack behind &lt;a href=\"Ambersmith%20Zikk\"&gt;Ambersmith Zikk&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; is all about the Klaxxi. The quest flow blends \"level-up\" quest progression with a daily reputation grind, so you begin working with the Klaxxi and earning rep almost immediately after setting foot in the zone. Your progression through the one-shot quests yields direct benefits to the eventual daily experience, and your progression into the higher rep levels through dailies will in turn open up more one-shot story quests. \nWhen you first arrive in Dread Wastes, you stumble upon a &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;, , and wake him up \u2013 he then introduces you to the council, and they allow you to continue waking up paragons to help build their forces. These paragons become your daily questgivers, so as you're waking them up you\u2019re also unlocking more dailies. They also provide you with buffs that let you do things like mind control enemies or double-jump while in the Dread Wastes.\nOnce players become with the Klaxxi, they can start a short quest chain that starts with &lt;a href=\"The%20Empress%27%20Gambit\"&gt;The Empress' Gambit&lt;/a&gt;, which in the end rewards &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20the%20Empire%23Rewards\"&gt;an epic ring&lt;/a&gt; (item level 489).\nQuotes.\nSeveral Paragons carry on conversations with each other once they make it back to Klaxxi'vess:"}

She is described as slight with a shock of short green hair.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; began to push through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sent Teshara to recall the night elven fleet, which was at the time en route to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. Teshara reached &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt;'s ship in &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;storm crow&lt;/a&gt; form and delivered the dire news, then \u2014 on Shandris' orders \u2014 prepared to inform the ships farther behind in the fleet, despite heir exhaustion. Shandris told Teshara that she might have saved her people by delivering the message, and the young druid brightened. Days later, Teshara returned to Malfurion near the border with &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to report that the fleet had arrived, and moments later her words were confirmed when the fleet began to bombard the Horde forces on the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to retreat to the forest. Teshara was eager to attack them on the beach, but Shandris informed her that it was better to wait, since not all of the kaldorei ships had arrived and the elves did not have the numbers for direct combat. Hours later, Teshara scouted a large number of Horde soldiers who had been sent to search for a way into Darkshore through &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;'s mountains.\nHowever, the tide quickly turned when the Horde began boarding and bombarding the night elven ships with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; projectiles while other forces found a path into Darkshore to begin attacking the night elves from behind. Malfurion gave Teshara a letter to deliver to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Teshara protested that she wanted to fight, but Malfurion replied that she would best serve by obeying his orders. Teshara briefly knelt, said it had been an honor to serve the &lt;a href=\"shan%27do\"&gt;shan'do&lt;/a&gt;, then shifted into storm crow form and flew off to obey. Shortly after, she arrived in Stormwind, delivered a note to &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and burst into tears as she delivered Malfurion's letter to Tyrande."}

{"id": "280800", "revid": "1026360", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=280800", "title": "Tess Greymane", "text": "Queen Tess Greymane is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20family\"&gt;Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. Following to her &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Tess became heir to the throne of the kingdom of Gilneas. With Liam gone, Tess is searching for answers to questions she never thought she would ask. After the successful reclamation of their kingdom, Genn bestowed the throne to Tess, officially becoming the Queen of Gilneas.\nHistory.\nChildhood.\nTess' life was saved by a potion made by &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;; if not for him, she would have died soon after she was born. When she was a little girl, her father told her that she was to find one beautiful thing every day and that it would make the hard days easier.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the town of &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, Tess ventured up to her father's observatory with a single &lt;a href=\"%3Apeacebloom\"&gt;:peacebloom&lt;/a&gt; flower. She reminded Genn the words he would tell Tess as a girl. Even among the ruined Gilneas, she was able to find an unharmed peacebloom, and it gave her hope.\nLord of His Pack.\nDuring the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Tess and her mother, &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, were aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Radiance\"&gt;Elune's Radiance&lt;/a&gt;\" while her father was on another ship. The fleet was hit by a powerful storm generated by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the ship started to sink. Having a leg broken during the storm, Mia could not move and Tess remained with her refusing to leave, so they both risked to drown. Genn, refusing to lose the last two members of his family, assumed the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; form and joined the rescue efforts of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; sailors from his ship. After the storm, both the women reached &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; safely. Tess' whereabouts until Legion were unknown, but it is possible that she followed her father to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Tess appears on the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; that brings adventurers and other wounded back to Stormwind. If the player chooses to take the optional offered Gryphon ride to Stormwind Keep, she and &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; will escort them on their own gryphons, conversing on the way. When flying to Stormwind Keep, Princess Tess Greymane confided to Lorna her concern about the lust for vengeance consuming her father. Lorna states that all Gilneans suffer from that rage, her father more than most. Though Tess concurs with Lorna, she fears more deaths are sure to come. Lorna grimly replies that such is the cost of vengeance and that Gilneas has waited for it long enough. When arriving at Stormwind Keep, Tess tells the adventurer to give King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; their condolences for the death of his father &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The two quickly return to the gunship once the player lands, as they are needed back at the ship. While Tess is dressed in armor for this appearance, it's unknown if she actually had a military role, or if it is due to formal reasons.\nNow one of &lt;a href=\"The%20Uncrowned\"&gt;The Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, Tess is within the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in the secret &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. She sends the newest Shadow of the Uncrowned after &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, who has gone to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate members of a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nShe appears, without her armor, in Stormwind whenever an alliance player reaches the requirements for Prestige rank 2, alongside Lord &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, to honor the player for their service to the Alliance.\nLegionfall.\nThe Uncrowned receive word of a large cave at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; where the Legion is plotting against the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, and together Tess and &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Admiral%20Tethys\"&gt;Fleet Admiral Tethys&lt;/a&gt; formulate a plan to stop them. With &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-infused gun powder taken from the &lt;a href=\"Blacksail%20Crew\"&gt;Blacksail Crew&lt;/a&gt;, Tess and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadowblade&lt;/a&gt; sneak their way into the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Temple\"&gt;Lost Temple&lt;/a&gt; and blow the cave up. Afterwards, Tess explains that she has not yet pledged service to the Shadowblade because, while all rogues step into the shadows, it had been especially important that her status remains truly secret. But with the Legion's threat too great, Tess wants to have a greater role in taking them down.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; returned from his trip from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, he had dinner with Genn in Stormwind. During the conversation, Genn urged Anduin to search for a queen to bear him a successor and suggested his own daughter, since Tess was close to Anduin's age and not some complete stranger. However, Anduin found the idea of an arranged marriage abhorrent and noted that Tess was a strong-willed woman with her own life, and who would likely not be particularly interested in the prospect of an arranged marriage either. Anduin internally reflected that he had heard all kinds of rumors about Tess' &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that she had \"taken a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;page or two&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, but he was unwilling to bring them up to Greymane, let alone after just having her be suggested as a bride.\nElegy.\nWhen discussing who would head to Darnassus to represent Gilneas, Anduin suggested Tess go and aid their people. Genn agreed, but stated he did not know where she was at the time; instead leading to &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; being sent instead.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nTess Greymane, alongside &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, head to Darkshore on behalf of her father. There, she aids the Kaldorei in reclaiming their land, acting as a co-commander with Lorna as they lead the Gilnean forces in the region. She is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Gilnean Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. She states she will not just stand by while the Kaldorei need their help, citing how her mother nearly lost her life; as well as claiming &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;some atrocities&lt;/a&gt; cannot go unanswered.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Tess could be found sneaking on the roof a bridge.\nTess wished to become a worgen so she could better know the plight of her people to better rule them when she becomes queen. As her father and mother were against it, they asked the night elf druid &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; to help Tess understand the worgen's plight without becoming a worgen herself. Vassandra called on &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Glade\"&gt;Twilight Glade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and Goldrinn put Tess into a dream scenario within the Emerald Dream. In her dream, Tess was a worgen at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, but was unable to save her brother from his death and she fell into the rage of the curse. With Goldrinn's help, Tess realized that she did not need to be a worgen to understand her people, for it was being Gilnean in spite of the curse that defined them. She promoted the Gilnean adventurer who aided her in this journey to a member of the &lt;a href=\"Greyguard\"&gt;Greyguard&lt;/a&gt; in thanks and as recognition to their contribution to Gilneas.\nShadowlands.\nTess was present in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Tyrande's speech about the Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nTess personally participated in the reclamation of Gilneas. After the city was reclaimed from the Scarlet Crusade, Genn Greymane abdicated the throne and gave the leadership of Gilneas to Tess.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWhat's the matter? Never seen a princess who knows how to twist a blade?\nMy mother nearly lost her life trying to save the people of Darnassus. I will do everything in my power to stop the Horde here in Darkshore.\nSome atrocities simply cannot go unanswered.\nI cannot remain idle, not after my people have lost their second home."}

You should be proud of your accomplishment this day.\nDuring your test of faith you displayed strength of spirit, and now you have shown endurance in battle by taking on the Roguefeather harpies, but the time has come for a new test.\nNotes.\nAfter obtaining the quest, head to the southern wall of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; and head west. You will eventually come to an area called &lt;a href=\"Screeching%20Canyon\"&gt;Screeching Canyon&lt;/a&gt; with a ramp leading up to the harpy cave.

This quest chain also serves to introduce newer players to the lore behind the World of Warcraft story: The player must collect two books and be prepared to answer questions about them in order to complete the chain. The first book is about the Dragon &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, and the second is about the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe full text of the two books can be found:\nTests of Thousand Needles.\n&lt;a href=\"Dorn%20Plainstalker\"&gt;Dorn Plainstalker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; has been testing young members of the Horde for years. The lessons he teaches are not those of academia: instead, he teaches Faith, Endurance, and Strength. Dorn awaits those who seek to test themselves in a cave known as the &lt;a href=\"Weathered%20Nook\"&gt;Weathered Nook&lt;/a&gt; on the northern cliff face of the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; canyon.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Faith%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Test of Faith (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nDorn Plainstalker presents you with your first test: a test of faith. Transporting you to a high perch above Thousand Needles, he instructs you to jump - if you have faith.\nWithout question, you leap from the planks on which you stand... and are teleported once more back to Dorn's cave.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Endurance\"&gt;Test of Endurance&lt;/a&gt;\nNext Dorn wishes to test your endurance. He sends you to a cave on the south side of the canyon, full of harpies. After destroying their food supplies, you take their leader's claw as proof of your deed, and return to Dorn.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Test of Strength&lt;/a&gt;\nFor this test, Dorn suggests you join with others to accomplish the task set before you. This time, Dorn wants you to seek out the powerful earth elemental who prowls Thousand Needles: &lt;a href=\"Rok%27Alim%20the%20Pounder\"&gt;Rok'Alim the Pounder&lt;/a&gt;. You locate the elemental and do battle with him, finally defeating him and returning to Dorn with the fragments of the once-proud construct. Your third test is complete.\nLore of the Dragon Aspects.\nDorn is not the only one who is tasked with testing young members of the Horde: his associate, &lt;a href=\"Braug%20Dimspirit\"&gt;Braug Dimspirit&lt;/a&gt;, resides in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and gives a test of a different sort.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Test of Lore&lt;/a&gt;\nYour time with Dorn is done: it is time for the Test of Lore, for which you must travel to Braug Dimspirit outside the &lt;a href=\"Talondeep%20Path\"&gt;Talondeep Path&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. He will give you further instructions.\nAfter quite a journey, you manage to locate Braug. But you are not yet ready for the test he will give.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore%20%282%29\"&gt;Test of Lore (2)&lt;/a&gt;\nBefore you can take the Test of Lore, you must find and read the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Legacy of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, a book currently held in the &lt;a href=\"Dor%27Danil%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Dor'Danil Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; forest to the north. The book is guarded by the spirits of the night elves, who do not wish to part with it. But you manage to fight your way through and gain access to the book. On your way back to Braug, you study the text as instructed, learning the history and legend behind the first of the great dragons.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore%20%283%29\"&gt;Test of Lore (3)&lt;/a&gt;\nOnce you are prepared, you give Braug the book and await his question. He asks it: which of the great aspects became the monster Deathwing? You easily answer: Neltharion. Braug nods, satisfied, but you are not yet finished with your test.\nThe Origin of the Scourge.\nIn addition to Dorn and Braug, there is another who gives tests to new adventurers: &lt;a href=\"Parqual%20Fintallas\"&gt;Parqual Fintallas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. A historian in life, his now permanent state gives him plenty of time to study the triumphs and mistakes of the past. Like Braug, Parqual tests young members of the Horde in their knowledge of lore.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore%20%284%29\"&gt;Test of Lore (4)&lt;/a&gt;\nBraug wants you to learn yet more lore before your testing is complete. To that end, he sends you on to Parqual Fintallas in the Undercity for further instructions.\nUpon hearing your story, Parqual seems unimpressed. And it seems he, too, has a task for you before he will give his test.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore%20%285%29\"&gt;Test of Lore (5)&lt;/a&gt; (Dungeon)\nParqual wants you to collect a very special book held by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in their library in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Beginnings%20of%20the%20Undead%20Threat\"&gt;Beginnings of the Undead Threat&lt;/a&gt;. Gathering a group of other strong adventurers with you, you enter the Scarlet library and steal the book. When you return to Parqual, he seems pleased, and explains that though the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; may once have had good intentions, they were now so crazed and zealous that they sought to destroy any who were not among their order.\nYou quickly study the book, learning about the origins of the undead. When you are ready, you give the book to Parqual and prepare for your question.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore%20%286%29\"&gt;Test of Lore (6)&lt;/a&gt;\nParqual asks: What was the name of the creature who became known as the Lich King? Instantly you answer: Ner'zhul. Parqual nods, seeming a bit surprised, and accepts your answer as correct.\n&lt;a href=\"Final%20Passage\"&gt;Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;\nYour tests finally complete, Parqual instructs you to return to Dorn in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; to receive your reward. After your journey, Dorn grants you the choice between a fine hammer or powerful wand. In addition, he promises that all members of the Horde will have more respect for someone who could pass such difficult tests.\nRewards.\nIf the player follows the entire quest chain from beginning to end, he or she will receive:\nSummary.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;# &lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Faith%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Test of Faith (quest)&lt;/a&gt; "}

It is easy to test your body\u2014your mind is another matter completely.\nI shall explain it simply: find the book I name, study it, and answer my question about its contents.\nWhat book, you must be asking?

If they leave their platforms the entire raid will be hit by unhealable massive nature damage from the Tesla coils in the room. They have 838,300 HP each. If they are not killed within 5 seconds of each other they will resurrect each other with full health.\n&lt;a href=\"Feugen\"&gt;Feugen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHits for about 3,000 on plate.\n&lt;a href=\"Stalagg\"&gt;Stalagg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHits for about 4,500 on plate.\nThaddius.\nAfter Feugen and Stalagg are slain the raid has 15 seconds to jump to Thaddius' platform before Thaddius becomes active. Thaddius has approximately 3,850,000 hit points.\n25-man strategy.\nTwo tanks are required for this encounter. Thaddius and the phase one adds are tauntable. This encounter is significantly harder on 25-man mode, as the enrage timer becomes a very restricting factor should you lose raid members early. Even losing non-damage classes can be harmful, due to the loss of a stacking +10% damage buff. The Thaddius portion of the fight is typically easy to heal, usually requiring no more than 3-4 healers for a 25-man raid. Any remaining healers should help DPS to beat the enrage timer.\nPhase 1: Feugen and Stalagg.\nPhase 1 is very simple. Split the raid into two groups that will deal approximately equal damage, with half the tanks/healers on either side. Keep the tanks alive and heal Feugen's/Stalagg's damage, keep the adds on their platforms, and kill them simultaneously. Tanks should be certain to keep Feugen and Stalagg in the middle/back of their platforms and within range of the Tesla coils - shifting too far towards the base of the ramp can pull them out of range, causing unhealable nature damage to the room and wiping the raid. Every so often, the tanks will be \"thrown\" to the opposite platform, and their accumulated threat reassigned to the new mob. Tanks may need to pull back and reposition slightly after being thrown to the opposite platform. At around 5% it is necessary for both groups to check where the other is on damage. If either Stalagg or Feugen are killed while the other still has more than 5% to go, both Feugen and Stalagg will be resurrected and the fight will begin anew.\nPhase 1.5: The Platform Jump.\nAs soon as Feugen and Stalagg are down, the raid should jump to Thaddius' platform. It is important to note that this jump is difficult for some people. If one or more members of the raid fail to make the jump, they can run around to the front of the room, up to Feugen or Stalagg's platform, and try again. However, any raid members who arrive on Thaddius' platform after the fight begins must wait for a Polarity Shift before moving near the rest of the raid. Having no charge (because you were out of range for the first Polarity Shift) will still trigger polarity charge damage, because the charge is not the same as the other members of the raid (i.e., \"no charge\" is viewed as a different charge than + or -). A member arriving late to Thaddius' platform will thus need to wait, away from the rest of the group, until a Polarity Shift occurs and a charge is received, and the raid member can then join the rest of the raid on the appropriate side. After 3.0.8, &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; can cast &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; can cast &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; on anyone in the raid. Players who have trouble jumping down should ask a priest or mage to buff them after Feugen and Stalagg are dead so that all they have to do is run off the edge and float safely down to Thaddius's platform.\nPhase 2: Thaddius.\nThaddius will become active a few seconds after the group reaches his platform, and should be tanked in the center of the platform where he is, but slightly forward so that there is room for the raid to see where to run on either side of him during the Polarity Shifts. Approximately 10 seconds after Thaddius becomes active, he will cast his first Polarity Shift on the raid. The raid will need to immediately stack up in two separate groups depending on their charge. Raid leaders, make sure you clearly state what side the Negative group is on and what side Positive is on! Each group should clump up at maximum melee range. This allows members with the same charge to buff one another and allows melee DPS to engage Thaddius, all while avoiding shocking members of the opposite group. Stacking the charges is critical, as each charge provides a +10% damage buff (up to 12 stacks) that will be necessary to defeat Thaddius before the enrage timer. The tank should rotate around Thaddius to match the group that shares his charge. Some raids may prefer to use a front/back arrangement, with (for example) negative against the wall and positive on the edge of the platform. This ensures that the groups are tightly bunched for the damage buff, and allows anyone coming in late to go directly to the right place without running through the opposite-charged players.\nWhen Thaddius switches polarities again, everyone that has to move should move to the appropriate side as fast as possible. One strategy is to ask everyone to run around him either clockwise or counter-clockwise to avoid shocking players running the opposite direction. However, there are only about 4 seconds between the polarity shift and the first shock, so some raids opt to have members run straight through Thaddius to their new spots. Note that not every Polarity Shift will change the charge on a raid member, so the raid members will need to monitor their debuffs each time Polarity Shift is cast.\nOnce the raid is back in position and stacked with others who have a similar charge, the fight continues as before. This is the entire fight from 100% to 0% - there are no phases. You have six minutes to get through Thaddius' 30,400,000 HP. This enrage timer is quite strict and it is highly unlikely you will be able to beat it if you lose more than a few people, both because of the lost DPS and because fewer members of the raid alive means there are fewer people to stack to receive the same-charge buff (thus, even a healer death can become somewhat problematic). Once Thaddius is down, the charges immediately dissipate.\nTips\nThaddius has a quite large hitbox, so it is possible for your ranged DPS and melee to group up relatively close to each other. This positioning has three benefits: \nIf the need for a battle rez arises, the target of the rez should wait for Thaddius' polarity change and accept the rez immediately upon Thaddius' cast, then move to the appropriate group. Prematurely accepting the rez will lead to group damage and the target of the rez dying again, thus wasting a valuable resurrection.\nIt is no longer possible to use two Bloodlusts/Heroisms during the Thaddius encounter, because the Sated/Exhaustion debuffs now last for 10 minutes, which is longer than the enrage timer.\nIt may be easier to look at the color of the debuff rather than the symbol, as that can slow reaction times by a fraction of a second. Negative is red, positive is blue.\n10-man strategy.\nThe 10-man strategy is exactly the same as the 25-man strategy. The tanks, healers, and DPS are split to kill Feugen and Stalagg simultaneously, and then Thaddius is engaged and the raid begins its rotations after the first Polarity Shift. Thaddius only needs one tank, so have your other(s) DPS.\nPhase 1: Feugen &amp; Stalagg.\nNotably, the pacing of DPS on Feugen and Stalagg may have to be monitored more carefully in this version of the fight. For a 10-man group running 2 tanks, 3 healers, and 5 dps, splitting the raid will mean that one side has more DPS than the other. Consequently, DPS on one side may need to slow down for a brief period of time, to ensure that Feugen and Stalagg are killed within 5 seconds of each other and do not resurrect. Feugen and Stalagg can creep forwards on their platform at times, so it it wise for the tank to reposition their new target at the back of the platform after each tank switch.\nPhase 2: Thaddius.\nThe technique for this encounter simply involves assigning a direction to each polarity. As you look in the room before you attack the two mini bosses, you will see Thaddius. The left and right sides as you are facing him are what is referred to by \"left\" and \"right\" when sides are called out. When you pull Thaddius and the raid has no charge, stack up on the tank. Then when he casts the first Polarity Shift, run to the assigned side. You only need to get this bit right once!\nFrom then on, the fight becomes simple. Stack on top of each other at max melee range. Thaddius's huge hitbox assures that everyone in each group gets the buff, is close enough to quickly change sides, and can be well out of range of the raid members with the opposite charge. When Thaddius changes polarity again, you must look carefully - if your Polarity has CHANGED, run around the boss in a counter clockwise direction and stack on the other side. If it didn't change, STAY WHERE YOU ARE!\nContinue this for 4\u20135 minutes and you will either kill him or kill yourself depending on how well your group has mastered the movement technique. This technique requires fast reactions and good awareness of de-buffs. If you are part of a group that successfully downed &lt;a href=\"Grobbulus\"&gt;Grobbulus&lt;/a&gt;, you are likely to be able to do this encounter. In 10 man, if one person messes up, this does not mean a wipe. If you are unsure where to go, move out of melee range and stand as far away from the boss and both groups as possible, until you understand the mechanic. \nThings that can go wrong\nSolo strategy.\nAs it's obviously not possible to keep both Stalagg and Feugen each on their respective platform, choose one wight and aggro it, but keep it within range of the Tesla Coil. For description purposes, assume Feugen is pulled and Stalagg has to run over, but the encounter is the same the same either way. Damage Feugen to ~25% health while waiting for Stalagg to run over. Once Stalagg is in range, swap over and damage Stalagg down to near death, then kill them both at the same time. Either wight will still resurrect the other if it is not killed within five seconds.\nOnce both wights are dead, jump down to Thaddius's platform, pop cooldowns and go to town. Polarity means nothing, so just work through Thaddius's health pool.\nQuotes.\nThe following screams are heard echoing throughout Naxxramas in addition to during the fight with Thaddius, and will stop after Thaddius dies. The screams sound like those of a woman or child:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The theme of this boss is similar to that of Frankenstein's Monster, creating something akin to an &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; in that it is sewn together of human parts, but also part machinery.\nAttacks and Abilities.\nPhase One: Feugen and Stalagg.\nThe encounter begins with two wight mini-bosses Feugen and Stalagg, each staged on their own platform and tethered to an adjacent tesla coil. Feugen and Stalagg each have 499,650 health. If they are not killed within 5 seconds of each other the slain wight will resurrect with full health.\nPhase Two: Thaddius.\nWhen both adds are down, players have 15 seconds to jump to the central platform before the tesla coils overload and activate Thaddius. Thaddius has ~6.657 million health.\nStrategy.\nBefore the encounter, assign locations for positive and negatively charged people to stand. The most common assignment has negatively charged players to the left of Thaddius and positively charged players to the right.\nSimply tank each sub-boss near where they start and DPS them down. Due to their mechanics, casters should fight Stalagg, while melee should fight Feugen. Mages and hunters can outrange Feugen's mana drain, so if the groups are too uneven then they can fill in for the missing spots. Note that these sub-bosses must be killed within five seconds of each other, or they will resurrect at full health(much like &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thekal\"&gt;High Priest Thekal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;).\nAll players head to Thaddius' platform. There is roughly 20 seconds between killing both sub-bosses and getting charged. Thaddius will cast Polarity Shift roughly every 30 seconds. Players whose polarity changes have 5 seconds to run to the location for their new polarity. There is no need to avoid other players changing sides, and they should run straight to his new position, using the shortest path available (that is, running through Thaddius). It is important for the raid to stand in two groups because Thaddius must be killed within 5 minutes (to avoid the berserk) and the damage bonus from stacking players on each side is needed to kill him that quickly. Hunters especially need to make sure they remain within range to maximize the charge debuff stacks.\nThree important notes with this phase:\nThaddius doesn't deal very much melee damage to an appropriately geared main tank, so only 3-4 tank healers are necessary. The other healers should focus on the rest of the raid, as Thaddius deals heavy nature damage to 15 players every 5-8 seconds.\nThaddius hits for about 2k normal, 3.3k crushing. The damage multiplier the rest of the raid has can make holding threat for a warrior tank a little bit iffy. (Bear tank threat generation benefits from the damage multiplier, unlike warrior abilities, and is advantageous for this fight.) \nIn order to have a prayer of holding threat, the MT has to move with others of his charge, if he's unstacked by the debuff, he will find himself making frequent use of his Taunt button (Thaddius is tauntable).\nBackground.\nBlizzard's release of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060717224353/http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/insider/07/anatomy.html\"&gt;Anatomy of a Monster: Thaddius&lt;/a&gt; revealed some clues into the strategy of fighting this abomination.\nAt the start of the encounter, the players don't fight Thaddius himself; they battle two &lt;a href=\"wight\"&gt;wight&lt;/a&gt;s that are in the same room on two separate platforms. These platforms are not directly connected, so to fight them the raid has to split up and attack both wights at the same time. But it gets worse... the wights have the ability to snatch a player from one platform and pull him to the other, which is a way to split up the raid and divide their forces.\nOne central part of the whole Frankenstein myth is the way the monster was brought to life using lightning and electricity. Voltage is created when electric charges are separated; when the charges are brought together, the stored energy is released in an electrostatic discharge - a basic electric shock. When players finally go up against Thaddius, he will \"polarize\" the raid group by making half the raid positive and the other half negative. When positive and negative raid members get too close to each other... Well, let's just say that you want to get as far away from players with an opposite charge as possible, which further plays into the idea of separating the raid.\nQuotes.\nWhile Thaddius remains undefeated, the following screams are occasionally heard echoing throughout Naxxramas. The screams sound like those of a woman or child:\nThese screams will cease after Thaddius is defeated.\nLoot.\nDefeating Thaddius rewards 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;."}

Upon concluding his story, he moves to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Thaedris was married to &lt;a href=\"Latara\"&gt;Latara&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Latara died and was buried at &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;. He would often visit the tomb of &lt;a href=\"General%20Startalon\"&gt;General Startalon&lt;/a&gt; at Tel'anor to meditate for guidance, and watched the caretakers perform their rituals and venerate the dead. He would spend the next 10,000 years stuck inside &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, without Latara's love, transforming into a &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThaedris believes or came to believe that as a people, it was their sacred responsibility to protect the world as heroes and guardians, like those interred at Tel'anor, which they abandoned to \"hide like cowards\" beneath the shield. Ashamed of what they had done, he became depressed. The last straw was when &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the council struck a dark bargain to become allies with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Considering the city to be lost and unable to call it home any longer, he left and ended up at Tel'anor.\nNevertheless, he was fully aware what being without the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; would do but felt that there was no place for him anymore. Unable to go back, and unwilling to be resigned to a mindless existence without release or dignity as a &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;, he began searching for a \"third option.\" It was at this point that he meets the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThaedris offers to pay for assistance with making a potion, for which he needs difficult ingredients. Although he does not say it outright, the adventurer comes to realize that the potion is actually a lethal poison that Thaedris intends to commit suicide with, so he can be with his wife. The adventurer tries to dissuade him by telling him about &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s refuge at &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and the search for a cure for withering, but he will not be swayed.\nWith the potion complete, Thaedris asks for help in finding his wife's missing bow. It turns out that Latara had risen as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; and taken it herself. After the adventurer puts her down and reports back, Thaedris admits what the potion really is, and realizes that he must live and do what he can to prevent the spirits from rising again. With new purpose, he resolves to help the adventurer save Suramar City and atone for the Nightborne's sins. Only then will he be worthy of joining his wife one day.\nQuotes.\nWho are you? Why does a &lt;race&gt; come here?\nThis place is not meant for strangers. It is... was... a sacred place for my people. Or what my people once were.\nLook at &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;race&gt;. It is beautiful, and it is tragic.\nWe were cowards to hide beneath that shield. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was in our care, and we chose to abandon her. We failed our sacred duty to protect the world, and our shame is too great.\nThis is where we remember &lt;a href=\"General%20Startalon\"&gt;General Startalon&lt;/a&gt;, one of the finest generals our people has ever known. He commanded the Hippogryph riders during the War of the Ancients.\nI used to visit his tomb often to meditate for guidance. I wonder if I will see him.\nThis memorial is not as grand or famous as the others here, but it holds special importance for me. Within lies Lady &lt;a href=\"Latara\"&gt;Latara&lt;/a&gt;, a consummate huntress and my wife. Oh, how I miss her.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Rayne%20Feathersong\"&gt;Rayne Feathersong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyranne%20Feathersong\"&gt;Lyranne Feathersong&lt;/a&gt;."}

Thaelin has numerous creations, among which a personal ram-headed &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"The%20Tank\"&gt;The Tank&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20golem\"&gt;Dark Iron golem&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"The%20Suit\"&gt;The Suit&lt;/a&gt; which he could equip, but it was destroyed.\nHistory.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Hansel%20Heavyhands\"&gt;Hansel Heavyhands&lt;/a&gt; fought in the united &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a demolitions expert and repair vendor. Thaelin blew a chamber where &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; was held prisoner. He then accompanied &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s group throughout the eastern camps. Near the end of the battle, Thaelin used the Iron Worldbreaker cannon to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Thaelin and the others left Tanaan.\nLater, Thaelin arrived to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; in order to find his fellow Dark Irons that had come here in mole machines to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, saying that no one knows how to fight the better than a Dark Iron dwarf. Unfortunately, the mole machines got lost in the wilds of Gorgrond. Thaelin arrived to &lt;a href=\"Naielle%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Naielle's Watch&lt;/a&gt; but the camp was attacked by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; blamed him and his invention for the attack. A genesaur knocked him out but it was soon killed by the commander. The dwarf joined with &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, repaired his tank and brought the draenei into the heart of Gorgrond where he had an outpost built. He started working with the draenei to find his comrades, traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Deeproot\"&gt;Deeproot&lt;/a&gt; jungle. He learned that three of the Dark Irons were killed in &lt;a href=\"Razorbloom\"&gt;Razorbloom&lt;/a&gt;. The Rangari also discovered that two of them were in &lt;a href=\"Evermorn%20Springs\"&gt;Evermorn Springs&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Burrian%20Coalpart\"&gt;Burrian Coalpart&lt;/a&gt; was found and rescued. The two dwarves then moved to &lt;a href=\"Moira%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Moira's Reach&lt;/a&gt; and helped Hansel to load a cannon and fire it at the genesaur &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThaelin and the draenei then entered &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. His inventions helped them to track the invading Iron Horde army led by . Thaelin commanded to destroy the orcs' supplies. Not long after, he was delivered a Shredder which he fixed and it was used to destroy the Iron Horde orcs in &lt;a href=\"Tuurem%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Tuurem&lt;/a&gt;. After it was done, he and the two draenei joined Khadgar on the outskirts of . He and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; found and repaired an Iron Star which the commander used for quick assault and transport throughout the city. The dwarf then joined the archmage in Shattrath's port where he managed the siege weapons and fired another &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Blackhand's&lt;/a&gt; ships. As he fired it, he noticed heroes and Khadgar quickly teleported them.\nAfter the battle, Thaelin arrived to &lt;a href=\"Telaari%20Station\"&gt;Telaari Station&lt;/a&gt; in and tried to repair his &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;. After he received supplies, the machine was used for its last mission in &lt;a href=\"Telaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telaar&lt;/a&gt;. Commander found plans which he gave to the dwarf and he had them materialized. Thaelin also sent a box full of young &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; to Yrel in &lt;a href=\"Yrel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Yrel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. The commander caught them and delivered back to Thaelin on Yrel's behalf. Thaelin admitted it was meant to be a joke. The commander released the goren and Thaelin began running as they followed him.\nSome time later, he hid himself in his new &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;secret location&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern Gorgrond. He was soon found and captured by the Iron Horde. They took Thaelin away but left Hansel there. The orcs convinced him to build them a new machinery near the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Pass\"&gt;Thunder Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The moles he built were used to attack &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; which triggered the attention of the commander. He found Hansel and together they began searching for the captured dwarf. During his capture, Thaelin had managed to hide a tracking device so the Alliance quickly located him. They used a prototype of a drill and emerged in the &lt;a href=\"Siegeworks\"&gt;Siegeworks&lt;/a&gt;. Thaelin was found and he could realize his backup plan - while he was working for the orcs, he also built a robot which he now used for, sending moles to his station and destroying all the machinery built for the enemy. After it was done, he commanded to kill &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Blackhammer\"&gt;Overlord Blackhammer&lt;/a&gt; who had got his notebook. They eventually returned to Hansel in a nearby cave but the robot, the Suit, did not survive. They returned briefly to Lunarfall, thinking about opening a new shop.\nFor the Horde characters, Gazlowe and the commander worked together to find Thaelin. Once they got him, the goblin gives him fuel, and the dwarf flies away. As a token of gratitude, he sent a transport mole to Gorgrond in Lunarfall and &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is next seen alongside the Alliance army and the Exarchs near the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Tanaan\"&gt;Gates of Tanaan&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Warchief Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; \"invited\" them to Tanaan.\nAfter took over the Iron Horde, Thaelin accompanied the Rangari scouts and the Alliance into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt;. He later provided &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; a powered ram to bring down the Tanaan Gate.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThaelin was aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Thaelin was smelting &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt; was stolen from him by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Anvil was also damaged in the attack.

A sorcerer of unmatched talent, he led an order of eredar &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"conjurer\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt;. Driven by ambition, he began secretly summoning large amounts of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and planned to install himself as dictator of Argus. However, his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; revealed the plot to Argus's rulers \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who banded together to strike him down, with Archimonde himself beheading his former master. After Thal'kiel's defeat, his skull, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20the%20Man%27ari\"&gt;Skull of the Man'ari&lt;/a&gt;, was gilded by Archimonde and placed on display as a warning. It was then passed from demon to demon, until the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to enhance his ability to summon and command demon armies for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, lost it to a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBrilliance.\nSeveral years before the coming of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Thal'kiel was a &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; of unmatched talent who led an order of eredar &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt;, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. The magi summoned &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; constructs to help build the architecture of Argus' capital, while Thal'kiel himself devised machines to focus the planet's latent arcane energies. For his work, the sorcerer was greatly admired. There were rumors that Thal'kiel's young apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, coveted his master's power and influence, but Thal'kiel himself dismissed these claims, for Archimonde had showed him nothing but devotion, having even gone to great lengths to create a custom-made crown for the eredar leader, taking the measurements for his head himself. At the time, Thal'kiel and Archimonde were among the most prominent proponents of \u2014 the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude \u2014 and Thal'kiel, in particular, was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer's skull, for which he was widely admired.\nHowever, Thal'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels and thirsted for more. In search of ways to elevate the Wakeners to levels undreamed of, his spells plumbed the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; in search of even greater power, and one day he received an answer. A dark presence began to whisper to him, showing him visions of unimaginable power and giving the sorcerer the ability to start summoning various lesser &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, which the eredar then immediately spread to his Wakeners. Afterward, he despised the arcane, his passion reserved only for &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. Believing this to be the start of a new era, Thal'kiel prepared to present his new pets to the rulers of Argus, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the presence of the eredar rulers' inner circle, Thal'kiel demonstrated his new abilities by first summoning scores of his old arcane constructs in orderly rows, and then calling down a storm of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt; meteors to destroy them as a symbolic display of the new era. However, when he looked upon his colleagues' faces, he did not see the approval he had expected. Kil'jaeden's expression was remote and inscrutable, but Velen harshly condemned Thal'kiel's actions and forbade him from ever conjuring demons again, denouncing his \"new era\" as a failed experiment.\nBetrayal.\nAccording to the journal of an anonymous Wakener, Thal'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks following the disastrous demonstration. He neither ate nor slept, his only companions being the demonic minions he summoned and then banished in rage \u2014 at least, that is what the Wakeners assumed, since all they could hear were the shrieks of &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s being thrust back and forth between Argus and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. They could also sense other, larger entities with him, \"shadowy apparitions of baleful influence,\" but Thal'kiel's servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum. When he finally emerged, Thal'kiel had aged by the centuries, his back having become twisted and stooped and with an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and then simply said: \"The new era begins.\"\nIn secret, Thal'kiel and his Wakeners resumed their demonic experiments, conjuring increasingly powerful demons and casting powerful spells to hide their minions from the eyes of Velen and Kil'jaeden. Over time, they amassed a great demonic army with the sole purpose of installing Thal'kiel as the dictator of Argus. The Wakeners were united behind their leader, save one: Thal'kiel's apprentice, Archimonde. While he had no aversion to demons, the ambitious Archimonde was eager to prove himself to the leadership of Argus, and the night before the planned coup, he snuck away and revealed his master's plans to Velen and Kil'jaeden.\nDeath.\nArchimonde himself broke the wards hiding Thal'kiel's army and led a contingent of magi to storm the Wakeners' secret training grounds. The Wakeners were caught off guard and easily defeated, and the demons were quickly slaughtered when they found themselves leaderless. As Thal'kiel tried to summon in more reinforcements, Archimonde decapitated his former master with a single stroke of his blade. The eredar now known as &lt;a href=\"Talixae%20Flamewreath\"&gt;Talixae Flamewreath&lt;/a&gt;, another student, escaped the raid as she was mysteriously missing at the time. After the battle, the Wakeners' bodies were burned and their writings destroyed, and their screams echoed across Argus, as a grim reminder of the price paid for dealing with demons. Archimonde was hailed as a hero and would later rise to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil'jaeden. Thal'kiel was succeeded as High Wakener by &lt;a href=\"Aargoss\"&gt;Aargon&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchimonde soon commissioned one of Argus' finest jewelers to gild Thal'kiel's skull and then proudly displayed it in his domicile, ostensibly as a an example of the dangers of the dark arts and a warning to the other eredar not to follow in Thal'kiel's footsteps, though in truth he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its magic-channeling abilities. Over time, however, a demonic presence slowly infiltrated Archimonde's mind, using Thal'kiel's skull as its conduit. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of a glorious army consuming civilizations in fel fire under the leadership of a dark god, and he became eager to learn more about this mysterious being and his legions. When Sargeras arrived on Argus, Archimonde was thus the first to accept the Dark Titan's offer.\nArchimonde continued to use his former master's skull in service to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; for some time, using it to exert his control over multitudes of demons to obliterate his opponents, but it has since passed between a handful of Sargeras' most elite generals. &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; was the last to be seen with Thal'kiel's skull.\nLegion.\nThal'kiel's skull, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20the%20Man%27ari\"&gt;Skull of the Man'ari&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the artifacts chronicled in the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt;, a grimoire held by the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;. After the newest member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 escapes from the rift with &lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt;, the two set out to find Mephistroth and retrieve the skull to rescue the other members of the Black Harvest from Jagganoth's domain. By conducting a dark ritual, the adventurer manages to contact Thal'kiel's spirit and attempts to convince the eredar to reveal where his skull is being held by Mephistroth. Thal'kiel initially refuses, but the adventurer manages to convince him by insulting his pride and telling him that by working together, they can make the Legion bow before them. Thal'kiel's spirit reveals his location to be &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing. Using one of Calydus' portals, the adventurer fight their way through Felsoul Hold, confronting Mephistroth and his minions and finally succeeding in defeating the dreadlord before he has a chance to destroy the skull. The warlock picks up the skull, and together, they and Thal'kiel return to Dalaran."}

It has both written and spoken equivalents. Individuals who are unfamiliar with the language's proper name may refer to it as High Elven.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shalassian\"&gt;Shalassian&lt;/a&gt;, Thalassian is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; language. Hence, Thalassian is closely related to Darnassian and there is some overlap between the two languages. Further Darnassian utterances may, therefore, have been preserved in modern Thalassian, in addition to those that are specified below.\nSo far, linguistic scholars have opted to err on the side of caution in documenting Darnassian terms and phrases that are also considered part of the Thalassian language. Certainly, this issue, however delicate, merits further research. Nevertheless, addressing a high elf or blood elf with a Darnassian-specific word or phrase can be considered offensive or at the very least rather foolish, and so the speaker must handle the situation with care.\nThalassian is one of the four known elven dialects.\nThalassian primer (official translations).\nHere are a few common Thalassian phrases and words, for which the translations have been officially confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;:\nThalassian speculation.\nThalassian word parser.\nThis is the list of words created by the in-game language parser for the Thalassian language and is listed as language number ten (word range 800-901) in the Language text file.\nIn the in-game translator, the language parser for Thalassian shares similar words with the Darnassian parser. \nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words look like Thalassian. It does not actually translate words. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't truly Thalassian.\nSpeculation.\nFor fan translations see &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20%28speculation%29\"&gt;Thalassian (speculation)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nTranslations:\nHigh elven names.\nThe past is a burden to the high elves, yet they maintain naming rituals that are millennia old. Many of the names of elven priests and heroes have become the names used for elves in modern times. The high elves share a connection with the sun that is quite prevalent in their choice of family names."}

There are, however, many words, forms, and tenses that differ to the extent that they probably should be considered different languages. The first thing to keep in mind is that Thalassian does not follow the rules of English and there is often likely no \"word for word\" literal translation of any given phrase. To find the meaning behind given phrases takes a little more effort then, but the first step to figuring out the structure of a language is in identifying parts of speech.\nGrammar.\nNouns.\nConcerning nouns in \"plural\" and \"singular\", there have been found a pattern which could be either a \"coincidence\" or actually \"intended\" by the creator of Thalassian.\nThe following words are all presumed nouns in singular (with its speculated meaning in parenthesis):\nWhen looking at another noun: dorei - used in \"kaldorei\" and \"sin'dorei\" - it means both \"children\" and \"child\".\nVerbs.\nThis table is an effort to further systematize the \"known\" Thalassian verbs. Third person forms are used in the English translations for the sake of simplicity. Words in \"italic\" are \"logic speculations\" derived from the more \"known\" tenses, and should probably not be used as a base to derive other words."}

Its vast libraries of knowledge contain the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Time%20%28lore%29\"&gt;timeways&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Oathstone\"&gt;Bronze Oathstone&lt;/a&gt; that symbolizes their calling to protect all time.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; spaces bear distinctive architecture, the places established by the dragons reflect the most cultured aspects of dragon society. The dragons built vast structures, the most glorious of which was &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;. From the top of this grand city, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; passed laws and directed their protection of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Also nestled in the heart of Thaldraszus is &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Infusion\"&gt;Halls of Infusion&lt;/a&gt;. A mysterious place that has been locked away for millennia and holds the secrets that &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; left behind.\nThe waters flowing through Thaldraszus' aqueducts come from the Wellspring of Eternity beneath Tyrhold, and the waters are in fact &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Azeroth's lifeblood&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

In truth, however, Thalen was a spy for &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, for whom he created the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; used to destroy &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Songweaver's demeanor is generally prideful, jovial, and narcissistic. Songweaver sees his actions as simply being loyal to the Horde, with the persecution of Garrosh and his forces being unfair. He aided &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu's&lt;/a&gt; plot to save Garrosh from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nTides of War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; agreed to aid Theramore, both &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; recommended Thalen to join the mission. He accompanied Rhonin to defend &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where he was ordered to magically strengthen the northern gate. However, while he appeared to be a loyal member of the Kirin Tor, he was actually a Horde loyalist, and instead weakened the gate. His treachery was discovered by Jaina, who confronted him at his post. Confident, Thalen prepared to do battle with her, though &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt; promptly knocked him unconscious and sent him to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Evencane\"&gt;Captain Evencane&lt;/a&gt; for questioning. After the Horde broke through the northern gate, some of them rescued Thalen and removed him from the city; he was safely away when &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Theramore with a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, which Thalen had engineered himself.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter regaining consciousness, Thalen found himself shackled in the basement of &lt;a href=\"Foothold%20Citadel\"&gt;Foothold Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. However, before Captain Evencane could interrogate him, he was successfully rescued by Horde adventurers. Grateful for being freed, Thalen tells his rescuers the truth about Garrosh's attack on Theramore. He will then send himself and the players through a portal to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; so they can escape before the mana bomb destroys the city. Before leaving, he tells the adventurers to visit him, if they ever come to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe will mail victorious Horde players the &lt;a href=\"Mini%20Mana%20Bomb\"&gt;Mini Mana Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, which he himself created (though, by his own admission, perhaps in somewhat poor humor).\nWar Crimes.\nThalen continued to reside in Silvermoon after the war's end. As the deposed Garrosh Hellscream's trial continued, Thalen was approached by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, who was gathering a raid of &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; loyalists to free their captured leader. Still loyal to Garrosh, and fearful that &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; would punish him severely for his part in destroying Theramore, Thalen agreed to join Zaela. His arcane mastery proved a valuable asset to the warlord, as did his mini-mana bomb creations.\nThalen and the other loyalists served as a distraction during the trial, leading to Garrosh's rescue at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. Thalen survived the assault and escaped along with the others.\nFollowing this and the events of &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, his whereabouts remain unknown."}

He didn't sleep on beautiful nights, and in fact he hasn't slept during any night in the wild for precisely 9,013 years. He knew &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20%28language%29\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;. He carried seeds and acorns which he used to grow food, and his eyes were of glowing silver color.\nTraveler.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, while in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, he stumbled upon the youngsters &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, being drawn to an energy, later revealed coming from Aram's magical compass. At first, he watched them as a shapeshifted stag, being almost caught by Makasa as a meal. He then approached them as a night elf and offered them any help and food they needed since they all were heading to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. Upon admitting being drawn by an energy, he inspected the compass and revealed its properties being celestial. He soon was helping them against the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; as, at one point, he smashed the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; who offered a deal - the compass for the recently captured Murky. Thalyss and Aram couldn't save the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; as they were caught by &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt; and his group of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20clan\"&gt;Gordunni clan&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyss being knocked out during the fight. He later awoke but didn't dare to escape so the two were brought to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; to fight in gladiatorial duels for ogres' amusement. The two started introducing to the rest of the slaves, finding Murky's family and friends.\nThalyss was paired to fight against &lt;a href=\"Wuul%20Breezerider\"&gt;Woolbeard&lt;/a&gt;, but only after Aram and &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt; would finish their fight. The &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; and Aram resolved not to finish their fight so King Gordok summoned the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; Old &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Aram managed to break her thorn collar but she didn't leave the ruined city and Thalyss realized that there must be something else still holding her here. From the murlocs he learned about her cubs being held in a thorn dome. When the Hidden entered Dire Maul, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; fought and killed King Gordok, and chaos erupted. At that moment, Aram, Thalyss and the reunited Makasa rushed to the dome. Thalyss used his druidism on an acorn that erupted into a mighty oak that shattered the dome. The cubs were thus retrieved and they flew eastward from the city. Having helped One-Eye's cubs, Thalyss, Aram, Makasa, Murky and Hackle hoped on the wyvern and started taking off. Malus noticed that and shouted to stop them. The &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zathra\"&gt;Zathra&lt;/a&gt; responded by firing crossbow bolts at the direction of the boy. Thalyss, having seen the danger, pushed Aram down and the bolts hit the druid's back. His life began to fade.\nLanding atop &lt;a href=\"Skypeak\"&gt;Skypeak&lt;/a&gt;, place dear to the druid as he once had a drinking night near the mountain, he accepted his final defeat, and asked Aram to continue protecting the compass as well as to finish his own journey to Gadgetzan and deliver a pouch to his old friend named &lt;a href=\"Faeyrine%20Springsong\"&gt;Faeyrine Springsong&lt;/a&gt;, for whom he deeply cared. Once he was gone, Makasa removed the bolts and they resolved to bury him near Skypeak. One-Eye took them off the mountain. As they flew, the compass flew off and they followed it. Thalyss's body hit the ground brutally in the subsequent fast descent. The wyvern then dug a hole in the place where the compass had previously impacted. After they buried him there, Aram and the rest spat on his grave - not as an insult but as an honor for the druid."}

Betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; during an attempted \"\" and exiled to the wilds, becoming a &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra joined with the \"outlanders\" from the floating city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and led the &lt;a href=\"nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that toppled Elisande and freed Suramar from the Legion. Having established cordial relations with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra eventually swore Suramar's allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to reclaim her people's place in Azeroth.\nThalyssra led the nightborne through the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, where her faith in &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; wavered; noting the similarities between her and Elisande. She ultimately stood in rebellion against Windrunner alongside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, whose advice she had come to trust. As such, as leader of Suramar, Thalyssra came to be seated on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; as the nightborne representative.\nBackground.\nThalyssra was born as a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and as a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;. Some time before the War of the Ancients, the First Arcanist had a gifted student named &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Commander%20Sivara\"&gt;Sivara&lt;/a&gt;, who Thalyssra recommended to enroll in the royal academy in &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time she was an adult she lived in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and was one of its many citizens contained inside the shield that was conjured up to protect it from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Over the centuries, she noted with the concern of how she was undergoing a transformation, eventually becoming a nightborne. Thalyssra would also have another student during this time, named &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Malrodi\"&gt;Malrodi&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of Suramar.\nFirst Arcanist Thalyssra was present when , emissary of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; with his offer: bring down the barrier around &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, give him access to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; and become allies of the Legion, or be destroyed. While &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Advisor Vandros&lt;/a&gt; was willing to submit to the Legion to save their people, Thalyssra argued that the demons would not be making offers at all if they were actually capable of destroying the barrier on their own.\nTwo days later, the First Arcanist, convinced that &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; would give her people over to the demons in fear, had gathered a small group of nightborne \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 with the intent of preventing Elisande from bringing down the barrier. Though her fellow elves were worried about the risk of becoming exiled and turned into &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra reminded them of how they had resisted the Legion once before during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, saying that demons would promise anything to get what they wanted, and that she would rather die as a nightborne than live as a Legion slave.\nDuring the night, the rebels stormed into the city but were ambushed by Elisande's guards. In the chaos that ensued, Thalyssra and Melandrus managed to slip away and reach the outskirts of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, however, Melandrus raised his sword and stabbed Thalyssra through the back before pushing her over the edge and into the river below. Most of the other rebels were killed, and the barrier was brought down, exposing the city to the Legion. However, unbeknownst to Melandrus and the other nightborne, Thalyssra survived and began planning for her revenge.\nThe Nightfallen resistance.\nAlone, starving, and having to ignore her stab wound for the time being in the wilds outside Suramar City, Thalyssra began to look for allies. Knowing that the &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt; are drawn to old settlements like &lt;a href=\"Ambervale\"&gt;Ambervale&lt;/a&gt;, she began heading there to find her old colleague &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Kel%27danath\"&gt;Arcanist Kel'danath&lt;/a&gt;, who would likely be there as he was researching a cure for the withered when he was banished. Also hoping to find friendly outsiders, Thalyssra wove a spell into the waves of magical energy emanating from the city which contained an encrypted message, a cry for help. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; intercepted and deciphered the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; and sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to Suramar to investigate.\nThe adventurer soon found Thalyssra in &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt; by following a trail of arcane echoes, and together the two fought their way through swarms of withered to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, an underground refuge where Withered dared not enter. From there, Thalyssra began assembling a resistance movement against Elisande and her Legion allies, recruiting &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; for his skill with teleportation magic, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt; for her knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;leyline&lt;/a&gt; feeds that could power Shal'Aran with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy, and the socialite &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; for her connections among Suramar's nobility. She also began offering sanctuary to other nightborne in need, such as &lt;a href=\"Absolon\"&gt;Absolon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSending her new ally to complete her original objective of finding Arcanist Kel'danath, he turned out to have succumbed to the Withered state, but left behind a test subject, &lt;a href=\"Theryn\"&gt;Subject 16&lt;/a&gt;, who was uncharacteristically pacified for a Withered. By probing Subject 16's memories, the First Arcanist was able to find the cause of his unusual state, which turned out to be the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; seed kept in &lt;a href=\"Moonshade%20Sanctum\"&gt;Moonshade Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Her adventurer ally returned to Shal'Aran with the seed and its ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; keeper, &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt;, who planted the seed on the central platform of Shal'Aran, where it would in time grow into a full-fledged arcan'dor tree.\nLater, as the resistance gathered strength, the arcan'dor needed a powerful influx of more arcane energy than even the leyline feeds across Suramar could provide. First Arcanist Thalyssra, along with &lt;a href=\"Arluin\"&gt;Arluin&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer, infiltrated &lt;a href=\"the%20Arcway\"&gt;the Arcway&lt;/a&gt; to create a manastorm that could give the magical tree the one-time boost of energy that it needed, an effort that cost Arluin his life. Along with Oculeth and Valtrois, Thalyssra was the first to eat the first fruit of the fully grown arcan'dor, which cured her addiction to the Nightwell, and after some time, she recovered from her nightfallen state and returned to the healthy appearance of a normal nightborne.\nThalyssra and her resistance eventually prepared to attack Suramar City itself. They were aided in this endeavor by &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; forces from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; (a native daughter of Suramar City) and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived in force to besiege the city. Tyrande remembered that Thalyssra's people hid under Suramar's shield during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and was cautious if she would betray them and become a ruler like &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; or Elisande, but still agreed to help them fight the Legion. Liadrin was more sympathetic to the Nightfallen, drawing parallels to her own people's addiction to magic and Legion-twisted &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; years before.\nThalyssra is the heroes' main navigator inside the Nighthold raid, providing information and exposition similar to &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in , and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon her return to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, First Arcanist Thalyssra saw to it that adventurers who helped her liberate Suramar were rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%27s%20Manasaber\"&gt;prized mounts&lt;/a&gt; from the royal stable. With Elisande's death, she becomes the new leader of the nightborne, promising to uphold their promise to aid Azeroth with repelling the Legion, rather than aiding them. Following her rise as leader, she makes the decision to not re-stabilize the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, which had become unstable and was dwindling without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, which had been brought to Dalaran. Valtrois argued against this, claiming that the well may still provide great power for the nightborne if it can be saved, but Thalyssra states that the nightborne must learn to live without the Nightwell, lest they fall prey to it as they had under Elisande.\nAftermath.\nThalyssra, now the ruler of Suramar and its people, has relocated to the Nighthold. Since the joint elven effort to oust the Burning Legion, Thalyssra has maintained good relations with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; through her positive interactions with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and from this has established an alliance between Suramar and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Liadrin's Horde allies can be seen assisting in Suramar's rebuilding efforts.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; summoned the Horde's leaders to seek out new allies, Liadrin suggested the nightborne; Sylvanas, intrigued by what Suramar's strength and resources could bring to the Horde, approved. Liadrin and the Horde champion then travel to Thalyssra's estate to offer the first arcanist a formal invitation to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;' ruler, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. While there, Liadrin and Thalyssra discuss the advantages of membership in the Horde. One of several pertinent factors for Thalyssra is to ensure her people enjoy the freedom to affect the world while upholding their traditions, which she feels is not offered by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra further reflects on her comparatively sour relations with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, who while natural allies to her people on the surface, proved otherwise due to \"arrogance and mistrust.\" The first arcanist conjures a brief reenactment of her exchange with Tyrande during the events leading up to the siege of Suramar to illustrate such, and then readily accepts the invitation to Silvermoon and hopes to inquire about a place for the nightborne in the Horde.\nAccompanied by Valtrois and Silgryn, Thalyssra meets the regent lord of Quel'Thalas in his palace; she and Lor'themar quickly take to one another, each insisting that friends call one another by their first names. Lor'themar then leads the nightborne retinue to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and Thalyssra observes its properties, contrasting it to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. During the visit, Lor'themar's other guest, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently draws a group of &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; beasts to the Sunwell, who overwhelm the plateau's guardians and attempt to corrupt it. Thalyssra, Valtrois, and Silgryn join the battle, and the first arcanist adds her magical strength to that of Alleria and &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to close a huge rift portal looming above the Sunwell.\nIn the battle's aftermath, Thalyssra, impressed by the regent's dedication to his people and seeing that the Horde has allowed the sin'dorei to uphold their own ancient traditions, formally pledges the allegiance of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling Suramar's new alliance with the Horde offered them a fresh start, Thalyssra sent &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20%28playable%29\"&gt;nightborne adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Blackguard\"&gt;Ambassador Blackguard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and encouraged them to fight to defend &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and claim a place for the shal'dorei within it. After said adventurers showed the will and courage the nightborne possess, the First Arcanist called them back home to Suramar to honor them &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Shal%27dorei\"&gt;with a symbol of Suramar's gratitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThalyssra was part of the Horde's strike team to free &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. While on the mission they also encountered &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently been captured at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. While Varok refused to go with them, they did accomplish their mission to free Zul and Talanji before fleeing the city. Upon arriving in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; the Horde began trying to earn the Zandalari's trust, and Thalyssra opened a portal to call in &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and Oculeth, who then set up portals to the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that the newly elected &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; was on the right track to gaining the trust of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra departed from &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; in order to attend to her other duties.\nThalyssra attended Talanji's coronation.\nWhen Baine was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Thalyssra was reminded of the rebellion against Elisande and hoped that Baine did not earn a blade in the back as she had. She decided to seek council with Lor'themar due to the similar experiences between their people.\nRise of Azshara.\nThalyssra later joined the Horde fleet under the command of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, who used the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both would be attacked by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas opened. Following the attack, Lor'themar rallied the Horde forces to him, and Thalyssra journeyed on ahead in order to rescue their forces taken prisoner by the naga. Joyed over the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker's&lt;/a&gt; survival, Thalyssra was quick to direct them to rescue the prisoners, nullify the naga's use of the nearby ley lines, and kill &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Ethendriss\"&gt;Tidemistress Ethendriss&lt;/a&gt; who was performing a damnable ritual and calling for the sacrifice of the Horde soldiers. With the Tidemistress dead, the Speaker, Lor'themar, and Thalyssra ventured further into Nazjatar where they encountered &lt;a href=\"Neri%20Sharpfin\"&gt;Neri Sharpfin&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. As they ventured together, they were confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara, who boosted that Nazjatar would be the last thing they would see and promised that she would hold the waters around Nazjatar at bay as long as she remained entertained. Deciding to work together, the Unshackled allowed the Horde to reinforce their base of &lt;a href=\"Newhome\"&gt;Newhome&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde established themselves at Newhome, Thalyssra headed off towards the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Market\"&gt;Drowned Market&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; in order to discover the fates of those she knew. After discovering what became of those she knew, with the exception of her former student &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Commander%20Sivara\"&gt;Sivara&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra and the Speaker were confronted by an astral projection of Queen Azshara who decided to show the First Arcanist why she never reached the title of Grand Magistrix. After the pair survived Azshara's gauntlet, the First Arcanist revealed that they stood in the center of powerful magics, an echo of something Azshara did long ago. Determined to see what it was, the pair communed with this echo which showed them Azshara aligning herself with &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Angered at Azshara for her dark bargain, Thalyssra was then confronted by Sivara, who Thalyssra was stunned to discover had joined Azshara in becoming one of the naga. After a brief fight, Azshara called off her Abyssal Commander leaving Thalyssra to wonder what game Azshara was playing.\nFollowing the successful rescue of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from execution at Sylvanas's orders, Lor'themar thanked the Speaker for saving Baine's life and voiced surprise that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; came to his aid as well. In turn, Thalyssra was surprised by Lor'themar's shock as she recalled the Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; to liberate Suramar from the Legion, which caused Lor'themar to reveal that cooperation between the sides was more the exception than the rule. Thalyssra countered that their animosity only strengthened Azshara and that divided neither Horde or the Alliance would be a match for her. Lor'themar retorted that as long as Sylvanas had the loyalty of the people and as long as she was Warchief the war would never end in their hearts, causing Thalyssra to muse that it might be enough to simply direct their attacks against Azshara over the Alliance. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Shan%20Bu\"&gt;recalling Taran Zhu's words&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar declared that Thalyssra was correct and that they needed to focus their attacks on Azshara but warned that if the Alliance undermined their efforts the flames of war would rise again.\nSeeking to gain control of the Tidestone away from Azshara, Lor'themar directed Thalyssra and the Speaker to investigate the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; for anything potent enough to counter Azshara's sorcery. While there, Thalyssra was confronted by an astral projection of Azshara, who revealed that no spell could be cast in Nazjatar without her knowledge. Though realizing Azshara knew where they were, Thalyssra was determined to press on in order to search for any relics that could be used against her. After discovering that the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were held by one of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Silazsi\"&gt;Azshara's handmaidens&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra declared that they couldn't let this opportunity pass and ordered for the javelins to be retrieved. Thalyssra was then confronted by &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; who accused her of admiring the Highborne's handiwork causing Thalyssra to point out that Suramar had rebelled against Azshara and without their courage, the Burning Legion could have overwhelmed Azeroth. However, Shandris was unmoved and remarked as they walled themselves off, Kalimdor burned around them. The pair were subsequently interrupted by an astral projection of Azshara that caused them to unite against her, to Azshara's amusement.\nWith the Javelins of Suramar, whose magic was ancient and strong, secured, Thalyssra decided it was time to return to Newhome and to deliver the relic to Lor'themar. After Lor'themar learned that the Javelins were obtained, he declared that they would allow them to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Declaring that now was the time to act, Lor'themar directed the Horde to take the fight to the naga. En route, however, the Horde encountered Alliance forces led by Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and after a brief argument, both sides agreed to fight together against Azshara's forces, where during the fighting Thalyssra worked side by side with Jaina. After the Javelins of Suramar were used to shatter the Tidestone's protective barrier around &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Zharessa\"&gt;Lady Zharessa&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra joined the fight against Azshara's champion. After Jaina and Thalyssra combined their magics in order to use the Tidestone to open the way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar warned that they couldn't underestimate Azshara as she was one of the most powerful sorceresses alive but declared, nevertheless, that she must be defeated. However, Lor'themar and Jaina argued about which side would deal the final blow to the Queen only to be interrupted by Azshara herself, who formally invited all of them to enter her palace.\nAccepting Azshara's invitation, Thalyssra was among the forces to strike at the heart of Azshara's power. During the battle against &lt;a href=\"Za%27qul\"&gt;Za'qul&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra personally aided her &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; by using her magic to prevent them from succumbing to Za'qul's madness. Following Azshara's defeat, Thalyssra witnessed the chains binding &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; shatter and its subsequent rescue of Azshara. Thalyssra stood by Lor'themar's side when the Regent Lord vowed to tell his people of what transpired in Nazjatar, of how Azshara fell because the Horde and Alliance stood together, of the rising threat of N'Zoth, and his promise to take his place besides Saurfang and Thrall.\nLor'themar and Thalyssra met Saurfang's loyalists, and the regent lord bluntly revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; has been costly and that battle against Azshara drained what little resources the Horde had left. He further revealed that Sylvanas was now in position to destroy her enemies and he no longer believed that Sylvanas would see reason. Thus, the pair joined Saurfang in his revolution. While Lor'themar warned that Saurfang had some &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;unlikely allies&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra teleported the revolutionary to meet with Saurfang in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. After the revolutionaries and Alliance secured the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Varok ordered of Thalyssra and Jaina with shielding the army from a magical assault. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Thalyssra later attended Saurfang's funeral. Thalyssra stated that Saurfang had spared many lives this day and should they survive against &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, then they will owe their future to Saurfang's sacrifice.\nWhen a distrustful &lt;a href=\"Stoki%20Wonderwand\"&gt;Stoki Wonderwand&lt;/a&gt; refused to allow &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;Former Banshee Loyalist&lt;/a&gt;s the use of her portals within the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra calmed the quarrel and explained to Stoki the importance of forgiveness.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nShortly after the end of the war, Thalyssra reported to Baine in Orgrimmar that &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt; was refusing to work with the staff the Horde had provided for the nightborne's &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; production. These problems were soon resolved by the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and a Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, after which Baine welcomed the vulpera people into the Horde.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he suggested that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created, with Thalyssra representing the nightborne. In the aftermath of the council's formation, Thalyssra reminded Lor'themar that an open invitation to visit her in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; still stood. When Lor'themar tried to object, citing the need to look after Silvermoon, Thalyssra revealed that both &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; (who promised to keep &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; secure) and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; (who threatened to just teleport Lor'themar to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;) endorsed this visit. In response, Lor'themar said that his closest allies had conspired against him which caused Thalyssra to ask if it required a conspiracy for them to spend time alone together. However, Lor'themar was quick to reassure her that it would be his pleasure to visit, the conversation ending with a polite yet suggestive exchange of words between the two.\nBelieving that there was a time for war and pace, Thalyssra thought it best for the Horde to rest and regroup, as one may never know trials and tribulations that yet await them.\nA Moment in Verse.\nThalyssra personally greeted Lor'themar when he arrived to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; where they competed with each other in a friendly poetry contest. She found Lor'themar's poem &lt;a href=\"The%20Adder\"&gt;The Adder&lt;/a&gt; to be marvelously done and recognized that it was about &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal of the blood elven people. Meanwhile, Lor'themar was so moved by Thalyssra's poem &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Moment\"&gt;Spirit of the Moment&lt;/a&gt; that he found himself standing in applause. Following their friendly competition, the pair conversed. During the conversation, Lor'themar admitted the recent events had made his thoughts linger on the past, and on Kael'thas's betrayal in particular. For her part, Thalyssra asked if he was truly healing from the wounds or merely simply reopening the wounds because they are his. As they reflected on things, they grew closer together only to be interrupted by a messenger revealing that Lor'themar was requested to return to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After Lor'themar ordered the messenger to depart, he and Thalyssra shared a kiss.\nShadows Rising.\nIn light of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;wounds&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting, Thalyssra pointed that acting rashly could threaten the armistice. After the failed assassination attempt on Talanji, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, Thalyssra and the rest of the Horde leaders were forced into action. They empowered the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nUpon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. The meeting concluded with the council voting for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, to which Thalyssra personally teleported the pair to the meeting site. Sometime after, Thalyssra used her teleportation skills to bring the Horde army to Zandalar to help Talanji and the Zandalari against the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; assaulting &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;his Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. She personally fought in the conflict and joined the victory celebration afterward.\nShadowlands.\nThalyssra was among the Horde leaders to convene with the leaders of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. While desiring to rescue her comrades Thalyssra knew that she couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission. In light of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s hostility when &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; encouraged the Alliance to do the same, she prepared herself for battle but stood down when Bolvar called for it. She then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and watched as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even Tyrande Whisperwind enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas. Thalyssra subsequently departed from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra and Lor'themar briefly traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to attend Sylvanas' trial.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nThalyssra and Lor'themar invited a number of Azeroth's leaders to the wedding at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. During the ceremony itself, they had &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; serve as their officiator and exchanged their vows through poetry. After the wedding crasher &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; caused a scene with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra arrived to see what happened and subsequently gave Kurog more courtesy than he showed her by allowing him to leave on his own two feet, while having &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; serve as his escort out. Wrathion then formally apologized to the newlyweds for his role in the scene, to which Thalyssra expressed her regret that their security was insufficient and that one of their guests had been exposed to such vitriol.\nDragonflight.\nSome after the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; had accepted the dragon aspects to explore the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra went to the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, where she seemed prepared to see the expedition depart. It was there that she and her husband mused on how they were fortunate to have had a brief respite and playfully bantered about who proposed to who.\nQuotes.\nShal'Aran.\n&lt;Thalyssra is shaking uncontrollably and can barely speak. &lt;Her hunger must be sated before all else.&gt;\nNighthold.\nIt had to be this way.

The two arches of the Thandol Span were built to bridge the gap between &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and to serve as both an economic and a symbolic bridge between the dwarven territories. Prosperity was gained by the two dwarven kingdoms as a result of mutual trade.\nSecond War.\nThe bridges were capable of supporting the weight of entire armies and served as the main route of trade between the dwarves and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s lost the battle for Lordaeron and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; kept pushing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; out of the continent to Khaz Modan through the Thandol Span.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe mighty bridges recently suffered heavy damage due to a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; attack planned by &lt;a href=\"Kam%20Deepfury\"&gt;Kam Deepfury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balgaras%20the%20Foul\"&gt;Balgaras the Foul&lt;/a&gt;. One of the two bridges was all but destroyed, and dwarven forces fought fiercely to defend the last remaining bridge and retake the nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt;.

Though Hjalmar didn't survive, his sacrifice saved the last remaining bridge of the Span from annihilation. With King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;'s dwarven reinforcements and the death of the Dark Iron leader, Balgaras the Foul, the company of heroes were able to drive away the Dark Iron invaders from Thandol Span and reclaim it for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe Dark Iron dwarves abandoned their small encampment near the Span, which became home to a friendly &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Entrepreneur\"&gt;Dark Iron Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; who sells uncommon quality items.

The Thandol Span is solid and large, a blocky stone edifice with numerous thick support columns plunging into the water. &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces damaged the bridge in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Great sections broke off and now lie beneath the waves, some visible at low tides. Nevertheless, the Thandol Span is still easily navigable and serves as the only land route between Lordaeron and the southern continents."}

However, when it became clear that the sethrak were too many, Zem'lan instead gathered his crew on the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Isle\"&gt;Golden Isle&lt;/a&gt; and conducted a ritual with three magical idols to curse his crew into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20troll\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, forced to serve him for eternity.\nThus, in the present day, the port is almost entirely inhabited by Zem'lan's skeletal pirates.

Listening to languages it does not understand confuses the head; it will return no results and light its gemstone eyes in confusion. \nMore complex portable heads possess a body of knowledge on a particular subject.

When it does possess knowledge, it will speak the answer via a small, vibrating membrane hidden in its \"mouth.\"\nSpoken languages are translated automatically when a portable head is active, but multiple nearby speakers easily confuse it. \nA portable head can operate for 6 hours before its internal boiler requires a fresh dose of liquid &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;.."}

For example, in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, the portal trainer is located in the center of the city, near the Silvermoon and Exodar city portals.\nNon-mage portal spell.\nThere are several portal spells not exclusive to mages.\nThere was also an item that opened a portal to the heart of Maraudon - &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Celebras\"&gt;Scepter of Celebras&lt;/a&gt;, but it could only be used on an altar just before entering the instance. The portal ability was phased out in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, and replaced with weapon stats.\nEtiquette.\nWhile most mages will offer portals for partymates at the end of quest, runs, etc., to ask for one outside of this should be approached tactfully.\nHere are a few guidelines to keep in mind.\nFollowing these fairly simple guidelines will help you get along with your fellow players, and it makes people remember you.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;Ley line&lt;/a&gt;s are harnessed to make portals possible, but traffic from across the planet will break down the infrastructure and it must be periodically replaced.\nThe standard dimensions for a mage portal are 3 yards, 1 foot, and 3/4 inches tall, 2 yards, 8 feet, 9 and 15/16 inches wide.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; creates and enforces the rules of portal usage for all legitimate mages on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As sometimes demonstrated by archmages such as &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, portals can actually be created to go anywhere, and the spell's vast potential is what makes it so dangerous (for example, the for Dalaran and the consequences for &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Jorny%20the%20Deified\"&gt;Crusader Jorny the Deified&lt;/a&gt;, and why unlicensed portal creation outside drop-off zones is punishable by death). There are hundreds of rules that the Kirin Tor has already created for safe and proper portal usage and mages are required to abide by every single one of them, including special licensing to make sure certain actions are only carried out by responsible individuals.\nNevertheless, in practice portals have a history of being a burden on any society in which it is offered to the general public, and of all the major spells developed and maintained by the Kirin Tor, portal technology is the closest to becoming banished from anything but emergency usage.\nA variation of the portal spell can be used to enchant mirrors for two-way communication across vast distances.\nPortals have been used to help evacuate entire settlements and cities in times of crisis and emergency, such as &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, although it apparently requires tremendous amounts of time and effort to maintain them in the long term, as well to fully evacuate populations using portals alone. It was mentioned that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; could not move armies through portals as one did handful of individuals, and that most travelers could go through portals by twos or three at the most, a very useful way for an individual to quickly get from one place to another, but not ideal for massive evacuations.\nPortals are suitable for moving a handful of individuals easily, but not usually stable enough for moving whole armies. Typically, large, stable portals require a person channeling and maintaining it on the other side. People cannot enter portals at the same time when going in opposite directions, but can enter portals in up to twos or threes going in the same direction.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, portal and teleport spells are a great privilege and responsibility; however, portals and teleportations are negatively used as a means for garbage repository in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparently, elven mages typically like to put a little flair, a signature, in their portal magic."}

He now haunts the city making sure that nobody tampers with the mail, and he has sworn that not even hail, sleet, or snow shall stop him.\nMalown is the sole source of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Postmaster\"&gt;Postmaster&lt;/a&gt; set.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHe appears, still active, in the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28pet%20battle%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; pet dungeon.\nSummoning the Postmaster.\nDungeon.\nIn order to spawn the Postmaster, you must tamper with the Stratholme mail system. To do this, you'll need keys (In patch 4.1 these were removed and no longer needed) to the mailboxes, which are held by the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Courier\"&gt;Stratholme Courier&lt;/a&gt;, who is lounging outside &lt;a href=\"Fras%20Siabi\"&gt;Fras Siabi&lt;/a&gt;'s shop near the main instance entrance. Head into the instance and make your first two lefts, and you'll see him behind the pack of undead. The courier himself is an easy kill (he is initially &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt;, so you can clear the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s around him and take him out solo), and drops 3 keys which open specific mailboxes scattered around the areas near the city gates. Beware of &lt;a href=\"Skul\"&gt;Skul&lt;/a&gt;, who can spawn with the undead in front of the courier and make that pull more difficult.\nOpen the mailboxes with the keys: each time you open one, 3 elite &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Postman\"&gt;Undead Postman&lt;/a&gt; mobs will attack. They frequently cast some nasty &lt;a href=\"curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;s, including one that does 500 damage after 60 seconds (and stacks multiple times), and one that reduces all &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; by a fixed percent. In general, it is better \"not\" to immediately remove all curses from party members and just heal through the damage, because they will be reapplied almost instantly. Instead, concentrate on &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; and keep everyone's life at a high level, and decurse near the end or after the fight. Otherwise, your &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; will waste all his or her time and mana decursing rather than healing or DPSing.\nThere are 6 mailboxes, but you only get three keys, so it's possible to get lucky and have keys to easily accessible mailboxes, or unlucky and get keys to the more remote mailboxes. When you open the third mailbox you have a key for, Malown spawns with his 3 cronies, making it a 4-elite ambush. This can be devastating to an unprepared party, as Malown hits like a truck and the curses from his buddies can quickly stack up.\nPet battle instance.\nTo summon Malown in the pet battle instance, you need to find a &lt;a href=\"Discarded%20Letter\"&gt;Discarded Letter&lt;/a&gt; which can spawn behind the lampost at , at , , and , and and bring it to the mailbox at . After Malown spawns, he despawns after 20 minutes.\nIn Wrath of the Lich King.\nIn \"Wrath of the Lich King\" Malown can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Stratholme\"&gt;Road to Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, alive and sleeping on the second floor of an inn. The same inn two other Stratholme mini-bosses can be found in: &lt;a href=\"Hearthsinger%20Forresten\"&gt;Hearthsinger Forresten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fras%20Siabi\"&gt;Fras Siabi&lt;/a&gt;."}
