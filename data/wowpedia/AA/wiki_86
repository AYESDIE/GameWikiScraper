She always appears in the first cave of the Caverns, but spawns in one of four locations around the room.\nAnacondra has a chance to drop the &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Belt of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;, which is the rarest part of the bind-on-pickup &lt;a href=\"Embrace%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Embrace of the Viper&lt;/a&gt; set; the drop rate for this is quite low and efforts to farm Anacondra for it are frequently frustrating.\nWherever Anacondra spawns, there will be other mobs to deal with around her. She's actually more difficult to kill than either &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Cobrahn\"&gt;Cobrahn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Serpentis\"&gt;Serpentis&lt;/a&gt;, due to these adds. Be careful of the raptors, if they are about to die they will call for assistance, and other Druids of the Fang, or other raptors will come to help out. If you are not prepared for this you could very possibly wipe. It is best to kill as many of the enemies around Anacondra before engaging her. She will cast a lightning bolt similar to a Shaman's and will cast Sleep on occasional party members, removing them from combat for 10\u201315 seconds. The range on the Lightning bolts is very large, so be careful if your cloth wearers or priests are getting attacked.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nLady Anacondra appears as a in the \"\" mini-set for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

She lived in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; and an echo of her can still be found there, watching the &lt;a href=\"jed%27hin\"&gt;jed'hin&lt;/a&gt; match at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Aspirants\"&gt;Circle of Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;. She says she had a hand in picking the prize for the victor and thinks they will be very pleased.\nIt was her intimate knowledge of the draenei's holy magics that caused &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to bestow the beacon upon Calindris after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Shar%27gel\"&gt;Battle of Shar'gel&lt;/a&gt;. After several years and a series of grim rituals, Calindris bent T'uure to her will and transformed the artifact into a dark reflection of itself. Instead of spreading hope, it would now spread fear, and where once the relic had healed, now it would cause wounds to fester.\nCalindris loathed the draenei and relished in the thought of befouling their cherished artifact. She grew so adept at wielding the corrupted staff that Kil'jaeden gave her a special task, assigning her as a torturer on the Legion's prison worlds. Calindris made an art out of inflicting suffering on her captives, and images of T'uure filled their nightmares. Eventually, Calindris received a vision of the future, much like the &lt;a href=\"Askara\"&gt;selfless draenei priestess&lt;/a&gt; who had once wielded the staff. She saw a vision of the Legion invading the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and bathing it in fel fire, but strangely, she herself was not there. T'uure, however, was. A stranger wielded the artifact in its true, uncorrupted form, and its &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; blinded the Legion's forces, shining like a second sun as it had on &lt;a href=\"Shar%27gel\"&gt;Shar'gel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the Legion's third invasion of Azeroth, a &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; in search of T'uure traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to heal a wounded draenei named &lt;a href=\"Defender%20Barrem\"&gt;Defender Barrem&lt;/a&gt;, who has mentioned T'uure in his delirious sleep. After cleansing his felcursed wounds, the priest and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt; learn from Barrem that he was taken to a prison world and shared a cell with another draenei named &lt;a href=\"Alora\"&gt;Alora&lt;/a&gt;. The two managed to escape through a portal back to Azeroth, but while Barrem managed to reach the safety of the water, Alora tripped and was dragged back. The priest and Boros travel to &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20Isle\"&gt;Darkstone Isle&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; where they rescue Alora from a &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;, after which she tells them of seeing a man'ari eredar carrying the darkened T'uure on the prison world. The conversation is interrupted as &lt;a href=\"Subjugator%20Valith\"&gt;Subjugator Valith&lt;/a&gt; appears and attacks the three, but the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; suddenly leaps down from a nearby pillar and kills the &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of Boros and the holy priest. Jace informs the priest that Alora's description perfectly matches that of Lady Calindris, but that the eredar is his prey and that he has been chasing her minions all over the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; for some time. Jace does, however, agree to assist Boros and the priest in killing Calindris, as he is after her soul, not her equipment.\nAfter stepping through the portal, the priest, Boros and Jace arrive in the hold of a Legion ship on the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. As the three battle their way through the complex and free a &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bo%27ja\"&gt;Bo'ja&lt;/a&gt;, Calindris notices their presence and sends &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Naranoth\"&gt;Captain Naranoth&lt;/a&gt; to stop them. After defeating Naranoth, Bo'ja tells the party that Calindris is outside the ship, directing her demons to load up more captives, and that the mage has a score to settle with the eredar. The demon hunter, paladin, mage and priest confront Lady Calindris just outside the ship, but near the end of the fight she uses her dark magic to incapacitate Bo'ja, Jace and Boros, leaving only the priest to fight the demon. However, the darkened T'uure gradually begins to absorb the holy magic from the priest's spells, and after the priest sufficiently damages Calindris, T'uure escapes from her grasp and engulfs her in holy magic, which instantly kills her. As the priest picks up T'uure, their companions are freed from the eredar's magic, and Bo'ja opens up a portal back to Dalaran to allow the priest to return triumphant with the purified T'uure in hand.\nObjective of.\nShe needs to be defeated for the sixth and penultimate stage of &lt;a href=\"Return%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Return of the Light&lt;/a&gt;."}

Perhaps you can go sell them on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;? But before you go, be a good &lt;boy/girl&gt; and check with the other collectors present. They may have an errand to send you off on.\nWhat is it now, &lt;class&gt;, I haven't got all day? The Horde has completed its collections and now waits only on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to organize themselves and do the same. Perhaps you should be out there looking for the pieces of &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;:the Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; so that you can ring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;gong&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Dais\"&gt;Scarab Dais&lt;/a&gt;, opening the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and thereby starting the war?\nYes, you heard true, &lt;class&gt;, all of our collections are complete and the last of the war materiel should arrive in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; within 5 days. I am told that once all is assembled there, and our troops readied, someone from within the ranks of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;you heroes&lt;/a&gt; is going to ring the gong outside of Ahn'Qiraj, already having assembled the Scepter of the Shifting Sands to do so with. I hope that we don't have to wait too long for that to happen.\nRelatives.\nShe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Genavie%20Callow\"&gt;Genavie Callow&lt;/a&gt;."}

Which means... you must be new around here! Let me introduce you to my darlings!\n&lt;She points to one of the manakittens.&gt;\nThis is Shadow. He's always losing his toys, carrying them off on his many adventures. Where do you go, little one? Down to the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Menagerie&lt;/a&gt; to see the exotic creatures of the world? Through the fragrant &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyard&lt;/a&gt;? Perhaps next time you can bring back a trinket from your travels! Well, I suppose he did bring me back something from one of his excursions once. My sweet boy, Mew! One day I opened the door to let him in and, much to my surprise and delight, he had a little friend with him! And any friend of Shadow's must become a friend of mine.\nAt first, he was peculiarly wary of me and wouldn't let me pet him, which, of course, made me even more determined. It took several years of persistence and T-R-E-A-T-S, never underestimate the power of T-R-E-A-T-S, but he has warmed up to me and we're BEST FRIENDS, just like I am with all of my other kitties!\nI have to spell out the word so he doesn't hear me, otherwise he will caterwaul and beg, and, well, how can I say no to those enchanting eyes? Just look at them, look at them! They're so full of love and warmth and it just makes me so happy and warm inside! I do try to ration them out a bit so he doesn't become spoiled but, oh why am I putting on pretenses, I give him exactly how much he wants!\nThese kittens certainly deserve the best because they are the best and I wish I could share them with everyone in the world but I can't. Believe me, I've tried. It just means so much to me that you are here and can pet them. It's a good thing that I had two other cats to pet when I was gaining Mew's trust because if I didn't, why it pains me even now to think about this, it would have tormented me! Imagine having a home with no cat in it! I wouldn't even say that's a home, just a place you live in and if you don't have a cat then are you really living? Speaking of those two cats, there's one of them now, Mrs. Fluffymuffins!\n&lt;She points to a third manakitten.&gt;\nLook at her, just sitting so patiently... I must say she has the most wonderful imagination when it comes to food. You would think she would be content with the fine fish we have here but, on the contrary, Mrs. Fluffymuffins is quite the connoisseur when it comes to tasyu things. Believe it or not, her favorite food is, I can hardly believe it myself, mana cake!\nI suppose it makes sense since my parents used to trea--excuse me, T-R-E-A-T her to it when I was a young girl. Only cat, only child... we made quite the pair.\n&lt;She starts sobbing.&gt;\nSorry, I'm getting emotional... I just really love cats. I love every kind of cat. &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Carrier%20%28Bombay%29\"&gt;Bombay cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Carrier%20%28Calico%20Cat%29\"&gt;calico cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Carrier%20%28Siamese%29\"&gt;siamese cats&lt;/a&gt;, tabby cats, fel-infused cats, not fel-infused cats, &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Striped%20Dawnsaber\"&gt;dawnsabers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"felsaber\"&gt;felsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Flamesaber\"&gt;flamesabers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"manasaber\"&gt;manasaber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Swift%20Mistsaber\"&gt;mistsabers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Moonsaber\"&gt;moonsabers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Runesaber\"&gt;runesabers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Swift%20Stormsaber\"&gt;stormsabers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"panthara\"&gt;panthara&lt;/a&gt;, their coloration is gorgeous, especially the indigo variety, yet some say their temperament is unruly, however, I think those people just don't understand them like I do, &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Spectral%20Tiger\"&gt;spectral tigers&lt;/a&gt;... The absolute first thing I did upon leaving &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; was to meet every kind of cat that I could, and I want to hug them all, but I can't hug every cat.\n&lt;She begins to cry again.&gt;\n&lt;She pauses for a moment, composing herself.&gt;\nOh, I haven't introduced you to the rest of darlings yet!\nHere is Bella! She used to antagonize Mrs. Fluffymuffins when she was a kitten, when Bella was a kitten, not when Mrs. Fluffymuffins was a kitten, that would be silly because she's ancient, and, oh my, it was during one of those spats that the poor dear tore her ear!\nYou can't tell now because I, of course had Suramar's finest physician and surgeon attend to her. Ah, and here's Ash. What a wily boy he can be! He loves to climb anything he can put his paws on and steal the other kitties' toys, which was quite a bother to the other three cats when he arrived. Bella doesn't mind, though, as she was just a kitten when she first met him. He especially enjoys stealing Shadow's toy ball, which really upsets him as it's his favorite. Usually I wouldn't let him keep something that filthy in my home but he loves it so it stays.\n&lt;She looks into the distance for a moment, lost in thought.&gt;\n...Sorry, I just, I REALLY LOVE CATS. I want to pet all of them but I can't because they're not here. I can't pet EVERY cat. I can just pet my own cats and that's going to have to be enough.\n&lt;She wipes away a tear from her eye, and you sense that this may be your chance to end the conversation.&gt;"}

{"id": "247542", "revid": "35159954", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=247542", "title": "Lady Deathwhisper", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; Lady Deathwhisper is the Supreme Overseer of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and the second boss of the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; raid. The fight is mostly a &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; (with a high damage output it becomes significantly easier), but also requires high awareness from all raid members. The 25-player Heroic version of this boss is one of the most difficult encounters in the instance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Deathwhisper was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill her once again.\nPreparation.\nThis encounter requires two tanks (in 25 player a third tank is optional). The encounter is not particularly healing intensive, so two healers (five in 25-player) are fine. The raid sets up within range of the boss at the center of the room. In 10 player, one tank alternates between the left and right gates (starting left), while the other tank can DPS. In 25 player, one tank stands left, the other right, and the optional third one at the stairs. With two tanks in 25 player, the add from the stairs must be misdirected to one of the side tanks.\nHer enrage timer is 10 minutes.\nPhase One.\nThis Phase is all about killing the adds quickly and efficiently. Ranged DPS in particular need to switch their target frequently, and be highly aware of the general situation.\nPhase 1 ends as soon as her mana shield is down. During the phase, all damage she takes is deducted from her mana, Phase 2 starts as soon as it reaches zero. Phase 1 should not take longer than 7 minutes, else there won't be enough time to kill her prior to the enrage.\nDuring Phase 1 she needs no tank. She spams Shadow Bolt, Death and Decay and Dominate Mind on random raid members (Dominate Mind is only cast in 25-player mode, it affects one raid member in normal mode, and multiple targets in heroic mode). The mind controlled raid members need to be &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;led.\nAlso randomly, she places Death and Decay, and AoE DoT. Raid members need to move out of this quickly.\nAfter 5 seconds of combat and every 60 seconds thereafter 3/7 (10/25 player) adds spawn. In 10 player, 3 adds spawn alternatively from the three gates on the left and right side. In 25 player, 3 adds spawn on each side every time, and a seventh add of a random type spawns on the stairs. The three gates on the left side of the room always spawn two fanatics and one adherent, the right side gates one fanatic and two adherents. All types of adds can be CC'd.\nLiving adds can explode (dark martyrdom) at random times, which deals AoE damage and turns them into their reanimated versions. &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Fanatic\"&gt;Reanimated Fanatic&lt;/a&gt;s (melee) are immune to physical damage, &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Adherent\"&gt;Reanimated Adherent&lt;/a&gt;s are immune to magical damage. Also at random, Lady Deathwhisper buffs living adds. Buffed Adherents become \"Empowered Adherents\", adding an uninterruptible AOE spell to their abilities, buffed Fanatics are \"Deformed Fanatics\" and double their melee damage output. These four special add types are the most dangerous, and must be killed as priority targets.\nAdherents are caster mobs who spam deathchill bolt, put a cooldown increasing curse on random players, and sometimes shield themselves with a spell reflect shield. The shield (Shroud of the Occult) takes 50,000 damage to remove. While the shield is on them, silencing effects like &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; do not work.\nFanatics have a high melee DPS output and a vicious cleave (melee DPS must take care to stand behind them). When buffed (as Deformed Fanatics), they double their damage output. Deformed Fanatics should be kited, which is quite easy because their movement speed is halved. Fanatics (either normal or deformed) are sometimes buffed with Vampiric Might which is another 25% damage increase, plus a self heal for 3x the damage they cause. This can (and should) be removed with a Shaman's &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt; or a Mage's &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt;. Spellsteal is the preferred method since it benefits the Mage.\nAny adds present when the mana shield is depleted stay up for phase 2. If an add wave was about to spawn it may still spawn after Phase 2 started. If such a situation is likely to develop, stop DPS should be called.\nBasic Tactic.\nThe basic method described above is to assign the tanks to the spawn locations. The left and right sides also get a fixed set of melee damage dealers (more to the right side, fewer to the left). When adds spawn, all ranged DPS switch and kill the adds right where they spawn. After all adds are dead, all damage dealers switch back to the Boss, a few seconds prior to the next wave, melee run back to the spawn locations.\nThis method feels rather natural and it leads to a distributed setup, which helps minimizing the effect of Death and Decay. The drawbacks are rather low DPS (particularly by melee), and frequent target switching.\nWith some practice, melee can concentrate on the caster adds, and ranged help on the melee adds, if overall DPS is high enough, ranged need to switch only if one of the special adds comes up. Adherents can be gathered by &lt;a href=\"Line%20of%20sight\"&gt;Line of sight&lt;/a&gt; pulling, using the nearby walls.\nBecause of their heavy reliance on DoTs, Affliction Warlocks and Shadow Priests might be more useful if they're assigned to continually attack the boss, and only attack the adds in cases of emergency, as burst damage tends to bring the adds down fairly quickly.\nAlternate Tactic.\nA different approach is to group all ranged and healers behind the boss (opposite to the stairs), and set up the tanks and melee group on the stairs side of the boss (on the edge of her hitbox). The whole raid hits the boss until adds spawn. At that time, the DPS casters set up an AoE kill zone (including some snares) right on the melee group. Adds normally aggro healers. Melee adds try to move to them and usually die while passing through the kill zone. Caster adds frequently stop outside the kill zone (and their shields protect them from the AoE). As in the normal method, tanks and melee must move to the caster adds, but the casters stand much closer to the melee group, and thus melee don't have to run far.The special add types still need extra care.\nThe advantage of this tactic is that damage output is substantially higher, and AoE healing is more effective. The drawback is that the raid stands quite concentrated on one spot, this makes Death and Decay much more dangerous.\nPhase Two.\nAfter her shield is down, Lady Deathwhisper switches to a new set of abilities, she gets an aggro table (in effect her threat is reset) and also starts to melee and cast Frostbolt volley. No more Adherents or Fanatics spawn, instead Vengeful Spirits randomly spawn near players.\nHer Frostbolt spell should be interrupted. Dominate Mind and Death and Decay continue as before. She stacks an ability called Touch of Insignificance on her tank. This reduces threat generation by 20% per stack (stacks to 5). On normal difficulty, she can be taunted. The standard tactic (on normal mode) is for the tanks to taunt her off each other to allow the debuff to fall off. In theory a single tank can keep her by using taunt on every CD, but this is only a short-term solution as diminishing returns ensures that she eventually becomes taunt-immune.\nVengeful Spirits pick a random target and follow it for 10 seconds, they explode for 25,000 shadowfrost AoE damage when they catch up. In normal difficulty it's possible to heal through this, in heroic mode probably not. Players targeted by a Vengeful Spirit need to kite it until it goes away.\nHeroic Mode.\nOther than every ability simply hitting harder the main difference in the encounter that may encourage groups to alter their strategy is the doubled hit points (but not mana) on Lady Deathwhisper thus extending phase two.\nThe heroic encounter is similar to the &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; encounter. Raids probably cannot focus all DPS on adds because more damage must be done on Deathwhisper. It seems likely that &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; may be needed on at least some of the adds through the entirety of phase 2 in order to beat the enrage timer, at least until the encounter is outgeared.\nConfirmed live heroic mode differences:\nOne novel strategy is to have one tank kite the Fanatics around the room for the entirety of the fight much like the &lt;a href=\"Razorgore%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Razorgore the Untamed&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; since they are affected by all movement impairing effects.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Though it appeared to be a featureless golden disk, it was, in fact, a talisman of immense power that could be used to destroy or enslave other &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. The artifact was forged by Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s, fused with the taint of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and finally mixed with the blood of Deathwing himself.\nThe Demon Soul was once fastened to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Chain\"&gt;Demon Chain&lt;/a&gt;, a seemingly ordinary loop of ornamental &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; chain that fills one's mind with dread as it touches one's flesh. The Soul has long since been destroyed, but the Chain, which may hold some residual power, was last seen in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nAt some point shortly before the War of the Ancients, Neltharion used the skills of his goblin artificer-servants to create an artifact of incredible power. It was fastened to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Chain\"&gt;a chain&lt;/a&gt; forged of &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt;. The golden, perfect disk was infused with the power of his &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; masters, and with both the essence of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Neltharion sought to use it to control the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, and make himself a god to be worshiped by the mortal races.\nDuring an accidental cave-in that tore a scale from his body, Neltharion found that his matter - even as small as a scale - could and did damage the Soul. He thus had to take great care to avoid damaging it. When it was ready, Neltharion revealed his creation to his fellow Aspects and convinced them to give their own essences, which then made them and their flight unable to damage the disc.\nIn the last combined fight of the dragons of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion arrayed the dragons of all the other flights into a magical matrix that enhanced the device's power greatly. During this battle, Neltharion revealed his madness and used the Dragon Soul to wreak havoc on both the Burning Legion and the helpless night elves, killing thousands and demanding that all of Azeroth, including the other dragon flights and the Great Aspects, bow to his mastery. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspect of Magic, and his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; attempted to stop Neltharion, who summarily executed the entirety of the blue flight with the exception of Malygos himself. The other dragons were locked in Neltharion's control until the unexpected intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; broke his concentration and allowed the other dragons to counter-attack. This proved a failure, however, and Neltharion scattered the hundreds of assembled dragons before retreating from the field of battle, taking the Dragon Soul with him.\nIn time, it became clear that the powerful Soul was corrupting Neltharion's body, causing it to bloat and tear; his beloved creation was ripping him apart. With the aid of his goblin artificers, Neltharion had immense adamantium plates bolted into the scales in order to keep the destructive power at bay. Driven completely to madness, it is around this time (probably influenced by the future-Korialstrasz, known as &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;) that the artifact became known as the Demon Soul, and that Neltharion received the name he is known by today. In order to prevent it from being used against them again, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz (Krasus), along with the night elf druid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to steal the artifact. Malfurion succeeded in obtaining the artifact but was captured by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s soldiers led by his own brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, who had agreed to obtain the artifact to allow &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; entry into Azeroth.\nThe Soul was used as part of a portal to be opened within the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; itself. Before the portal could be opened, however, the Soul's spellwork was disrupted, reversing the portal to pull the Legion out of Azeroth, but also beginning the Sundering. As it fell towards the Well of Eternity's surface, it was seized by none other than Nozdormu who brought it far into the future. After the Sundering of the World finished, and the artifact's return from the future, Malfurion, and the four remaining Aspects placed a spell on the Demon Soul that would prevent Deathwing from ever using it again, and then hid the foul disk in a place where only the four dragons would find it, but not Deathwing.\nSecond War.\nAt some point, Deathwing still found out the location of the Demon Soul in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; anyway. As the weapon had been enchanted after the war so that no dragon could wield it, the black leviathan couldn't touch it, but others like the new-coming &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s could. So ten thousand years later, after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing granted visions to &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the orcish &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. The visions manipulated him toward a hidden place deep beneath the mountains, protected by wards and the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Orastrasz\"&gt;Orastrasz&lt;/a&gt;. Dozens of Dragonmaw orcs died against Orastrasz, unfamiliar as they were with dragons, but they succeeded. Zuluhed ordered his clan's greatest warlock, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the Dragon Soul. Sensing the dark power within, Nekros renamed it the Demon Soul. Far from the Redridge Mountains, Alexstrasza sensed the wards breaking and grew concerned when she heard no word from Orastrasz. She and several of her red dragons hurried south, though she believed that some mortal had found the disc and Orastrasz was currently hunting for it and that it would be easy to help him retrieve. In truth, they were heading right into Deathwing's trap.\nDeathwing taught Nekros how to use the Demon Soul through dreams and visions. With it, the Dragonmaw clan was able to enslave Alexstrasza shortly after the Horde assaulted &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. He could not use it on the other dragons as he had to focus on her, but by lashing out at Alexstrasza with the disc's power whenever her dragons tried to intervene, Nekros was able to get them to do as he ordered. Alexstrasza was brought to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, where she was forced to lay eggs. The adult dragons were used as powerful war mounts, while the eggs would be raised as loyal &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;. Korialstrasz - in his guise as Krasus, a member of the senior council of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; - had discovered Deathwing's identity as Lord Prestor, and his revealing the location of the Soul to the orcs. Sending his student, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, on a mission to free Alexstrasza, Krasus attempted to obtain the aid of the other three Aspects - Malygos, Nozdormu, and Ysera - to free Alexstrasza from the orcs, and subsequently from Deathwing himself.\nRhonin, who had been \"rescued\" by Deathwing twice during the course of his mission, was manipulated by the black Aspect to locate Alexstrasza and free her (or so he led Rhonin to believe). Giving him one of his scales to act as a talisman, allowing him to communicate with Rhonin and see what the human mage saw, Deathwing sent Rhonin on his way to Grim Batol. He finally discovered Alexstrasza's location and the imminent moveout of the Dragonmaw clan (under the belief that the Alliance intended to invade). As Deathwing held the upper hand in a battle with the other, weakened Aspects, including the now-free Alexstrasza, Rhonin was able to use the scale Deathwing had given him to destroy the disk. Cutting the scale across the surface, Rhonin unleashed the power trapped within, and with a quick spell, returned to the Aspects their essence given at the creation of the Dragon Soul, who proceeded to defeat and hunt their treacherous brother.\nNight of the Dragon.\nThough the Demon Soul's power was lost with its destruction, it still had enough power within it to be of some use. &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Consort of the Destroyer, collected the fragments of the Demon Soul and found power within them still. Using their power combined with &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, a stolen staff of the naaru and the essence of the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, Sintharia (or Sinestra, as she preferred to be called) experimented with the eggs of various dragonflights. The end result was the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, a sinister creation that could absorb magical energy from any living thing - particularly enemy dragons. One such monstrosity, &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;, was a cunning and ambitious creature who sought to overthrow his \"mother\" and take the world for himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin of the Windrunner sisters, had allied himself with Sintharia in order to gain access to a vast fount of energy and steal the partially restored Demon Soul. Ultimately this brought him into conflict with his cousin &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, who sought revenge for Zendarin's attempted kidnapping of her twin sons. The battle resulted in the death of Zendarin and the final destruction of the Demon Soul, when the naaru staff he carried touched the foul artifact as he released all of its energy. This was possible because Sintharia had shielded the artifact from all Azerothian magic, and the staff had been from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Sintharia attempted to reconstruct it - having fallen to the same protective madness over the artifact as Deathwing had - but it was once again destroyed, this time for good, when it impacted with the unstable Balacgos's Bane thrown by Korialstrasz, obliterating both artifacts.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the battle against &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the Old God showed a vision of the Dragon Aspects creating the Dragon Soul ten thousand years earlier, when the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s entered his mind.\nCataclysm.\nCharge of the Aspects.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the aspects gathered to discuss how to end Deathwing once and for all, and after listening to the research gathered by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his flight it had become clear to them that they needed a weapon like none that had ever come before it. A short while later &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; realized that the Demon Soul was, in fact, that weapon and proposed using to her fellow Aspects. While initially doubtful &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; was convinced by Ysera and Kalec of the need to use the artifact and was given the task to convince &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; of this need as well. Nozdormu hesitated to do believing that doing so would make no different than &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, but Alexstrasza made him see that the intention was noble and ultimately convinced him that they needed the demon soul.\nCaverns of Time.\nWith a gateway to the past open, Nozdormu transported adventurers to Azshara's palace, where they witnessed one of the most catastrophic events in the War of the Ancients. While assisting the much younger Tyrande and Illidan in a battle against the Highborne and Burning Legion, adventurers stole the Dragon Soul hovering above the Well. With so many of Azshara's most empowered wizards locked in ritual and pouring their magical energies into the turbulent depths of the Well, retrieving the Dragon Soul required victory over some lethal foes.\nAfter recovering a version of the artifact from the Caverns of Time, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the allied dragonflights rallied at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate bid to use its might to defeat Deathwing. Created by the titans as a sanctuary for all dragonkin, the crumbling Wyrmrest Temple was now the final hope for the forces allied against the black dragon Neltharion, once the Earth-Warder and protector of Azeroth, now Deathwing the Destroyer.\nHour of Twilight.\nIt is here that the remaining aspects -- Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, and Thrall -- have gathered to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth. As they begin to charge the Dragon Soul with energy, Deathwing and his entire army assault Wyrmrest Temple. Heroes had to thwart the attacking forces long enough for Thrall to charge the Dragon Soul.\nAfter the heroes of Azeroth defeated Ultraxion Thrall unleashed the Dragon Soul, injuring the corrupted aspect. Deathwing fled the battle to recover in Deepholm but he was pursued and badly injured by another shot from the artifact. Deathwing fell into the Maelstrom, and losing what little remained of his sanity he rose up without his armor and deformed. The heroes of Azeroth and the Aspects were able to successfully delay him long enough to finish charging the Dragon Soul, and with a single blast from the artifact, the Destroyer was no more. Ironically, the artifact that had been created to dominate and enslave the world had ended up saving it from destruction.\nThe Dragon Soul was returned to its exact time in history.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Dragon Soul appears as for the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Its flavor text reads: \"Crafted by Deathwing's goblin horde, but the dragon added the rainbow sparkles himself.\""}

Although this power was ripped away, they are determined to get it back. Many of these power hungry mortals gather secretly to practice the forbidden arts of &lt;a href=\"demonology\"&gt;demonology&lt;/a&gt; and to summon demons from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. They seek to usher in a new era of power at the hands of the Burning Legion.\nWhile cultists follow a unified agenda to regain their power, a great deal of distrust lingers between the races. As such, demon cults seldom include members of more than one &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon cultists obsess over gaining &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; or political power of any kind. They infiltrate communities and political structures to deceive key individuals in an attempt to gain wealth for their fellow cult members, to position themselves in places of authority, or even eliminate a threat that comes to close to learning the presence of a cult. Cult members in public are polite, well dressed, and very difficult to find, sometimes being high members of tribal councils or governing bodies. Primarily businessmen, traders, &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, smugglers, and clerks comprise a cult's ranks; soldiers are uncommon but not unknown in their ranks. Cult members carry on normal lives separate from the one another in the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s and cities in which they live. They hold their meetings in the wilderness just beyond civilization, in dark glades and deep caves where the creasm of their victims - offerings to the demon lords, test subjects for new &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magic, or unfortunates who tumbled upon thier secret - cannot be heard.\nEach cultist bears an identifying mark hidden on his body that indicates his status and the cult to which he belongs. For instance, the &lt;a href=\"Marapor\"&gt;Marapor&lt;/a&gt; cultists who reside along the coast region of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; have a brand in the shape of a six-sided star hidden under the hair on their scalp. &lt;a href=\"Underblade\"&gt;Underblade&lt;/a&gt; cultists in the far reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; Forest have a small tattoo of a dripping dagger inked to the heel on the right foot. Other cultists have various marks and signs on their bodies.\nOne of the greater challenges when dealing with demon cults involves not how to destroy them,but how to find them. Not only do they take great pains to blend in with the populace, but cult members practice a ruthless and deadly system of keeping fellow cultists' tongues silent about their dark activities. Once a person joins a cult, she cannot leave except on pain of death (or worse). This creates a system based on respect steeped heavily in fear.\nA powerful warlock stands as the head of each cult. This figure, skilled in summoning magic and able to communicate with the demons trapped in the Nether, is rarely found without the protection of cult members, a &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;fel stalker&lt;/a&gt;, or some other kind of fodder he can dispose to kill those who oppose him... or to buy him enough time to escape. Even without such servants, a warlock poses a dangerous threat. Yet the rest of the cult must never be forgotten, for even if the warlock is slain, the cult simply hides until a new warlock emerges to lead it.\nDemon cultists are rarely trained warrior. Stealth and terror are their primary weapons. They do not exist to fight, but to act as the means by which the great demon hosts will someday return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. That does not mean they don't indulge in violence, however - just in the controlled (and depraved) application of it: torture, poison, assassination, on other silent deaths."}

Demon hunters start at level 8 (98 before \"Shadowlands\"), experiencing a unique starting experience comparable to that for &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, before then moving into \"Legion\" content.\nDemon hunters are able to speak &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20%28language%29\"&gt;Demonic&lt;/a&gt;.\nClass overview.\n\"Demon hunters, disciples of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, uphold a dark legacy, one that frightens their allies and enemies alike. The &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; embrace fel and chaotic magics\u2014energies that have long threatened the world of Azeroth\u2014believing them necessary to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding the powers of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s they\u2019ve slain, they develop demonic features that incite revulsion and dread in fellow &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Demon hunters ritually blind themselves in exchange for spectral sight that enables them to better sense their prey. This enhanced awareness, together with their great agility and magical prowess, makes demon hunters unpredictable adversaries. An Illidari\u2019s quarry has much to fear.\n\"Forgoing heavy armor, demon hunters capitalize on speed, closing the distance quickly to sever enemies with &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons. However, Illidari must also use their agility defensively to ensure that battles end favorably.\n\"They can command chaotic energies to inflict havoc on enemies, or they can focus their powers to resist damage. Demon hunters fuel vengeful attacks and are a &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;-wearing melee DPS and tank class, with only two specializations: Havoc (&lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;), and Vengeance (&lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;).\nBackground.\nThe first demon hunter, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, had his eyes burned out and tattoos marked on his body by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself. The demon hunters' iconic &lt;a href=\"warglaive\"&gt;warglaive&lt;/a&gt; weapons come from the famous &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Blades%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Twin Blades of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;, which Illidan took from the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Azzinoth\"&gt;Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the years Illidan was in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, many elves sought him out because they had lost everything to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to devote themselves to its destruction. Some &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; demon hunters were instead sent to Illidan by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. On average, only one in five elves survive the demon hunter training. Most are overwhelmed and killed by the demonic energy or go insane and commit suicide. At least one &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; demon hunter wasn't trained by Illidan in Outland, &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, who seems to have been a demon hunter since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; after following in Illidan's footsteps.\nSome demon hunters' &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s are bound to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, effectively making them demons, and killing them in the physical universe will only send them back into the Nether. Such souls are described by Illidan as \"immortal demon souls\". This does not seem to be the case for all demon hunters, as Illidan was intrigued when he learned about the player's.\nDemon hunters can take a demon's power by taking the demon's essence from its corpse, granting the demon hunter new abilities.\nTraining.\nThe training begins with the person slaying a demon, eating its heart, and drinking its blood. The spirit of the ingested demon bonds with them and from this bond the demon hunter receives visions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; destroying countless worlds across the universe. In horror at the sight, they tear their own eyes out, which usually puts them into a coma. The &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power infusing their bodies after ingesting the demon's heart and blood causes the demon hunter to mutate, gaining demonic features such as scales, horns, or claws. As with all chaos-touched creatures, the forms that these traits will take can be quite unpredictable.\nAfter the demon hunter awakens and their &lt;a href=\"spectral%20sight\"&gt;spectral sight&lt;/a&gt; begins to take effect, they are given tattoos which keep their inner demon from overwhelming them, but it is still always there, talking to them and trying to get them to turn to the Legion. &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy counters &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, thus they mark their bodies with arcane &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s to keep the fel forces in check. Keeping their demons at bay with those tattoos and willpower is necessary to not become demons themselves. Each ritual to become a demon hunter is different and, as such, no two sets of tattoos are the same.\nDemon hunters have a constant craving for fel power and demonic flesh, and live in constant torment from the sacrifices they've made. Some succumb to the overbearing power of fel energy and lose all control of themselves. Their blood begins to burn and they unwillingly take on their demon form before lashing out at any nearby living beings. Assuming Metamorphosis form is a very dangerous feat to undertake: unleashing the demon within is risking that the demonic power will take over. Should this happen, all semblance of the elf that was will be lost and only a demonic servant of the Burning Legion will remain.\nDemon hunters used to be taught about demons by &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt;, infiltration by &lt;a href=\"Alandien\"&gt;Alandien&lt;/a&gt;, and weapons by &lt;a href=\"Netharel\"&gt;Netharel&lt;/a&gt;. Varedis also used to oversee training duels. &lt;a href=\"Theras\"&gt;Theras&lt;/a&gt;'s role was not elaborated on.\n&lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, found that the fel in his body has made arcane all but impossible to use, even though he retained the knowledge of his old spells. Despite this, Illidan himself casts spells quite often during \"\", so it may vary from individual to individual.\nNotable.\nWarcraft III.\nA list of random demon hunter names that appear in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;:\nRaces.\nOnly two playable races can be demon hunters: &lt;a href=\"night%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon hunter characters have completely unique voice overs different from night elves and blood elves of other classes.\nAppearance.\nUnlike most classes, demon hunter characters come with special visual customization options.\nMetamorphosis.\nMetamorphosis forms retain the demon hunter characters' hair color and tattoo shape.\nStarting attributes.\nDemon hunters start with the following attributes: \nStarting experience.\nDemon hunters will have a unique starting experience, similar in nature to the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight%20starting%20experience\"&gt;death knight starting experience&lt;/a&gt;. Starting at level 8 (98 prior to \"Shadowlands\"), players will then be able to \"immediately flow into\" \"Legion\" content.\nThe demon hunter storyline starts years before \"Legion\", at the events at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Part of an elite team of demon hunters, the player is sent on a \"suicide mission\" by Illidan to the Legion prison world of &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, the world in which &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned demons prior to his descent into madness. As events play out, the player will learn what it means to be a demon hunter, and the true meaning of sacrifice.\nYears later, the player is awoken in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate for help in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s have \"thrown the switch\" to awaken the imprisoned demon hunters, in particular because of their unique abilities when it comes to fighting demons.\nSpecializations.\nUnlike most classes, demon hunters have only 2 &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s: Havoc, a &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealing&lt;/a&gt; spec, and Vengeance, a &lt;a href=\"tanking\"&gt;tanking&lt;/a&gt; spec.\nHavoc.\nHavoc demon hunters are agile melee damage dealers, using the weapons of the enemy against them. They constantly struggle to resist the corruption of the power they wield and can channel that power to achieve feats of impossible agility, or release it explosively in a torrent of chaos.\nA highly mobile melee DPS spec, Havoc demon hunters rush and charge across the battlefield, assailing their targets with a flurry of attacks. Their filler abilities build Fury, which can be consumed to unleash a chain of explosive attacks at just the right time; with powerful damage-enhancing cooldowns such as &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28Havoc%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (Havoc)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blades\"&gt;Chaos Blades&lt;/a&gt;, Havoc is a spec with strong burst damage capabilities. With a variety of AoE attacks, Havoc has naturally strong multi-target damage potential, but can also deal powerful single target damage with the right talent choices. Primarily melee, Havoc can also deal decent ranged damage when necessary through abilities like &lt;a href=\"Throw%20Glaive\"&gt;Throw Glaive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Beam\"&gt;Eye Beam&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn PvP, Havoc demon hunters hound their prey, chasing them relentlessly and aggressively burning down priority targets, and are especially effective at cutting through to soft backline targets. They have a number of counters to caster classes, while their agility allows them to kite other melee classes, while dealing a steady stream of ranged damage. Their signature strength, their agility, is also their weakness: when stunned, rooted or heavily snared, demon hunters are quickly dispatched by the groups of foes into which they all too readily throw themselves.\nVengeance.\nVengeance demon hunters wield fire and pain as their weapons. Those who follow the path of vengeance have found strength in their suffering, and by harnessing that power, they are able to inflict it upon their enemies while defending themselves and their allies from harm. They directly attack the soul of their foe.\nCapable tanks, Vengeance weather the wrath of their enemies by cleaving fragments from their souls, which can then be consumed by the demon hunter to restore their health. They have regular damage reduction abilities in &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Spikes\"&gt;Demon Spikes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Empower%20Wards\"&gt;Empower Wards&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a number of stronger defensive tools, but primarily rely on self-healing for survivability. They also have access to a number of sigils, used for AoE damage and crowd control, and can leap between enemies, allowing them to quickly counter any threat. They have good AoE and multi-target threat through various damaging abilities.\nAbilities.\nDemon hunters use &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28game%20resource%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; as their primary &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;. Some abilities generate Fury, while others consume it. Demon hunter attacks primarily deal Physical, Fire, or Chaos damage.\nGear.\nDemon hunters are able to wear &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; only, and gain additional benefits from wearing completely leather. They can equip &lt;a href=\"warglaive\"&gt;warglaive&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, one-handed &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, and one-handed &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s. \nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; is the most famous demon hunter, and was the first of their kind. Even Illidan's own brother did not appreciate his sacrifice, and locked him below ground for thousands of years for trafficking with dark powers. Illidan's case was unique. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the Burning Legion, burned away Illidan's eyes with magic fire until only scorched sockets remained. Illidan's resulting sight was a maddening display of violent colors. His altered vision allowed him to easily recognize both demons and mortals with magic powers. In addition, Sargeras covered Illidan's body with black tattoos that increased his arcane power.\nLater, a group of night elves, inspired by Illidan's example, made a pact to turn the Burning Legion's powers against it, fighting destruction with destruction. Obviously they could not gain their powers in the same way Illidan did, but they discovered other means. In the millennia since, other night elves, and a few creatures of other races, have made the same pact, binding demonic essence in their bodies and using it to destroy the Legion's minions.\nThough many among the night elves and the Alliance fear the demon hunters and their pact with darkness, all know that demon hunters and their demonically-charged warblades have played an important part in combating what remains of the Burning Legion.\nDevelopment and abilities.\nDemon hunters have a variety of abilities that assist them in destroying demons, though the power coursing through their bodies also allows them to prevail over lesser foes. Demon hunters eschew heavy armor, valuing mobility and speed. As a demon hunter grows in power, they undergo a gradual evolution, becoming more and more demonic in appearance. The changes are cosmetic and can take many different forms, from burning eyes to black blood. By the time the demon hunter reaches the pinnacle of his development, he is a twisted and dark version of his former self - though the chaotic energy in his body does not affect his personality and allegiance (or so the demon hunters claim), it wreaks great changes on his physical form. The demon hunter\u2019s gradual evolution achieves its pinnacle as they become a demonic entity. Their appearance has changed to something frightening: the exact changes vary, but can include glowing red eyes, horns, clawed feet and hands, nonfunctioning wings, cloven hooves, a spiked tail, dark skin, a deep, rumbling voice, and similar cosmetic changes. The demon hunter becomes an outsider.\nThe demon hunter can drain a demon\u2019s energy to fuel their own powers. They mainly use arcane and fire energy. Shadow energy is rare. No other energies have been confirmed. The demon hunter can channel the chaos energy within them into a melee weapon to increase its powers. In time, the demon hunter becomes more proficient in channeling demonic energy into their weapons, and highly skilled demon hunters are adept at this technique.\nDemon hunters have shown the ability to cover their bodies in a shell of flame. At the pinnacle of evolution, Demon hunters can unleash the demon in them and turn themselves (temporarily) into something more. This is called Metamorphosis. \nDemon hunters hone their speed and maneuverability to overcome their foes.\nRelations.\nNight elf society shuns demon hunters. Most night elves don't understand the noble sacrifice that demon hunters make; therefore, they make another sacrifice: to be outcasts from their society. Other cultures share the night elves' distrust of demon hunters, and the shadowy individuals are not welcome in cities throughout the Alliance or Horde-controlled lands. Citizens and &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s may allow a demon hunter to stay at an inn or take a brief rest at a tavern, but they watch them warily and breathe sighs of relief when they leave. These people do not see the demon hunters for the heroes and martyrs they are; they see them as dangerous individuals who consort with dark powers, almost as bad as &lt;a href=\"warlock%20lore\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. Such ignorance embitters many demon hunters, and most are solitary souls. Some are fortunate enough to find the company of a few individuals who appreciate them, or at least show them little ill will.\nRace and initiation.\nThe tradition of the demon hunter arises from night elf history, and almost all demon hunters are night elves. A few blood elves make the pledge as well, seeking revenge for the destruction of their home. Other races can become demon hunters, but such individuals are unheard of. Any member of another race who is willing to make the sacrifices necessary to join the fight against the demonic invaders must find a night elf or blood elf demon hunter to assist him in the initiation ceremonies.\nHumans can also be demon hunters. Some of these demon hunters can be found guarding Mount Hyjal with the help of fellow night elf demon hunters. Demon hunters in other races are rare, but some exist.\nIn order to become a demon hunter, a hero must find a demon hunter who is willing to lead them through a series of complex rituals. These rituals involve capturing a demon and sacrificing it in order to bind a portion of its spirit inside the hero. As part of the ceremony to become a demon hunter, the initiate burns out his or her eyes with a magic blade to entrap a demonic essence within their body. Most demon hunters then bind their mutilated eyes with strips of cloth. In return for this sacrifice, the demon hunter gains the ability to see the world without vision \u2014 creatures are visible as dimly glowing forms against a gray and murky background. Demonic energy blazes like burning pitch in the night; the demon hunter sees and recognizes it easily.\nEquipment and weaponry.\nEquipment.\nThough equipment obviously varies from demon hunter to demon hunter, one universal element of the order seems to be the blindfold. Used to conceal the remains of the demon hunters' mutilated eye sockets, the demon hunter's blindfold is usually some dark but mundane-looking fabric. Blindfolds are occasionally neglected, perhaps to make the demon hunter appear more frightening and intimidating. A second common occurrence among demon hunters is the tendency for the males among their numbers to be stripped to the waist, which is just one display of the demon hunters' emphasis on the importance of agility and general rejection of heavier armor. Those female demon hunters that have surfaced have been similarly garbed, wearing only the bare minimum of clothing on their upper bodies, sometimes even nothing at all. Demon hunters further tend to wear what appears to be cloth or leather, rarely (if ever) donning plate and mail, favoring greater speed and agility on the battlefield.\nWeaponry.\nTo contrast their stark lack of armor and clothing in general, demon hunters seem to typically carry large, curved warglaives, in the style of Illidan Stormrage's own &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Blades%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Twin Blades of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;. Though the exact reason for this tendency isn't well explained, there are several possible reasons. One is that this kind of weapon has simply become a tradition over the years, later demon hunters mimicking the first of their kind. Another is that this style of curved warblades is common among the kind of demons that demon hunters have to kill as part of their basic initiation process. A third explanation is that the dual-bladed nature of their large, curved weapons allows them to deal the most damage with the least amount of effort, allowing them to focus on their agility and speed. A final explanation is that this kind of weapon is somehow easier to magically charge or channel through, though there is nothing that directly suggests this. \nDemon hunters also possess a plethora of magical abilities, most notably the ability to metamorphose. Many abilities also tend to vary from demon hunter to demon hunter, possibly derived from the type of demon that they originally partially absorbed.\nDemon hunter warblades description: These blades appear as a strange cross between a small buckler and a sharp-looking, curved, two-bladed short sword. The demon hunters of the night elves wear these blades while they hunt the minions of the Scourge, the Burning Legion or other dark adversaries worthy of such weaponry. While many of the demon hunters rely on non-magic weapons, eventually most have either one of these double blades or a matching pair.\nThe use of such weapons tells a lot about the individual wielding them. The inwardly-curving nature of the blades means that the demon hunter must get extremely close to their opponent, literally within what would normally be punching range, in order to get maximum use of the blades. The warblades would be swung in wide arcs at extreme speed, viciously lacerating the foe. More often than not, the warblades will have intricate serrations on the outer edge of the blade near the central buckle, adding yet another facet to the brutal nature of the weapons.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was both ally and foe of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself granted Illidan his spectral sight and demon hunter powers during Illidan's tenure as a Burning Legion agent. This pact with the Burning Legion established Illidan as the first ever Demon Hunter. Though he justified his quest for more demonic power to gain an advantage on the unrelenting demons of the Burning Legion, Illidan has been ostracized by his own people for his seeming betrayals during the War of the Ancients.\nSome night elves, embittered by the brutality of the demons in the upcoming wars with the Legion, sought any power they could that would enable them to satiate their vengeance. These night elf demon hunters made a pact, long ago, to fight against the forces of chaos using its own terrible powers against it. Thus they trained under Illidan to become demon hunters themselves. These mysterious warriors ritually blind themselves so that they develop 'spectral sight' that enables them to see &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; with greater clarity. They wield demonically charged warblades in battle and even call upon demonic energies to augment their formidable combat skills. Although they are counted as some of the mightiest warriors within the Night Elves' society, the Demon Hunters were always maligned and misunderstood for making their selfless pact with darkness. Particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, these night elf demon hunters were mighty allies of night elf society against the Burning Legion, even if night elf society had shunned them. Even so, they were resolved in their mission. &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; believed that while the Illidari demon hunters had demonic energies course through their veins and gnaw at their every thought, there was a fundamental difference between them and the Burning Legion: while the demons would stop at nothing to destroy &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they would sacrifice everything to save it. In Illidan's own words, \"There is no sacrifice too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion.\"\nMost of these night elf demon hunters would continue to serve Lord Illidan as members of his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Though a few such as &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt; became disenchanted with Illidan's questionable tactics, since they believed that he became the very thing they had sworn to fight. As such, with Illidan's defeat and eventual disappearance, some of these demon hunters seek to reform the Illidari into a more honorable organization.\nFollowing the funeral of King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; envoy &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; uncovers Burning Legion infiltrators plotting to attack the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; racial leaders, notably the newly crowned King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, during their time of mourning and aids Alliance forces in repelling the demons. Grateful for the Illidari's assistance, King Anduin allows the Illidari to establish a temporary camp in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; and tasks an Alliance champion to act as his envoy to them, while cautioning the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on them lest their dark powers consume their new allies. After which, the Illidari are welcomed as allies of the Alliance.\nHorde.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elf outcasts had abandoned the failing &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and aligned themselves with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they defeated the &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and made Illidan the new Lord of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan was impressed by the blood elves' zeal and honed strength during the battles. As a reward for his years of service, Illidan allowed Kael'thas to send him five warriors to train under him. It would be the first time blood elves would be allowed to train as demon hunters. The training was brutal. Illidan put Kael's warriors through trials that would defeat most fully capable demon hunters. Three of Kael's elves died in training - another went mad. Only &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; succeeded, becoming the first successful blood elf demon hunter. Varedis eventually became one of the most talented demon hunters under Illidan, surpassing many veteran demon hunters. At Illidan's request, Varedis ran the training grounds at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Ruins of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; - along with the three masters that had mentored Varedis and had been surpassed by him. Following his example, many blood elves trained to become demon hunters like him. It is not surprising that a blood elf's potential for power as a demon hunter is so high. After all, the sin'dorei do not have the natural aversion to demonic magic that night elves do. Emboldened by Illidan's pro-active aggression against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and fiery determination, the blood elf demon hunters remained loyal to Illidan and his Illidari even when their own prince, Kael'thas, defected to the Burning Legion. Some demon hunters, such as &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, believe in Illidan and his ideals of doing whatever it takes to defeat the Legion.\nAfter demon infiltrators assault &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; envoy, &lt;a href=\"Allari%20the%20Souleater\"&gt;Allari the Souleater&lt;/a&gt;, were able to repel the attack. Seeing that &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s will play a crucial part in the war but mistrustful of their motives, Lady Windrunner sends a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion to act as the Horde's envoy to the Illidari and unofficially her spy. After which, the Illidari are welcomed as allies of the Horde.\nOther demon hunter races.\n&lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo murloc demon hunters can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Murgulis\"&gt;Murgulis&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; to fight off a demon invasion, and &lt;a href=\"Lil%27idan\"&gt;Lil'idan&lt;/a&gt; is involved in battle pet world quests in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. Their origin is unknown, though they are probably just for humoristic purposes."}

Some NPCs use this model to represent their arguably unique demonic race, while others just use the model as a shape after using a &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;-like ability. It should be noted that the only NPCs that aren't the result of the metamorphosis ability are Atiesh and The Cleaner.

Through an ancient and arcane ritual, demoniacs allow a demon to enter their being. Rather than let it possess them though, they enslave the demon from the inside, absorbing the power of the beast for their own command. It is a feat few are ever able to master. The demoniac seeks to embody power outright, not just possess it. More than one demoniac has lost a fight with a demon, but with the enemies of the Zandalari threatening them, the power that a demoniac is able to unleash on the tribe's foes is worth the sacrifice.\nA demoniac knows that the game they play is much similar to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but the power unleashed is often the very thing needed for survival. The ultimate symbol of power amongst the Zandalari is the garb they wear in battle. A demoniac's robes have fused fine &lt;a href=\"%3Arunecloth\"&gt;:runecloth&lt;/a&gt; and devastatingly powerful &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; into a single fabric. The visage of the robe is said to instill fear into the minds of all who see it, especially the demons that the demoniac will eventually dominate.\nRecently, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; gave powerful demoniac clothing to &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who were willing to learn their ways."}

This talent makes a huge difference, and many Warlocks consider this talent essential for effective Voidwalker soloing.\nJust to note: The improvement of Demonic Frenzy increases each stack by 1/2/3%, making 6/7/8% per application (up to an overall of 60/70/80%), so it's a very noticeable improvement to your &lt;a href=\"Felguard%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Felguard&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, some dragons are more challenging than others. Ysondre is considered to be the easiest.\nAll four dragons share the Sleep (summoning \"Dream Fog\"), Noxious Breath, Tail Sweep, Mark of Nature and Aura of Nature abilities. Each dragon also has a few unique abilities. One of these is considered the dragon's ace move, and will be performed when the dragon loses 25 \u00b1 5% of its max life. In other words, the ace move will only be performed three times; when the dragon is at 25%, 50%, and 75% life. When it is performed, the dragon will also yell something. "}

Yu'lon watches over the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. She is the spirit of wisdom, but also represents spring, youth, growth, and nurturing. She occasionally disguises herself as a &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; girl named Fei.\nHistory.\nFu Zan.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20%28titanic%29\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Keeper Freya&lt;/a&gt; gifted her &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;walking stick&lt;/a&gt;, fashioned from one of the branches of &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%20%28tree%29\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt; the first tree, to the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, and Yu'lon vowed to keep the staff safe. For thousands of years, even during the dark reign of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;, she did just that. Yu'lon suspected that, if Fu Zan would pass to someone, it would go to a &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; since she considered the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; to be too innately violent to be trusted with such a gift. They were often selfish and shortsighted, unable to work together long enough to build a proper civilization of their own. But as time passed, Yu'lon questioned her assumptions. There were different forms of wisdom and courage. It was easy to see the short-lived, short-tempered hozen as troublemakers, but they lived full lives-wild lives-in the years they had. Yu'lon felt Fu Zan begin to awaken. It needed a new companion. The Jade Serpent knew that soon she would honor Freya's wishes and allow a worthy mortal to carry Fu Zan. And she was becoming certain that it needed to be given to a hozen.\nFreya's words became clear the moment Yu'lon laid eyes upon one exceptional and uniquely clever hozen. He called himself the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20King\"&gt;Monkey King&lt;/a&gt;. Yu'lon could see the Monkey King's motivation. It was simple: he disliked the sight of blood. At the most fundamental level, this was a creature who loathed battle and loved peace. And from that, he had achieved what no other hozen ever had. Yu'lon needed to know how deep the Monkey King's cleverness ran, so she visited him in disguise. All the Monkey King saw was another hozen, but this one did not call him king or bow before him. He demanded that she show respect. Instead, the newcomer asked him a riddle, telling him that a true king would have no trouble answering it. He snapped out the correct answer in seconds. She gave him another. He answered again. On and on they went, for three days and three nights. The Monkey King grew enraged, but even in his anger, he continued to answer her questions. Yu'lon was convinced. Violence and tyranny were not in the Monkey King's nature, or he would have tried to shut her up with force long ago. She revealed her true form-which caused considerable chaos in that hozen village-and presented him with Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion. The Jade Serpent told him the story of Freya and how the staff had come to be. Then she warned him: she sensed that, one day, his cleverness would not be enough to stop evil. When that day came, he would need to act decisively. The Monkey King did not believe her.\nThe mogu empire.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of Pandaria, he and the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; overpowered the four August Celestials. Yu'lon was the last Celestial to remain uncaptured, and she spread wisdom to the pandaren of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; during their time under the mogu empire. During a visit to one of the slave camps, Lei Shen sent a bolt of lightning streaking across the sky that pierced Yu'lon's body and sent her crashing to the earth. Yu'lon awoke underground, where the pandaren had secreted her away to a hidden cave built in honor of the August Celestials. The Jade Serpent, so moved by what she saw, imbued the place with her magic to help the miners find the wisdom, hope, fortitude, and strength they had lost in life. But she was dying, and so she requested that the pandaren build a statue of her.\nFor a hundred years, generations of miners toiled. All the while Yu'lon, still wounded from the Thunder King's attack, drew closer to death. At the moment when the work finished, she breathed her last breath. The miners wept that they'd failed to save her, but the statue moved and its eyes opened; Yu'lon had been reborn through the statue, and to this day she still must reincarnate through a new statue when she grows weak.\nThe Burdens of Shaohao.\nWhen Shaohao climbed up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt;, the Jade Serpent appeared before him. Shaohao needed to know how to keep his land and people safe from the Sundering. She told him to go to the center of Pandaria and find the answer within.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFei is a pandaren girl illusion used by Yu'lon to test the adventurer in the Jade Temple, and later in the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt; after completing the main storyline of &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and takes the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery hundred years, an enormous jade state is built in the temple grounds, so Yu'lon can transfer her life essence into the sculpture, which would then turn into a new being. This cycle has been going for generations.\nYu'lon and the other three Celestials opened the gate to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe also granted her powers to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; warriors when the mogu invaded the vale after the death of &lt;a href=\"Zhi%20the%20Harmonious\"&gt;Zhi the Harmonious&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemple of the Jade Forest.\nDuring the encounter with Liu Flameheart, roughly around 30%, she summons Yu'lon to defend her. After Yu'lon is defeated, she frees the priestess of all doubt, killing her and flying off.\nEscalation.\nAs part of &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s legendary journey, he and an adventurer visited the Jade Serpent in order to receive her blessing.\nTimeless Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;The trial of Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; is a test of wisdom and faith. With omens of a bleak future floating through his mind. Emperor Shaohao climbed to the summit of Mount Neverest to seek the counsel of the Jade Serpent. Yu'lon urged Shaohao to cast off the dark emotions that plagued him, and through his trials, Emperor Shaohao would become one with the land. To pass the trial of the Serpent, warriors must be wise in their choices.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"Why%20Do%20We%20Fight%3F%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Why Do We Fight? (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, the celestials alongside the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; gathered around to begin to heal the Vale. She flies around in a circle after the tree was planted upon the ground to begin the process of healing Pandaria.\nAfter some time, the Monkey King sensed that his travels with Fu Zan were nearing their end. So, he traveled to the temple of Yu'lon and passed the staff back into her care so that one day it can again be given up to another who is worthy to wield it.\nWar Crimes.\nYu'lon and other Celestials chose to hold a trial involving the members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; rather than sentence &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; among themselves. During the trial, Yu'lon took the form of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Panda cub from the Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; as a show of respect to the gathered races.\nThe Jade Hunters.\nDisguised as Fei, she led &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt; to the same 'mine', of which none where happy with.\nLater on, the dwarves learned of how Yu'lon inspired the pandaren miners to seek knowledge and escape the mogu's grip, and of the hidden refuge the pandaren had built underground to worship the Celestials in secret. After &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the miners' descendants would &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Niuzao%20Temple\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;temples&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the celestials and founded the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials%20%28faction%29\"&gt;order of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; to uphold their teachings. The three masons realized that the 'mine' Fei had sent them to was the very refuge that Yu'lon experienced the death of her natural body.\nWhen they returned as friends from their journey, Fei revealed her true form to them and they watched her fly away until she was a vein of jade in the diamond sky.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nYu'lon can be summoned by an item called &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Invoke%20Yu%27lon%2C%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Scroll of Invoke Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; battles.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, Yu'lon was wounded. She was aided by &lt;a href=\"the%20Monkey%20King\"&gt;the Monkey King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Summerpetal\"&gt;Priestess Summerpetal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; who defeated the attacking demons and healed her. Renewed, they all entered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Jade\"&gt;Heart of Jade&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the leader of the assault. While the mortals fought against &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Korithis\"&gt;Lord Korithis&lt;/a&gt;, Yu'lon faced &lt;a href=\"Yigthregor\"&gt;Yigthregor&lt;/a&gt;. Zpon Korithis's death, the grateful Yu'lon bestowed &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion&lt;/a&gt; upon the Grandmaster and transported them to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20the%20Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Assault in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, Yu'lon is seen patrolling the skies.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Yu%27lon\"&gt;Pearl of Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; artifact used to refer to Yu'lon as male. While it's possible this was simply an error by Blizzard, it may have suggested that Yu'lon may get reincarnated as either male or female, even if her current incarnation is female. This was eventually corrected in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.1\"&gt;patch 6.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, so presumably it was the former rather than the latter."}

With omens of a bleak future floating through his mind. &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; climbed to the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt; to seek the council of the Jade Serpent. Yu'lon urged Shaohao to cast off the dark emotions that plagued him, and through his trials, Emperor Shaohao would become one with the land. To pass the trial of the Serpent, warriors must be wise in their choices.\"\nStrategy.\nYu'lon is generally seen as the most difficult of the four celestials, with high amounts of both tank and raid-wide damage, along with a deadly and hard to dodge mechanic in Jadefire Wall. Only one tank is required. \nThe tank may attempt to dodge Jadefire Breath by moving to either side while Yu'lon is casting. The Jade Serpent will periodically shoot Jadefire Bolts to the ground around her, creating Jadefire Blazes. These blazes can be somewhat hard to see against the green-brown ground of the arena, particularly when the graphics settings are on low. In addition, they spawn quickly with no cast time and little warning, so raid members should always be ready to move. The tanks should constantly be kiting Yu'lon around the arena to minimize threat of the Jadefire Blazes. While kiting, keep Yu'lon faced away from the raid to avoid damage from Jadefire Breath. \nThe Jade Serpent's most devastating attack is Jadefire Wall, summoning a giant wave of green fire that starts at the end of the arena where &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; is. The mechanic is similar to &lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion's&lt;/a&gt; Lava Walls, with small gaps in the waves as the only way to avoid them. For this reason, the tanks should try to keep the combat to the other side of the arena to give the raid as much time as possible to get between the gaps. "}

He personally came to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to inform Thrall that something was terribly wrong in the spirit world, noting that he had never seen the spirits act as they've done. In light of both the Earthen Ring shaman and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s sensing the disturbance, Yukha agreed to serve as Thrall's messenger to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who had relocated to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;'s rage had not lessened, she did agree on the meeting with the condition that Yukha inform Thrall that he \"must bring what is owed.\" A declaration that confused both orcs.\nWhen Thrall mentioned his intention to bring &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; with him to the meeting, Yukha grew concerned, believing that their presence would remind Tyrande of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in different ways. Thrall then cited that Baine despised Sylvanas, and how Calia wished to bridge the divide between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the kaldorei that were raised into undeath as reasons in order to ease his worries. In response, Yukha told Thrall that he felt that it was best if Thrall came alone but acquiesced to Thrall's wishes.\nHe then accompanied the three to Nordrassil, where in light of the frosty frigid reception they had received and Tyrande's rage, Yukha declared that it was a mistake to bring the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; here. He then corralled Baine and Calia out of the area and attempted to do so with Thrall. However, Thrall refused to be corralled out and promised Tyrande that he would deliver what is owed, that he would give her the head of Sylvanas Windrunner. The group subsequently departed from Nordrassil.\nWhile Thrall, Baine, and Calia returned to Orgrimmar, it is presumed that Yukha returned to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was defeated and laid broken on the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;battlefield&lt;/a&gt; until she was found by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;unseen ones&lt;/a&gt; who preserved her to serve as a vessel for Denathrius' rage.

Prince Renathal placed bonds of warding on the blade in order to contain Denathrius and prevent the sword from escaping, but stronger arrangements were necessary. Remornia was brought to Z'rali at Dawnkeep, where the naaru used her Light to keep the Sire imprisoned. Prince Renathal also hoped that the torture would eventually reeducate Denathrius to be the kind of person he used to be.\nHowever, the nathrezim revealed their presence and successfully rescued Denathrius from her tower."}

He was the inhabitant of &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; took up residence there.\nHistory.\nMeeting the Mograines.\nThe troll Zabra took up residence in the abandoned monastery that would later become &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and learned the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from the books within its library. He is found by knights of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who confirmed his connection to the Light, saving him from being killed by &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;. Zabra promises to never forget Alexandros' act of mercy.\nLater, he encounters &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time is mourning his father's death. Zabra suggests that the spirit of Alexandros Mograine has not passed on, claiming that he can still feel a connection to Mograine through the Light, though it has been obscured. When Darion asks him about Alexandros' whereabouts, Zabra tells him that he had seen a vision of a &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; floating above &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;a burning city&lt;/a&gt;, and then vanishes mysteriously.\nLegion.\nZabra Hexx appears in \"Legion\" as a user of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic, though it is not explained why. As some of the best &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s that the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; had to offer, Zabra and &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; on the front lines against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; of the Conclave to find them so they could prepare an extract that would grant him a vision of the future. While in Azsuna, Yalia and Zabra were attacked by the local &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, and dropped the supplies they were delivering to the Illidari while they fled. The two were also separated in their fleeing.\nZabra was discovered soon after by the High Priest after he had been turned to stone by a &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;. After the High Priest helped to rescue Yalia from the murlocs, she and Zabra looked for ingredients for Velen's elixir while the High Priest delivered their supplies to the Illidari. Afterward Zabra believed that it was fate that he and the High Priest crossed paths, and that it was the beginning of something great.\nZabra and Yalia's elixir would later help Velen to see visions of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; joining the Conclave, and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; attacking the Netherlight Temple."}

{"id": "17184", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17184", "title": "Zaetar", "text": "Zaetar was a &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt; and the firstborn son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. After mating with &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, he became the father of the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, but was shortly after killed by his barbaric children.\nBiography.\nBirth of the centaur.\nZaetar was born the first son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and brother of &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Where Remulos was strong and beautiful, Zaetar was very cunning and slight of build. Like his father, Zaetar walked the physical world in the form of a majestic half-stag, with vines and leaves encircling his limbs and antlers. Wherever he walked, dozens of saplings would sprout and\u2014over time\u2014grow into lush groves. While the two brothers were respected equally, Zaetar always felt as if he could never compare to the glory and attention he thought Remulos had. When Remulos' children\u2014&lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; sisters\u2014were born, a jealous Zaetar set out to outdo his brother.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt; was roused from her slumber by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, she drained the lands of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Mashan'she&lt;/a&gt; of life to restore her powers. The loss of so much life sent ripples through the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and Zaetar emerged to investigate, eventually discovering Theradras in heir lair. Despite having set out to imprison the strange creature responsible for draining Mashan'she, Zaetar soon became enticed by the elemental's stolen life energies and grew enchanted with her beauty. Theradras realized the influence she had over the keeper, and\u2014as she found Zaetar beautiful as well\u2014claimed that together the two could restore the land to its former beauty. Despite knowing that it was against nature and despite the warnings of Remulos, Zaetar became Theradras' mate. In so doing, he rejected his heritage as a &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom Zaetar and Theradras' forbidden union, the barbaric &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; were born. The first centaur were &lt;a href=\"Kolk\"&gt;Kolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelk\"&gt;Gelk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magra\"&gt;Magra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraudos\"&gt;Maraudos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veng\"&gt;Veng&lt;/a&gt;, who became the first five &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon seeing his children, Zaetar immediately realized his sin. He tried to connect with his offspring, but the centaur saw the disgust in their father's eyes and brutally murdered him. Theradras harshly chastised the centaur, who\u2014upon realizing that they had wounded their beloved mother\u2014promised to honor Zaetar's memory. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, Theradras entombed her lover's spirit in her lair, which the centaur named &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; and came to regard as holy ground. The life energies permeating Zaetar's body caused a bloom of plant life, turning the area around &lt;a href=\"Zaetar%27s%20Grave\"&gt;his grave&lt;/a&gt; into a verdant paradise.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nInfluenced by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, Theradras trapped Zaetar's spirit in Maraudon and used its energies to transform her home into a den of corruption and suffering, tainting the surrounding lands of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. Zaetar's nephew and nieces\u2014&lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; sisters\u2014at one point traveled to Maraudon in the hopes of freeing their uncle's tortured spirit, but they instead became corrupted by the caverns' dark energies.\n&lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Marandis\"&gt;Keeper Marandis&lt;/a&gt; and his sisters later traveled to Desolace in the hopes of recruiting &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Theradras and retrieve Zaetar's remains so that they could be brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers succeeded in defeating Theradras, thereby freeing Zaetar's spirit. He told the heroes that he would remain in Maraudon, since his centaur children had need of their father despite their crimes against him. He also asked the heroes to bring the &lt;a href=\"%3ASeed%20of%20Life\"&gt;:Seed of Life&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the first seed that fell from the life his remains nourished\u2014to his brother &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Remulos expressed joy that his brother had found peace and stated that the seed was proof that Zaetar had been reborn and would \"take his place in nature as was his duty\".\nStormrage.\nZaetar's spirit returned to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, he led forces of nature spirits and &lt;a href=\"dreamform\"&gt;dreamform&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, but he was pessimistic about their chances of winning the battle. After &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; entered the Dream in search of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arei\"&gt;Arei&lt;/a&gt; brought him to Zaetar. The keeper tried to convince Broll to stay and fight with them, but Broll quickly left them to continue his search. Zaetar told Arei that he believed that Broll and his friends would be consumed by the Nightmare, just as he believed that his own forces were doomed to failure.\nBroll described Zaetar as having a slightly greener tint than Remulos, and a faintly longer face that bore in it a constant sadness.\nCataclysm.\nDespite the fact that Theradras had canonically been defeated years earlier, &lt;a href=\"Zaetar%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;Zaetar's Spirit&lt;/a&gt; gives new quests to defeat &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vyletongue\"&gt;Lord Vyletongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noxxion\"&gt;Noxxion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorlash\"&gt;Razorlash&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately Theradras herself in order to free himself so that Desolace can one day be restored to a verdant land \"as Cenarius would want\". This may be due to the fact that Maraudon was not updated to reflect the storyline.\nIn the RPG.\nThe product of Zaetar and Theradras' union were five tribes of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galak\"&gt;Galak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraudine\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt;), twisted mockeries of the beauty of the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and keepers of the grove. According to the story, the first act of the jealous and evil centaur was to kill their father. Fearing Cenarius' wrath upon her children, Theradras spirited Zaetar's remains, and his soul, away to be with her in &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs he is the eldest son of Cenarius he is likely the one known as \"the keeper of the grove\" in the night elven legend that speaks of three oldest offspring of Cenarius, his sister \"the dryad\" and his bastard brother, \"&lt;a href=\"the%20centaur\"&gt;the centaur&lt;/a&gt;\" (the first of those races). &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; is one of his younger brothers not mentioned in the legend. Zaetar's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Remulos, attempted to rescue Zaetar's spirit from Maraudon, but became corrupted himself by Theradras' magic, and still resides there with his dryads.\nSpeculation.\nSome believe that the two legends (this one and the night elf legend) are one and the same, in which the son called \"the centaur\" may, in fact, be Zaetar. This is because they share many things, such as their fall from grace due to jealousy. This would mean that \"the centaur\"'s children were the same as Zaetar's. Those also believe that the Krenka, Marauder, Stonetalon, and Eastern Kingdom centaur may have simply broken away from the five main tribes in the countless centuries since their creation, as the five tribes remaining unbroken for well over ten thousand years may seem unrealistic.\nHowever, this would ignore most of the traits, and history attributed to \"the centaur\". Zaetar appears to neither be a bastard, nor does he have the centaur's personality traits. He does not have the same hatred of his siblings as \"the centaur\". Zaetar was not cursed by his father either (stripped of his beauty to appear as current centaurs), nor did Zaetar swear a blood feud on all creatures of the world. These discrepancies could be explained as exaggerations added as the story was retold over the years."}

He was one of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s most vocal opponents, leading to his assassination by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDuring the clan meeting at &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; told the gathered orcs that the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were enemies of the orcs and that the orcs needed to unite and destroy them, Zagrel was one of the most outspoken critics. He did not believe slaughtering the draenei would make life better. On the contrary, it might anger the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; even more. While the discussion continued, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; took note of Zagrel and others who stubbornly opposed unity and resolved to not forget their names.\nA few years later, after the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan dispatched agents of his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to the orcish territories to spread word of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Chieftain Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s mighty deeds and inform the orcs that Blackhand's &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; had discovered &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;a new power&lt;/a&gt; even greater than the elements. The Shadow Council agents also spied on the clans, taking notes of those who opposed the Horde, and relayed this information back to Gul'dan. Zagrel in particular drew Gul'dan's ire, for he had called on the clans to end their pointless war with the draenei and focus their attention on shamanic rituals. Zagrel believed that only through dedicated worship and adherence to old traditions could the orcs regain their relationship with the elements. Gul'dan feared that Zagrel could eventually win the support of orcs who questioned the Horde, such as &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;. He would need to deal with the Whiteclaws' troublesome leader quickly, and so ordered his assassin, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, to strike Zagrel down. Garona silently slipped into the Whiteclaw encampment and stabbed Zagrel through the heart. None of the Whiteclaws would ever know she'd been there. After their leader's untimely death, inner turmoil gripped the clan as Zagrel's brothers and sons battled for the title of chieftain. The clan would endure, but would never be as strong as they had once been.\nZagrel's death caused Durotan's unease to grow. He was already growing wary of the war against the draenei, and considered it to be no mere coincidence that the Horde's most vocal opponent had died, but yet he had no proof of who had murdered the Whiteclaw chieftain."}

It was buried beneath &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; with Tyr himself, sealed in a facility within &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLong ago, Zakazj and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; served as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s most ruthless and cunning C'Thraxxi generals. When the Old Gods fell to the might of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; armies, they were sealed away along many other n'raqi in underground chambers alongside the Old Gods. Millennia ago, the Prime Designate &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, excavated their tombs and roused the two C'Thraxxi to life. Sensing the lingering touch of Yogg-Saron in the keeper's mind, the two readily obeyed, and were sent to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, who had stolen the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Loken. Eventually, Tyr sacrificed himself in an immense explosion. Kith'ix, though heavily wounded, survived and fled to the south, but the Corruptor was killed. The &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who had accompanied Tyr named the land \"Tyr's Fall\" in his honor, or \"Tirisfal\" in their tongue. The mortals who would one day inhabit the area of Tirisfal would feel two conflicting energies emanating from the earth: the remaining spiritual essence of Keeper Tyr, and that of Zakajz.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, seeing the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; in good hands, the first king of Arathor &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; turned his attention to the origins of humanity. In the Tirisfal Glades, he discovered the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and recklessly broke the magical seals that kept the C'Thrax dead within the Tomb. Zakajz began to slowly awaken and, even barely conscious, slew Thoradin's comrades easily. The king gave his life to ensure that the beast would not escape, and impaled Zakajz's brain with his sword &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar, the Warbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, keeping Zakajz dead for millennia.\nLegion.\nCenturies later, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to awaken Zakajz under &lt;a href=\"Farthing\"&gt;Twilight Deacon Farthing&lt;/a&gt;'s command.

Later, Farthing attempted to use &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; to rouse Zakajz yet again, but a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; killed him and used the dark blade to consume the last remnants of the creature's power.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Artifacts\"&gt;Bloodstone Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; might be related to Zakajz, as &lt;a href=\"Kegan%20Darkmar\"&gt;Kegan Darkmar&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; spoke of how remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; still lingered in the deep hollows of the world.

In the midst of it, the Speaker struck out against the denizens of Zalamar.\nAfter the talismans were acquired and turned into a poison, Hir'eek called for the blood trolls to cease their attacks and called for the Speaker and Jo'chunga to come forth. In the ensuing struggle between the corrupted loa and the two, Hir'eek was slain. Though Hir'eek was killed the blood trolls remained in control of Zalamar.\nSeeking to sever the bonds between the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sought to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; itself. However, the Alliance sought to trick the Zandalari and the Horde that they were going to attack from Nazmir. To this end, the Alliance wrested control of Zalamar away from the blood trolls in order to establish their forces within the village. Following the successful recapture of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt; by the Horde and Zandalari forces, the conjoined armies headed towards Zalamar to take the fight to the Alliance. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde army left for the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Reach\"&gt;Far Reach&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the fog and the Alliance fleet. After realizing that they had been tricked, the Horde rushed towards &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; in order defend &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance. \nThe current status and who inhabitants Zalamar is unknown."}

Yet the powers he wielded, combined with a &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt;-granted vision of his early years, eventually drove him to become the Darkspear's greatest traitor. When the Darkspear joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and claimed a new homeland on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Zalazane eventually rose up and used his powers to take control of the islands for himself, and ruled over them for several years with an iron fist.\nSeveral attempts were made by the Horde to kill the elusive witch doctor over the years until finally Vol'jin called upon all of the races of the Horde, and even the great spirits themselves, to liberate the Echo Isles on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde army defeated every obstacle the Hexmaster laid before them, cornered him on one of the &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;smaller islands&lt;/a&gt;, and finally destroyed him, allowing the Darkspear to rebuild their homeland.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nZalazane grew up as the best friend of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Because Vol'jin was the son of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, others always considered Vol'jin to be the hero while Zalazane was merely the companion. The youths often spoke of this and merely laughed at the ignorance of those who thought such. Throughout their entire childhood, Zalazane and Vol'jin ran, fished, wrestled, and built mud forts together. Their first kill was the same beast. Zalazane knew things about Vol'jin that no one else did, having been present for everything from the time when Vol'jin cried over a dead pet to the day he beat an older bully senseless. While Vol'jin trained to become a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Zalazane became a &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt;. Sen'jin himself encouraged Zalazane, and some Darkspears thought that the young witch doctor was being trained to lead after Sen'jin while Vol'jin was destined for greater things. However, even this was incorrect, for Vol'jin and Zalazane both believed in Sen'jin's dream of a homeland for the Darkspears.\nWhile still a \"young nobody\", Vol'jin was sent into &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt;. Unsure of himself, Vol'jin convinced Zalazane to sneak into First Home and be tested by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, thinking they would be stronger together than if alone. Zalazane not knowing the truth at the time, that Vol'jin was sent there by his father, was more than willing to help his friend. During these tests, both trolls were each granted separate visions of a possible future for their people. In Zalazane's vision, he saw himself leading Darkspear fighters away from the tribe. His reasoning being that the current leader was too weak, and believed he sold the Darkspear out. Zalazane saw himself become the new leader, and the tribe split in half. With those visions, the two trolls learned many things, like that they would end up fighting each other to death. Yet both trolls agreed that the visions were not set in stone and were just possibilities. Fate does not control their actions and whatever happens, it happens because they chose it to be. Zalazane seems to embrace his destiny and believes that if the troll in his vision does become weak, then in his perspective, the weak troll leader would be the villain in his story and would force him to usurp him. \nBoth the young trolls, having passed the tests and now able to see and commune with the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; were now what they sought to become. However, after leaving First Home, with each step they took memories of what they learned faded and only keeping just a vague sense of what was needed. \nWhen they returned to their village, after thinking only a week had passed but was really three months, they found the village in ruins and many trolls dead. The ones that were able were building ships and preparing to leave. As Vol'jin's most trusted friend and knowing he would do a fine job, Zalazane was sent with the first voyage to prepare the way. Part of Vol'jin balked at the idea and he didn't know why, but he felt that he should keep Zalazane close to him now.\nBetraying the Darkspear.\nSomewhere, at some point, Zalazane was overcome with doubt. As Vol'jin later reflected, it could have been the knowledge that Sen'jin\u2014a powerful witch doctor\u2014had died so easily, or perhaps hearing one too many times that Vol'jin was the hero while Zalazane was the companion, or perhaps something that Vol'jin couldn't even guess at. Whatever it was, it caused Zalazane to lunge for power that drove him mad.\nWhen the Darkspear trolls returned to the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, after answering &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;'s call to aid the Horde against &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Zalazane had been driven mad by his own power and betrayed the tribe. He used dark voodoo to rob most of the Darkspear trolls of their free will, forcing them to obey him. As his influence spread, his army grew while the number of free Darkspears dwindled. Fearing that all of his people would fall to Zalazane's insidious sorcery, Vol'jin ordered the tribe to abandon the Echo Isles.\nThus, the free Darkspear trolls left the islands and created the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; coast, just northwest of the Echo Isles. \nThe Darkspears and their allies frequently struck at Zalazane's holdings on the Echo Isles, determined to win back the trolls' first home on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. But Zalazane had not given up on his efforts to enslave his entire tribe, and so he continued to send his trolls to the mainland in order to drag further Darkspears under his sway. Zalazane disrupted the normal flow of magic in Durotar using &lt;a href=\"Ju-Ju%20Heap\"&gt;ju-ju heaps&lt;/a&gt; he placed among his huts on the main Echo Isle.\nThough many trolls and other members of the Horde had journeyed to the Echo Isles to slay him, and a number had even returned with his head, a few days later the magic always wore off and his \"head\" was revealed to be nothing more than painted rocks, bunches of coconuts, or the head of an enslaved Darkspear troll.\nDownfall.\nAfter years of biding his time and gathering allies, Vol'jin gathered a great army of the Horde and - aided by the elements and the beasts of Durotar - marched on the Echo Isles. The massed army fought through the legions of hexed trolls until they came face-to-face with Zalazane himself. Fleeing across the Isles and gathering his foul magics, Zalazane erected a shield around himself, while he used his magic to turn the Darkspear warriors against their chieftain. Cornered, Zalazane boasted that he was invincible and that no living thing could penetrate his shield...at which point he was greeted by the mocking laughter of the great Loa &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, guardian of the dead.\nDamning the sorcerer for usurping his domain, Bwonsamdi brought down the Hexmaster's shield and then exploded him from within, bringing an end once and for all to Zalazane's evil reign of the Echo Isles.\nAfterward, Vol'jin liked to think that in Zalazane's last moments, he had returned to sanity and was pleased to be free.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nZalazane's spirit can be found chained up in Bwonsamdi's temple, the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Echo Isles came under attack once again by Zalazane, who broke free of Bwonsamdi and came back as a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; with an army of undead. He was able to break away because Bwonsamdi did not also have Vol'jin's spirit. Zalazane seems to be aware that Vol'jin had died, attacking the isles to claim his ashes. Vol'jin's &lt;a href=\"Nekana\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt; was used to combat Zalazane because it was necessary to use a magical weapon to harm someone who escaped the grasp of Bwonsamdi, and the bond between Vol'jin and Zalazane was great. Upon his death, Zalazane proclaimed \"What? Vol'jin... you could not have grown so strong without becoming... a...\"\nIn World of Warcraft.\nZalazane was a level 10 troll located in the Echo Isles in Durotar. During the Zalazane's Fall event, he reappeared as level 80 as part of the final quest. With the conclusion of the event following the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, Zalazane and his minions have been removed entirely, in preparation for the Echo Isles becoming the troll starting zone in \"\".\nIn Cataclysm.\nIn \"Cataclysm\", there is a region of the Echo Isles known as &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Zalazane's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. After being killed here by Bwonsamdi, the land became tainted.\nLands of Mystery.\nZalzane's backstory from \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\" conflicts with the information given in \"World of Warcraft\". The following is information given from \"Lands of Mystery\":\nThis large &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; is draped in black robes and wears a black-and-white, wooden mask reminiscent of both &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and voodoo. Wrinkled hands grip a dark quarterstaff with a &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; skull on the top. Zalazane, in his mid-50s, decided that his people did not need the help of the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s in order to succeed. He was further offended when he heard about &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s distrust of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of a number of similar-minded trolls \u2014 and summoned &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 Zalazane drove most of his fellow &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. He continues to attack the other trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and his reasoning is unknown. The source of his knowledge of necromantic magic is equally mysterious.\nIn combat, Zalazane begins the fight by &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. He then uses &lt;a href=\"death%20coil\"&gt;death coil&lt;/a&gt; and other offensive spells until he exhausts his repertoire, then wades into &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; or retreats.\nZalazane's experiments on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; had progressed far further than the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ever anticipated, and the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s created greater undead, such as abominations. The &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; called for a full assault on the Echo Isles before the situation escalated.\nSpeculation.\nIt is unstated if the death of Zalazane freed the Darkspear trolls he had enslaved.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Report to Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; states that the evil of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cult has taken seed on the Echo Isles, even though Zalazane and his minions were the only ones who inhabited the isles prior to \"\". This may imply that Zalazane had ties to the Burning Blade, or alternatively be a developer mistake."}

Over the years, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspears&lt;/a&gt; have proven to be invaluable members of the Horde.

Long ago they were driven from &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;'s mainland by the more powerful trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi empire&lt;/a&gt; and then settled on a remote island. The Darkspears later sought refuge with the Horde when their isle was destroyed by a mysterious sea witch, and Thrall granted the trolls new lands on the Echo Isles off the coast of Durotar. Aside from a brief exodus when 's fleet arrived to hunt down orcs, the Darkspears enjoyed relative stability until one of their own, &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, drove his brethren from their latest home.\"\n\"The witch doctor Zalazane had been one of the tribe's leading mystical instructors when he was inexplicably driven to insanity by the powers under his control. Utilizing dark magic, he enslaved many of his fellow tribespeople and amassed an army of mindless Darkspear trolls. Fearing that all of his tribe would come under Zalazane's sway, Vol'jin ordered the remaining free Darkspears to abandon the Echo Isles.\"\n\"Vol'jin's Darkspears settled in nearby &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;, which they have since used as a staging point to attack Zalazane. Over the years, members of the Horde looking to test their worth have braved the Echo Isles to confront Zalazane, and many of them even returned seemingly victorious with his &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Head\"&gt;severed head&lt;/a&gt;. These victories, however, proved to be nothing more than illusions created by the twisted witch doctor's dark magic. Days after these trophies were taken to Sen'jin Village, they reverted to their true forms: painted rocks and coconuts adorned with wooden tusks, or even the heads of Zalazane's enslaved trolls.\"\n\"Despite these setbacks and his preoccupation with advising Thrall on Horde-related matters, Vol'jin has spent considerable time formulating a strategy to recapture the Echo Isles. Now he believes that the time to strike at Zalazane has come. As the Darkspear leader and his close allies &lt;a href=\"Vanira\"&gt;Vanira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Uru%27zin\"&gt;Champion Uru'zin&lt;/a&gt; await approval of their plan from the ancestral spirits, they have begun rounding up new troll recruits and staging reconnaissance missions to learn about Zalazane's minions.\"\n\"Yet Vol'jin's trolls are short on forces, and the enslaved Darkspears on the Echo Isles outnumber them. The Darkspears are well-known for being among Azeroth's bravest combatants, however, and fortunately many non-trolls have expressed interest in assisting Vol'jin, perhaps hoping that restoring the Echo Isles will eventually bolster the Horde's strength.\"\n\"Vol'jin is also aware of the strategic importance that a Darkspear homeland offers his allies, but he is motivated by more personal reasons. Zalazane's betrayal was an affront against Vol'jin's dream of a better life for his tribe, a destiny that his late father, Sen'jin, envisioned years ago. Only by retaking the Echo Isles will Vol'jin be able to honor his father and at long last secure a permanent homeland for the long-exiled Darkspear tribe.\"\nSecond announcement.\n\"\"Zalazane Must Fall!\" Cries Vol'jin\"\n\"Embedded on the coast of Durotar, the tiny troll Village of Sen'jin is bursting with recent activity. In what some claim is a retort to the overblown assertions of the vertically-challenged High Tinker Mekkatorque, Troll Chieftain Vol'jin has announced his intention to \"honor de ancestors n' take back da 'omeland, mon.\" The call has been given, and the scattered Darkspear tribe has begun to gather at the once-sleepy location. Now the primal rhythm of beating drums and strange clouds of acrid smoke drift aloft deep into the night, arguably a sign of celebration and preparation for an impending offensive.\"\n\"With the full support of Thrall and his counterparts, Vol'jin is calling upon all factions of the Horde to prepare for an assault on Echo Isles and the twisted witch doctor Zalazane. He will pay for his crimes against the Darkspears and the land bestowed upon them by Thrall! As explained by Vol'jin in the demand for Zalazane's fall today, honorable members of the Horde passing through the village proper -- whether they've never slain a boar in their lives or are the subject of every dragon's nightmare -- will be given a chance to help their upstanding troll brothers in what will surely be the most brutal of attacks. But first there must be preparation. With the Echo Isles on the line, no detail is too small, no spoken word too trivial. And for that reason the noted troll shaman, Vanira, will get adventurers started on the monumental tasks ahead.\"\n\"Using sacred totemic rituals, Vanira needs frogs for her agenda. It is unclear of her exact intentions with these amphibious lurkers of Sen'jin, but there appears to be a bat handler standing by. Could it be that frogs will soon rain down from the heavens upon the Echo Isles? When asked for further comment, Vanira only remarked that she's seeking \"da perfect spies.\" It seems war is sometimes won with even the most unlikely of arsenals. Spying on the enemy, however, is only the beginning. Vol'jin has spoken of a most-trusted trainer of reinforcements, Champion Uru'zin, who will guide new recruits of all ranges of experience into battle-hardened Darkspear warriors. \"Trollin' for volunteers,\" as Vol'jin remarked, will be a key component to building a strike force capable of overthrowing Zalazane's hexed Darkspears.\"\n\"Vol'jin argues that the spirits are on the side of his Darkspear tribe. Can animistic beliefs truly manifest into proven battle leverage against Zalazane? Perhaps only Vanira and her beguiled spies can answer this. But it is rumored that, long ago, a tribe of troll druids once called the Echo Isles home. If ever there was a time for good omens such as this, it is now. Only if the spirits truly are on the side of the son of Sen'jin, reportedly only a phenomenon that Witch Doctor Hez'tok can decipher, then the assault will commence! Those who assist Hez'tok in his ceremony will be adorned with Darkspear Pride, allowing adventurers the ability to take on the form of an elite Darkspear Warrior during battle. Wearing such battle garb is an honor to the ancestors of a people long persecuted and plagued by war between tribes.\"\n\"Should the spirits give their blessing to Vol'jin, Champion Uru'zin will call for all seasoned veterans of the Horde levels 75-80 to aid in the attack. If \"at last, everythin' be ready,\" as Vol'jin put it, his plan is to launch a full assault from the shores of Sen'jin village. Vol'jin exclaimed in his call for such an assault today, \"come, now! Join in de liberation of de Echo Isles! Zalazane will fall!\" He's gone so far as to offer a particularly rare Sen'jin Overcloak to those who help bring Zalazane down. Even still, sources report that this foe possesses powerful voodoo and black magic.\"\n\"Preparations for Zalazane's fall are underway, but will it be enough to best this witch doctor? It's time, proud members of the Horde, to stand with your disaffected troll brethren and recognize the full might of the Darkspear tribe!\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

None of the Gurubashi who had witnessed Jok'non's death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; had survived, but it took little imagination for the trolls to guess who was responsible. They soon rallied under Zan'non's banner and marched to war against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, marking the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the trolls arrived at the walls of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the human soldiers trembled at their numbers. Zan'non had learned some of his father's &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;forbidden tricks&lt;/a&gt;, using them to transform a few Gurubashi into hulking berserkers who climbed Stormwind's walls and ripped its soldiers to pieces. The death toll on both sides mounted quickly, and the human king, &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, knew that it would take a miracle to break the Gurubashi siege. Thus, he mounted a desperate counterattack with his personal guards, storming directly into the hellish front lines with the intent of taking Zan'non's head. The king almost succeeded, but the odds were against him and he died on the field of battle. &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Llane&lt;/a&gt; mourned his father's death but knew that the city now looked to him for guidance. Stormwind's forces had fallen into disarray and all seemed lost. Llane pleaded with Medivh to unleash his &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; powers as he had once before. Medivh agreed, being both frightened and excited at the thought of unleashing his full powers. He stood on Stormwind City's ramparts and rained down destruction on the Gurubashi, freezing, incinerating and blasting them to pieces. When Medivh called off his arcane barrage, the city still stood and the Gurubashi and their leader were dead. Only a handful of trolls had escaped the maelstrom of magic."}

In doing so, the dark truth of a children's tale come to light...\nBride of the Embalmer.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Hermit%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Hermit (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eva\"&gt;Madame Eva&lt;/a&gt;, a resident of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, has begun to worry about an old man who used to come to town to buy supplies, but has not shown up lately. She's worried and asks you to check on him, pointing you in the direction of Raven Hill.\n&lt;a href=\"Supplies%20from%20Darkshire\"&gt;Supplies from Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;\nA shack overlooking the cemetary is the humble abode of Abercrombie, the hermit. He's old and is having a hard time getting out these days. He asks you to back to Madame Eva and get some &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Hair%20Thread\"&gt;Ghost Hair Thread&lt;/a&gt;, to which you happily oblige.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Hair%20Thread%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Ghost Hair Thread (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nMadame Eva informs you that she has none. However, &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Mary\"&gt;Blind Mary&lt;/a&gt;, a specter in a nearby cottage, will give you some if you ask her to comb her hair with a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Comb\"&gt;Spectral Comb&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Return%20the%20Comb\"&gt;Return the Comb&lt;/a&gt;\nJourneying to Blind Mary, she begins to happily comb her hair, but remembers what a hideous being she is. She throws the comb back at you and begins to sob. Looking down at the comb, you see the strands of hair caught in the comb. Returning it to Madame Eva, she weaves it into what Abercrombie needs.\n&lt;a href=\"Deliver%20the%20Thread\"&gt;Deliver the Thread&lt;/a&gt;\nMadame Eva tells you the many uses of Ghost Hair as she weaves. It can ward off evil spirits, like the ones that inhabit Raven Hill, or some dark arcanists even use it to give life to inanimate objects! Journeying back to Abercrombie, he laughs at your uneasiness and assures you that he's going to hang it over his door to keep the ghouls away.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Juice%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Zombie Juice (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nAbercrombie has another request though. The tavern in town has a drink called Zombie Juice. It's strong stuff, and will put some real fire in his veins on cold nights. Back in Darkshire, &lt;a href=\"Tavernkeep%20Smitts\"&gt;Tavernkeep Smitts&lt;/a&gt; tells you its pretty strong stuff, and that its not exactly in high demand. As such, he doesn't have it in stock, but he knows how to brew it.\n&lt;a href=\"Gather%20Rot%20Blossoms\"&gt;Gather Rot Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;\nThe only ingredient Smitts is missing is some Rot Blossoms. The only place they grow however, is in the skulls of undead skeletons. Not the prettiest of thoughts, but thinking of the cold old man, you gather them. Smitts brews the Juice, and tells you that he'll remember to mention you to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Juice%20Delivery\"&gt;Juice Delivery&lt;/a&gt;\nSmitts hands over the drink, jokingly telling you that it's strong enough to raise the dead. On the way back to Abercrombie's shack, you begin to feel uneasy again. Raise the dead? Doesn't Ghost Hair do that too? It...no, the old man has been quite kind. Besides the grave to his wife indicates that he's pretty strong of will. Drinking may be the only way he makes it through these days. A slip of Abercrombie's tongue about your foolish...er...kindness doesn't help to reassure you.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghoulish%20Effigy\"&gt;Ghoulish Effigy&lt;/a&gt;\nApparently, undead rather dislike scarecrows, Abercrombie's latest plan. He sends you into the cemetary to get some Ghoul Ribs, conjuring bad memories of getting the rot blossoms. Upon bringing him the ribs, he tells you he has one last thing.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Thieves\"&gt;Ogre Thieves&lt;/a&gt;\nWhile picking herbs a ways away from his house, some ogres ambushed him and he lost his crate. Upon retrieving it, you realize the crate smells like undeath, whatever \"that\" smells like. Returning it to him, he gives you a letter to take to the mayor of Darkshire.\n&lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20the%20Mayor\"&gt;Note to the Mayor&lt;/a&gt;\nAccording to Abercrombie, he and &lt;a href=\"Ello%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Ello Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, the mayor, know each other well, and have been good friends for a long time. However, Ebonlocke knows no man by the name of Abercrombie. He opens the letter, only to find it in an ancient language that he can't read.\n&lt;a href=\"Translate%20Abercrombie%27s%20Note\"&gt;Translate Abercrombie's Note&lt;/a&gt;\nLuckily for the mayor and you, &lt;a href=\"Sirra%20Von%27Indi\"&gt;Sirra Von'Indi&lt;/a&gt;, a man who loves languages and knows many of them, is out in the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;. You deliver the letter, and Sirra looks ecstatic to put his skills to work.\n&lt;a href=\"Wait%20for%20Sirra%20to%20Finish\"&gt;Wait for Sirra to Finish&lt;/a&gt;\nSirra begins to translate the note, and his face becomes more and more worried as he translates the note. As he hands it to you to take it back to the mayor, he urges you to hurry. The horrors unleashed by Abercrombie are probably already on their way...\n&lt;a href=\"Translation%20to%20Ello\"&gt;Translation to Ello&lt;/a&gt;\nAs Ello reads the letter, he begins to shake. He tells you that even though you were helping Abercrombie out of kindness, Darkshire may be doomed. Abercrombie is known as \"The Embalmer,\" a tale told to children to scare them into being good. The Embalmer was a kind old alchemist, beloved by all, and he loved his wife more than anything in the world. However, when she died, he could not bear the pain, and used dark magic to cut out his heart and place it in her chest. It kept her alive, but gave her a hunger for human flesh, forcing him to keep her buried. Ello tells you that there is only one solution: find his wife and take the Embalmer's heart, the source of his power!\n&lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20the%20Embalmer\"&gt;Bride of the Embalmer&lt;/a&gt;\nAs you run from the town hall, a monster roars out! It could only be &lt;a href=\"Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt;, the monster you helped create. He lumbers toward Darkshire, but is killed with a little help from the Night Watch. Behind Abercrombie's shack, you approach Eliza's grave. As you dig her up, she realizes you aren't Abercrombie, and proceeds to try and eat you. You prevail, carving open her chest and pulling out Abercrombie's still-beating heart. Upon taking it back to Mayor Ebonlocke, you are lauded as a great hero, and will go down in Darkshire's history!\nRewards.\nThese come from completing &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20the%20Embalmer\"&gt;Bride of the Embalmer&lt;/a&gt;, along with experience and cash rewards."}

Though under the protection of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the town has become a base for many of the operations of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. From their workshops and warehouses on the docks, they use Bridgeport as a center to ship cargo across the region, often illegally. The town is also the site of an Ashvane chemistry operation, where &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; continues to be researched and refined.\nHistory.\nBridgeport has traditionally been a major trade hub for the southeastern region of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, through which many goods are shipped. In particular, Bridgeport services the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Foundry\"&gt;Ashvane Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, a main production center in the area. As a result of its economic importance, the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; maintains offices and workshops within the port.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, Bridgeport became a hotspot for the illegal smuggling of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons and munitions by the Ashvane Company. The nature of the cargo was not known by the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Admiralty\"&gt;Proudmoore authorities&lt;/a&gt;, even though the port was garrisoned by a battalion of their marines. Hired ships, such as the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Maiden%27s%20Virtue\"&gt;Maiden's Virtue&lt;/a&gt;\", carried these weapons on to locations such as &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; where they were used to arm &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;'s upcoming coup.\nTo further develop their Azerite weaponry, the Company also set up chemical workshops in the port. These facilities yielded impressive new Azerite products, some of which were fine enough to be sent on to Boralus.\n&lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; eventually arrived in Bridgeport investigating the Ashvane Company's plans. After learning more about the smuggling operation taking place, and securing a sample of Azerite as evidence, they stowed away on the \"Maiden's Virtue\" to discover the destination of the cargo. The ship would, however, become wrecked on the coast before reaching its final destination: Freehold.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would turn its attention on Bridgeport not long after establishing a foothold in Tiragarde Sound. Directed by &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; laid a trap for the garrison of Bridgeport under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Amalia%20Stone\"&gt;Captain Amalia Stone&lt;/a&gt;. After causing a scene and luring much of the guard out of town, they detonated a large cache of explosives, killing the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt;s instantly. In the aftermath, Captain Stone's body was recovered by the Horde, and she was eventually raised as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nResidents.\nNamed.\n\"During &lt;a href=\"Stow%20and%20Go\"&gt;Stow and Go&lt;/a&gt;\""}

She was the daughter of the former &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;. Brigitte later became Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Ashbringer.\nBrigitte Abbendis is perhaps the most fervent of all the leaders of the Crusade. She hates the undead with a fanatical loathing and thinks nothing of sacrificing her troops in an effort to eradicate the walking dead. Brigitte is the daughter of the previous &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, an older man who sought to destroy all undead. He passed that mission onto his daughter before he died at the hands of the undead.\nBrigitte was one of the members of the Silver Hand present when then-Commander &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; revealed his plan to forge the weapon that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and participated in the act of cleansing the sword's crystal. She seemed to accompany &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt; at that meeting in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;. She, her father High General Abbendis, Grand Inquisitor Isillien, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; formed the Crusade. She then accompanied Alexandros and &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; to the Scarlet Monastery and claimed it for the Crusade. She then participated in the battle for &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, in which her father sacrificed himself to protect her. She was promoted to High General after his death.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHigh General Abbendis was originally found in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. She was frequently found visiting the city's &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand%20Abbey\"&gt;abbey&lt;/a&gt; or planning the Crusade's military operations in the garrison.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nNew Avalon.\nAbbendis appears at several locations in &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;: either just in front of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Hold\"&gt;Scarlet Hold&lt;/a&gt; while on the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20Comes%20From%20On%20High\"&gt;Death Comes From On High&lt;/a&gt;\" or at &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Harbor\"&gt;King's Harbor&lt;/a&gt; while on the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Meeting%20With%20Fate\"&gt;A Meeting With Fate&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNew Hearthglen.\nWith the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Brigitte has been stationed as the leader of the organization in the cathedral of &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Diary%20of%20High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;The Diary of High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; details her campaign in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; up until the events unfolding in Northrend.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; want &lt;a href=\"The%20Head%20of%20the%20High%20General\"&gt;Abbendis' head&lt;/a&gt;.

Upon leaving &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt;, new Forsaken &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s will be directed to Brill where they will continue the Forsaken's war against both the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the ever-present &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the center of Tirisfal, directly north of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Capital City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; not much was left of the town but rubble and ruins. Sometime after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken regained control of the town and began its reconstruction.\nHistory.\nThe Third War.\nBrill was once a small town within the human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the earliest towns to become afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; that would eventually cripple the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northern lands&lt;/a&gt;. It was at Brill that the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, still a living man, first started his experiments with the Plague that would come to be the demise of the kingdom of Lordaeron. The success of the infestation was such that it allowed Kel'Thuzad to convince the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to launch the invasion even before it was planned. The mass graveyard just outside of Brill was made to accommodate the large number of deaths Tirisfal suffered when the Plague first came. The town's &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Defenders\"&gt;Regional Defenders&lt;/a&gt; were unable to save the villagers and eventually, the defense force was pushed out of Brill. There, they joined Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; during his mission to investigate and uncover the source of the Plague.\nFollowing the weakening of the Lich King due to the spell cast by &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;'s rebel Forsaken were able to quickly assume control of the town, along with numerous other sites in Tirisfal Glades.\nThe citizens of Brill now fight daily to preserve their freedom against their enemies.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAccording to some &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;s, Brill once had a blacksmith but he turned back into a mindless minion of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Brill's buildings had already been updated with the new Forsaken architecture seen in Northrend in addition of a statue of the Banshee Queen.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Brill was completely destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in their invasion to retake &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Little was left of the town apart from the walls that once surrounded it and some ruins. The Alliance built a camp among the rubble to prepare for the siege.\nAt least some of the citizens survived since &lt;a href=\"Zachariah%20Post\"&gt;Zachariah Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velma%20Warnam\"&gt;Velma Warnam&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; afterwards.\nPrimary enemies of Brill.\nThe Scourge.\nLike all Forsaken, the citizens of Brill are in a constant battle against their former master, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally Scourge will slip past the defenders of the Bulwark, the protectors of Tirisfal from the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The citizens of Brill have taken it upon themselves to be the Bulwark's rear guard, since success at the Bulwark depends on a one-front battle, as well as protecting the supply lines to the Bulwark. They focus their attention particularly on the Balnir Farmstead to the east, which has become a haven for interloping Scourge. The Scourge have also trickled into Tirisfal Glades and infested the area west of Brill, near the old bridge. In addition, the Scourge use the &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Hide\"&gt;Rot Hide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s at Garren's Haunt to further their cause.\nThe most significant threat from the Scourge comes from the &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;Agamand Mills&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, which have become a foothold for the Scourge, led by a skeleton named Captain Dargol. Dargol uses the &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Family%20Crypt\"&gt;Agamand Family Crypt&lt;/a&gt; to raise the ancestors of the Agamands and use them against the citizens of Brill, who must be constantly alert for their attacks.\nRot Hide gnolls.\nThe Rot Hide gnolls are a group of undead gnolls, controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, that have set up camp at Garren's Haunt to the north of Brill. Their primary mission is to steal corpses from the mass graves just outside of Brill so that the Scourge may use them to bolster their forces. They are led by a vile gnoll named Maggot Eye.\nScarlet Crusade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; have set up their base of operations in Tirisfal Glades at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, high on a hill to the northeast of Brill. In addition, they have a number of outposts throughout Tirisfal Glades (mostly ruined towers from the last war) from which to engage their attacks and raids against the Scourge and Forsaken. The humans at the &lt;a href=\"Solliden%20Farmstead\"&gt;Solliden Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; to the west of Brill aid the Scarlet Crusade in their fight against the undead.\nAlliance.\nAlthough Brill is located deep within Horde territory, there is still the threat of occasional Alliance forces attacking from &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the southern lands. This has increased after the removal of &lt;a href=\"Dishonorable%20Kill\"&gt;dishonorable kills&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt; system, as formerly Brill would be avoided due to the huge amounts of &lt;a href=\"civilian\"&gt;civilian&lt;/a&gt;s present there. Now, however, there is little to stop willing raiding parties emerging from the south; provided they do not fear the inhabitants of the Undercity nearby.\nIn the RPG.\nThis once-bustling human city is in &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; hands and is their primary settlement outside &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Brill is home to the &lt;a href=\"Gallow%27s%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;Gallow's End Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, a pleasant if smelly establishment. Adjacent to Brill is an enormous cemetery that holds many dead from the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The Rothide gnolls have been robbing graves recently. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Sevren\"&gt;Magistrate Sevren&lt;/a&gt;, Brill's leader and a surprisingly genial fellow, is trying to stop them."}

{"id": "12743", "revid": "30741107", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12743", "title": "Shaman", "text": "Shaman (sometimes pluralized as shamans) are mortal mediators between the very elements themselves. The shaman is a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20class\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, able to &lt;a href=\"Specialization\"&gt;specialize&lt;/a&gt; in offensive spellcasting, melee damage dealing, or healing. As such, the class is considered highly adaptable and versatile, as shaman are formidable opponents, able to respond to any situation with a range of unique abilities. Often spiritual guides of their communities, these powerful practitioners commune with the ancestors and seek to balance the raging elemental forces. Shaman become deadly warriors, unstoppable spellcasters, and quick-witted healers by working respectfully with the &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring combat, shaman place damaging and controlling totems on the ground to maximize their effectiveness while hindering their enemies. They are versatile enough to battle foes up close or at range, but wise shaman choose their avenue of attack based on their enemies' strengths and weaknesses. By calling on their spiritual power, shaman can restore health to injured allies. They enhance their weapons with elemental effects, empowering their blows with the power of fire, wind, or ice. The elemental force of the shaman can be used to damage enemies from afar with lightning strikes, earthquakes, and lava bursts. They can choose to deploy a wide array of different &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20totem\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;, each with unique effects from improved restoration to greater damage, enhanced crowd control, and more.\nShaman talents can strengthen their ability to heal the wounded, empower their melee attacks with natural force, or call upon blistering elemental spells:\nClass overview.\n\"For millennia, since the primitive tribal cultures of Azeroth and Draenor, the natural elements of the physical universe have been celebrated, feared, and even worshiped. Mystics sought communion with the earth, air, fire, and water, and learned to tap into their raw power. In time, these spiritual guides came to understand that nature's elemental forces aren't wholly benevolent, but have, in fact, been locked in an unending conflict of chaos and primal fury that once consumed the physical realm. So began the calling of the Shaman, to bring balance to these volatile energies, leveraging their intensity to mend wounds . . . or inflict them.\"\nGame guide.\n\"Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman's allies or punish those who threaten them.\"\n\"These masters of the elements can also call upon elemental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder. The experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile heroes and valued members of any group.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"Shaman commune directly with the elements. Their combination of wisdom and resilience makes them ideal as tribal advisors and leaders. In battle the shaman uses totems and spells to manipulate the elements and provoke other fighters into untold heights of rage and might. Shamans exemplify the primal bond between the savage races and their environment.\"\nClassic guide.\n\" Limited to the Horde, Shamans commune with the chaotic elements, harnessing primal fury to enhance weapons, empower totems, and augment their own abilities.\"\nBackground.\nShamanism has existed since the sapient races first discovered the power of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, now shattered &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were shamanistic; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; were shamanistic, while the trolls had a history of shamanistic worship of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, or spirits. Before being accustomed to the divine &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; or the potency of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; had primitive belief systems that incorporated simple nature &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, practicing crude forms of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism and shamanism.\n230 years prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; was founded by &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to lead their people with wisdom and maintain the harmony between the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThough shamanism on Azeroth flourished and still continues to, shamanism on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was all but extinct by the time of the great crossing of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth via the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest and yet some of the most vilified orcs were once shaman, such as &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, archdemon of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, distorted the shaman's connection with their spirits in the sacred mountain of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, himself taking on the form of the shaman's ancestors to convince the shaman (who held much political sway in the orcish culture) that the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were the enemy. The ensuing &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;massacres&lt;/a&gt; upon several draenei hunting parties offended the spirits, who eventually denied the shaman their powers. Prior to this, the orcs could easily overpower wandering draenei groups, but the nascent Horde was now vulnerable to their &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. All was set for the transition. Cut off from their elemental powers, the shaman were offered to turn to the more efficient and masterful powers of the Burning Legion, becoming &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. Most of the shaman eagerly accepted, even wise and honorable orcs such as &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;. As the orcs and Draenor got gradually more corrupted, Kil'jaeden and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had a barrier put around Oshu'gun which prevented the ancestral spirits and K'ure from making contact with the outside world. Orcs were also forbidden on &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s orders to ever return to the mountain, to make sure none could realize the deception. This effectively outlawed shamanism and its practice.\nYears later, after the destruction of Draenor and its transformation into Outland, the elements slowly recovered from the turmoil and uncertainty of being ravaged along with the land when the portals were opened. For some time, they were lost, confused, and neglected: very much like, they sensed, a kindred spirit in a certain &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; draenei named &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; was. Hopeful that he would be receptive to contact with them, they did so once they recovered sufficiently enough to reach out once again, and found that he was. In an experience that was probably not too dissimilar to the first ancient shaman of other races, the elements themselves taught Nobundo the delicate balance of nature and the powers and truth of the Five Elements. Spending years primarily as a student of the elements, Nobundo would become a teacher himself, seeking out his first students among his own people at &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; and opened a new path for the draenei.\nThird War.\nShamanism in the orcs remained all but extinct until &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the son of the deceased &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and future chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; clan, grabbed hold of the reins of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, ushering in a new generation of shamanism, breaking the crippling lethargy of the captive orcs and outlawing the dark magic of the Burning Legion. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, a shaman was a derogatory term for someone who told fantastical and unbelievable stories. Shamanism is now at its peak, though, as the New Horde itself became led by a shaman of great power in the new orcish nation of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; have started to follow the path of the shaman under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, although for some draenei, the shamanistic teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; were considered as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al and a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Draenei and Broken shaman later integrated the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, with the main goal to heal &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; shaman helped new elementals to replace &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; respectively. They then managed to convince the four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s to band together against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. During the conflict, shaman and elementals worked actively from the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s off the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nShamanism is a deeply spiritual form of elemental &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that involves a connection with both the natural and the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. Shaman do not normally enslave &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, but honor them, asking the elements to heed their call. Consequently, the power of the shaman is borrowed, rather than taken. Shaman are not inherently imbued with magic - they harness the powers of the elements through &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20totem\"&gt;ceremonial totems&lt;/a&gt;. There is a relation to the spiritual magic of shaman and the natural magic of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, which is why the shaman were able to hear the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Shaman said that all things had a life, a power, a spirit. They are deeply involved with the spirits of the elements \u2014 earth, air, fire, water, and the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Wilds\"&gt;Spirit of the Wilds&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and claimed they could sense the &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;life force&lt;/a&gt; in earth and even seemingly dead stone. This Spirit energy is what gave the shaman their connection to the elements, to others, and to themselves. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; save this Spirit for apprentice's studies till they are ready.\nDuring a conversation, &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; explained to his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; that shaman have a bond with the things of the natural world, thus they strive always to work in harmony with them, with respect in their heart and the willingness to offer something in return. Unlike &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who used the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; through their spells, the shaman call for the powers of the elements and work with those who respond, knowing they are borrowed only, never bought. This is their primary agreement, and if they violate it, nothing of nature would ever respond to them again. They request only the barest needs for themselves and their people, and at times, may ask great things, but only when the cause is good and just. In the end, the elements are powerful entities who come of their own free will, and who are companions in their magic, not slaves.\n&lt;a href=\"Farseer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt;s are exceptionally powerful and wise shaman that play the role of advisors or take on leadership positions in their communities. They are highly esteemed and respected by their factions.\nUnlike the others, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; shaman follow the motto of \"Controlling the Elements for Fun and Profit\". They are an extension of their society's single-minded devotion to making profit; to a goblin shaman, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are potential customers with whom they can negotiate and enter contracts. They tend to be a bit more forceful in their negotiations than the other shamanic races would like, though not as forceful as the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;. Some goblin shaman mechanically modify both their totems and their elemental minions. To shaman of other races, these methods can seem unorthodox or outrageously disrespectful to the elements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; is a dark version of a shaman, forcing the elements into servitude by using &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt;, twisting them into burned-out ash, corrupted waters, and toxic air. They also use the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; to enslave the elements.\nRaces.\nThe shaman class can be played by the following races:\nSpecializations.\nElemental.\nA spellcaster who harnesses the destructive forces of nature and the elements.\nElemental shaman are powerful spellcasters, fulfilling a caster &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; role to blast and scorch enemies from afar. They benefit from numerous improvements to their offensive spell casting abilities, boasting reduced cooldowns and mana costs, and increased crit chance, range and damage dealt for many of their spells. Dedicated casters, Elemental shaman' play is augmented with a number of mechanics rewarding spell-casting, including &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Focus\"&gt;Elemental Focus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Surge\"&gt;Lava Surge&lt;/a&gt; They also gain some unique abilities of their own, including the iconic &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; - a powerful &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; ability notorious for propelling enemies from high edges in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; - and their . Elemental is the choice for shaman who want to play a ranged damage-dealer and maximize their damage output with their spells.\n&lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt; is another Elemental ability which, while broadly similar to &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, also has utility in being able to knock down foes caught in its area of effect, making it very versatile in both &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; settings when used right. Combining their &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, an Elemental shaman can do considerable &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nThe most important &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; for Elemental is &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt;, which increases spell power. The second-most important statistic is &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;, which increases their casting speed.\n\"Certain shaman have dedicated themselves above all else to forging a deep bond with the elements. They have peered beyond the Elemental Plane, gleaning visions of an ancient past where manifestations of volatile energies once raged unimpeded across primordial Azeroth. Through careful study and dedication, the elemental shaman is able to channel such power into destructive magical surges. Through the body of the shaman flows bolts of lightning, as if from storm, and bursts of fire, as if from molten earth. They manipulate the land itself and summon spirits of earth, fire, and storm to their aid. To battle an elemental shaman is to taunt the very forces of nature.\"\nEnhancement.\nA totemic warrior who strikes foes with weapons imbued with elemental power.\nEnhancement shaman are &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealers&lt;/a&gt;, smiting opponents with elementally-empowered weapons. A unique melee spec that derives a large portion of its damage from spells, the playstyle of an Enhancement shaman is very active and hectic. Using the right abilities at the right time, combined with &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%20Weapon\"&gt;Maelstrom Weapon&lt;/a&gt; procs, it's a very engaging spec to play.\nSignature abilities of this spec include &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wield%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;Dual Wield (shaman ability)&lt;/a&gt;, giving shaman the ability to &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt; one-handed-weapons, &lt;a href=\"Windfury\"&gt;Windfury&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a chance of each of your main hand attack to trigger extra attacks, and &lt;a href=\"Stormstrike\"&gt;Stormstrike&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the shaman to hit with both weapons at once for a large amount of damage.\nEnhancement Shamans use &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%20%28game%20resource%29\"&gt;Maelstrom (game resource)&lt;/a&gt; as their resource instead of mana. They passively generate Maelstrom with each auto attack, and can also actively generate it with &lt;a href=\"Rockbiter\"&gt;Rockbiter&lt;/a&gt;. They spend their Maelstrom through their usage of &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Lash\"&gt;Lava Lash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Lightning\"&gt;Crash Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and many other skills.\nFinally, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Spirit\"&gt;Feral Spirit&lt;/a&gt; allows enhancement shaman to summon a pair of immensely powerful spirit wolves which add a fair amount to the shaman's DPS while active, as well as generating Maelstrom for each time they attack (and providing some unique utility in breaking snares, sprinting, stunning, and taunting enemies).\n\"Intense communion with fire, earth, air, and water isn't exclusive to the elemental shaman. In many ways, enhancement shaman similarly bond with nature and leverage its power on the battlefield. What distinguishes them in their training\u2014and in their connection with the elements\u2014is their combat methodology. These shaman favor empowering their physical attacks with elemental energies and facing their adversaries up close. They don't shy from the frontlines, wielding magically augmented weapons, potent elemental attacks, and totems that shape the tide of battle.\"\nRestoration.\nA healer who calls upon ancestral spirits and the cleansing power of water to mend allies' wounds.\nRestoration shaman are versatile healers well suited for any situation, with numerous passive abilities reducing the casting time and mana cost of healing spells, while increasing their effectiveness. On top of that, they offer good utility (like mana regeneration using &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Mana Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;) and strong multi-target healing through &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Rain\"&gt;Healing Rain&lt;/a&gt;. Signature abilities include &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt;, a long-term buff that triggers a heal whenever the target is damaged, and &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;, an instant cast heal and an &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn important mechanic of the restoration shaman is the &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Waves\"&gt;Tidal Waves&lt;/a&gt; buff, granted upon casting a &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt;. This buff has initially two stacks. A single stack is consumed upon casting a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Greater Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Surge\"&gt;Healing Surge&lt;/a&gt;. A spent charge makes a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Greater Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; much faster to cast or increases the crit chance of a &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Surge\"&gt;Healing Surge&lt;/a&gt;. This makes careful management of &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Waves\"&gt;Tidal Waves&lt;/a&gt; and the Healing Wave spells essential for a good Restoration shaman.\nRestoration shaman are highly effective in PvP and group PvE, the only drawback being their rather low damage output, which can make solo play more difficult. In return, a Restoration shaman hardly ever dies while questing/soloing.\nRestoration shaman should focus on &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to maximize their healing output while maintaining enough mana regeneration to last the fight.\n\"Some shaman find a serene affinity for the restorative properties of water. These shaman do not necessarily seek the Light or turn to the divine, yet they feel a profound spiritual connection with the source from which all mortal life took root. So strong is their connection with water that the shaman is able to restore life and heal afflictions. They balance this with a command of the other elements, finding harmony in nature and purifying their allies as a tidal surge washes across a sandy shore.\"\nOverview.\nShaman were originally a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive class available to three races: &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The class was designed as the counterpart to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, and they shared many qualities such as a strong focus on &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20weapon%20buffs\"&gt;buffs&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to act as an &lt;a href=\"off-tank\"&gt;off-tank&lt;/a&gt;, and useful &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; spells. However, balancing the two classes against each other to prevent one faction from having a clear advantage became too difficult for developers, restricting the development of both classes. After the release of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2007, the Alliance gained access to the shaman class with the introduction of the alien &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, while the Horde gained access to paladins through the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. With both factions now capable of fielding shaman and paladins, developers have been able to balance the shaman against the other classes instead of trying to mirror paladins. Later expansions have seen the shaman class become available to new races.\nIn the past, shaman were often considered a \u201cJack of all trades, master of none\u201d. This was a result of their ability to perform many abilities outside the normal realm of skills for their primary specialization. It was also a result of the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" model for the shaman's iconic &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20totem\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;, in which many classes provided &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Winter\"&gt;more powerful&lt;/a&gt; versions of a shaman's &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20Earth%20Totem\"&gt;totem buffs&lt;/a&gt; but no class provided the same amount of variety. \nIn game, shaman are capable of filling three roles: &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt;. These roles are represented by the &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20specs\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20specs\"&gt;Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20specs\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s. Originally, Enhancement shaman were designed to be viable &lt;a href=\"off-tank\"&gt;off-tank&lt;/a&gt;s to counter the abilities of &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20specs\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; paladins. As the Horde gained access to paladins with &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and with the addition of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; class in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the need for shaman tanks was eliminated. Though developers pushed the class towards being exclusively damage dealers or healers, some enthusiasts maintained tanking simple encounters using Enhancement shaman. However, with the removal of the &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; statistic in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, it became impossible for shaman tanks to prevent &lt;a href=\"Defense%23Critical%20Hits\"&gt;critical strikes&lt;/a&gt;, effectively ending their history.\nAbilities.\nTotems.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman%20totem\"&gt;Shaman totem&lt;/a&gt;s are unique to the shaman, and give them access to unique and powerful abilities. Once a totem is put down, it cannot be moved, so the shaman must have the intended position in mind when using it. Only Restoration has baseline access to totems, one example being &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;. Enhancement and Elemental need to spec into certain totem talents to have access to totems themselves, such as &lt;a href=\"Totem%20Mastery\"&gt;Totem Mastery&lt;/a&gt; for Elemental and Enhancement, or extra totems for Restoration such as &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Wall%20Totem\"&gt;Earthen Wall Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman%20abilities\"&gt;Shaman spells&lt;/a&gt; include direct damage spells, heals, and weapon buffs among others. Their spells are mostly based on the elements.\nShaman also are graced with &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Recall\"&gt;Astral Recall&lt;/a&gt;, a spell similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, but it can only be used when out of combat, and is on a separate shorter cooldown.\nFinally, the combination of &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Spirit\"&gt;Ancestral Spirit&lt;/a&gt; make shaman the only class able to begin &lt;a href=\"wipe%20recovery\"&gt;wipe recovery&lt;/a&gt; without outside help. These abilities make the shaman one of the most powerful support classes in the game. \nEquipment.\nShaman can wear &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt;, but they should seek to only wear mail armor. Shaman will often compete with &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s for armor, since both classes use Mail armor. All shaman specifications can equip &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stave\"&gt;stave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s. In &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, Enhancement shaman gained the ability to &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wield%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt; gear sets for shaman which can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20sets\"&gt;Shaman sets&lt;/a&gt; page. The &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; profession is capable of crafting many pieces of &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt; that are attractive to both &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; focused shaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Enhancement\"&gt;Enhancement&lt;/a&gt; shaman should dual wield &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt; weapons. &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; shaman should equip an &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"main%20hand\"&gt;main hand&lt;/a&gt; weapon and a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Caster\"&gt;Caster&lt;/a&gt; shaman may also equip non-shield off-hand items or, if the stats are more beneficial, &lt;a href=\"stave\"&gt;stave&lt;/a&gt;s. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, shaman equipped a &lt;a href=\"Totem%20%28relic%29\"&gt;Totem&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"Relic%20%28slot%29\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt; slot in lieu of having a &lt;a href=\"ranged%20weapon\"&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/a&gt;. However, with &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"ranged%20weapon\"&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/a&gt; slot was removed and the relic items were phased out.\nEnd-game expectations.\nTotems are a major part of the end game and knowing what totems will benefit the shaman's group members best in different situations is all part of the strategy involved in playing a shaman. All shamans have access to powerful spells such as &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful raid-wide cooldown that considerably increases everyone's haste for a long period of time, and useful utility such as &lt;a href=\"Hex\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn elemental shaman will be expected to maximize their damage output as a ranged DPS through careful management of their stats such as Intellect and Versatility, and usage of their offensive spells such as &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Burst\"&gt;Lava Burst&lt;/a&gt;. They are able to call upon &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;Fire Elemental (shaman ability)&lt;/a&gt; for extra damage and also &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Elemental%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;Earth Elemental (shaman ability)&lt;/a&gt; if the shaman requires help tanking an enemy mob.\nAn enhancement shaman will be expected to maximize their damage as a melee DPS by stacking stats such as Haste, Agility and Critical Strike. They have access to elemental buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Flametongue\"&gt;Flametongue&lt;/a&gt; to increase their damage output and powerful abilities like &lt;a href=\"Stormstrike\"&gt;Stormstrike&lt;/a&gt; to devastate all enemies within melee range.\nA restoration shaman will be expected to maximize their healing, and much like an elemental shaman requires Intellect and Critical Strike. They also have access to a vast array of totems to aid their healing, from the minor &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Stream%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Stream Totem&lt;/a&gt;, to the powerful raid-wide healing of the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;, to the potentially raid saving &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Link%20Totem\"&gt;Spirit Link Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nShamans are spiritual visionaries of tribes and clans. These gifted warriors can see into the world of spirits and communicate with creatures invisible to eyes of normal beings. They are beset by visions of the future and use their sight to guide their people through troubled times. Although the shaman may seem wise and serene at first glance, he is a formidable foe: when angered, his wrath is as fierce as those who have a connection to &lt;a href=\"Eternals\"&gt;Eternals&lt;/a&gt; or nature.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "717100", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=717100", "title": "Shaman-tank", "text": "Shaman-tank or sometimes referred to as \"Warden\" is the playstyle of adopting the traits of the tank role in ' and ' as a &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially, the Shaman was not designed to fulfill the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; role during its original inception, but over the years, the Shaman as a tank has improved through research and effort from the community to legitimize their role as an unofficial tank. Shaman, although, not the most optimal class to be played as a tank is still deemed to be a viable option. If it wasn't obvious before, shield-bearing is a sizeable undertaking that demands more effort than traditional tanking classes i.e. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you want a challenge and a refreshing perspective from a very old game, look no further than the Shaman tank. Many players who take up the tanking mantle agree their motivation is from the glory of seizing a feat the rest of the realm dares not try. When experienced players tank with a shaman and put in the effort, it shines tenfold. Shamans can fully tank 5mans, 10mans, off-tank &amp; main-tank &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. But, this is reliant on personal and guild experience. Their overall defensive statistics won't reach a warrior's. However, it isn't necessary to do so, to tank.\nRaces.\nIn World of Warcraft Classic, the Shaman class is exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; faction under the following races: &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;. Most future tank players who want to have as much working for them as possible will opt in for Troll because of the racial: &lt;a href=\"Berserking\"&gt;Berserking&lt;/a&gt;. But keep in mind, there is no \"wrong race\" since racial benefits are minor compared to other aspects.\nProfessions.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s]], which can flesh out a character's potential. When it comes to a shaman tanking, the most suitable profession is &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; because of its numerous tools, ex: &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sapper%20Charge\"&gt;Masterwork Target Dummy&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; uniquely for the weapon: &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; but if a player has access to the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; raid and the loot it has to offer i.e. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Edge%20of%20Insanity\"&gt;Dark Edge of Insanity&lt;/a&gt;, the Blacksmithing profession can be disregarded and the player can go a high &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; generating profession on their &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gold helps buy &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s among other useful items for tanking.\nThreat management.\nA Shaman can increase &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; in many ways, notably: &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shock\"&gt;Earth Shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormstrike\"&gt;Stormstrike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockbiter%20Weapon\"&gt;Rockbiter Weapon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Shield\"&gt;Lightning Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Installing an &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;AddOn&lt;/a&gt; to monitor threat is recommended. Threat can also originate from items that replenish &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;, ex: &lt;a href=\"Major%20Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Major Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt; based on half of the Health &amp; Mana gained. Items, which inflict damage, ex: &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sapper%20Charge\"&gt;Goblin Sapper Charge&lt;/a&gt; deal threat equal to the damage done so do reflective &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, ex: &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, certain items deal threat each time their &lt;a href=\"Debuff\"&gt;Debuff&lt;/a&gt; is triggered, ex: &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20Arthas\"&gt;Gift of Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. \nAllies can reduce their threat, through items, ex: &lt;a href=\"Fetish%20of%20the%20Sand%20Reaver\"&gt;Fetish of the Sand Reaver&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; class can reduce their threat through the talent: &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Soul\"&gt;Burning Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Shaman: &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; wipe threat with &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; and so can &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Petrification\"&gt;Flask of Petrification&lt;/a&gt;. Items prevent aggro: &lt;a href=\"Limited%20Invulnerability%20Potion\"&gt;Limited Invulnerability Potion&lt;/a&gt; and redirect &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;: Masterwork Target Dummy. Classes in the 30-40 yard range won't get aggro until they surpass the threat level of the mob's target by 30%, as opposed to 10% for melee.\nTotems.\nShamans get access to a multitude of class unique &lt;a href=\"totems\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;, some totems can help with tanking, notably &lt;a href=\"Grace%20of%20Air%20Totem\"&gt;Grace of Air Totem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stoneskin Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Stream%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Stream Totem&lt;/a&gt;. Totems are incapable of generating threat for the Shaman.\nTalents.\nOur totemic friend can go down three &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt; path trees. The most relevant talent path for tanking being &lt;a href=\"Enhancement\"&gt;Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;, which delivers Toughness, Anticipation, and &lt;a href=\"Stormstrike\"&gt;Stormstrike&lt;/a&gt; among other talents. The most popular talent point allocation being &lt;a href=\"https%3A//classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/2503015-0505000055503151\"&gt;(16/35/0)&lt;/a&gt;.\nRotations.\nA sequence of abilities or \"&lt;a href=\"rotation\"&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt;\" is advised to master your tanking potential. A tank rotation is split into three phases: Pre-pull, Pulling, and Combat.\nBuffs + Debuffs.\nThere's a maximum of 32 &lt;a href=\"Buff\"&gt;Buffs&lt;/a&gt;, avoid nearing the max as it may result in Buffs getting pushed off, it's advised to install an addon to keep track of buffs. Prioritize getting defensive Buffs, ex: [Elixir of Fortitude]] before getting buffs that bolster threat, ex: &lt;a href=\"Juju%20Might\"&gt;Juju Might&lt;/a&gt;. \nA max of 16 &lt;a href=\"Debuff\"&gt;Debuffs&lt;/a&gt; can be on a mob. Reaching the max is major in raids. There's defensive debuffs: &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Swarm\"&gt;Insect Swarm&lt;/a&gt; and threat Debuffs: &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; among others. If in a raid, ask the &lt;a href=\"Leader\"&gt;raid leader&lt;/a&gt;, if certain Debuffs can be placed on the mob, without overstepping.\nGear + Enchants.\nCement defensive stats when gearing, threat is second. It's advised to get 4k HP &amp; 5k Armor unbuffed for &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, ~4800 to 5k HP and 6500-7k Armor. For reliable threat, 3% melee Hit is advised for dungeons. For Raid tanking, 6% Melee Hit. You can only equip a weapon &amp; shield while in combat, enabling the switch to a defensive weapon, ex: &lt;a href=\"Spineshatter\"&gt;Spineshatter&lt;/a&gt;, if survival seems grim.\nThere are two types of enchants, defensive, ex: &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Gloves%20-%20Superior%20Agility\"&gt;Enchant Gloves - Superior Agility&lt;/a&gt;. And offensive, ex: &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Gloves%20-%20Threat\"&gt;Enchant Gloves - Threat&lt;/a&gt;. Having the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; profession isn't needed to gain the profession's advantages. Simply, give the Enchanter the required enchanting materials and they will enchant your gear for a small gold tip. \nTanking multiple mobs.\nMany actions can further solidify situations when a tank is dealing with many mobs, ex: &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Immolation\"&gt;Oil of Immolation&lt;/a&gt;, Thorns, &lt;a href=\"Force%20Reactive%20Disk\"&gt;Force Reactive Disk&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It's crucial to switch and attack another target ever so often. In combat, items &amp; spells giving health or mana deal 50% threat divided by each mob. Items can also take help until a decent amount of threat is gained on all mobs, ex: &lt;a href=\"Masterwork%20Target%20Dummy\"&gt;Masterwork Target Dummy&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaid Composition.\nWith the raid leader's consent, offer an ideal raid comp without overstepping. In our group, Warlock: &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Pact\"&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/a&gt;, Warrior: &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Shout\"&gt;Battle Shout&lt;/a&gt;, Druid: &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Leader of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, Hunter: &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Aura\"&gt;Trueshot Aura&lt;/a&gt;. For damage dealing classes, we prefer ranged classes over melee. If melee are needed, rogues are best. Groups with high threat dealers can have a Shaman: &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;."}

In an attempt to rid the Horde of its demonic corruption, Thrall banned the use of &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; magic and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Now, all Orc magic users practice Shaman magic which draws its power from the natural world and the elements.\nInformation.\nThe Orc Shaman is one of the most powerful spellcasters besides the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;. The Shaman is powerful because of his &lt;a href=\"%23Bloodlust%20%28Autocast%29\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; ability mainly. Shamans can Bloodlust any friendly organic unit, including allied units, Orc units, and themselves. They cannot Bloodlust mechanical or magic-immune units like &lt;a href=\"Demolisher%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. You can further enhance this damage with &lt;a href=\"Hero%20unit\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Beast%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Kodo Beast&lt;/a&gt;. Shamans can also slow escaping enemy units with &lt;a href=\"%23Purge\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt; and wreak havoc with &lt;a href=\"%23Lightning%20Shield\"&gt;Lightning Shield&lt;/a&gt; on shadowmelded or tightly packed groups of enemy units. There are several methods of using Shamans. Many players build &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s then work up to Shamans and use the two together. Shamans are also good when used with &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s, or with &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, or with both. As the Orcs get the Shaman magics, the use of Warlock necromancy goes to the Undead &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemember to research &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Adept&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Master Training&lt;/a&gt;. Besides just giving extra spells, these upgrades also increase mana capacity and mana regeneration, which is exactly what you want on spell casting units.\nSpells and abilities.\nPure.\nPurge is useful for removing enemy spell effects. An example would be enemy Sorceresses &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;ing your units. However in team battles, Night Elf players with &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s should fill this role instead.\nHowever, Purge is also effective at grabbing fleeing units, as it temporarily paralyzes them.\nightning Shield.\nNotes: The unit with Lighting Shield deals damage to surrounding units, but the caster of Lighting Shield is considered the killer for kills caused by the Lighting Shield.\nLightning Shield is useful for casting on groups of tightly packed enemy units. Cast Lightning Shield on ranged units, as using it on melee units will result in your own units being damaged too. If the player isn't careful, then their units will die to the shield's effects.\nYou can also cast this on your own units but be warned that good enemy players typically run away until it wears off. \nSelect the unit with Lightning Shield on it and run it away from other units to prevent the Lightning Shield from hurting them. Use the Lightning Shield against the enemy, move a unit with Lightning Shield next to enemy units.\nIt deals no damage if the targeted unit turns invisible.\nloodlust (Autocast).\nLike in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;, Bloodlust is one of the uber spells in the game, especially in team battles. Orc players, regardless of however they build, should always bring in multiple Shamans so they can Bloodlust as many allied units as they can before running out of mana. Bloodlust is a weaker version of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s Unholy Frenzy when it comes to attack speed (40% to 75%), but does not drain health and also increases the movement speed of units under it. Visually in-game, units affected by Bloodlust pulse with red energy and are larger.\nBloodlust stacks with Unholy Frenzy, essentially giving the unit a 115% attack speed increase during their duration.\nIt's best to turn off the autocasting of Bloodlust when you don't need it. That way Shamans can cast whatever is needed during a heavy battle.\nDispel, or use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;s to steal Bloodlust.\nManual description.\nNow, all orc magic users practice shaman magic that draws its power from the natural world and the elements of the earth. Powerful shamans can call lightning from the sky and rouse the earth itself to devour legions of their enemies."}

According to Velen's vision, the Broken would rise to power once again and aid their displaced brethren.\"\n\"Velen's vision was given substance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, a one-time draenei &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; who had devolved while the orcs decimated his race and tore the planet apart. Like his fellow Broken, Nobundo had lost contact with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and so he ventured far into the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to meditate and pray for guidance.\"\n\"After decades of silence, an unfamiliar voice finally answered his prayers. It was not the Light that whispered to him, but the wind. The breeze spoke to him of lost truths, of the might of the elements \u2013 of the delicate balance of power embraced by the shaman.\"\n\"Nobundo listened eagerly and learned all he could. When he judged the time was right, he departed the desert determined to use this knowledge to help the draenei race. However, most draenei refugees greeted the sight of a Broken with skepticism and outright prejudice. Only one of the healthy draenei did not shun the Broken: the wise and perceptive Velen.\"\n\"Velen had heard the philosophy of the shaman before, but Nobundo revealed new truths. The elements were timeless; they stretched across the cosmos to inhabit every world they touched. With the proper training, the draenei might learn to wield this overlooked, seemingly inexhaustible source of power.\"\n\"Velen rejoiced to realize that his vision was coming to pass. Accordingly he took Nobundo with him when he and his fellow refugees took possession of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; satellite structure &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Thus it was that Nobundo journeyed with the draenei to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Nobundo found that unlike the desolate wastes of Outland, Azeroth possessed abundant elemental energies. He shared his knowledge of shamanism with the draenei on Azeroth, and all who adopted its path flourished.\"\n\"The time for the draenei shaman to test themselves draws near, for the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; is once again at hand. And the fate not only of Azeroth, but of all worlds, hangs in the balance.\" \nFrom the Burning Crusade website: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/classcombo.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nShamanism is not popular among the draenei, with many thinking it gets in the way of worship of the light. Nobundo has been accepted among the draenei and teaches all those who will listen a new path. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/q9421\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nDwarf shaman.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; already had shaman during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reasons for &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarf&lt;/a&gt; shaman aren't entirely known, but it likely has to do with the alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. A suggestion is that due to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer dwarves are part of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. As such we will be able to play them as now they are part of Ironforge. This is also true in the case of why dwarves can become &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s due to the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge.\nHorde.\nTauren shaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; are perhaps the most spiritual people on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They revere their ancestors, the spirits of the land, and the great and vague force they call the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. They assisted the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in developing their forgotten shamanic roots. Tauren honor their shaman as they do few others, and their shaman in turn keep their communities in touch with nature and reinvigorate their &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s with spiritual vigor and purpose. The iconic tauren shaman is a calm individual. A meditative spirit holds in check their great size and strength - they are like a boulder in the tide, steadfast and immobile, watching the world as it changes around them. In battle, however they are a terrible force, calling upon the spirits to annihilate their foes. The strong connection to the spirits of their ancestors also allows some tauren to become &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spirit walker&lt;/a&gt;s, which are similar to shaman.\nOrc shaman.\nDuring the Third War\nUnder the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s have rediscovered their ancient Shamanistic traditions. Because of their history, the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are barely tolerated and no longer practice their magic as openly as they once did. Now, most orc magic users practice shaman magic which draws its power from the natural world and the elements of the earth. Powerful shaman can call lightning from the sky and rouse the earth itself to devour legions of their enemies.\nShaman can cause such overwhelming &lt;a href=\"bloodlust\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; in their brethren that affected\nwarriors actually increase in size and power for short periods of time. The shaman\u2019 lightning shields, when cast on fellow warriors, create a barrier that damages any nearby ground units. Shaman can purge any magical spells or enchantments from their comrades or enemies with their ability to purge. Though purge can be useful to remove negative enchantments or curses, it taxes the recipient to such a degree that the unit\u2019s movements are slow and painful. \nOrcs revere the natural elements and shaman are held in high regard. They generally have a close relationship with the nature elements and angering them is considered a grave offense. There is probably no finer example of this than what happened after the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; angered the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; by digging through the ancestral grounds of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt; in order to find alleged ancient relics.\nTroll shaman.\nThe trolls have always had a deep connection to the spirits, though they never called it shamanism. The way of the &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;, which might after time lead up to the respected title, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter\"&gt;Shadow Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, was a common way of life to many trolls. But not all trolls could comprehend the power. A witch doctor would not only have to be able to strike lightning into their foes, with the power granted by the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; God &lt;a href=\"Shango\"&gt;Shango&lt;/a&gt;, controller of storms, or aid allies by mending their wounds, with the might of the Loa God Lokou, master of healing. They would also have to be clever, cunning and ruthless in order to save their &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;, or stop anyone who came in their tribe's way.\nWhen they merged with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls taught their new allies their \"twist\" on shamanism, and tauren and orcs taught them theirs.\nGoblin shaman.\nGoblin shaman are an extension of their society's single-minded devotion to making a profit; to a goblin shaman, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are potential customers. Goblins do tend to be a bit more forceful in their negotiations than the other shamanic races (especially the tauren) would like, though they are far less forceful than what we've seen from the &lt;a href=\"%23Taunka%20shaman\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. (Unless the elemental tries to weasel out of its contract. Elementals tend not to have breakable knees, so goblins sometimes have to resort to other methods of control.) As for the goblins' \"mechanical\" &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20totem\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;, note that these are merely physical manifestations of the small totems they tinker/craft to form a link with the elemental spirits. Instead of lugging around large totems, goblin shaman have a ring (probably the same ring on which they keep their house and motorbike keys) with small totems they've built as conduits for the elemental spirits they do business with. &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Goldmine\"&gt;Initiate Goldmine&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most notable goblin shaman the player will encounter.\nGoblin shaman seem to have first appeared with the \"Cataclysm\", which may mean the class is limited to the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than using traditional wooden totems to channel the spirits' power, goblin shaman infuse their technology with elemental energies, using mechanical totems instead.\nAs their &lt;a href=\"shaman%20trainer\"&gt;shaman trainer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maxx%20Avalanche\"&gt;Maxx Avalanche&lt;/a&gt; is present before meeting the orcs, the Kezan goblins may have learned shamanism from their former &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; oppressors, who now serve the goblins, according to a comment made by &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Dampwick\"&gt;Foreman Dampwick&lt;/a&gt; and a \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" art piece showing a troll being kept by a &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt;. (Though it is still possible it was learned from orcs, as goblins as a whole are known to deal with almost every other race as traders.)\nNeutral.\nPandaren shaman.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; pandaren shaman from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; have joined forces respectively with the Alliance and the Horde, little is known about their kin's affinity for the elements and spirits. &lt;a href=\"Geomancer%23Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren geomancers&lt;/a&gt;, however, are not unheard of. \nOther shaman.\nBlood elf shaman.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; getting busy, many races of Azeroth joined their cause. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Starion\"&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; is known to have become an &lt;a href=\"elementalist\"&gt;elementalist&lt;/a&gt; shaman. \nHuman shaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Demitrian\"&gt;Highlord Demitrian&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, has a connection with the elements unusual in a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that he may be a rare example of a human shaman. The non-canon &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; explicitly states Demitrian is a shaman.\nTaunka shaman.\nUnlike the tauren, the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; have survived only by forcing the land and the elements to yield to their will. Their relationship with nature has been one of constant struggle and grim perseverance.\nIn the RPG.\nFurbolg shaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; society places great importance on shaman. Each furbolg tribe contains at least one shaman, and most of the time a shaman leads the tribe. Lesser furbolg shaman range out with the hunters to protect their territory. Furbolgs share a connection with nature as well; their shaman communicate with the spirits of nature and focus on divine magic that flows in furbolg blood. The iconic furbolg shaman is a peaceful being carrying a feather-topped spear who guides his tribe with benevolence. When his anger is aroused, however, he is a fearsome sight, using his magic to rouse himself and his warriors into a horrible frenzy.\nTuskarr shaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; shaman have the power to influence events such as weather, food, and illnesses. Shaman magic is often quite a production, even something like curing the sick: the shaman may speak with ghosts of the patient's relatives and even battle other spirits into submission before forcing them to help heal the patient.\nQuilboar shaman.\n&lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;Quilboar&lt;/a&gt; shaman possess the abilities to combat or cause disease, to control nature, and to summon spirit &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s. According to quilboar shaman, the existence of sickness is caused by the intrusion of other species on the rightful lands of the quilboar. They teach that until the invaders are driven out and the quilboar have returned to their promised lands, suffering can only be alleviated through a heroic death. The afterlife for quilboar martyrs is filled with wonders and pleasure beyond imagining, according to shamanistic teachings. Quilboar shaman teach that the law of the wild is the standard by which all tribal members must live - survival of the fittest. At least one quilboar every generation walks the path of the shaman. Quilboar never seek to become shaman, but a few are awarded the right to study with their elders when visited by dreams of former shaman now deceased. Shaman usually rise to positions of power and leadership within their tribes. Most often it is males that receive the dream-vision that sets them on the shaman's path, although female shaman are not uncommon. On occasion, a quilboar receives a dream-vision where the deceased shaman of the tribe counsel him to leave the pack. The vision may seem confusing to the quilboar, but tribal shaman take these visitations seriously.\nDark Iron dwarven shaman.\nThe spellcasters of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are usually &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s or shaman, as these deal closely with fire.\nWildhammer dwarven shaman.\nShaman and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; entertain people on cold nights with myths of nature, and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The Wildhammer dwarves lead much more spiritual lives than the Ironforge dwarves. They are dedicated to elemental earth and storm magic, drawing their power from the mountains. Magically, they are more powerful than their cousins; they have mastered the art of divine elemental magic and use this power to supplement their already mighty aerial fighting force."}

Characterized by their immobility and &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt;, the totems embody the shaman's mastery over the elements. Some totems possess destructive power while others aid and assist allies. Shamanistic cultures outside those of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; also possess the ability to use totems in battle.\nGameplay.\nTotems are unique to the shaman. Once a totem is put down it cannot be moved, but a new totem can be used to replace it. Although the shaman's totems are summoned and fixed near the caster, a shaman player can place a totem while moving. A totem's effect is only active within a certain radius of the totem (making it a hybrid version of &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect%23Point%20Blank%20Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Point Blank Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect%23Ground%20Targeted%20Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Ground Targeted Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt;). The totem can be planted underwater, and appears floating at the foot level of the character.\nTotems are considered spells, and summoning totems can be prevented by silencing effects. Totems are immune to AoEs and DoTs, and must be specifically attacked to be destroyed.\nTotems are always placed roughly 3 yards away from the position from where you cast it. The exact position of the totem is dependent on where you are when you cast it, and in which direction you are facing."}

He is directly involved in the quest &lt;a href=\"Surprise%20Attack%21\"&gt;Surprise Attack!&lt;/a&gt;, where he launches a final assault against &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt; to claim &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nAfter his invasion fails, he retreats north and hear the news that the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;First Emperor of the Mogu Empire&lt;/a&gt; has been resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He was most pleased and looked forward to standing by his side once again. In &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Down%20This%20Wall%21\"&gt;Tear Down This Wall!&lt;/a&gt;, he and &lt;a href=\"War-God%20Al%27chukla\"&gt;War-God Al'chukla&lt;/a&gt; are ordered to protect the palace gates from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, along with &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Scout Captain Elsia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;. As he blamed the Zandalari to hold the wall from us, he retreated back to his Emperor.\nLater during &lt;a href=\"A%20Bold%20Idea\"&gt;A Bold Idea&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Decisive%20Action\"&gt;Decisive Action&lt;/a&gt;, he is asked to stop the adventurers from obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Stormsea%20Landing\"&gt;Stormsea Landing&lt;/a&gt; ship. He summoned &lt;a href=\"Hu%27seng%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Hu'seng the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that they won't pass into the palace. Thus, that was broken as well.\nAt last, everyone including the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, with his followers &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;, decide to take the fight to Shan Bu himself inside the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King's&lt;/a&gt; citadel. After they arrive, a battle between Shan Bu and the attackers commences. After fighting through his mogu and Zandalari minions, Taran Zhu taunts him by saying that he's trying to create a God. Shan Bu responds \"Who needs a god? We have the Thunder King!\" He finishes the ritual to bring &lt;a href=\"Nalak%2C%20the%20Storm%20Lord\"&gt;Nalak, the Storm Lord&lt;/a&gt; back into the world. In an attempt to distract Shan Bu, Taran Zhu enrages him by telling him \"Come and face me Shan Bu. Or is the court of the Thunder King a den of cowards.\" Enraged, Shan Bu leaps towards Taran Zhu and engages him. After a while, Shan Bu grabs Taran Zhu by the neck and attempts to choke him to death. Before he can kill Taran Zhu, the adventurer finishes him off and he falls to the ground. His last words are that he has failed Lei Shen, and thus is his &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Shan%20Bu\"&gt;downfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing his death, his soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.

Shandris first came to prominence during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where her entire family was slain by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, after which she was adopted by High Priestess Tyrande and took up arms herself.\nAfter the end of the war, Shandris continued to stand with unwavering devotion by Tyrande's side, becoming a fierce defender of the high priestess. Shandris came to lead a cadre of Sentinels known as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowleaves\"&gt;Shadowleaves&lt;/a&gt;, and helped lead her people during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris proved herself to be a skilled &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt; over the years, eventually being promoted to general of the Sentinels.\nAs head of the military, Shandris has since been involved in many conflicts across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, leading the night elves to victory on numerous occasions. She notably commanded the bulk of Sentinel forces from &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; before and during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and later co-led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;war campaign&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAs an adolescent Shandris lived in the village of &lt;a href=\"Ara-Hinam\"&gt;Ara-Hinam&lt;/a&gt;, where her father trained her to become an excellent archer. Her closest childhood friend was a boy named &lt;a href=\"Janius\"&gt;Janius&lt;/a&gt;. When the invading forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; arrived and destroyed the settlement, she and Janius had been playing together. He was apparently supposed to watch her, but the two got separated. Shandris was also separated from her family and fled south with the other survivors, chased by the ravening demons. Fortunately for the refugees, the pursuing Legion was intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; and his combined night elf forces, who slaughtered the demonic army.\nThe survivors of Ara-Hinam joined with the defenders. Shortly thereafter, at the defender's camp, a lonely and bitter Shandris was found by Tyrande Whisperwind, priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande became fond of the young girl, and couldn't bear to simply let her remain among the survivors alone, and so she accompanied the priestess. Shandris soon started to idolize Tyrande and followed her everywhere she went, learning the arts of divine magic and healing from the goddess-touched Tyrande. Shandris wanted more than anything to take part in the battles, but Tyrande forbid it, so she secretly followed the Sisters into battle, looking on from the shadows. Shandris' secret tours were discovered by Tyrande, and the priestess told Shandris to never again put herself in such danger. Shandris reluctantly agreed. However, just before one of the most important battles in the war, Shandris grabbed her bow and ran after Tyrande after watching her ride away.\nThe dragon Aspects joined the fray for the first time in the battle that followed and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; revealed his betrayal. Chaos broke out as Deathwing slaughtered both defenders, demons, and the entire &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in his madness, until he was forced to retreat by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. When the dragons departed, the scattered defenders were put under heavy pressure as the demons renewed their charge. In the chaotic battles near the forest's edge, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; found his beloved Tyrande at the mercy of one he had thought dead, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Xavius mocked Malfurion for some time, and just as he was about to strike the death blow to the young druid, his body was rocked by a feathered arrow plunging into his shoulder. Shandris, hidden in the forest, had proved her unnatural talent with the bow. Xavius' satyrs struggled to open up a portal to Zin'Azshari when the fighting night elves and demons reached their location. Several satyrs fell, impaled by Shandris' arrows, and Malfurion was able to confront Xavius unhindered. Focusing on the wood of Shandris' arrow impaled into Xavius' shoulder, Malfurion caused it to grow into a massive oak tree, consuming Xavius's flesh in the process. Still, the night elf druid failed to rescue his beloved Tyrande from the escaping demons. Shandris was rescued by Korialstrasz from the massive downpour created by Malfurion's resulting grief, and hounded him to rescue the priestess.\nShandris, with nothing stopping her from taking part in battles, clad in armor a bit too large for her, joined with the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. And so, as all sisters, she followed the command of &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, though the sisters themselves were now led by Jarod's arrogant sister, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the last, and most epic battle, when the night elves, and the combined forces of the denizens of Kalimdor, met the vast army of Archimonde the Defiler, Shandris was in the middle of the fray. Along with the sisters, she dropped dozens of demons with lethally aimed arrows.\nDuring the Sundering, Shandris fled with the other night elves to the slopes of Mt Hyjal. As the chaos subsided, Shandris stood next to Jarod, ever close to Tyrande.\nIt is hinted that Shandris wanted to start a romantic relationship with Jarod, but as it would be later revealed, Jarod avoided this due to personal happenings in his own life.\nFollowing the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, she was named captain.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nShandris participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; leading the army of Sentinels. She led a group of Sentinels along with the druids &lt;a href=\"Ralaar\"&gt;Ralaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt; against the satyr &lt;a href=\"Xalan%20the%20Feared\"&gt;Xalan the Feared&lt;/a&gt;. Though they killed Xalan, the rest of satyrs almost overwhelmed them. Shandris and her sentinels divided from the druids leaving them to satyrs. They survived using the pack form and eventually attacked Shandris and her sentinels. While Shandris was just wounded, &lt;a href=\"Aldorei\"&gt;Aldorei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elanu\"&gt;Elanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morina\"&gt;Morina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrnas\"&gt;Tyrnas&lt;/a&gt; died. Shandris quickly recovered and together with Tyrande, Malfurion and an army of elves attacked a satyr encampment. She witnessed the first &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed the encampment but also attacked the elves. The army had to flee. She eventually battled against the Alpha Prime and his feral worgen where Malfurion trapped them into &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; delivered by priestess &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Long Vigil.\nShandris remained at the right hand of Tyrande during the long vigil, and came to lead an elite group of sentinels called the &lt;a href=\"Shadowleaves\"&gt;Shadowleaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nShandris once fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; two or three thousand years ago.\nThe Third War.\nHaving the rank &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris was stirred from her long vigil by the Orcish Horde. When they began to assault the forest, Shandris and her &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; attacked. During these battles, a vast army of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s infused with the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; managed to kill the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; after a long and arduous combat. Horrified, Shandris and the Shadowleaves retreated deeper into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to warn the high priestess, Tyrande. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; quickly surmised that the invaders must leave. Shandris loyally obeyed, and together, they sensed a looming darkness. Shandris believed it to be the demonic orcs who killed Cenarius, but Tyrande was still unsure. Shandris remained deeper in the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; while Tyrande took care of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and orc problem. But her encampment came under heavy attack by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and they barely beat them back. When Tyrande arrived with the survivors of the demonic attack, she knew that the time had come to awaken the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s once more. Shandris stayed behind to defend Hyjal and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, while Tyrande went out to awaken the druids. Shandris bravely fought back the demons and undead, until she saw a massive demonic force amassing at the base of the mountain. Just then, Tyrande and Furion arrived with human and orcish allies at their back. Together, they formed a plan to dupe &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into destroying himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; defended the human base, while &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; took charge of the orcish encampment. Shandris was next to Tyrande, constantly on the front lines. First while defending Jaina's encampment, then while defending Thrall's, Shandris' arrows were the death of many demons. At last, when both Jaina's and Thrall's fortifications were broken, Shandris and Tyrande, along with the rest of the night elves, retreated to the peak of the mountain. Shandris fought fiercely in the very last battle, when all night elves, ancients, furbolgs, and even dark trolls stood combined against the might of the thousands of ravening demons that came against them. When Archimonde himself came, Malfurion quickly cast a spell that teleported all night elves and ancients to the safety of the shadowy forest. Archimonde, overconfident from his supposed victory, stepped up to Nordrassil and prepared to consume its energy. Just then, Malfurion activated his trap. Thousands of the night elves' ancestral guardians swarmed up from the forest and destroyed Archimonde.\nShandris, a great hero of battles, and now the Third War as well, helped Tyrande in retaking the night elves' grounds and rebuilding their settlements. She remained in Kalimdor as Tyrande and Malfurion chased &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, through the &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt;, and into the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nShandris and Jaina came to regard each other as friends, with Shandris freely calling Jaina \"battle sister\".\nWorld of Warcraft.\nShandris was promoted to the general of the Sentinels, and resided in the &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; located on &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, which was named after her. When &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s met Shandris, she tasked adventurers to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest\"&gt;Hatecrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;'s increased presence in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Solarsal\"&gt;Ruins of Solarsal&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers return to Shandris to report the discovery of a strange gazebo in the heart of Solarsal. While Shandris sends adventurers to her second, &lt;a href=\"Latronicus%20Moonspear\"&gt;Latronicus Moonspear&lt;/a&gt;, to deal with the Hatecrest threat, she remained behind to assess the adventurer's findings. Eventually, the adventurer discovered evidence of a resurgent &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; threat in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Zukk%27ash\"&gt;Zukk'ash&lt;/a&gt; hive in Feralas. General Shandris thanked the adventurer for their heroics on behalf of the stronghold and tasked them to deliver their findings to an associate of the Protectorate, &lt;a href=\"Gracina%20Spiritmight\"&gt;Gracina Spiritmight&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\n&lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; wanted Shandris to accompany him on his quest inside the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, but apparently &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; had left Shandris in charge of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; for a brief time, so that Tyrande herself could help Broll seek out &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; in the Emerald Dream. Shandris gave Tyrande her hippogryph &lt;a href=\"Jai%27alator\"&gt;Jai'alator&lt;/a&gt; for their journey. It was also revealed that Shandris has a network of spies at her disposal, keeping her (and by extension, Tyrande) informed of events all over Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; sought to find her, though they all were silenced by the shadowy warriors and traitorous &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, they were rescued by Malfurion and Shandris was left in Darnassus organizing its inhabitants while Malfurion and his druids were healing &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and battling in the Emerald Dream.\nAfter the crisis brought on by the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; was defused, Shandris acted as Tyrande's witness (the equivalent to a bridesmaid) to the long-awaited wedding of Malfurion and Tyrande. Malfurion noted to himself that Shandris was as adept at organizing wedding guests as she was at combat. It was later revealed that she managed to procure an \"&lt;a href=\"alor%27el\"&gt;alor'el&lt;/a&gt;\" plant for her wedding present.\nSeeds of Faith.\nShandris led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; attack sometime after the &lt;a href=\"shattering\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt;. Although the night elves fought bravely, the stronghold's fortifications eventually crumbled to the combined might of an invading naga army and the natural disasters plaguing &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris ordered the survivors to retreat to the mainland while she alone stayed behind to buy the survivors more time to escape. The naga offered to spare her life in exchange for the head of her mistress, Tyrande Whisperwind. Shandris responded by killing the naga negotiator and fighting to the bitter end. By the time Tyrande and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; reached her, she was already critically wounded. Tyrande's desperate prayer to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; granted her the strength to heal Shandris and save her from the brink of death.\nShandris was brought back to Darnassus to recover in Malfurion and Tyrande's home. To her great joy, she discovered that the \"alor'el\" was on the verge of blooming.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the destruction of the former Feathermoon Stronghold, caused by massive flooding during the Shattering in Feralas, Shandris had a &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; built on the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Coast\"&gt;Forgotten Coast&lt;/a&gt;. There it was revealed that Shandris has been training &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s. General Shandris has been planning the Sentinel offensives on multiple fronts. Shandris directed &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to her lieutenants that led her operations. The first lieutenant she directed the adventurer to was &lt;a href=\"Tambre\"&gt;Tambre&lt;/a&gt;, who led the counter strike offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest\"&gt;Hatecrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the naga responsible for the attack on their former stronghold on &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The second lieutenant she directed the adventurer to was &lt;a href=\"Silvia\"&gt;Silvia&lt;/a&gt;, who has been leading the offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; allies. Shandris' last lieutenant that the adventurer was directed to was &lt;a href=\"Adella\"&gt;Adella&lt;/a&gt;, and her orders from Shandris were to finish clearing Feralas of the remaining Gordunni ogre forces, &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, and other hostile wildlife.\nWolfheart.\nShandris was helping Tyrande organize the Alliance summit but was surprised to hear that &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; had returned to civilization and had come to Darnassus after a long self imposed exile. She sought him out and had an emotional reunion with him. She revealed that she once had feelings for him, and envied &lt;a href=\"Shalasyr\"&gt;Shalasyr&lt;/a&gt; and the time she spent with him. Jarod apologized to Shandris for his sudden and unexplained disappearance, and explained that while he was flattered by her affections, their choices prevented a romantic relationship; Shandris had been training to take on a more active role in night elf society, while Jarod wanted to live out his life in seclusion. Both Shandris and Jarod resolved to have a platonic relationship, after which Shandris gave her condolences.\nLater on a messenger from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; was found and brought to Darnassus, where she relayed to Tyrande that the Horde was making their move to invade &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Both Shandris and Tyrande rallied an army and departed to drive the Horde out. Unfortunately, a series of murders had occurred in Darnassus and Shandris did not have enough time to investigate them as she had to depart to Ashenvale. Together with Tyrande, they did a battle against the Horde. During the battle, Shandris was injured. Tyrande prayed to Elune to heal her, allowing her to continue fighting. As the &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s secret weapon, took the field, the battle went badly for the night elves. The sudden arrival of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and the Gilnean &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; however, turned the tide of battle and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was able to emerge victorious.\nAfter the battle, Shandris organized a new defense of Ashenvale and returned to Darnassus with Tyrande. The murders there were resolved by Jarod and Malfurion Stormrage; it turned out that the murderer of the newly accepted &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris was ordered to aid Jarod with forming his new security force, in order to help him choose some possible candidates from the Sentinels. Malfurion quickly realized that Tyrande did this in the hope that Jarod will grow closer to Shandris in the future.\nTides of War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; called for aid to defend &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; against an overwhelming attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris arrived with a force of Sentinels, much to the dismay of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who pleaded with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; to call off the attack on Theramore. Shandris and her Sentinels fought bravely, ultimately driving the Horde back out of the city. However, after the battle, she was informed that the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde traitor within the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, had been rescued during the attack. After coordinating with &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris led her sentinels north into &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to look for him, and so was not present when &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Theramore with a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris was present at the beginning of the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDisguised as an anonymous &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Ranger\"&gt;Cowled Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, she went to in order to look for &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nShandris Feathermoon represents the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, the union of all &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Shandris can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, she is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nShandris engaged in combat with the &lt;a href=\"Hatecoil\"&gt;Hatecoil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. She was assisted by the champions of the Unseen Path.\nAs a member of the Unseen Path, Shandris participated in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nShandris led the night elven fleet that was sent to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to deter a potential &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; campaign. However, while the fleet was en route to their destination, the night elven druid &lt;a href=\"Teshara\"&gt;Teshara&lt;/a&gt; sent word of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s orders to recall the fleet back to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris realized their deployment to Silithus was just a ploy to leave Ashenvale and Darnassus vulnerable and grimly acknowledged the genius of the strategy. The night elf fleet returned just in time to fend off the Horde's incursion in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. With Malfurion creating a &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall defense and the night elf fleet using its artillery to keep the Horde at bay, it seemed as if the night elves could hold the Horde off until &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s reinforcements arrived. However, the Horde dissipated the wisp wall by dividing its attention on multiple fronts and then began besieging the night elf fleet with their arcane enhanced &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. To make matters worse, Horde infiltrators swam through the sea and commandeered some of the night elf ships. Shandris fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt; as the ships were attacked when the tide of battle turned. When the Horde began to besiege &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, all hope to safeguard the night elven capital was lost and the remnants of the night elf fleet steered their ships away in retreat.\nShandris co-leads the Alliance's war effort on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of that campaign, she knew that the battle against the Horde was far from over, and joined the adventurer to work together to stop Sylvanas.\nThe night elf forces stationed across Kalimdor were recalled to begin a campaign against &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and were tracked by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions. Shandris Feathermoon was encountered in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; spoke to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to try and convince him to assault &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. As the three night elves spoke to Anduin, Tyrande went on ahead of the army to try and retake Darkshore herself. Maiev, Shandris, Sira, and an adventurer located Tyrande's ruined ship at the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt;, which contained a book about the ancient ritual of the Night Warrior. The Night Warrior was the incarnation of Elune's wrath. The ritual to become the avatar of the Night Warrior was extremely dangerous, and even witnessing it would put you in danger. Legend said that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to secure Kalimdor. None who have attempted the ritual since then have survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart.\nUpon journeying to Darkshore, Maiev tasked Sira with scouting the coast while she, Shandris, and the adventurer searched the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Eye of Elune&lt;/a&gt; that Tyrande would need for the ritual. Though the Eye had already been taken, they were cornered by &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev successfully slew his forces and drove him off. After leaving Auberdine and saving Tyrande's mount &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt; from the Horde, they met with the High Priestess at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; where she underwent and survived the ritual to become the Night Warrior. Tyrande told Shandris and Maiev to prepare for war while she left to confront &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. The confrontation ended with Nathanos raising both &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and Sira who had just died minutes before, but Tyrande slaying one of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nShandris later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter catching wind of the remains of the Horde fleet moving out to the sea, the Alliance assembled their fleets to finish the Horde's naval power, with Shandris among their forces. Unbeknownst to the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was using the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both fleets were attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas were opened. Though surprised by their arrival in Nazjatar, Shandris joined the rest of the Alliance in rallying under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nShandris enlisted Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; in rescuing &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Captive%20%28Nazjatar%29\"&gt;survivors&lt;/a&gt; from the fleet, destroying &lt;a href=\"Ley%20Line%20Accumulator\"&gt;latent power&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; were tapping into too, and killing &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Ethendriss\"&gt;Tidemistress Ethendriss&lt;/a&gt;, who was performing a damnable ritual and calling for the sacrifice of the Alliance soldiers. With these tasks completed, Shandris and the champions moved to regroup with Jaina and Genn. After they met and aided &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Okani\"&gt;Blademaster Okani&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance was allowed to regroup and reinforce their base of &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Shandris led the rest of the Alliance survivors to the town.\nWhen Jaina returned from a rescue mission to save &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from execution by the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris declared that she was fortunate that her unexpected allies &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; didn't kill in order to regain Sylvanas's favor. However, Jaina countered that they had a common enemy, one that wanted them at each other's throats, and mused that Azshara perhaps wanted the same. Though declaring that their must be vengeance for Teldrassil, Shandris agreed to focus their efforts on Azshara over the Horde and give time for Saurfang's rebellion to take root.\nIn time, Shandris discovered a promising lead for a weapon to use against Azshara. She recruited Alliance champions and then headed off towards the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Market\"&gt;Drowned Market&lt;/a&gt;. During the search, she reflected on how Azshara sacrificed her people twice over, once to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and again to &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. However, she was confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara, who informed her that as a general she must be familiar with sacrifice. She further spoke of a leader must serve the greater good. Outraged Shandris demanded what \"good\" there was in trading lives for power, twisting them into aberrations. In response, she was informed that Shandris did not yet understand, but in time she would.\nAfter the pair survived Azshara's gauntlet, Shandris remarked that they stood a place of great power. She then questioned the spirits to obtain information in their quest, which enabled them to discover that the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were nearby. In gratitude for this information, Shandris attempted to help the spirits find peace and move on, by making them face the fact that their beloved queen betrayed them. However, she was informed by &lt;a href=\"Riathia%20Silverstar\"&gt;Riathia Silverstar&lt;/a&gt;, that admitting that Azshara's pride and vanity destroyed them, would cause them to lose everything. She also called for the naga to be purged from the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Elun%27alor%20Temple\"&gt;Elun'alor Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in order to show them &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s vengeance, as she accused Azshara and her minions of having defiled for too long the ruined temple with their &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;heresy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter confronting and killing &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Silazsi\"&gt;Lady Silazsi&lt;/a&gt; and obtaining the Javelins of Suramar, Shandris declared it a turning point and the path to victory. She subsequently returned to Jaina to report their success. After the Javelins of Suramar was used to open the way into the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris joined the Alliance forces led by Jaina, and the Horde forces under the command &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, in invading the palace. Though Azshara was beaten, she was able to shatter the final seals on &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s prison.\nFollowing the events within the Eternal Palace, Shandris joined the rest of the Alliance forces and Saurfang's revolutionaries in the conflict against Sylvanas. After the revolutionaries and Alliance secured the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Varok Saurfang and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sought to attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; from all three entrances at once. Thus, Shandris and Lor'themar were ordered to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. However, instead of calling for the attack on Orgrimmar, Saurfang unwilling to spill more Horde blood challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. During the duel, Saurfang was able to get Sylvanas to admit that she considered the Horde nothing, which caused the Warchief to swiftly kill him and abandoned the Horde altogether. With Sylvanas's defection, the Horde united once more with Sylvanas's former loyalists defecting to Saurfang's revolution. With Saurfang dead and Sylvanas no longer in command of the Horde, the Alliance forces (Shandris among them) departed from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris reunited with Tyrande at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt;. They, along with the rest of the Alliance leaders, were informed that an armistice was signed between the Horde and Alliance, ending the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande interrupted Anduin's speech, saying the call for vengeance was still strong, that the Horde had yet to answer for their crimes and that they were untrustworthy, asking Anduin how he would handle it if Stormwind fell. She concluded by calling Anduin's faith in the Horde naive and left, with Shandris directly behind her. Despite this, she questioned Tyrande over if had been too hard on King Anduin as she felt that their people could ill afford to shun the Alliance, due to them providing aid and comfort in these dark times. Tyrande was quick to retort, that Anduin was foolish in regards to their enemies and hard words should be the least of his fears. In contrast with Tyrande's bleakness of peace with the Horde, Shandris sought to be more hopeful and stated that the new &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde leadership&lt;/a&gt; seemed more inclined toward peace than war. However, Tyrande was unmoved and cynically noted a rabid wolf would bare its fangs, regardless of who rode it.\nWith the Fourth War over, Shandris declared that it was time for the Kaldorei heal and rebuild, and that they still look to the future without forgetting the past.\nShandris then tried unsuccessfully to plead for Tyrande to abandon her desire for further bloodshed, and she was stunned to hear Tyrande speak of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; abandoning her children. Tyrande then declared that that would Stormwind for the boughs of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and dispatch the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; to every corner of Azeroth in order to find Sylvanas.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, Tyrande, and the night elven people made their new home in &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion and Tyrande had taken to ignoring any and all missives sent to them by the young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In light of both the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; sensing something horrible within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion and Tyrande agreed for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to meet with them under the condition that the Earthen Ring &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; was to be present and for Thrall to bring what was owed.\nAfter Thrall and his companions (&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;) arrived, Malfurion, Tyrande, Shandris Feathermoon, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; greeted them with frosty, rigid silence. Thrall formally apologized to night elves and explained how the Horde sought to change. While Shandris was willing to listen, she revealed that she would not exonerate the Horde entirely, and only work with them as a matter of strategy against Sylvanas. When Tyrande stated she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Shandris witnessed Thrall promising to give Tyrande the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime later, the night elven leadership received another missive from Anduin revealing that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had sent them a gift, a start to what was owed. In response, Tyrande, Shandris, and Maiev journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; where they encountered the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris called on for Tyrande to have mercy on Sira. After Tyrande cut a shallow cut into Sira's neck, Shandris took her blade, and Maiev encouraged her to have mercy towards Sira, who Maiev saw as a sad defeated thing. Tyrande subsequently departed while Maiev and Shandris had more things to ask.\nShadowlands.\nShandris was present in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Tyrande's speech about Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. She later attended an Alliance meeting discussing the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, where she vowed to make Sylvanas pay for everything she's done.\nAfter Tyrande went missing in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris had dreams of her mother being trapped in a place of eternal torment and traveled to the Shadowlands to find her alongside an adventurer in the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. They located Tyrande but she refused to leave the Maw while the souls of their people still suffered in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris and the Maw Walker followed Tyrande through the halls of the tower, but were always one step behind her as Tyrande's vengeance would not allow her to stop. Shandris expressed concern that the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; would consume her. When they finally caught up to Tyrande they confronted a &lt;a href=\"Tortured%20Amalgamation\"&gt;Tortured Amalgamation&lt;/a&gt; comprised of countless night elf souls. After putting the souls out of their misery for oblivion would be a kinder fate, Tyrande swore to avenge them.\nDespite Shandris's pleas, Tyrande refused to stop her hunt until Sylvanas was dead and chose to remain in the Maw. But upon learning that the Maw Walker could save the souls damned in the Maw, she tasked them to save her imprisoned people while she continued to hunt for Sylvanas. With the souls saved, Shandris felt hope for the first time in a long while. Even so, she knew that Tyrande would not stop until either Sylvanas was dead or the Night Warrior consumed her. She vowed not to give up on her mother. Taking the night elf souls to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris reunited with &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; who had found her afterlife in that realm. Ysera said she would investigate a promising whisper she had heard regarding someone who could aid Tyrande.\nAfter Ysera discovered that &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, was once a Night Warrior in life, she sent Shandris and the Maw Walker to seek him out. When Shandris requested his aid in saving Tyrande, Thiernax cynically noted that her fate was sealed, and that Shandris must let her go, for both of their sakes. As the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; was focused on more pressing concerns, Shandris joined Thiernax's husband, &lt;a href=\"Qadarin\"&gt;Qadarin&lt;/a&gt;, in dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s within the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20Night\"&gt;Garden of Night&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, she learned how Thiernax had invoked the dark powers of Elune in order to save their world, how it subsequently destroy him afterwards, and how attempting to share Elune's power between costed Thiernax and Qadarin's their lives.\nAfter arriving within the inner garden, the group reunited with Thiernax, and came under attack by Spriggans led by &lt;a href=\"Sickleshanks\"&gt;Sickleshanks&lt;/a&gt;, who with his dying breath cursed Qadarin. Shandris promised to help Qadarin save the curse, a task which was successful. She then warmly welcomed Thiernax and Qadarin's aid in averting the Night Warrior's fate upon Tyrande. Eventually they theorized that they could save Tyrande by dispersing the power amongst former Night Warriors themselves. After the Maw Walker successfully recruited &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; for the task, Shandris warmly greeted her old friend, who promised to not rest until he had found the former Night Warriors.\nAs the group awaited word from Huln, they learned that Bwonsamdi had arrived requesting the Maw Walker's aid. Shandris personally believed that this would prove to be interesting. Her words proved rather true, as it started a group of events, that ended with the rescue of &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; from the Maw, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; becoming imbued with the essence of the dying &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, and all of them coming under the care of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; being driven out of Ardenweald, Shandris joined the Winter Queen's court in celebrating their victory. She remarked that while this threat was beaten, there was still work to be done in Ardenweald.\nChains of Domination.\nShandris aided the convents in &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;defending&lt;/a&gt; Ardenweald from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. As the fight between the &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and Banshee Queen neared its end, Shadnris witnessed &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; stepping in to aid and comfort Tyrande after Sylvanas and the Mawsworn left the battlefield. Though overjoyed that Tyrande had found her own way out of Maw, she was worried over her condition and hoped that Ysera would be able to keep Tyrande stabilized long enough for them to save her.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and the Maw Walker successfully recruited additional &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;night warriors&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris aided in the ritual at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse Tyrande of her Night Warrior's powers. However, as the ritual progressed Tyrande called upon more of Elune's power and grew hostile to the point of attacking Shandris. As the ritual neared its ends Shandris, witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; converse as well as the creation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;the Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;. She then returned to the Heart of the Forest and bore witness to the Winter Queen using the newly created tear to remake her &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; and restore the Heart of the Forest.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris and Tyrande could be found conversing outside of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. After Shandris mentioned her joy at seeing Tyrande whole again, Tyrande admitted her rage and anger prevented her from recognizing that grief and deep sense of betrayal that hide within her heart. Shandris admitted that when Teldrassil burned, she couldn't understand why Elune didn't intervene, how could she seemingly allow for so many to be lost. However after learning of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and the duty and purpose that should have awaited the souls of their people, if not for the Maw, Shandris felt she could, and in response Tyrande declared that while they can never truly know the ways of the gods, but that she felt that Elune made the decision to aid her sister and not to cause them sorrow. This prompted Shandris to remark about how the Winter Queen had faced hard choices as well and how Elune and the Winter Queen were bound together in an eternal cycle, one of death and rebirth. Agreeing with her, Tyrande told Shandris that it was a cycle that the kaldorei must now rejoin, no more looking to the past, but embracing the future.\nEternity's End.\nShandris joined &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and the covenant forces in entering &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, where soon after she and the Maw Walker entered the &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Strata\"&gt;Provis Strata&lt;/a&gt;, on the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;, in order to help discover what Zovaal was up too. The pair subsequently learned that the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to gain control of the Forge of Afterlives and sought a way into the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris subsequently left to deliver the information to Bolvar, and came to reside within &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the defeat of the Jailer, Shandris, and Maiev accompanied Tyrande to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to attend the trial of a remorseful Sylvanas Windrunner. Sylvanas willingly submitted to Tyrande's judgment, and the high priestess had Shandris and Maiev escort her to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande sentenced Sylvanas to begin her penance by scouring the Maw and freeing all of the souls trapped therein. Shandris noted that many night elves still wouldn't be satisfied by anything less than Sylvanas' execution, but Shandris believed that killing Sylvanas would've been mercy and that her penance might prove more valuable than her death if she was able to save souls from the Maw.\nSometime later, Shandris witnessed Tyrande's meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where Tyrande received the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt;, which had become a vessel of renewal, and that the night elven souls who had been saved from the Maw rejected the eternal tranquility in the boughs of Ardenweald by becoming a new beginning for their kin, with the seed thus embodying the cycle of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath, Tyrande, Shandris, and Ysera spoke about the seed, to which Ysera revealed that it had been touched by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;the Dream&lt;/a&gt; as well, making it a symbol of the crucial balance between life and death. She thus revealed that the seed should be brought to her daughter, as &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; should know where it should be taken. When Shandris questioned if Ysera would return to Azeroth with them, Ysera revealed that as she is bound to Ardenweald, she would not be able to leave without a great sacrifice, rejected Tyrande's offer for aid as she felt that the kaldorei needed them, and stated if &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; willed then she would soar Azeroth's skies again.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;War against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris and her scouts served as the eyes and ears of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; had designs on claiming the power of &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt; and was set to meet with &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt;. She and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; then made their way to Lunedane, where they discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; had allied with the Fyrakk as they fought their way to the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;. The pair collected &lt;a href=\"Smoldering%20Blossom\"&gt;Smoldering Blossom&lt;/a&gt;s for the Aspects to study and subsequently witnessed a secret between Fyrakk and Vyranoth, in which they learned that the Druids of the Flame had allied with Fyrakk under the promise of achieving immortality and of a potential schism between the incarnates. After &lt;a href=\"Larodar\"&gt;Larodar&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption by the druids and Fyrakk's &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, the Incarnates departed, prompting Shandris to instruct her allies to dispatch the keeper, while she held off reinforcements. However, the keeper hearing the call to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; escaped, causing her to remark what they discovered was beyond what they could have prepared themselves for. Declaring that they needed to mobilize the troops to stop the Druids of the Flame on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris sent adventurers to report to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; in order to have the &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; dispatched, while she went to &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; to handle things.\nQuests.\nAlliance War Campaign\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe forces of the Sentinel Army hold back the Horde across all of Kalimdor.

Shannox is no exception. Serving as the chief hunter and &lt;a href=\"kennel\"&gt;kennel&lt;/a&gt; master of Ragnaros's hell hounds, Shannox patrols the elemental realm with his two most ferocious beasts: &lt;a href=\"Riplimb\"&gt;Riplimb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rageface\"&gt;Rageface&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAbilities.\nShannox is untauntable and uses a standard threat table. He has a 10 minute enrage in all difficulties, but this is likely to happen only on heroic mode (or raids doing &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20List\"&gt;Bucket List&lt;/a&gt;) since normal mode has Magma Rupture as a soft enrage, which will likely kill your raid before then.\n&lt;a href=\"Riplimb\"&gt;Riplimb&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiplimb is untauntable and uses a standard threat table. In Heroic Difficulty Riplimb cannot be permanently slain while his master lives. When his health reaches zero, he will collapse for 30 seconds, and then reanimate at full health to resume fighting.\n&lt;a href=\"Rageface\"&gt;Rageface&lt;/a&gt;.\nRageface cannot be controlled or tanked, and darts about from enemy to enemy, changing targets periodically.\nStrategy.\nThere are three things to worry about during this fight. Traps, Tank debuff stacks, and raid damage. We will briefly go over each mechanic and how to mitigate it.\nTraps.\nShannox throws traps around. Don't walk over traps. If a doggie is chasing you, walk the dog over the trap (avoid dragging the dog over a crystal prison trap if it is the current dps target, however). Crystalline traps have a dark red crystal in the center. Immolation traps have the familiar flame dancing in the center of the trap. The Riplimb tank must develop the ability to distinguish the two. If a dog is trapped in a crystalline prison trap, they will be out of line of sight and immune to all damage until the trap breaks (10 seconds after it's triggered, less if the prism is dpsed). If a player is trapped in a crystalline prison trap, they will be out of line of sight for heals and unable to act, but can still be attacked by Shannox or the dogs if they have aggro. Trapped players should be freed as soon as possible (and should ensure they don't get trapped in the future).\nWhen a dog runs over any trap it gains a buff which prevents it from being affected by other traps for 15 seconds from the time the trap was triggered. Riplimb often gains Wary once he completes a spear fetch (because there are tons of immolation traps lying around). Also, a few seconds after Shannox performs Hurl Spear, Riplimb will gain that prevents him from being immobilized or slowed below a certain percentage of his normal speed (this percentage starts at 65% rises the longer Riplimb is attempting to retrieve and return the spear). This small window is when Riplimb can be kited (preferably into a Crystal Trap) to increase Shannox' spear downtime.\nTank Debuffs.\nShannox and Riplimb can be tanked but not taunted. You'll want one tank on each of them and no tank on Rageface. Both Shannox and Riplimb place a stacking debuff on the tanks that must time off to be cleared. Riplimb will place the debuff when he attacks, Shannox will only place his debuff while he holds his spear. Keep Shannox and Riplimb a good 30-50 yards apart, but not more than 60 yard such that they gets separation anxiety. \nShannox will throw his spear to Riplimb. The spear will explode in fire. Riplimb will then pick up the spear and bring it back to Shannox. It is during this \"fetch it boy\" stage that both tanks can clear their debuffs. Riplimb can be slowed. Shannox can be kited for more time. Riplimb can be kited into a crystal trap but it must be done quickly. If the tank doesn't kite Riplimb into a trap before Riplimb begins his fetch cycle, he becomes immune to traps. It is not required to cleanse the buff every time he throws the spear, but it makes the fight much easier on the healers. Riplimb's tank should remember not to chase Riplimb as he heads back towards Shannox after retrieving the spear, as the time it takes Riplimb to get back to the tank is vital to ensuring his bleed falls off.\nGetting the Jagged Tear debuff to fall off requires a combination of\nIf one of these time-eaters is missing or too small, the other factors must be increased (tank Riplimb farther away, kite him away from the spear impact zone).\nRaid Damage.\nDuring this fight your raid will take damage from Rageface. Both placing Immolation traps on him (thus allowing easier stopping of face rage) and placing him in Crystalline traps (not recommended, since he's being DPS'd first, but can break Facerage) will reduce the sporadic raid damage. Shannox cleaves and traps can wipe you if you get hit by them.\nKill Order.\nHowever, it is possible to have success with various kill orders.\nAlternative Strategy.\nThere have been reports of tanks that can ride each others' aggro so well that they effectively tank swap both Shannox/Riplimb. While this strategy has proven successful for some, it greatly increases the amount of damage taken by the tanks (Dog doesn't have a long \"fetch it boy\" phase) and complicates an easy fight.\nAlternate Kill Order.\nIf your raid has issues with tank death once Rageface dies, often due to Immolation traps hitting the tank, it is possible to alter the order slightly. Burn Rageface to about 30%, then move your melee to Shannox and your ranged to Riplimb apart from a couple heavy-hitters, who stay on Rageface to break Face Rage. Arcane mages are a very good option here, with Marksman hunters being a decent backup. Once Riplimb and Rageface are both under 10% and Shannox is close to 30%, both dogs are killed off in quick succession and Shannox is then burned through the remainder of his health.\nThis allows all healers to move from other targets to the Shannox tank at the same time, simplifying the healing. However, this does increase the risk of deaths to Face Rage if the assigned dps are out of range or otherwise unable to act. Note that the exact percent health Rageface should be left at, as well as which dps go where, depends greatly on both your raid composition and the performance of all dps.\nSolo strategy.\nThere are two fatal mechanics in this fight for players trying to solo the encounter:\nPop cooldowns on the pull. Both mechanics can be countered by pet classes that can direct their pets to attack Rageface to break the channel and the Crystal Prison should players get trapped by it. Otherwise beating the encounter will require bursting down Shannox before Rageface casts Face Rage, or bursting down Rageface and surviving Shannox's +30% damage/attack speed frenzy. Try to keep Riplimb alive, but crowd-controlled if possible. There's no real difference between normal and heroic mode at this point.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nTrivia.\nShannox is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Grant%20George\"&gt;Grant George&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some of them were later captured by the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; and taken to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, where they were incarcerated in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; were already present within the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, having sent scouts through a cavern in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20Rise\"&gt;Ruins Rise&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Guo-Lai\"&gt;Ruins of Guo-Lai&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; sealed off the cave, the gates of the vale had already been opened. Following this, the Shao-Tien assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Stair\"&gt;Golden Stair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Approach\"&gt;Emperor's Approach&lt;/a&gt;. From the Golden Stair and encampents at &lt;a href=\"Winterbough%20Glade\"&gt;Winterbough Glade&lt;/a&gt; they would stage attacks and occasionally assault &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Guo-Lai\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Whitepetal%20Lake\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; the vale.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Sun\"&gt;Bleeding Sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis clan was also part of an ambush on the Golden Lotus that caught the fleeing &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; and his children, sending quilen into the fray first, and then attacking themselves. While the Shao-Tien and their unnamed leader were unsuccessful in defeating the Golden Lotus, one of Dezco's sons was poisoned (though later cured), and the other crushed in the chaos that ensued.\nThe Secrets of Guo-Lai.\nThe Shao-Tien and their warlord &lt;a href=\"Zhao-Jin%20the%20Bloodletter\"&gt;Zhao-Jin&lt;/a&gt; also attempted to recover mogu artifacts of power within the vale, successfully securing an army of &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Jade%20Warrior\"&gt;Jade Warriors&lt;/a&gt; but (temporarily) losing three of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;the Thunder King's&lt;/a&gt; artifacts to the Golden Lotus: the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Battle Axe of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Helm%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Battle Helm of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Spear%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Battle Spear of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually the Shao-Tien mustered a final assault on the vale using the previously recovered &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Jade%20Warrior\"&gt;Jade Army&lt;/a&gt;. The Golden Lotus won the battle with the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Leven%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Leven Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; defeated Zhao-Jin the Bloodletter at the stairs of &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Shao-Tien positioned at the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Stair\"&gt;Golden Stair&lt;/a&gt; were killed. The Shao-Tien commanders, including &lt;a href=\"General%20Temuja\"&gt;General Temuja&lt;/a&gt; and all five Imperions, appear to have survived. Many have relocated to various locations west of the Whitepetal Lake.\nElsewhere, deep below Orgrimmar in the Underhold, the Shao-Tien Elder Council and some of their followers have been taken by the True Horde under &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; orders.

It is also the only of these abilities that does not require a target to use.\nAs well being useful for catching fleeing opponents, it can also be used to escape combat, especially after using &lt;a href=\"Intimidating%20Shout\"&gt;Intimidating Shout&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hamstring\"&gt;Hamstring&lt;/a&gt;. When combined with such abilities, the 40-yard distance granted is enough to place you out of range of any opponent's attacks, certainly for long enough to leave combat and mount.\nWhen dealing with casters, Heroic Leap can be used to jump behind the opponent, causing their cast to fail.\nAlthough Heroic Leap does deal some damage, the stun effect of Charge usually makes them preferable as openers.\nIt is possible to use abilities during Heroic Leap. This is most useful for casting &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; mid-leap. When correctly timed, this will cause the stun effect and rage generation from Charge as well as the damage from Heroic Leap.\nMobs encountered during Heroic Leap's flight path will not be aggroed. Mobs within range of the warrior's landing spot will of course be aggroed as usual when the warrior lands.\nAs with many AoE abilities, the damage caused from Heroic Leap will be dealt to neutral mobs within range as well as hostile ones. When using Heroic Leap in crowded areas, this can potentially turn a 1-on-1 into something far more dangerous.\nAs with &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, Heroic Leap can be used while falling. Timed correctly this can prevent fall damage, allowing warriors to skydive, rapidly descend heights or even recover from a &lt;a href=\"Typhoon\"&gt;Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf hurt, the warrior can use this attack for a quick getaway."}

It is an instant melee attack dealing physical damage. Heroic Strike shares a 1.5 second cooldown with &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, but is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. Heroic Strike is a &lt;a href=\"Rage%23Rage%20management\"&gt;rage dump&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively inefficient attack designed to be used \"when you have more Rage than you can spend.\"\nTips and Tactics.\nHeroic Strike and Cleave.\nHeroic Strike shares a cooldown with &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, and they are very similar abilities. They are both instant attacks that are off the global cooldown, and they both cost the same amount of rage.\nHeroic Strike is always preferable in single-target situations; in multiple-target situations, Cleave may have the potential to deal damage more quickly and efficiently, but Heroic Strike may still be preferred in order to kill a single target more quickly, reducing damage taken. Cleave is limited by the fact that it can break crowd control, and also generates aggro on multiple targets, which may or may not be desired.\nUsage.\nThe main strength of Heroic Strike and Cleave is that they are not on the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. This allows them to be used at any time without interrupting the warrior's rotation, making them useful for disposing of excess rage, or for adding quick burst damage. When accumulating more rage than is being spent, they can and should be used to convert this rage into extra damage, essentially generating free bonus damage. However, Heroic Strike and Cleave both deal very little damage for their &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; cost, making them generally the least useful way of spending rage; other abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Slam\"&gt;Slam&lt;/a&gt; deal far more damage for the same rage. They are therefore best used only when you have so much rage that rage will be wasted if they are not used (however, certain abilities and glyphs can provide exceptions to this rule - see below). Heroic Strike can also be useful in PvP for instantly dealing extra damage to an opponent, helping to quickly overwhelm them. \nThe proper use of Heroic Strike is essential for both Fury and Arms warriors who are fulfilling the DPS role in PVE. One of the biggest mistakes new Warrior DPS make is using Heroic Strike too frequently, rather than waiting until the situation demands it. It is absolutely not recommended to macro Heroic Strike into another commonly used attack such as &lt;a href=\"Overpower\"&gt;Overpower&lt;/a&gt; while in group play.\nExceptions.\nHeroic Strike and Cleave are generally very inefficient abilities, only to be used when generating excessive amounts of rage. However, a number of abilities and glyphs provide exceptions to this rule:"}

{"id": "70129", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=70129", "title": "Heroic mode", "text": "Heroic mode (often abbreviated to Heroic or simply HC) refers to a &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20difficulty\"&gt;dungeon difficulty&lt;/a&gt; setting. This setting is accessed from the party or raid leader's portrait menu; currently the other other difficulty settings are &lt;a href=\"normal%20mode\"&gt;normal mode&lt;/a&gt; (the default setting) and &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;challenge mode&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on expansion and dungeon type (5-player or raid), the setting has different effects and requirements. For all heroic mode dungeons &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; have more HP, hit harder, and have additional or more potent skills. Heroic-mode bosses drop better quality equipment than their normal-mode counterparts as well as currency tokens used to purchase epic equipment from vendors.\nHeroic mode dungeons are on a lockout timer much like raids, and can only be run once a day per character. Each dungeon is on an independent timer, however, so a character could run as many as 15 heroic mode instances per day. Heroic timers are reset daily at 9:00 A.M. server time for US servers, and 08:00 A.M. server time for European servers. The daily &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;random heroic&lt;/a&gt; resets at the same time as other dailies, generally between 2-4 A.M. realm time.\nHeroic dungeons don't require an &lt;a href=\"attunement\"&gt;attunement&lt;/a&gt;, but do require all characters in the group to be max level for their respective expansions.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nEach of the 5-player dungeons introduced in the \"\" expansion pack may be run on heroic mode.\nSome heroic mode instances share loot with their normal-mode counterparts, while some do not. For example, items that drop in a max level normal instance like &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt; will also drop in the heroic mode. However, a lower-level instance like &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; will have completely different items in normal and heroic mode. For the instance where loot is shared there are also additional items that only drop in the heroic mode. These items are of higher quality than the other items. Each boss in a heroic dungeon may drop an epic gem. The last boss always drops one epic item in addition to &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2.0\"&gt;patch 4.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Burning Crusade\" heroic modes required every member of the party to have obtained the appropriate key. These keys were purchased from the faction &lt;a href=\"quartermaster\"&gt;quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; of the faction corresponding to the instance once reaching . At introduction the keys required , but this was reduced in later patches to allow easier access to the heroic modes. &lt;a href=\"Magister%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Magister's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, which was introduced later with &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, did not use a purchased key. To obtain this key, players needed to simply complete a quest which involved killing the final boss of the instance in normal mode.\nEach key required reputation with the respective faction. (Lowered from in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;.)\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWith the second expansion, heroic mode was extended to raids. The key requirements were not included on instances, instead heroic mode is available to all players at 80. The token system used in TBC heroics was considered successful, new tokens were added for the various \"tiers\" of wrath heroics and raids. For example, the same tokens drop in heroic 5-players and the first-tier 10-player raids, while a different token drops in the first tier 25-player raids and second-tier 10-player raids. A third token drops in second-tier 25-player raids, and will presumably drop in the third-tier 10-player raids when implemented.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, Heroic mode raids, unlike their instance counterparts, did not dictate difficulty. Instead 10-player raids were considered \"normal\" mode, and 25-player raids to be \"heroic\". Heroic raids are not intended to be \"harder\" than the 10-player version of the same raid, instead simply tuned for the larger number of players. Heroic raids do still drop higher quality equipment than the normal-mode counterparts, by the logic that it is more difficult to form a good 25-player group. The currency tokens dropped in each mode can be used to buy items of similar quality to the boss-dropped items.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; did away with this setting, other than showing up in &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, in favor of the following:\nIn , heroic mode dungeons have the following relative difficulty.\nHeroic Mode: Violet Hold, located within Dalaran, is commonly considered the easiest of all Northrend Heroic instances. This is because it can be completed in under 20 minutes on average by those with even minor Heroic instance skills. Its low difficulty and low Reputation of 1300 makes it commonly a very casual Heroic instance.\nCataclysm.\nBosses in heroic cataclysm instances award &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt;. By using the dungeon finder, players can gain an additional 150 &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; per day.\nDaily heroic.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt; introduced daily quests for heroic dungeons. These daily quests, referred to as \"daily heroics\", involved killing the final boss in a dungeon on heroic mode, and gave additional in or in and &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"reward\"&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers were able to earn extra &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; and gold for the first &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;random WotLK heroic dungeon&lt;/a&gt; they complete that day, but the daily heroic quests were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, however the daily heroic quests still exist.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1.0\"&gt;Patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt; removed the daily heroic dungeons, but players would get bonus rewards 7 times per week.\nThis was later changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; where only the first 5-man heroic would grant additional Valor Points but every subsequent random 5-man heroic would grant Valor Points as well."}

The gryphon is well trained and is the best mount he ever had. Hestra is akin to a dog rather than a part-leonine beast and will jump on top of his master wagging his tail before being told to get off. Falstad keeps a tiny whistle which enables him to summon the gryphon. \nHestra carried Falstad over the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Hasic\"&gt;Hasic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. They departed ways after Falstad and the elven ranger &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; were lured into a ground trap akin to a quicksand by the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kryll\"&gt;Kryll&lt;/a&gt;. Later he was able to call the beast to escape the fortress of Grim Batol with Vereesa and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. From the gryphon they witnessed the battles taking place between the orcs and the &lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt; on the ground, and Deathwing and the dragons in the air.\nSpeculation.\nHestra's status is unknown. He has not appeared at any point in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" despite Falstad's increased inclusions after the forming of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, in all appearances where Falstad is partnered with a gryphon, it is with &lt;a href=\"Swiftwing\"&gt;Swiftwing&lt;/a&gt;; including \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". When defeated in Ironforge, Falstad will attempt to say \"Bury me with me gryphon\", a remnant from when &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; (who shares Falstad's voice actor and whose gryphon, &lt;a href=\"Sky%27ree\"&gt;Sky'ree&lt;/a&gt;, passed away) was the Wildhammer council member. Assuming that the line was not simply kept by mistake, it is possible Hestra has died since his appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\"; explaining the retaining of such a quote as well as why Swiftwing has replaced him as Falstad's gryphon."}

This means 'Hexed' mobs can usually afford to take an accidental hit or stay crowd controlled during &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells. Hexed players can often take a fair amount of damage without breaking the effect, making the spell in some ways more useful than other similar effects. Also, Hexed targets do not have the greatly increased health regeneration granted to Polymorphed targets. \nAs a Polymorph effect, Hex can be &lt;a href=\"shapeshift\"&gt;shapeshift&lt;/a&gt;ed out of by Druids.\nWhile Hexed targets are unable to take any actions (aside from shapeshifting and the use of counters and trinkets) they remain in control of their character, and are able to move at normal movement speed in the direction of their choice.\nHex lasts for up to 1 minute when cast upon mobs.

Alternatively, stepping on a \"safe\" tile will reveal the count of adjacent mines.\nThe object is to \"clear\" the field by revealing all of the safe tiles and by marking all of the dangerous ones with the little white flags provided.\nIt's unclear why the game feels it necessary to murder players who step on the wrong tile."}

{"id": "132118", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=132118", "title": "Hex Lord Malacrass (BC Classic)", "text": "Hex Lord Malacrass is the fifth boss in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, the final obstacle before the raid can do battle with &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nA devious plan.\nInformation taken from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/dungeons/zulaman.xml\"&gt;worldofwarcraft.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Malacrass had studied the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; high priests and their ability to call upon the favor of the animal gods. He also knew that the elves had magically bound one of the mighty &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, using it to channel the power of the Light into their own ranks. Malacrass had devised a similar plan: to seal the power of the animal gods within the bodies of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;'s strongest warriors. &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; quickly approved the plan and lent his full support. Malacrass experimented tirelessly and succeeded in imbuing four warriors with the essence of mighty animal gods: the lynx, dragonhawk, bear, and eagle. Some adventurers fear that Malacrass may have bound a fifth, even darker essence within his own soul...\"\nThe Fight.\nHex-lord has 4 adds (described in more detail below). Each add is a different mob type and has differing abilities and will need to be CC'd, off-tanked, or killed. \nDuring the entire fight, the Hex Lord will melee damage his highest threat target for (amount?). He will also use an ability called Soul Drain which gives him several abilities from a single class for 30 seconds (described in more detail below). After his Soul Drain buff wears off he will lose his class abilities, stop melee dps, and cast Spirit Bolts on all members of the raid. As soon as he is done with the Spirit Bolts, he will immediately cast Soul Drain and gain a different classes' abilities (unless he drains the same class or player, which is not uncommon) for 30 seconds. Alternating between the Soul Drain phase and the Spirit Bolt phase is basically the entire fight. After the Hex Lord reaches 80%, his Soul Drain also gives him a stackable buff which increases his size and the damage of his melee, Soul Drain abilities, and Spirit Bolts. The longer you take to kill him, the harder he becomes.\nKey factors of the fight are:\nAbilities.\nAdds.\nHe starts with 4 random adds, much like &lt;a href=\"Moroes%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. There will always be a sap/sheepable, hibernatable, banishable, and shacklable mob but additional CC types may come in to play as well. Possible adds are:\nFar Left (Humanoid)\nLeft (Hibernatable)\nRight (Banishable)\nFar Right (Shacklable)\nSpirit Bolts.\nEvery 30 secs, Malacrass uses this ability, which deals 450 shadow damage to every member of the raid every 0.5 sec for 10 seconds. Can be resisted, but is not subject to line of sight. It increases in damage with each Soul Drain. Testing has shown that &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Magic%20%28removed%20mage%20ability%29\"&gt;Amplify Magic (removed mage ability)&lt;/a&gt; does not change the overall damage for a Spirit Bolt volley. Therefore, Amplify Magic can be placed on the raid and the damage taken from the Spirit Bolts will not increase, thereby providing a nice increase to raid healing. The downside is that certain stolen class abilities (like a mage's) appear to do extra damage to Amplified targets. (Additional testing is desired over anecdotal evidence.) A Paladin's Concentration Aura (especially improved with talent points) is invaluable for allowing the raid healers to avoid pushback from the bolts.\nSoul Drains.\nImmediately after Malacrass finishes casting Spirit Bolts, he uses Soul Drain. Soul Drain is a channeled debuff that is placed on a random member of the raid. The person drained will not suffer any direct penalties, but Malacrass will gain some abilities from the target's class, which are outlined below. He has these abilities for 30 secs until he starts casting Spirit Bolts again, after which he will Soul Drain another (or the same) class. This continues for the rest of the fight.\nStrategy.\nBefore starting the fight establish control methods and kill order for the adds present. Some raids may find it more useful to maintain crowd control on one or more adds through out the fight, while others will have enough DPS to kill all adds before beginning DPS on Malacrass. Note that Malacrass does not start stacking the Power Drain debuffs until his health reaches 80%. If the stacking debuffs are a problem, kill all four adds before attacking Malacrass. The raid will then not have to spend mana, casting time, and cooldowns keeping adds controlled.\nFocus on quickly killing the adds. Be careful not to start killing AoE-attack capable adds (like Slither) during Spirit Bolts.\nSpirit Bolts will be cast every 30 seconds and last 10 seconds. Spirit Bolts can not be avoided via line of sight. Rogues should focus on using Cloak of Shadows to mitigate some of this damage.\nFollowing Spirit Bolts, Malacrass will select a new target for Soul Drain randomly from the raid.\nPower Drain.\nAfter dropping Malacrass to 80% health he will begin to use Power Drain once every 30 seconds, increasing his size and damage by 10% and reducing all player's damage/healing by 1%. Once Malacrass begins Power Draining the DPS race begins because he will eventually become buffed enough to wipe your raid during Spirit Bolts."}

He is the husband of &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt;, the high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nRaal's appointment to the Zanchuli Council was no surprise to anyone. The charming hexlord of &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; had won the heart of his loa and of many of the people. Seen as the \"man of the people,\" Raal has taken it upon himself to represent many of the people within Zandalar's borders.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt; spied reported that dark heresies were being practiced the &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; sent Raal and his wife &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the situation. Following the arrival of the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Yazma directed the newly named &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid them as she felt the two were too soft on their own followers and that the Speaker would be more ruthlessly neutral. Loti accepted the aid of Speaker and instructed them to kill &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Cultist\"&gt;Crimson Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s for practicing &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; and then to tell instruct her husband to get off his perch to help keep the Zanchul secure. For his part, Raal was unimpressed with her calling him out and accurately predicting his wife's actions. Declaring such actions barely a half measure Raal explained that the blood magic came from the old ways and had the Speaker join him to patrol the border to &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, so the Speaker could see where the blood magic was coming from. As the patrol came to an end, Raal sensed a great power resonating within the Zanchul itself and subsequently sent the Speaker to group with Loti.\nUpon being informed of the situation, Loti accused her husband of trying to win the Speaker over and responded by blessing them with the power of &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, while instructing them to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodraged%20Pterrordax\"&gt;Bloodraged Pterrordax&lt;/a&gt;es, who were driven mad by some dark ritual, and to shoo away the &lt;a href=\"Pterrordax%20Hatchling\"&gt;Pterrordax Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;s, who were swarming courtyard of Zanchul. Feeling that Loti was more interesting in recruiting than dealing with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; treat, Raal then blessed the Speaker with the power of &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; and instructed them to &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Tombs\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Rites\"&gt;with the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;corrupted guardians&lt;/a&gt;. After discovering the source of the corruption was a ritual in which blood magic heretics were empowering the &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dregada\"&gt;Dregada&lt;/a&gt;, Loti, Raal, and the Speaker united to put the ritual to an end by killing Dregada. With the threat removed Loti declared that while she won't hold a grudge, she'll be damned before letting the Speaker double dip with the loa and called upon them to choose between Gonk and Pa'ku. Should the Speaker pick Pa'ku Raal would declare that he knew they would make the right choice and then &lt;a href=\"Ata%20the%20Winglord\"&gt;fly&lt;/a&gt; them out so that they could see Pa'ku face to face. On the way to Pa'ku, Raal warned the Speaker to mind their manners as Pa'ku had been known to drop followers she is not fond of from a really great height onto a really hard stone. After witnessing Pa'ku accept the Speaker, Raal declared it was time to show the public their choice and inform King Rastakhan.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; started his coup, he directed his forces to gain control of the Zanchul, and in the process Raal was captured. &lt;a href=\"Crazzak%20the%20Heretic\"&gt;Crazzak the Heretic&lt;/a&gt; then tortured Raal in an attempt to use Raal's connection with Pa'ku to weaken the loa. Though grateful to be freed, he was a bit disgruntled that Loti was present as he felt that she would never let him forget about this. Revealing that Yazma and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27kaal\"&gt;Vol'kaal&lt;/a&gt; had pulled most of their forces to the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt;, Raal, Loti, and the Speaker headed to there in order to rescue the loa. Hearing Pa'ku cry out in his mind caused, Raal to realize that something old and terrible was being done to her and subsequently successfully rescued the loa with the aid of the Speaker. Remarking that the Zanchuli Council was betrayed, Loti instructed the Speaker to inform &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of what had transpired in order to secure &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; support, as she and Raal rallied what support they could before they grouped with Rastakhan at the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaal was among the many who joined the great hunt for Zul and his forces. After Zul's forces at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Temple of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; were thinned out, Raal, who revealed that Rastakhan and &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt; had rushed on ahead causing him, Loti, and the Speaker went to rendezvous with them, giving their king air support. During the confrontation with Zul, Rezan was slain which forced the Zandalari forces, Raal among them, into retreat.\nRaal was among the many defenders of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; when Zul, &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;his loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies, &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mythrax%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city as they sought to break the final seal in order to release the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the city would be saved, Zul slain, and the seal broken, freeing G'huun, who was slain sometime later.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji conferred with her father about how to deal with this new threat. They determined that while Rastakhan would defend the city, Talanji herself would lead the armies of Zandalari against the Alliance. To that end, she enlisted the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; with rallying the Zandalari. In particular, Raal was ordered to mobilize the aerial forces for battle. However upon arriving in Nazmir a thick fog prevented the combined Zandalari and Horde armies from moving foreword and had cost them several warriors. As a result of the fog Raal and his forces were forced to sit out the subsequent war in the fog against the Alliance. After the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt; which lifted the fog Raal headed towards the Nazmir coast to join the assault against the Alliance only to discover that the army was leaving the cost towards back towards Dazar'alor. Upon learning that the Alliance attack on Nazmir was a feint to lure them away from Dazar'alor in order to weaken the city's defenses Raal joined the army in heading back towards the city in order to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;defend it&lt;/a&gt; while declaring that Zuldazar will not fall. During the battle Rastakhan was slain and Raal was among the many to attend his funeral.\nSometime after the death of her father, Talanji created a new Zanchuli Council consisting of Raal, &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%27nok%2C%20Bulwark%20of%20Torcali\"&gt;Jo'nok, Bulwark of Torcali&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Vol'kaal), &lt;a href=\"High%20Prelate%20Rata\"&gt;High Prelate Rata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;General Rakera&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Jakra'zet), and &lt;a href=\"Lashk\"&gt;Lashk&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt; to sit on the Council. During the ritual of queens and kings, Raal and the rest of the Council were attacked and imprisoned in webs by &lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;Samara&lt;/a&gt;, the White Widow, as they were giving Talanji their blessings. Upon the death of Samara, the Zanchuli Council was freed and finished their blessings, after which Talanji moved forward. After Talanji passed the rest of her trials, she was declared the Queen of Zandalar and formally joined the Horde as its equal. Following these events, Raal remarked that the winds of change were blowing."}

There are &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; hexxers.\nIn the RPG.\nAll &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s know of ways to invoke &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s to do their bidding. The hexer (or hexxer) takes this craft to a new level, calling the wrath of spirits down upon his enemies. With a dance and a chant, he weakens and debilitates his foes. If a particular enemy becomes troublesome, he can bind a hostile spirit into an idol, delivering a permanent curse.\nHexers attract spirits to do their bidding through the use of music, chants, dances, or other types of performance. Therefore a high skill in performance is desirable. The idols a hexer creates usually take the form of carvings or other types of figures (the classic voodoo doll, for example), so some ability to craft is also necessary.\nThe hexer can invoke a hex chant. Although termed a \u201cchant,\u201d hex chants can involve ritual dance, hand motions and the like, they do not necessarily have to produce sound. A hex chant produces a supernatural effect on one or more creatures in an area, within a specified range around the hexer. The hexer can freely designate which targets are affected and which are not. He may include himself. A hexer can continue a hex chant as long as he is concentrating. A hexer can begin a new chant while the effects of an old one persist.\nA hexer can create a hex idol, which takes the form of a wood or bone carving, voodoo doll, or similar object. The idol is attuned to a specific individual creature, giving the hexer power over that creature. Crafting the hex idol requires some piece of the creature such as a lock of hair, fingernail or claw clipping, discarded scale, and so forth. He can use any appropriate craft depending on the type of idol such as woodworking, bonecarving, stonecutting, and even glassblowing are all good choices. Success indicates that he has successfully called upon a spirit hostile to the creature and bound it to the idol.\nHexers in the world.\nThe typical hexer is the stereotypical &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, dressed in animal skins, dancing wildly about a bubbling cauldron as he calls forth spirits to do his bidding. Hexers almost always hail from tribal cultures, and are particularly well known among &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Some &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; take up the craft, though it is dark; and while the art was lost for a while to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, they recently rediscovered it while returning to their spiritual roots. Hexers are virtually unknown outside the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost people see hexers as mysterious and perhaps a little disturbed, especially since hexer performances are bizarre. Since nobody can see or interact with the \"spirits\" a hexer calls forth, some believe a hexer's art is all smoke and mirrors, designed merely to intimidate and distract the enemy. Nonetheless, the hexer's powers affect believers and nonbelievers alike."}
