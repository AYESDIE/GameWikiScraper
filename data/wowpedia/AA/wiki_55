His desire for magic driving him, Illidan braved the dangers of Felwood and took the skull, stopping the corruption from spreading.

Lastly, the demon hunter &lt;a href=\"Feronas%20Sindweller\"&gt;Feronas Sindweller&lt;/a&gt;, former student of Illidan, seeks to continue his master's work and slay the remaining demons of Felwood.\nDig sites.\nFelwood has four &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nCataclysm.\nIn , Felwood underwent some notable changes. &lt;a href=\"Bloodvenom%20Post\"&gt;Bloodvenom Post&lt;/a&gt; was seemingly reinforced with new, &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish architecture but infested by slime spirits, thus resulting in its loss as a Horde hub. The Horde now have a &lt;a href=\"Irontree%20Clearing\"&gt;Goblin base&lt;/a&gt; directly west of &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the very northernmost part of Felwood. The &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Circle\"&gt;Emerald Circle&lt;/a&gt; established a new settlement around &lt;a href=\"Irontree%20Woods\"&gt;Irontree Woods&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Talonbranch%20Glade\"&gt;Talonbranch Glade&lt;/a&gt; became a smaller Worgen settlement. The zone was retuned to a 45-50 bracket. \nAreas affected:\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nFelwood Forest was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was a lush and vibrant land of woods and meadows, tended by the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; and protected by &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Bubbling streams ran through quiet, grassy meadows, and the summer sun was tempered by the whispering breeze and the cooling rain. The leafy corridors of the forest rang out with the music of songbirds. It was as close to a paradise as the world has ever known. Then the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; befouled the land. Any trees and creatures that escaped the outright destruction became forever cursed in the demons' rampage. Having felt the cursed touch of the Burning Legion, Felwood is an eerie, dark, and haunted region of scattered gloomy woodlands and tainted vales, all of it teeming with evil. The meadows of Felwood retain the sickly, charred look they took on when the demons cursed the land during the third war. Nothing grows there. The mighty ancients that once guarded the land now roam blindly, their limbs twisted and their bark hides bleeding fel poisons. The once tranquil rivers and streams now boil with poison and noxious gases.\nFelwood is a dismal and dangerous land to all who enter. Most cross into Felwood only out of necessity, for it lies directly along the road to &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Armed travelers are usually safe if they pass along the main road by day, but they have no guarantee of safety if they leave the trail or if they venture into Felwood after nightfall. The night elves feel constant shame that they failed to protect this noble land. All their efforts to restore health to the woods and meadows through divine magic have failed. Despite the lingering curse of 10,000 years, the night elves refuse to cease their efforts to lift it. Some think that the key to healing the blighted land lies with , brother to the night elf hero &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan was known to have consumed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, which also blighted the forest. Only powerful divine magic can likely save the land, however.\nGeography.\nFelwood has no villages or people of its own. It is home to no cities to speak of; the night elves fled the area thousands of years ago, and no one had found the ambition to settle in the cursed forest since. The land is a cursed relic, a danger to all within its bounds. Even creatures united in evil are not safe from the depredations of one another. Explosions and flashes of arcane brilliance erupt throughout Felwood as druids clash with the warlocks. Felwood is home to many beasts, with bears and wolves the most numerous. As herbivores refuse to eat the cursed vegetation, the carnivores have turned to feeding on each other. As the new beasts immigrate from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, only the toughest survive for longer feeding on others. At the end, the overall numbers stays more or less constant. Combined with the great curse, this development has created in each creature a brutal rage, one that causes the beasts turn on one another and any who dare to enter their territory. Cursed furbolgs roam the forest, looking for an end to their torment. They are hardy enough to survive drinking the cursed waters of &lt;a href=\"Bloodvenom%20Falls\"&gt;Bloodvenom Falls&lt;/a&gt;, but the water only increases their madness.\nCursed &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s lurk near &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; ruins and will attack anyone they see.

Satyrs dwell by tainted &lt;a href=\"moon%20well\"&gt;moon well&lt;/a&gt;s, their dark magics twisting Felwood\u2019s curse ever deeper into the land.

The undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and what demons survived the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; have also made a home in Felwood.

Many derogatory slang terms exist for armor, plate or otherwise, perceived by the fanbase as as excessively revealing on female character models compared to how they appear applied to male player characters, such as \"boobplate\", \"slutplate\", \"buttplate\", etc. While non-plate items such as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mageweave%20Leggings\"&gt;Black Mageweave Leggings&lt;/a&gt; (\"buttweave\") and &lt;a href=\"Robes%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Robes of Insight&lt;/a&gt; are infamous for similar reasons, boobplate carries an extra stigma of being unconvincing visual protection for the character: midriff and cleavage windows, bare thighs, etc.\nThe aesthetic is heavily associated with the experimental, sometimes odd visual design of &lt;a href=\"vanilla\"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt; content, which has been heavily toned down in later expansions. Because of this, many sets such as the Glorious Plate or &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;Warrior's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; are equipable by relatively low-to-medium-level players, but the rarity of these items being encountered at the current speed of leveling content can inflate &lt;a href=\"BoE\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt; boobplate to extreme prices on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; , especially with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;transmogging&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany people see this as mere fanservice.

He would mine all across the planet and earn the title of Hand of Khaz. He has mined the depths of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, the Borean Tundra, &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and many other dangerous locations.\nCataclysm.\nAfter his time in Northrend, Fendrig along with twelve other miners were tasked with investing the trogg infestation from the &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Pass\"&gt;Coldridge Pass&lt;/a&gt;. However, a quake would trap Fendrig under the rubble and when they others tried to rescue him the pass itself would collapse and kill the other miners. The sole survivor was Fendrig and after he was rescued, he no longer desired into venture the mines ever again.\nThe Jade Hunters.\nAfter spending his time telling his past exploits as stories Fendrig would be called by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; and teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; in order to help rebuild the Jade Serpent statue. Accepting the task Fendrig would later find himself participating in the jade hunt called by &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Raiki\"&gt;Foreman Raiki&lt;/a&gt; since there was a lack of jade to help rebuild the statue.\nDuring this jade hunt, the three dwarves would be tricked by &lt;a href=\"Fei\"&gt;Fei&lt;/a&gt; into going into the same mine, a fact that pleased none of them. As the three ventured deeper into the cave Carrick would decide to strike the Mogu statue that blocked their way, though Carrick would soon break it and leave the pathway open. Fendrig would soon become trapped alone, which caused him to have a flashback of the Coldridge pass accident and to his shock, he was greeted by the ghost of the miners. However, rather than smiting him, like he thought they would, they instead implored him to keep on living. This gave Fendrig the strength to rise back up and open the next door. \nThe three dwarves would find a cave full of gems and when Fenella ordered her pet golem, &lt;a href=\"Koveth\"&gt;Koveth&lt;/a&gt;, to dig it caused the ceiling to fall down. When running for the exit he and Carrick would be forced to fight off spiders until Fenella rescued and then sacrificed Koveth to give them enough time to escape. While looking around the room they ran into, they found a great amount of Jade and the Scrolls of the Celestials. Reading the scrolls gave the three dwarves insight which allowed them to realize they could still do great things, even after they believed that they couldn't.\nAs such when the three left the cave as friends, their prior animosity forgotten, and brought forth the jade they found to the Foreman. Uncaring that the contest was over, the three decided to thank &lt;a href=\"Fei\"&gt;Fei&lt;/a&gt; for getting them together, only to be shocked when she ran away. After chasing her to a hill Fei then turned into the Jade Serpent and flew into the sky, leaving the dwarves speechless.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Grum%20Redbeard\"&gt;Grum Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grimthorn%20Redbeard\"&gt;Grimthorn Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Godrey%20Redbeard\"&gt;Godrey Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;."}

She is known for the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Crystalarium\"&gt;Ruby Crystalarium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Jade Hunters.\nFenella was blackmailed by Moira, alongside &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;, into aiding &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Raiki\"&gt;Foreman Raiki&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; masons on the reconstruction of the statue of &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt;.

However, when Fenella and Koveth arrived, she found that the young pandaren girl had also revealed the location to Carrick and Fendrig.\nAs her team pressed deeper into the mine, each member Fenella's team encountered illusions and traps related to their past traumas, before encountering a swarm of hungry &lt;a href=\"shale%20spider\"&gt;shale spider&lt;/a&gt;s. While fleeing the spiders and leaving her team to their fates, Fenella encountered an illusion of her father, scolding her for leaving her companions behind, and a memory of her stealing the plans of other architects and presenting them to &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; as if they were her father's. While no evidence was found of the crime and Fenella's father was ultimately promoted, he lost face with the other architects and got a reputation as a fraud. Fineous went along with the deception anyway so that his daughter wouldn't be branded a thief. The illusion of her father soon returned, scolding her once more, before emptying his pipe and disappearing. Fenella returned to save her fellow dwarves but lost Koveth in the process, the golem having been overrun by the spiders.\nOnce they'd escaped the spiders, Fenella and the miners found their way into a cavern full of jade and discovered the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20the%20Celestials\"&gt;Scrolls of the Celestials&lt;/a&gt;. After reading through the scrolls and learning of the history of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;, they took a piece of jade and returned to the celebrating pandaren masons, who were amazed by the beauty of the jade. As Fenella and her two compatriots went to thank Fei for showing them the mine, the young pandaren girl revealed her true form: that of the Jade Serpent, Yu'lon.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFenella is present in &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt; after the remaining Dark Iron dwarves join the Alliance under Moira."}

He is a spirit awakened after the death of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guard\"&gt;Stone Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and will animate several mogu statue trash mobs on the route to his encounter.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Long ago, Feng Shri was the Mogu'shan Vaults' caretaker, tasked with preserving the treasures kept within these shadowy halls. After years of faithful service, he was caught stealing from the shelves, although some say he was framed by a jealous underling and the mogu ruler punished him with a fatal curse. The doomed spirit of Feng Shri has wandered the vaults ever since, communing with the shades of past mogu heroes and warlords.\"\nSpells and Abilities.\nFeng enrages after 10 minutes on all difficulties.\nStolen Essences of Stone.\nThe heroic willpower of tank-specced players allows them access to the leftover essence shards from the awakened statues.\nStrategy.\nOverview.\nFeng the Accursed is a multi-phase &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; encounter in which Feng will draw upon the might of three (LFR and Normal) or four (Heroic) Mogu champion statues located around the perimeter of the dais, gaining their abilities.\nAt the pull, two large purple crystals will appear on the South side of the dais. These gems, when clicked by a tank, will grant the tank one of two abilities, which the player can activate with an &lt;a href=\"ExtraActionButton1\"&gt;ExtraActionButton1&lt;/a&gt;. The West crystal grants Shroud of Reversal and the East gem grants Nullification Barrier. The effects of these abilities are listed above and the proper usage of these abilities is explained below.\nRaid composition.\nThese are the ideal raid compositions, but similar configurations may work just as well.\nGeneral mechanics.\nWhile Feng's most important abilities change depending on which phase he is in, he does retain Spirit Bolt which does Shadow damage targeted at a random player. In each phase, he also has a tank swap ability that are all functionally the same mechanic with different types of damage-- Lightning Lash, Flaming Spear, Arcane Shock and Shadowburn. Each of these abilities places a DoT on his current tank, and tanks should swap aggro around 2-3 stacks, although if DPS is very good or a tank is well-geared swapping may not be necessary.\nFeng the Accursed has a 9 minute hard &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timer on Normal mode and a 10 minute hard enrage timer on Heroic mode. If he is not defeated within this time limit Feng will gain vastly increased attack speed and damage and will wipe the raid in a matter of seconds. Heroic mode also features a minor soft enrage mechanic in the form of Strength of Spirit, a passive buff he gains as his individual phases are completed.\nPhases.\nThere are three (LFR and Normal) or four (Heroic) phases of this encounter. In LFR and Normal mode, the order of the phases is fixed and Feng will always enter the same three phases in the same order. On Heroic mode, the raid can choose which order they will take the phases in. In either case, whenever Feng enters a new phase he loses the special abilities he had in the previous phase.\nOn LFR and Normal mode:\nHeroic mode.\nOn Heroic mode, there are four phases and the raid can control what order they will take the phases in. Feng will draw powers from whichever statue is closest to him at the pull and again when his remaining health reaches 75%, 50% and 25%. Because he will immediately enter a phase after the pull, the tank that begins the encounter must taunt Feng from in front of whichever statue's phase the raid wants to tackle first. The three statues from LFR and Normal mode will grant Feng the same abilities as before, while the Heroic-only Northwest statue will grant him Spirit of the Shield, the Heroic-only phase.\nWhile the order of these phases should reflect your raid's preferences, the most common order used is the following:\nThis order places his most damaging abilities earlier in the fight (when they will not be fully buffed by Strength of Spirit) and also provides the convenience of allowing the raid to wipe earlier in the fight (and thus save time) if these damaging abilities prove too difficult to handle. On the other hand, if the raid is struggling to deal with the adds in the Strength of the Shield phase to prevent Feng's self-healing, it may be advantageous to do that phase first to limit Feng's self-healing potential as he cannot heal himself above 100%. The raid leader will need to decide the best order for his or her team based on knowledge of the members' abilities.\nBecause Feng will always go next to whichever statue is closest to him, tanks need to move Feng to the next statue for the phase the raid will be doing next ahead of time so that he always enters the correct phase next. If following the order above, after Feng enters Spirit of the Staff the tanks should move Feng to the Northeast statue so that he will acquire Spirit of the Fist at 75%, then move him again to the Northwest statue for Spirit of the Shield before Feng reaches 50% and so on.\nSpirit of the Fist.\nWhen Feng enters the Spirit of the Fist phase he gains two abilities: Lightning Fists and Epicenter. Lightning Fists creates damaging shockwaves that will also stun anyone caught in their path, and these must simply be dodged as much as possible. Epicenter is a raid-wide AoE that will do less damage the further players are away from Feng. As such, during this phase it is preferable to have ranged DPS and healers stacked up on the opposite end of the dais where they will take minimal damage from Epicenter. The tanks and melee DPS will be protected by means of the extra tank abilities mentioned above.\nWhen Feng uses Epicenter the first time, the tank with Nullification Barrier should channel the ability to protect the melee DPS and the tanks from harm, as Nullification Barrier will completely block the damage of Epicenter. Note that since Nullification Barrier is a channel, the tank with this ability must not move or take any action as this will break the channel and thus cause melee DPS and tanks to take massive damage.\nBefore Feng uses Epicenter a second time, the tank with Shroud of Reversal should use this ability on the other tank right before Feng uses Lightning Fists on that tank. By doing this, the Shroud tank will be able to use Lightning Fists on Feng. Lightning Fists has the ability to interrupt Epicenter and should be saved for when Feng begins to cast it. If Lightning Fists is used by the tank when Epicenter is being cast, Epicenter will stop and immediately be placed back on cooldown. The tanks should alternate between these two means of dealing with Epicenter, although if the raid's DPS is good it is unlikely that Feng will be able to use Epicenter a third time anyway.\nNote: The tank with Shroud of Reversal may benefit from placing the following macro on their action bar in place of their normal interrupt:\n /target nameOfMainTank\n /click ExtraActionButton1\n /targetlasttarget\nNote: The cooldown on Nullification Barrier is much shorter on LFR difficulty, and thus Nullification Barrier can and should be used to block every Epicenter.\nSpirit of the Spear.\nWhen Feng enters the Spirit of the Spear phase he gains two new abilities: Wildfire Spark and Draw Flame.\nWildfire Spark places a debuff on a random DPS or healer. After five seconds this debuff will explode and deal damage in addition to creating a fire void zone at that player's location that will damage anyone standing in it. When a player is targeted, they must run away from their group (either melee/tanks or ranged/healers, which should still be stacked up after the previous phase) and let it explode far enough away from the raid that the rest of the raid will not be caught in the fire. After the fire void zone has been placed away from the raid, they can then rejoin their group. It is best, if possible, for fire drop locations to be decided before the pull. The Northeast corner for melee and the Northwest corner for ranged/healers are ideal for Normal mode, but in Heroic mode where you place the fires should depend on which phase you plan to enter next so the space is clear for the tanks to move the boss when needed.\nWhen Feng uses Draw Flame, he will suck all of the fire void zones toward him, causing damage to anyone standing in the fires as they move. Any fire void zones that reach Feng will cause his melee swings to deal significant raid damage for a short period of time. However, the tank with Nullification Barrier can prevent him from absorbing the fire by activating and channeling it while he uses Draw Flame. The fires will still move towards him, but if the barrier is up when they reach Feng they will simply despawn and he will not absorb the fire and thus not receive the buff. Unfortunately, the cooldown on Nullification Barrier is too long to block every Draw Flame, and healers should be prepared to use cooldowns for as needed to deal with the raid damage.\nShroud of Reversal has no particular defensive purpose during this phase, but the tank that has this ability should use it to steal Feng's abilities as frequently as possible to deal extra damage and end the phase sooner.\nSpirit of the Staff.\nVictims of Arcane Resonance should stand clear of other players. The rest of the raid should try to take advantage of Arcane Velocity to increase their DPS.The healers should expect a lot of raid damage in this phase. As the damage will be high and raid movement is of little importance,&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; should be used is this phase to finish him as quick as possible.\nThere are eight convenient scrollwork/designs around the circle that can be used as reference points for raid member positioning. In 10-man mode, it may be useful for the two tanks to bring Feng to the middle, with the rest of the raid pre-assigned to the outer locations in case of Arcane Resonance, ensuring no raider is in the same spot. Non-resonating players can then group near the middle for AoE healing during Arcane Velocity.\nSpirit of the Shield (Heroic only).\nShadowburn is a stacking debuff that Feng applies to the tank, inflicting Shadow damage.\nChains of Shadow is an ability that Feng spams with relatively high frequency. It deals damage to a random player, and then jumps to other nearby targets, dealing damage to them as well. The damage to each successive target is lower than the damage to the one before. In 10-man, Chains of Shadow affects 3 targets, while in 25-man it affects 8.\nPeriodically, Feng throws his shield at a nearby location, which causes a number of \"Soul Fragments\" (5 in 10-man and 10 in 25-man) to spawn on the location of random raid members. They have no aggro table and move toward the shield, each one healing 5% of Feng's health if it reaches the shield. The fragments can be rooted, snared, stunned and knocked back.\nTanks must take turns to allow the Shadowburn debuff to drop off. The raid should be stacked up near Feng. Although this causes Chains of Shadow to deal its full damage, and it can be the source of possible deaths to your raid members, it's still the optimal positioning due to Soul Fragments. With the raid grouped together, they will all spawn in one place, allowing your raid to AoE them down as quickly as possible.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

Although leader of the Thunderlords, he was born in the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; as the eldest son of &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;, making him &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Ga%27nar\"&gt;Ga'nar&lt;/a&gt;'s brother, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s uncle and &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;'s great-uncle.\nHistory.\nRoughly 11 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Fenris, the eldest son of the Frostwolf chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;, abandoned the Frostwolves and instead joined the rival &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlords&lt;/a&gt;. In his new clan, he earned the renown he craved and eventually became the clan's chieftain. When the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20clan\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s began seizing large tracts of land from the orcs of Frostfire with an army of &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20clan\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; half-breeds, Garad called upon the Thunderlords and Whiteclaws to unite with the Frostwolves against this new threat. Due to Fenris' influence, the Thunderlords rejected Garad's call for unity, and instead decided to deal with the Bladespire in their own way.\nFenris and his clan were among the many who joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and serve under &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand tasked the Frostwolves, Thunderlords, and Whiteclaws with wiping out Draenor's gronn, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but Fenris and his Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies. One of the few gronn to escape the onslaught was named &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to fend off multiple Thunderlord assaults from his lair in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. Casualties grew so great that Fenris eventually abandoned the attacks.\nAfter the Horde had conquered much of Draenor, the threat of starvation caused many orcs to grow more agitated and turn on each other, clashing in short-lived battles that left hundreds dead. Several clans, among them the Thunderlords, completely lost themselves to the depths of madness. To protect the rest of the Horde, Blackhand banished the violent clans from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the remote areas of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve some of the Horde's dwindling strength. By the time &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; became Warchief, the clans of Draenor had descended deeper into bloodlust and had begun attacking the other clans left behind.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; chose to reforge the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after Doomhammer's defeat on Azeroth, Fenris pledged his Thunderlords to the cause. Fenris accompanied &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Teron then sent Fenris and &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Newly aided with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the two orc chieftains were transported to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;. From there they took boats and continued on a swift mission to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, where they slew a demon and claimed the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Fenris returned to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, gave the scepter to Teron, and returned to Draenor.\nHis subsequent fate remains unclear.\nPersonality.\nFenris was described as willing to acknowledge his own fears when facing a real danger, intelligent, and also as not lacking courage. Unlike Tagar and his Bonechewers, he noticed the peculiar structure of the Tomb.

When their home came under threat from the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, giant beasts that could be brought down only through a coordinated effort, Fenris defied his father's wishes and hunted with the neighboring Thunderlord clan. Fenris was victorious and continued to hunt with the Thunderlords as well as with the Frostwolves. He joined the group of &lt;a href=\"Ger%27hel\"&gt;Ger'hel&lt;/a&gt;, his future mate. During a &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20festival\"&gt;Kosh'harg festival&lt;/a&gt;, Garad declared in front of everyone that his son's pursuit of fame was hollow and without honor. Fenris then challenged Garad to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; and was defeated but not killed. Humiliated, Fenris left his native Frostwolf clan and joined the Thunderlords. There, his skill and intensity gained him notoriety, regardless of blood ties. He discarded the name Fenris Wolfbrother and embraced the nickname he earned from his daring exploits: the Iron Wolf.\nFor years, Fenris ascended through the ranks of the Thunderlord clan, eventually becoming its chieftain. Then the legendary chieftain &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, an army of orcs forged for one purpose: to conquer all of . The multitude represented the strength of diversity that Fenris admired and yearned for. Though composed of different clans, the Iron Horde worked for the glory of all. With the soul of the orc race at stake, Fenris looks to coerce the stubborn Frostwolf holdouts to join the Iron Horde... even if it means destroying everything his father taught him to cherish.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nLike the other orc clans, the Thunderlords were invited by to join the Iron Horde, an offer Fenris accepted. His father Garad and the Frostwolf clan however refused to join the Iron Horde, and Fenris was ordered to kill him. He led a small group of the Thunderlords and ambushed Garad and . After he killed his father, Ga'nar was left for dead and later captured. Fenris's youngest brother, , became the new chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.\nUnder his leadership, the Thunderlord clan leads attacks on the Frostwolf orcs, most notably at &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonefang%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonefang Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where the Thunderlords make use of &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s supplied by the Iron Horde to devastating effect. Ga'nar leads a raid on the Thunderlords, killing his sons Hatock, Grotan and Skal in the process. After being pursued by &lt;a href=\"Lokra\"&gt;Lokra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asha\"&gt;Asha&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which he mortally wounds with a spear, he is later confronted by Durotan and Ga'nar in the &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Hall%20%28Frostfire%20Ridge%29\"&gt;Hunter's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he reveals himself, as the two of them had been unaware that the Iron Wolf was their brother. Claiming that he always knew they would reunite one day, he enters the fray along with his rylak, &lt;a href=\"Chilltongue\"&gt;Chilltongue&lt;/a&gt;, and is summarily killed."}

Essentially:\n- The &lt;a href=\"Sheep\"&gt;Sheep&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; combo can disable healers or damage dealing classes effectively.\n- The Mage's anti-melee abilities like &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Armor\"&gt;Frost Armor&lt;/a&gt; coupled with the Druid's physical resistance (armor and dodge).\n- The Mage's Ice Block coupled with the Druid's healing spells.\n- The Mage's &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt; coupled with the Druid's &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge\"&gt;Feral Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bash%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Bash (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipement.\nBoth members of the team will need to acquire a lot of &lt;a href=\"resilience\"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;, due to the fact that the Druid is not a true healer. This means you will need to keep yourselves alive as long as you possibly can.\nThe Druid will need to get season 3 feral gloves in priority, because their effect is invaluable. In enables the &lt;a href=\"Maim\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; ability to counterspell a school of magic for three seconds, thereby preventing use of the Paladin's bubbles, the mage's &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, or the priest's &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt;, if used wisely.\nBoth members need to have &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Medallion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nYour Opponent.\nWarlock:\nWarlocks are probably going to be your worst ennemy. Their healing capabilities and their ability to fear their opponents will be hard for you to handle. Both of you should try to dispell curses of agony every so often. The general idea is to kill the Warlock's ally first, while trying to sheep/cyclone the Warlock. Burst DPS his ally, then the Druid should heal while the mage kills the lock.\nPaladin (Holy):\nThe Paladin is a hard cookie to crack. This is due to the fact that your attempts to burst him down will generally be aborted by his &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;. However your main advantage against them is the profusion of your Counterspelling effects. Force him to use his Shield early while Cyclone/Sheeping/Rooting his ally. Then, when the shield comes back down again, focus the Paladin again, and kill him. With a little luck you can even sometimes kil him before he can use his bubble."}

Both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; lay claim to the area and have to contend with powerful local forces. These include the bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s who control a number of scattered ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; ruins, including the vast ruined city now known as &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. The ogres have desecrated and defiled much of Feralas, damaging the land with their taint. The Horde in particular is concerned with the unchecked expansion of the Gordunni and has put out a call for &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to aid the war effort against them. Feralas is also home to a number of &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, members of which are hunted by order of &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The far western islands are crawling with &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and recently several &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; hives have been spotted. Feralas is also the location of one of the four &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s leading to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the Third War.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; set up a trap for &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; who had been hunting him for some time. Deep within the forests of Feralas, he sent his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s away and waited for the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, she struck, and they grappled in the misty wilds. Although Garona managed to wound Cho'gall, the &lt;a href=\"ogre-mage\"&gt;ogre-mage&lt;/a&gt; ultimately bested her and mind-controlled her. Afterward, Cho'gall took his Twilight's Hammer and the new &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; and left for Silithus.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe adventuring visitors of the area's main settlements, &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; off the coast and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; to the east, were involved in simply dealing with the local harsh wildlife including &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; hive called &lt;a href=\"The%20Writhing%20Deep\"&gt;The Writhing Deep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; green dragon &lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt; prowled the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Bough\"&gt;Dream Bough&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was invaded by the armies of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep within the southern forests of Feralas, ogre raiding parties were razing settlements and villages, as well as waylaying travelers. Besides the ogres, the wilds were also twisted by a corruption. After a series of skirmishes throughout Feralas, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; learned that the source of these problems was in Dire Maul, so they raided it, ending the threat of &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nWhile flying over Feralas on &lt;a href=\"Bristlefur\"&gt;Bristlefur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that the jungle used to run on for miles more and asked &lt;a href=\"Tarm\"&gt;Tarm&lt;/a&gt; what was wrong with the region. Tarm explained that nothing was wrong and that the forests are simply slowly giving way to the grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaman.\nA battle between a traitorous &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt; with Grimtotem tauren against the Earthen Ring's &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; occurred here.\nCataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; usurped the tauren leadership, the tauren of Feralas began their rebellion. In the Cataclysm's chaos that happened to the night elves in Feralas, the naga renewed their attack on Feathermoon Stronghold.\nFollowing the Cataclysm, there was an increased presence from both the Alliance and Horde in Feralas due to the escalation of both the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thalanaar\"&gt;Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; and Feathermoon Stronghold were both destroyed by floods and their inhabitants assailed by the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. They founded two &lt;a href=\"New%20Thalanaar\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;settlements&lt;/a&gt; to combat the threat. The Horde was not doing well either, with refugees from the destroyed &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; tauren settlements pouring in, as well as the increased &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20clan\"&gt;Gordunni clan&lt;/a&gt; magic corruption of the land. The Horde gets back up from the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; ogres led by &lt;a href=\"Orhan%20Ogreblade\"&gt;Orhan Ogreblade&lt;/a&gt;. They find out that the Gordunni are being taught magic by the mad ogre warlock &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;. Orhan and her ogres/&lt;a href=\"Silvia\"&gt;Silvia&lt;/a&gt; and her Sentinels stop him during &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20the%20Stonemaul\"&gt;Might of the Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20the%20Sentinels\"&gt;Might of the Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. \nMeanwhile, the now-redeemed green dragon &lt;a href=\"Ysondre\"&gt;Ysondre&lt;/a&gt; (now wearing a blindfold and a set of &lt;a href=\"Tier%207\"&gt;Tier 7&lt;/a&gt; druid armor), decides to ask for help from the mortals to help her kill the only corrupted green dragon to survive the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Taerar\"&gt;Taerar&lt;/a&gt;. They track him down to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Wilds\"&gt;Lower Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and kill him during &lt;a href=\"Taerar%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Taerar's Fall&lt;/a&gt;.

They trekked through the southern part of Feralas in order to get to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. They rescued a murloc named &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; and were joined by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;. The druid and the boy were captured by the Gordunni ogres who brought them to Dire Maul. An organization named the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; entered the ancient city and challenged &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;. While Aram and his companions escaped, Hidden's leader, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;, now also the new leader of the Dire Maul Gordunni ogres commanded to leave the ruins and search the forests. Near the border with Thousand Needles, a crystal shard of Aram's compass was located here.\nA large chunk of Feralas has been deforested by the Gordunni, driving the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s further east and into conflict with each other. The yetis and gnolls eventually allied together to fight the ogres.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20Theramore\"&gt;Destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde set up a blockade around Kalimdor, and according to spies the Horde believed the Alliance would focus to liberate &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; first. At the same time, Alliance intelligence revealed that the Grimtotem in the region plan to take advantage of the Horde's distraction to attack them.\nExploring Azeroth.\nEven though the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have built footholds in Feralas, the area stays wild and untamable. The Horde's presence continues thanks to Camp Mojache that is being attacked by the Gordunni who hold many of the best areas of the jungle. As the ogres and Woodpaw gnolls continue to attack Mojache and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Ataya\"&gt;Camp Ataya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; to answer their calls for help. Adventurers helped him thin the enemies' numbers, but it wasn't enough. To strengthen the camps, Belgrom wants a new Horde outpost, Camp Rockmaul. While the tug of war goes on between the gnolls, yetis, silithid, and the Horde, the Gordunni grow their holdings. Their war parties hammer the contested borders of the jungle and spoil what land they pry away from others.\nGeography.\nFeralas is a large rainforest of huge, ancient trees stretching from &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; to the coastline in the west and from the wasteland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in the north to the lush &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\n&lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, ancient ruins now populated by ogres, is an instanced dungeon which can be found in this area. There are no raid dungeons or battlegrounds here, but there are multiple &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D31\"&gt;A pre-Cataclysm textured map of Feralas&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nFeralas is home to several characters of note. At Thalanaar, &lt;a href=\"Falfindel%20Waywarder\"&gt;Falfindel Waywarder&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the Death's Head cult. In Feathermoon Stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; attempts to cleanse the taint that is the naga led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Shalzaru\"&gt;Lord Shalzaru&lt;/a&gt;. And at Camp Mojache, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Uzer%27i\"&gt;Witch Doctor Uzer'i&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the deepest parts of the jungle in search of mystical muisek (the spirit of animals). &lt;a href=\"Kindal%20Moonweaver\"&gt;Kindal Moonweaver&lt;/a&gt; requires help to free &lt;a href=\"Sprite%20Darter\"&gt;Sprite Darter&lt;/a&gt;s being held captive by &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; tauren.\nQuests.\nFor the pre-Cataclysm experience, see &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20quests\"&gt;Feralas quests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Feralas questing guide&lt;/a&gt;. The post-Cataclysm version of the zone can (or will be) found at &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20storyline\"&gt;Feralas storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Herb\"&gt;Herb&lt;/a&gt;s\n&lt;a href=\"Ore\"&gt;Ore&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Leather\"&gt;Leather&lt;/a&gt;\nWarcraft III.\nIn \"\", Feralas is a melee map designed for maximum 8 players. The tileset is called \"Lordaeron Summer\".\n\"Separated only by a shallow stretch of water, two teams prepare to battle it out. The forest is dense enough that you may need to chop through the trees in order to better aid your allies.\"\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nOnce part of the great expansion of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; power, the forest of Feralas holds many ancient ruins as well as the great city now known as &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; that have long since been overgrown by the native plant life. One possible explanation for its abundant flora and fauna could lie in the fact that &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was once nothing but lush forests prior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely the high mountains that surround the area served as a protective barrier from such outside factors.\nFrom Lands of Mystery.\nUpon arriving from Desolace, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; witnessed a lush valley filled with enough ancient trees to \"make any elf weep with joy\". He quickly spotted the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Colossals\"&gt;Twin Colossals&lt;/a&gt; and decided to climb to the summit of one of them, spending most of his first day in Feralas by circling the Twin Colossals while fending off wild creatures and &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s. In the evening he met a night elf who'd been observing Brann for some time for fun, but was gentle enough to teleport him to the top. From there, Brann saw a road descending into the valley from the south, cutting through the forest until it turned east and disappeared. To the west, amid the thick treetops, he saw stone ruins \"jutted up like bony fingers\". Further westward, he spotted the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Coast\"&gt;Forgotten Coast&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Dread\"&gt;Isle of Dread&lt;/a&gt; along the horizon, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Ferry\"&gt;Feathermoon Ferry&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople and culture.\nIn Brann's opinion, most residents of Feralas were rather barbaric, living in simple dwellings or holes in the ground. They wear whatever they can create using simple tools and have little knowledge of higher technologies like stonecutting and metalwork. The tauren at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; are the most civilized, though remaining true to their tribal roots and treating their surroundings with respect. The ogres are \"the worst menace in the area\", being scavengers and squatters. Some live in traditional mounds, other in the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; ruins. They hate anything that isn't an ogre, sometimes not even caring about that. There are also pockets of &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; \"whom will kill you first, eat you second, and ask questions later.\" Oddly enough, Brann describes the night elves as not being true natives of Feralas, despite their strong history there.\nGeography.\nBrann describes Feralas as a lush, L-shaped valley stretching from Desolace in the north to the ocean in the west and then stretching across half of Kalimdor until it reaches the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The region is nearly bisected by the ridge in the middle, which stretches from the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20Den\"&gt;Woodpaw Den&lt;/a&gt; in the south to Dire Maul in the north. The climate is subtropical with most days being warm and humid, with plentiful rainfall. All kinds of creatures inhabit Feralas, ranging from carnivores like wolves and &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s to \"smart animals\" known as yeti and intelligent creatures like gnolls.\nThe Legend of Feralas.\n\"The Legend of Feralas\" is a legend Brann heard while he stayed at the Feathermoon Stronghold. It tells that in the days before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Feralas was a part of a great valley that stretched across south-central Kalimdor to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;. The Highborne, servitors of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, lived here in their city and capital &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was a group of powerful &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s called the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; exploded in the Sundering, the elves were cut off from their magical source became lethargic, seeming doomed. Their prince, &lt;a href=\"Tortheldrin\"&gt;Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt;, decided that they required a new source of magical. The ony way to get it was to steal it from the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s; the elves' enemies, and so they constructed a prison to trap a mighty demon in. It consisted of a network of pylons which harnessed magical forces, creating a force field. Their plan worked - they summoned and trapped the demon &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;, and siphoned his energies for centuries. The demon couldn't escape, but its power had a limit. This was something he prince didn't foresee. When Immol'thar's power began to fade after thousand of years, Tortheldrin - now driven mad in his lust for power - solved the problem by slaying most of the arcanists, forcing the rest of them to continue channeling energy into Immol'thar's prison to keep him confined. Still, Tortheldrin wasn't satisfied. With no other arcanists draining energy from the demon, the prince was able to absorb the energy for himself. This increased his strength to almost unimaginable levels, but only so long as he remained in Eldre'Thalas. And so, Immol\u2019thar remains trapped, the arcanists continue to be Tortheldrin\u2019s slaves, and the once beautiful city became an ogre-infested ruin.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Most of them do not speak the languages spoken by humans or orcs, however a few like &lt;a href=\"Orbiss\"&gt;Orbiss&lt;/a&gt; have learned to speak it. \nThe mist helps sustain their bodies. Mist that is warm and fragrant, like the mist in the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Sumprushes\"&gt;Upper Sumprushes&lt;/a&gt;, is nutritive to them. They also ingest plants and plant-like creatures, like the &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;nature spirit&lt;/a&gt;s and drink the blood of creatures they can capture.\nThe crew of \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Barnacle\"&gt;the Barnacle&lt;/a&gt;\" encountered a mistlurker when venturing into the caves of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. They were surprised when the moss and lichen lining the wall detached itself and began shambling toward them. A choking gas billowed from the mistlurker's many fungal blossoms. The vines and ferns making up its hide regrew rapidly wherever it was struck.\nMistlurkers are also found on the fungus-covered world &lt;a href=\"Naigtal\"&gt;Naigtal&lt;/a&gt; accessed through &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20Points\"&gt;Invasion Points&lt;/a&gt;. One Mistlurker is known to live on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tar%20Spitter\"&gt;Tar Spitter&lt;/a&gt;."}

They protected the inhabitants of the lands during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nShaohao sought the counsel of the great &lt;a href=\"waterspeaker\"&gt;waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; who, instead of good news, brought him news about the coming of a great catastrophe. Shaohao embarked on a journey to get rid of his negative emotions like doubt and anger. After Shaohao cleansed himself, using his staff &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt;, he merged his &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; with the land, causing his very essence to shroud Pandaria in thick mist for years to come, and faded into a legend. Shaohao, however, did so out of &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;pride&lt;/a&gt; which he never got rid of. It even became obscured from the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s abilities to penetrate the passages of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anglers\"&gt;Anglers&lt;/a&gt;, no boat could find its way home through the mists.

He gathered like-minded pandaren and never returned to Pandaria again, avoiding it.\nOver 10,000 years later, the mists parted due to the effects of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the island continent was then first found by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the visions granted by the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, soon followed by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they fell, the mists still remained in the sky.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; has drifted in and out of Pandaria's mists for hundreds of years. It reappeared again at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.

But when the civilized &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; draw near their warrens, the Virmen are a famine on legs.\nVirmen are inveterate lurkers, awaiting the opportunity to grab carrion, garbage, or actual food whenever they can. They\u2019ll steal and eat nearly anything, then scurry away, leaving behind overturned tables and ransacked trash piles. The menace of the Virmen is only slightly increased by their propensity to wield stolen daggers (or, failing that, sharpened pieces of &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;) in both hands. Though most Virmen avoid direct conflict, they are not unwilling to attack others in pursuit of the sustenance that drives their every waking moment.\nJinyu, Caretakers of Pandaria\u2019s waters.\nPandaria is surrounded by and shot through with clear blue waters, and it is in these bodies of water that the amphibious &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; flourish. In a sense, the Jinyu maintain and cultivate natural water sources, even creating smaller streams with &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. But the Jinyu also exercise a dominion over Pandaria\u2019s rivers and lakes that can bring them into conflict with other races. They regularly stop up rivers to create their homes and breeding pools, and the multifaceted dwellings they create aren\u2019t simple mud lodges \u2013 they are towns and camps that can extend beneath the water.\nJinyu society is caste-based. Jinyu are chosen for their roles (such as &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s) at a young age, and final say in all communal decisions is granted to the elder Jinyu in a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;. While this rigid structure can seem constricting, the elders\u2019 roles are often deserved: they can speak and listen to the waters that flow throughout Pandaria, making them extremely wise and terribly powerful.\nSprites, Pranksters and embodiments of nature.\nMischievous and prevalent, the nature &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s of Pandaria resemble the prevalent features of their surroundings, like shrubs or rocks. Their appearance allows them to easily hide and engage in their favorite pastime \u2013 playing tricks on others for inscrutable reasons. Many forest sprites\u2019 pranks \u2013 disguising themselves as stools to trip people, or throwing fruit and nuts at wanderers \u2013 seem harmless. Mountain spirits\u2019 means of interaction tend to have a higher incidence of violence and death, involving rockslides and falls off cliffs.\nRumor has it that more deadly, unique varieties of sprites have emerged in &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;-tainted areas. If sprites\u2019 behavior is simply a reflection of the environments that surround them, any such creatures must be monumentally dangerous.\nMogu, Overlords of old Pandaria.\nThe land known as Pandaria today was not always named for the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; people. In ages past, the &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; ruled. Possessed of immense size and strength, they built an &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;empire based on might&lt;/a&gt;, in which the weak \u2013 other races \u2013 were subjugated, and the strong \u2013 always Mogu \u2013 ascended to power. Imposing stone monuments and titanic siege engines displayed the power of the Mogu to the rest of the land. They turned their strength on the lesser inhabitants of Pandaria, shaping flesh to their whims as they shaped rock.\nThe Mogu were overthrown in a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;desperate revolution&lt;/a&gt; led by the Pandaren, but their legacy persists in thousand year-old ruins too immense to fall. Indeed, some of the Mogu were too great to topple with their empire. As Pandaria emerges into a changed &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving Mogu have begun to stir. They crave the domain they once held, and, to regain it, they will sweep usurpers and invaders alike into the dust.\nHozen, Furious hunter-gatherers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hozen\"&gt;Hozen&lt;/a&gt; are uncannily dexterous foragers and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s who dwell in clans among treetops and mountains of Pandaria. They\u2019re extremely short-lived (their elders are often no older than twenty) and their society lacks roots (and rules) as a result. Uncouth and impulsive, Hozen nonetheless play, live and squabble together\u2026at least until their clans grow so large that they collapse into multiple smaller groups.\nThe other races of Pandaria are careful to avoid Hozen hunting grounds, as their notoriously short tempers grow even shorter when their hunger pushes entire &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, including elderly and young Hozen, to ravage food sources outside of their territory, either gathering enough food or seeing enough Hozen die in the process to ensure the survivors\u2019 continued health.\nMantid, Insectoid reavers from beyond the wall.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt; people were once deemed a threat so great that the ancient Mogu who ruled Pandaria dedicated several generations to the construction of a &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;zone-spanning wall&lt;/a&gt; solely to keep them at bay. Yet, the insectoid Mantid are no hive mind. They are intelligent creatures who organize themselves by caste, and claim total obedience to an Empress of their race. They are the builders of elaborate cities that range across Pandaria\u2019s steppes. It is the manner of these cities\u2019 construction that makes the Mantid so dangerous.\nThe cycle of Mantid birthing and building revolves around the &lt;a href=\"Kunchong\"&gt;Kunchong&lt;/a&gt;, a colossal insect large enough to threaten whole towns by itself. The Mantid revere this enormous creature, and when instinct compels it to stampede throughout the continent, eating earth, trees, and lakes, they follow behind, collecting the &lt;a href=\"amber\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt;-colored resin it secretes, birthing their young and creating their homes in its wake. If other races\u2019 homes are trampled by the Kunchong, it is of little consequence to the Mantid. Where the Kunchong\u2019s shadow falls, they walk. Where they walk, the land is transformed.\nSaurok, Reptilian humanoids uplifted by dark magic.\nIn the search for shock troops to consolidate their hold over ancient Pandaria, the Mogu turned to an unlikely source: the fauna of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The Mogu chose several particularly sturdy varieties of local reptiles, and twisted them in body and mind, imbuing them with an upright gait and sufficient intelligence to wield weapons. But these reptilian servitors were spectacularly ineffective: they attacked their commanders, fled from battles, and prized plunder over obedience. Furious, the Mogu slaughtered them in great numbers and crushed their breeding chambers\u2026yet, today, the experiments outnumber their creators.\nAfter the Mogu withdrew from the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20empire\"&gt;Pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt;, their creations, the &lt;a href=\"Saurok\"&gt;Saurok&lt;/a&gt;, survived by scrounging and hiding in the wild places of Pandaria. As lone bandits possessed of brute strength and innate aggression, the Saurok can be dangerous enough \u2013 but they have slowly begun to organize in roving warbands. Unburdened by \u2018civilized\u2019 notions of property, these raiders charge into battle, seeking the spoils of softer races.\nYaungol, Tribal warriors in search of a new home.\nTen thousand years ago, a number of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes were stranded on the western slopes of the new Pandaren continent. Clever and hardy, forced to adapt to a harsh land, they were able to eke out a life in these dangerous environs. They became the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt;. They counted the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; among their hunting grounds. There they roamed, in the dangerous wilds beyond the Pandaren wall.\nRecent mantid attacks have led many yaungol warlords to the realization that the best hope for their people was to breach the wall and seek new homes in the safer environs of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, outnumbered and already straining to fight off mantid assaults and a sha uprising, were unable to stop the incursion. The yaungol horde has arrived in Kun-Lai, bringing war with them. It now falls to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to drive back the yaungol and aid the Shado-Pan in securing the breached wall.\nGrummle, Humble wanderers of the mountains.\nHigh among the cloud-topped mountains of Pandaria live the &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s. These simple, tiny humanoids are a humble folk content to wander and transport goods throughout the twisty, windy trails of the Kun-Lai Summit. In addition to their great knowledge of the mountains, the superstitious grummles rely on luck and good fortune to see them through the difficult high passes.\nGrummles travel in packs. They do not have a centralized government so much as an arrangement of &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; masters who handle business. The grummles have a long-standing arrangement with the Shado-Pan which grants the grummles protection on the perilous mountain roads from predators, &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s, and hozen in exchange for transporting perishable goods to the great wall. This centuries-old trade route, known as the &lt;a href=\"Burlap%20Trail\"&gt;Burlap Trail&lt;/a&gt;, has been the source of much prosperity for both the Shado-Pan and the grummles.\nSha, Fiends of the heart and soul.\nTen thousand years ago, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, the last Pandaren emperor, sought to rule wisely, that he might save Pandaria from ruin. To better his people, Shaohao undertook a grand quest to strip away his own negative emotions. He succeeded, and the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;doubt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; and still more that he plucked from himself was imprisoned beneath the earth. But it did not lie still. It seeped into the very land Shaohao hoped to protect.\nIn the heart of Pandaria, Shaohao\u2019s darkness \u2013 the Sha \u2013 waited, feeding off every harsh word, angry fist or pang of despair. The Pandaren have trained themselves in compassion, patience, and love of life in order to limit their contribution to the power of the Sha, but with the arrival of violent outsiders on Pandaria, all their care may be for naught.\nIt is not clear if the Sha have an agenda, but there is no doubt that they exist in disharmony with life. Wherever they lurk, they bring and delight in discord and death in a cycle that seems difficult for even the greatest heroes to end. Swords cannot slash doubt. Armor cannot deflect hatred. "}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt; added in .\nArticle.\nSeparated from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; for centuries, the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; meanders the oceans of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Heroes must figure out the cause of the land's illness before the entire island plunges into the abyss!\nThe Wandering Isle.\nLevel 1-10\nSeparated from Pandaria for millennia, the Wandering Isle meanders the oceans of Azeroth. When the weather changes unexpectedly on the Isle and it begins erratically spiraling toward the Maelstrom, the elders at the Temple of Five Dawns request the aid of four elemental spirits to unravel the mystery. Heroes must figure out the cause of the land's illness before the entire island plunges into the abyss!\nPandaren Racial Starting Zone\nThough &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; live in harmony with their native land, wanderlust has gripped a small portion of their hearts for as long as they can remember. To satisfy that wanderlust, the ancient &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt; set out long ago \u2013 on the back of a &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 to explore the world he knew waited beyond Pandaria's shores. Liu Lang made several return trips to his homeland, each time bringing with him stories of the wondrous things he'd seen; each time, Shen-zin Su, the turtle that carried Liu Lang through the waters, seemed to become larger and larger.\nLiu Lang has passed on, but his followers still depart Pandaria's shores to see the world. The turtle has grown massive, the size of a small city. It's here, on the \"Wandering Isle\" that young, eager Pandaren train and learn, engaging in mock combat against one another and mastering the tools and forms of martial arts.\nLife on the Wandering Isle is pacific and enlightening until the day the Wandering Isle travels through the seas near Azeroth's Maelstrom. The ground becomes unstable, crops wilt, and Shen-zin Su seems to wobble in the ocean, drifting in an unsteady pattern that may be a death spiral.\nAs one of the most promising Pandaren wanderers, you'll uncover the true threat to the Wandering Isle. But the problem facing the great turtle has several potential solutions, and the students of the isle are split on how to handle it. Do they act immediately (but rashly) to save their home before all is lost? Do they deliberate, attempting to find a safer (but slower) way to heal the land and deal with the dangers in their midst?\nYour decision will shape the future, and set the path of the Pandaren in a changed world.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThe Jade Forest &amp; Temple of the Jade Serpent.\nLevel 85-86\nAfter a devastating naval battle, survivors from both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; wash up onto the tree-lined shores of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Surrounded by wilderness, they must form alliances with the natives if they wish to survive. Along the way, they will meet the pandaren... along with some of the greater powers that protect and shape Pandaria.\nAfter a naval battle between the Horde and the Alliance leaves the survivors stranded on the beaches of Pandaria, rescue parties of those factions' elite soldiers set out explore the mysterious, fog-shrouded island. You are among them.\nAs one of the first explorers to set foot on Pandaria, you'll begin your investigation in the midst of the emerald &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; and coastal marsh of the Jade Forest, where two of Pandaria's most prominent races make their homes. The &lt;a href=\"monkey\"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"Hozen\"&gt;Hozen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;-people thrive near the rivers of the Jade Forest, and your first encounters with them are likely to be hostile. Yet, ultimately, your lack of allies and guidance in this unfamiliar land will make befriending the natives your only option.\nTemple of the Jade Serpent.\nIn the eastern heart of the Jade Forest, the races of Pandaria maintain a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, a venerable spirit of wisdom and foresight. Here, overlooking Pandaria's coast, the myriad races of the continent come to meditate for insight or peruse the living archives of the temple's library, where Pandaria's history is literally brought to life. The temple is particularly sacred to the fish-like Jinyu, who use its scrying pool to serve as their eyes and ears throughout the continent.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nValley of the Four Winds &amp; Stormstout Brewery.\nLevel 86-88\nA tranquil plain of lush farmland, bordered by dense mysterious jungles along the south and impassible mountains to the north. The &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt; is considered the \"breadbasket\" of Pandaria, but the year's harvest is in jeopardy and a terrible malaise has overcome the pandaren that live along the coast. The valley is also the home of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and his niece &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt; hope to journey to discover the whereabouts of their long-lost ancestors.\nIn the golden and green fields of the Valley of the Four Winds, Pandaria sees to the hunger and thirst of its people. Sizeable corn and lotus crops are watered by ingenious agricultural advances and cared for by the &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt;, Pandaren &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s who feed a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;growing empire&lt;/a&gt;. Farms, ranches and marketplaces dot a land of rolling plains and vine-covered boughs.\nIt is here that Brewmaster Chen Stormstout arrives after a life spent traveling, first on the Wandering Isle and then throughout &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside Alliance and Horde explorers, he'll discover the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"Stormstout\"&gt;Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, and strive to live up to his family's name and legacy of peerless brewing. But not all is idyllic within the Valley. The ravenous appetites of long-toothed &lt;a href=\"Virmen\"&gt;Virmen&lt;/a&gt; and simian Hozen endanger crops and farmers alike\u2026and threaten the entire continent with starvation. If you can stop these animalistic pillagers, you'll be able to grab a plow and a shovel and cultivate Pandaria's fallow farmlands once again. Meanwhile, as farmers worry over their harvests and the hunger in their bellies, the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;great wall&lt;/a&gt; built to keep the violent &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt; race out of the Valley begins to show its first cracks\u2026\nStormstout Brewery.\nFor generations, the Stormstout Brewery has been a font of joy for the citizens of Pandaria, pumping out an endless-seeming supply of delicious and refined beverages without appearing to break stride. The Stormstout family has enjoyed and supported the Brewery's continued significance, and kept diligent watch over their recipes and the perfection of their stills \u2013 until today. In the absence of any more able Stormstout, management of the building has recently fallen to &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Gao\"&gt;Uncle Gao Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;\u2026to the detriment of everyone who has ever enjoyed a cold drink. On Gao's \"watch,\" loathsome Virmen have broken through the brewery's massive oak doors and ravaged the Stormstout's stores of rice and barley; local Hozen have also begun cracking into casks left and right, spurring a destructive revel that threatens to devastate the Valley's supply. As if that weren't enough, the brew itself has begun to spoil \u2013 in the worst way possible.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nKrasarang Wilds.\nLevel 86-88\nThe &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; along Pandaria's southern coast conceal many ancient secrets of a lost dynasty that have drawn the attention of &lt;a href=\"prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;-seekers among the Alliance and Horde. The Wilds are also home to the vicious, domineering &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and a more insidious danger still: the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Sha of Despair&lt;/a&gt; is believed to have escaped from its bindings in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, and stifling gloom has begun to blanket the land in its path.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nKun-Lai Summit.\nLevel 87-89\nHigh atop the frigid northern peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; looms the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient training ground protected by an elite force of martial &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, along with the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; itself. Deeper into the mountains is the hideout of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt;: a mysterious order charged with protecting Pandaria from the dark things buried beneath its surface. When the isolated people of Kun-Lai are threatened by &lt;a href=\"marauder\"&gt;marauder&lt;/a&gt;s from the west and a &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt; menace invading its northern shores, they turn to the Alliance and Horde for help.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nTownlong Steppes.\nLevel 89-90\nSeparated from the rest of Pandaria by the Pandaren Wall, the rampaging mantid people of the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Wastes&lt;/a&gt; devour everything in their path in order to build their own &lt;a href=\"Mantid%20Empire\"&gt;crystalline empire&lt;/a&gt; of ruthless warriors and scheming feudal lords. The pandaren are left reeling when the mantid's thousand-year cycle of aggression kicks off a hundred years too early and their greatest warriors burst through the Pandaren Wall. The beleaguered pandaren must now face the worst swarm in recorded history while trying to isolate the cause of the mantid's erratic behavior.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nDread Wastes.\nLevel 89-90\nBeyond the wall, in the dark heart of mantid territory, few pandaren dare to tread. It is here that the mantid &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;empress&lt;/a&gt; holds court from her once-splendid palace. But a dark shadow has crept over the mantid race, and the behavior of the empress has grown erratic. Driven to madness by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, the empress is breeding and unleashing an uncontrolled swarm that threatens to overwhelm the wall and engulf Pandaria. There is hope; even within the mantid race there are &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; who wish to see the Empress overthrown. Ending her reign will require breaching her palace stronghold, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nVale of Eternal Blossoms.\nLevel 90\nThe ancient seat of the pandaren empire has been hidden for generations, shrouded in &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; and walled-off by impassible mountains. The waters of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale&lt;/a&gt; are believed to have mystical powers... which has attracted the attention of ancient enemies as well as power-hungry factions within the Alliance and Horde. What secrets lie buried below this mystical font of power?"}

Applying any enchant, either from an augment item or enchanter, will overwrite any previous enchantment. Temporary effects like rogue poisons, oils, sharpening stones and shaman spells will not erase a permanent augment or enchantment.\nInscriptions.\nMists of Pandaria.\nShoulder inscriptions are now made by the &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; profession. Unlike previous expansions, there is no longer a faction that awards them at a certain reputation level, like Sons of Hodir or Therazane. This was done to avoid forcing all endgame-focused players to grind reputation with that faction.\nScribes can also create augments that they can used themselves that has extra stats.\nCataclysm.\nCataclysm inscriptions are shoulder enchant items rewarded from high level reputation status with &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;.

All inscriptions require level 80, can only be placed on items you own (they cannot be applied through the Trade window), and will soulbind any items that are not already soulbound if applied. The lesser inscriptions cost and the greater inscriptions cost before any factional discounts.\nAlso available are PvP-based inscriptions from &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; vendors for a cost of each:\nOutland.\nInscriptions grant enchants to shoulder armor. They are purchased from &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryer&lt;/a&gt; vendors in their respective banks in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inscription%20of%20Endurance\"&gt;Inscription of Endurance&lt;/a&gt; is also available from &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Darius\"&gt;Apprentice Darius&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"The%20Violet%20Eye\"&gt;The Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; reputation. For the Aldor/Scryer inscriptions, uncommon inscriptions can be purchased for 2 tokens, rare greater inscriptions cost 8 tokens.

Inscriptions can only be placed on items you own (they cannot be applied through the Trade window), and will soulbind any items that are not already soulbound if applied.\nArcanum.\nLore.\nThe first arcanum that came to be were apparently created by the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and stolen by the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; during their conquest of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The elves, well versed in the ways of magic, could not understand why the troll's weapon enchantments of &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; were stronger than the elven magic. As a solution, they stole magic and knowledge from troll spellcasters such as &lt;a href=\"Zanza\"&gt;Zanza&lt;/a&gt; and imbued them into idols to create their own enchantments against the trolls. These enchantments were called \"Arcanum\".\nMists of Pandaria.\nHead enchants were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nCataclysm Arcana cost before the faction discount. They are heirloom items and require level 85. The three primary neutral factions and the Dragonmaw Clan/Wildhammer Clan faction offer arcana at .\nNorthrend.\nNorthrend Arcana cost either before the faction discount for the faction-based arcana or for the arcana purchased from &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; vendors. They are all of rare quality and require level 80. The four primary neutral factions offer arcana at and (as like the primary instance factions in Burning Crusade), while the Alliance Vanguard/Horde Expedition arcana require and the Wintergrasp arcana have no requirement other than control of Wintergrasp itself in order to purchase the arcanum. Arcana can only be placed on items you own (cannot be applied in the trade window), and will also soulbind any items that are not already soulbound if applied.\nOutland.\nOutland arcana are items that grant enchants to head armor. They are all of uncommon quality and require level 70. The reward for being Honored is +20 resistance to a specific school, while the reward for Revered is a pair of stat enchants. Each arcanum is sold for before faction discounts. Arcana can only be placed on items you own (cannot be applied in the trade window), and will also soulbind any items that are not already soulbound if applied. \nClassic.\nLike the lesser arcanum, these items granted an enchant to a head or leg item. They were acquired from Libram drops in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. The libram and various ingredients were turned in to &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt; in the Dire Maul library.\nEach turnin required a libram, a quest item, a &lt;a href=\"Pristine%20Black%20Diamond\"&gt;Pristine Black Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Large%20Brilliant%20Shards\"&gt;Large Brilliant Shards&lt;/a&gt;\nLesser Arcanum.\nLesser arcanum granted an enchant to a head or leg item. They could be acquired from Libram &lt;a href=\"world%20drop\"&gt;world drop&lt;/a&gt;s.

Each augment requires:\nGuards.\nGuards are augments (&lt;a href=\"Ice%20Guard\"&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AShadow%20Guard\"&gt;:Shadow Guard&lt;/a&gt; are acquired from &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; Insignias) that grant a head or leg enchantment giving +10 resistance to a school of magic.\nMantles.\nMantles are augments that grant a shoulder enchantment giving +5 resistance to a school of magic. Nearly all of them can be purchased for after becoming Revered with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and turning in 10 Valor Tokens; the exception is the Chromatic Mantle, which costs and requires Exalted and 25 Valor Tokens. Mantles can only be placed on items you own, and placing one on a non-soulbound item will bind it to you.\nFishing Line.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Test%20Eternium%20Fishing%20Line\"&gt;High Test Eternium Fishing Line&lt;/a&gt; grants +5 Fishing to a fishing rod. It can be acquired by catching &lt;a href=\"Dezian%20Queenfish\"&gt;Dezian Queenfish&lt;/a&gt; and completing &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Fish%20-%20Dezian%20Queenfish\"&gt;Rare Fish - Dezian Queenfish&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Fishing%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Spun%20Truesilver%20Fishing%20Line\"&gt;Spun Truesilver Fishing Line&lt;/a&gt; grants +3 Fishing to a fishing rod. It is one of many possible rewards found in the &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Fishing%20Treasures\"&gt;Bag of Fishing Treasures&lt;/a&gt; from the 2.4 Daily Fishing quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Fishing%20Line\"&gt;Ancient Fishing Line&lt;/a&gt; drops from &lt;a href=\"Slithon%20the%20Last\"&gt;Slithon the Last&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapon Chains.\nWeapon chains are weapon augmentations that decrease the duration of disarm effects on the wielder as well as, in one case, increase parry chance. Weapon chains are created by blacksmiths, similarly to shield spikes and spurs.\nSpurs.\nSpurs are augmentations that are attached to feet items and increase mounted speed. At this time, there is only one form of spur; &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Spurs\"&gt;Mithril Spurs&lt;/a&gt;, which increases mounted speed by 4%. These are made by blacksmiths and since 2.4.2, do not need to be attached by blacksmiths."}

They consist of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, the Red Crane, &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Ox, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger, and &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, the Jade Serpent.\nTemples.\nEach Celestial possesses a temple dedicated to them.\nBackground.\nEarly history.\nMuch like the other &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, Chi-Ji, Niuzao, Xuen, and Yu'lon emerged from the great enclaves of life created by &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; during the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They were drawn to and gathered near the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and Freya noticed that these four shared a deep commitment to peace and wisdom. She knew their compassion would aid the region well. One day, the Keeper came to the celestials with concern in her heart. There was a great darkness in the north, and she believed a confrontation was near. She gave them her &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping. Freya never returned, and Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent, vowed to keep the staff safe.\nUnder their care, many different life forms emerged near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Among them were the wise &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt;, the mischievous &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, and the peaceful &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. They worshipped the August Celestials, and in return, the spirits offered them knowledge and guidance. For a time, there was peace.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt;, 15,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, numerous races settled in the lands surrounding the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. This emergence of life piqued the interest of the four Wild Gods, and though they were troubled by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;'s constant warfare, they grew to enjoy watching the other races flourish. One race in particular, the wise &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, developed close ties with Xuen and his fellow Wild Gods due to their peaceful nature. Referring to the four Wild Gods as the \"August Celestials\", the pandaren developed a system of worship and philosophy centered around the powerful beings.\nThe Thunder King's conquest.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; would seize Pandaria from the celestials. &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; attempted to protect the people of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; from the Thunder King's rule. The battle ended with Xuen's defeat and imprisonment. &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt; also faced the Mogu in combat, but failed was imprisoned as well. &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; was captured and used to mock the despairing Pandaren slaves. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; was struck down by Lei Shen's lightning, only surviving by transferring her essence into a jade statue of herself in &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe celestials would build temples to train monks in their respective styles after the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;Pandaren revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Niuzao emphasized fortitude in his teachings, the strength to endure any hardship. Xuen taught strength and how physical prowess was not the same as true inner strength. Chi-Ji espoused the importance of hope, even in the darkest of times. Yu'lon spoke of the wisdom of knowing when, and when not, to act.\nThe Burdens of Shaohao.\nAfter being crowned ruler of Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; received a prophecy from a &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Waterspeaker\"&gt;Waterspeaker&lt;/a&gt; that showed a &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;disasterous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. Shaohao then traveled to the four corners of Pandaria, receiving wisdom from each of the Celestials that would help him overcome his negative emotions, become one with the land, and save his people. He learned to conquer his &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;doubt&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;despair&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;hatred&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;. Believed to now be a being of complete harmony by all, including himself, he used his newfound power to withdraw Pandaria from the world before the Great Sundering could destroy it. However, even the Celestials did not know this was all the doing of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, who cloaked Pandaria in mists, isolating it and ensuring a future of stagnation for all who lived within. The Celestials would continue doing their best to protect Pandaria from the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; armies for 10,000 years before the Sha of Pride's mist would dissipate following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. \nOpened borders.\nThe Sha of Pride's mist disappeared as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; was continually intensifying under &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, with the former becoming more prideful and tyrannical and the latter becoming more fair under the influence of his &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. As General &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and Admiral &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; led their forces against each other in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the sha primes began to erupt across the continent. \nRestoring balance.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting her servants and priests until killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, as Yu'lon believed they would. Yu'lon proved kind and forgiving toward the outsiders and guided them toward the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes would eventually come across the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, where Chi'ji had succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Sha of Despair&lt;/a&gt;. Aided by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Koro%20Mistwalker\"&gt;Koro Mistwalker&lt;/a&gt;, the Sha of Despair was vanquished and Chi'ji thanked the brave heroes, promising them his support. He would later allow adventurers to participate with his monks in training at the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20Chi-Ji\"&gt;Cradle of Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Xuen would &lt;a href=\"A%20Celestial%20Experience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;become convinced&lt;/a&gt; by the Horde and Alliance that the sha must no longer be contained, but faced and defeated, and that the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; should be opened. After the four celestials united and opened the gates of the Vale, the &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien\"&gt;Shao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; Mogu rushed the vale as well, stealing the three treasures of the Thunder King. The celestials would later grant their blessings to the heroes and the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; to drive them back and kill their leader &lt;a href=\"Zhao-Jin%20the%20Bloodletter\"&gt;Zhao-Jin the Bloodletter&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; continued to use the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;empress&lt;/a&gt; as his puppets against the pandaren, Niuzao was besieged by the Shan'ze Mogu led by the Thunder King's herald &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; received aid from the heroes, freed Niuzao from Shan Bu's grasp, and forced the mantid and mogu back. The celestials (or at least their essences) aided in the fall of the Thunder King during the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Consorts\"&gt;Twin Consorts&lt;/a&gt; battle. After the remaining sha primes, not counting Pride who had yet to reveal itself, were killed, the young &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; sought wisdom from each of the celestials in his quest to better understand how to prepare the world for the coming conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; had ended, the August Celestials joined the heroes and &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; to witness &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; planting a magic tree in the Vale of Eternal Sorrows, providing hope that the vale would one day heal. Speaking with Yu'lon afterward, the player finds that Pandaria will no longer have to live in fear of the seven breaths of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, declaring the threat of the sha to be over.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nSeveral years later, when the final Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed, the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; came under assault by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. All four August Celestials helped to defend the Vale."}

Years of solitude have weighed heavily on Auriaya, and the &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s growing power seems to have destroyed the last shreds of her sanity.\"\nOverview.\nAuriaya patrols the Observation Ring with her four Sanctum Sentries which will ravage their target with a Savage Pounce when engaged. She summons other guardians during the encounter which she commands to disrupt her enemies.\nStrategy.\n10-man.\nPositioning.\nHave your &lt;a href=\"offtank\"&gt;offtank&lt;/a&gt; stand at least 20 yards away from where Auriaya will be tanked. The rest of the raid except for the two tanks and a hunter should stand out of line of sight of Auriaya to ensure the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;sentries&lt;/a&gt; don't pounce them. After the add's are both under control, the raid should move between them, staying grouped up for &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Screech\"&gt;Sonic Screech&lt;/a&gt;. After a fear always group back up.\nThe pull.\nThe pull is the most crucial element to the fight, and it is not uncommon for groups to spend longer learning how to pull than actually learning the fight. The two &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;panther adds&lt;/a&gt; that follow the boss will &lt;a href=\"Pounce\"&gt;Pounce&lt;/a&gt; on the initial aggro target if they are out of &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; range but within &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to not have the 2 adds Pounce anyone, so the pull must be done while both tanks are out of LoS from the boss until she is within melee range.\nA good place for the tanks to stand at the beginning is in the small enclave with the urn to the side of the stairs. Various classes have abilities that can be used to &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; the boss, it is recommended that your group contains at least one of these classes:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;panthers&lt;/a&gt; also buff themselves if they're within close range to each other so splitting them up is highly recommended.\nThe fight.\nKill the two &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;Sentries&lt;/a&gt;. If the off tank is going to pick up the remaining Sentry after his target is dead, they need to be sure not to taunt from outside of melee range because the Sentry will still pounce even after the fight begins. Once the adds are dead, focus on Auriaya until she summons the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt;. Always be sure to have the ranged grouped up, and have the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; \"facing the boss towards the raid.\" That way, melee dpsers behind the boss are the only ones that need to move for &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Screech\"&gt;Sonic Screech&lt;/a&gt;. A well placed &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt; can cover the raid group, main tank, and possibly the melee with this setup.\nHave your dps ready once the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt; spawns. Although it can be taunted, it can't be tanked, and it will jump around all over the place. Having your dps stack on it will keep it in one spot and avoid repeated pounces. Killing it gives you 30 seconds or so to focus solely on Auriaya, but creates a void zone that can cause issues when people are feared through it at low health. Always make sure to try to kill the Feral Defender outside of where your raid is standing to minimize the risk of people running through it while feared. Each time you kill the defender, its damage will be halved, so if you kill it a few times, it will probably be safe to ignore it and focus on the boss.\nAlternating between killing the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt; and killing Auriaya will let you kill her with plenty of time left. If you're going for the achievement , simply repeat this sequence without doing too much &lt;a href=\"dps\"&gt;dps&lt;/a&gt; to Auriaya while waiting for the Feral Defender to repop.\nAlternately, a raid can completely ignore the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt; and solely focus on Auriaya so long as it stays grouped up and has an off tank for the Defender. Even the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt; tank should stay stacked up to prevent pounces. Should a &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt; die to AoE damage simply hug the edge of the resulting void zone so the emerging &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt; has no room to pounce. This method will turn the fight into more of a traditional tank and spank with the added mechanic of running back to the same spot after every fear.\n25-man.\nPositioning.\nYou should have your raid and healers out of &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid being pounced on the pull. Your &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;sentry&lt;/a&gt; tanks should be spread out and be ready to quickly taunt to weaken the sentries. After the pull is made, the kill target sentry can be dragged back to where the dps are to ensure that it does not get significant damage buffs. \nThe pull.\nYou can place a &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Trap\"&gt;Snake Trap&lt;/a&gt; down to where Auriaya will pat, along with various &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;, and the tanks can pick off the snakes and totems. The snakes will keep Auriaya busy for a small bit of time, and also the totems have a small chance of being pounced. It is advisable to have tanks and healers pop &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s on the pull, because two pounces can take down a tank in an instant. For example, you could have a &lt;a href=\"protection\"&gt;prot&lt;/a&gt; paladin pop his &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Protection\"&gt;bubble wall&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Guardian\"&gt;Divine Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, then throw a &lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;frisbee&lt;/a&gt; to pull before quickly moving out of &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;. A priest could also aid with the pull by using &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Suppression\"&gt;Pain Suppression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardian Spirit&lt;/a&gt; on the tank. A good pull should result in minimal pounce damage or potentially none at all. However the pull can often be disastrous, because the tanks may drop quickly from bad &lt;a href=\"RNG\"&gt;RNG&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you have 3 tanks, (1 on Auriaya, 2 on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;sentries&lt;/a&gt;), each sentry tank must tank 2 adds. While the adds are up, those tanks will require lots of healing. With 4 tanks, while you have less dps, you may find the fight more forgiving.\nThe fight.\nYou must quickly burn the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Sentry\"&gt;sentries&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you have 2 tanks tanking the sentries, because the pounces are deadly. If you are having trouble with the initial adds, utilize &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt; and other defensive &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s and trinkets. \nAfter the sentries are down, you'll have a little bit of time to dps Auriaya before she summons her &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Feral Defender&lt;/a&gt;. When the defender spawns, the tanks previously used for sentries must pick him up. However, the defender will jump around, occasionally &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Rush\"&gt;Feral Rush&lt;/a&gt;ing for large amounts of damage. If the Defender does not rush, it will &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Pounce\"&gt;pounce&lt;/a&gt; for ~4-5k and lockout your casting for ~6 seconds (similar to &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt; only longer). If the entire raid stacks up on the tank, the Feral Defender will not jump around, allowing both ranged and melee dps to down it fast. It is advisable to kill the defender a few times to reduce its damage because of the strength of Feral Rush. However, unless you are going for the , killing the Defender 3 to 4 times should be sufficient. It is likely that you will hit the &lt;a href=\"enrage%20timer\"&gt;enrage timer&lt;/a&gt; (10 minutes) if you attempt to kill the Feral Defender all 10 times. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Defender&lt;/a&gt; also spawns a &lt;a href=\"Seeping%20Feral%20Essence\"&gt;void zone&lt;/a&gt; doing 9k damage a second when it dies. The placement of these can be particularly brutal since raid members can be feared into them. The Defender also jumps around; if you kill it while it's jumping, chances are it will drop the void zone in the raid (or worse, on the main tank). When the Defender gets low on health (around 10% &lt;a href=\"hp\"&gt;hp&lt;/a&gt;), your tank should pull it out of the raid, then stun it, and kill it. You should not stun it before it gets low because the stuns have a diminishing return on the defender. If the Defender becomes immune to stuns while you kill it, it may drop a void zone in your raid party from all the jumping around. After killing it 2-3 times on one of the circles, you should move the entire raid to the opposite circle to reduce the chances of being feared into a void zone.\nWhile dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Defender\"&gt;Defender&lt;/a&gt;, you also have to watch out for the &lt;a href=\"Horrifying%20Screech\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Sonic%20Screech\"&gt;Sonic Screech&lt;/a&gt;es. Immediately after a fear, Auriaya will typically cast &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Blast\"&gt;Sentinel Blast&lt;/a&gt;, which will require &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ion or else it will do massive damage to the raid. Because of this, &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; are critical.

He fled to &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the chapel's consecrated ground would help stave off the Scourge's corruption.

With it, he was able to join them in the battle against his father, but he suffered mortal wounds in the battle and perished. Some time after Baron Rivendare left for &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, Aurius was raised as a death knight and took control of the city in his father's absence. He was killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis body was then said to be placed in the crypt, but at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; entered Stratholme to obtain &lt;a href=\"Shadowmane\"&gt;his steed&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins found that his body was gone and the steed was ridden by &lt;a href=\"Raemien%20the%20Soultaker\"&gt;Raemien the Soultaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiven the fact that Shadowmane was ridden by a death knight, Aurius's body was very likely taken by the Scourge and his father.\nQuotes.\nIt is good to see others who fight the Scourge in Stratholme, for it is here they are strongest.\nGreetings. I am Aurius. I was once a paladin of the Silver Hand, but like others whose faith wavered... I fell from grace. The Scourge seduced me and nearly transformed me into a death knight!\nFinally sensing my peril, I fled to this chapel. It is a sacred place where the first paladin, Uther the Lightbringer, was ordained into the order of the Silver Hand.\nLeave me. My wounds are great and I fear they will overtake me. Thank you, &lt;name&gt;. I will die here, but because of you... I'll die in peace.\n\"For his quotes as a boss in Stratholme, see &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

{"id": "18626", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18626", "title": "Auto Shot", "text": "Auto Shot is a basic attack that allows &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to fire their ranged weapons repeatedly until canceled. This will automatically activate when a hunter uses any offensive ranged ability (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Scatter%20Shot\"&gt;Scatter Shot&lt;/a&gt;).\nNotes.\nThis is the bread and butter attack for hunters. Generally a hunter will &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; the mob and then just turn on Auto Shot and use whatever shots they choose (&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt;, etc).\nThe actual icon the player will see for the Auto Shot ability will be the icon for the ranged weapon in use. The icon shown on this page is a placeholder, shown when no ranged weapon is equipped.\nThe 0.5 cast time affects the time between activating this ability and the first shot being fired, or firing the first shot after moving (when Auto Shot will not fire). Between shots, the time only depends on the hunter's weapon speed and haste, just like the auto melee attack.\nAuto Shot has a built-in 15% ranged &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nTips and tactics.\nThe auto-activation when used with any ranged offensive ability can cause you to generate more aggro than you wanted or to break an effect.\nSince it is a spell in itself, attempting to use a macro which activates multiple abilities will prevent one or possibly more than one of the abilities from being activated (in other words, you will receive the error message \"Another action is in progress\").\nThere is a cast time of 0.5 seconds. This is important to keep it in mind because using another special ability can and will cancel out this casting time to reset Auto Shot.\nDue to the 0.5 second cast time on auto-shot, firing a special ability while moving will prevent auto-shot from firing immediately after the special shot goes off. This can be highly helpful when trying to generate aggro on a crowd-controlled mob without breaking the CC."}

If the player is in a part of the game world which they are unable to walk out of (\"stuck\") then the facility will give them some aid. It will perform the following tasks:\nIt is thought that the \"auto unstuck\" feature simply calls the &lt;a href=\"API%20Stuck\"&gt;Stuck()&lt;/a&gt; function, but this is unknown as Stuck() can only be called from secure code.\n\"Auto unstuck\" was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.1.1\"&gt;Patch 1.1.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nActivating auto unstuck.\nTo activate auto unstuck, take the following procedure:\nThis procedure will not open a ticket to a &lt;a href=\"GM\"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; as such, but it will record your location along with your character name, so that &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; can investigate in future and make sure to correct the bug which you have discovered.\nMisuse of auto unstuck.\nIt is well-known that it is possible to misuse auto unstuck. Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.12\"&gt;patch 2.0.12&lt;/a&gt;, players used auto unstuck as a \"second hearthstone\", because it would allow them to teleport to their home location whenever their hearthstone was on cooldown. But since that patch, the auto unstuck activates the hearthstone cooldown, and as discussed above, it does not teleport you to your home location if the hearthstone is on cooldown.\nAnother popular misuse of the hearthstone is to access closed subzones, but such behaviour is almost certainly classed as misuse."}

A special series of bins in the automatic alchemist holds containers for necessary ingredients that allow it to make up to six of any alchemical item before requiring more supplies.

The Horde equivalent of the Silver Covenant are the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, they joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.

However, they ended up being reinstated during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the covenant pledged itself to the cause of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Covenant provided military support to the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed themselves &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; in the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and instead sought to help bridge the gaps between the two factions, starting with reaching out to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; for magical support against &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the elven population of the Kirin Tor underwent something of a split: the portion of the elves who converted to the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; philosophy took up the name \"the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;\", named for their leader, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the only non-human on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; at the time who ensured the Horde a sanctuary within the city.\nConversely, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; members who opposed the notion of allowing the sin'dorei back into the Kirin Tor's ranks formed the Silver Covenant as a precaution against possible treachery from the Sunreavers. Consequently, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; became the base of operations of the Covenant, and later of the Alliance in Dalaran. Its leader, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, however, held no political sway within the city, thus leading to the blood elves officially being readmitted as members of the Kirin Tor.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Covenant controlled the Alliance-exclusive district of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. The guards they employed were &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Guardian%20Mage\"&gt;Silver Covenant guardian mages&lt;/a&gt;, who expelled &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers once they get too close to the Enclave's outer walls.\nThe Silver Covenant wasn't delighted having the Horde in Dalaran, with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; leading the charge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and so they aligned themselves with the Alliance, and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;. This feud was largely fueled by its leader, Vereesa Windrunner, who disapproved of the blood elves, though Vereesa herself had no political sway in the city, while numerous members of &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;the six&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;) vouched for the blood elves' readmission.\nSome of their members joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; as battle mages, now stationed at &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, notably in the &lt;a href=\"arcane%20sanctum\"&gt;arcane sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of the fortress with &lt;a href=\"Vas%20the%20Unstable\"&gt;Vas the Unstable&lt;/a&gt; as their representative. They later represented the Alliance from the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Pavilion\"&gt;Silver Covenant Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, their base of operations staffed by representatives of each race of the faction, in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Later the champions of the Silver Covenant helped fight the forces of the scourge in the Frozen Halls and its Sunreaver counterpart in Dalaran, to restore the magical blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; from its defiled state by the &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Reaver%27s%20Run\"&gt;Sea Reaver's Run&lt;/a&gt;, the strait between Northrend and an island called &lt;a href=\"Hrothgar%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Hrothgar's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Covenant sailed their ships \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Blade\"&gt;The Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wavecrest\"&gt;The Wavecrest&lt;/a&gt;\" on these waters, while the Sunreavers sailed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;The Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Firehawk\"&gt;The Firehawk&lt;/a&gt;\". The ships fought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; back from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;'s main shore and had to slay the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; they kept summoning, with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCataclysm.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Covenant is invited by the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, to join forces with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; against the budding &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; within the city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a number of high elves of the Silver Covenant were present to protect the city. After &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; escaped from Theramore, Vereesa led her soldiers to the western part of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; thought that the Sunreavers were the ones who helped &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; steal the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina mobilized the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces and the Silver Covenant to purge the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; from Dalaran. While Jaina rounded up the Sunreavers who surrendered peacefully, Vereesa sent Alliance agents to prevent the Sunreavers from escaping and neutralize any Horde insurrections or Sunreaver sympathizers who were aiding and abetting their resistance to incarceration. The Silver Covenant is dispatched into the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;, where they round up several bewildered Sunreaver citizens. Soon after, the Covenant comes under attack by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, whose assault on the city includes undoing much of the Silver Covenant's attacks underground, in &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, and in the (now Alliance-controlled) &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Silver Covenant is later seen supporting Jaina Proudmoore's &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; as they vie for control over the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa led the Silver Covenant to &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, pledging their aid to the new leader of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; following their inauguration.\nLater, the Silver Covenant, together with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; force, participated in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nShortly before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Covenant participated in the events of the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, as high elven &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e were present during the conflict to support the Alliance in front of the Horde's capital.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Covenant was seen defending their pavilion at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in Icecrown. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Arcanist\"&gt;Silver Covenant Arcanist&lt;/a&gt; opened a direct portal to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, connecting the pavilion with the Alliance capital.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%27s%20Overlook\"&gt;Windrunner's Overlook&lt;/a&gt; is still the outpost of the Silver Covenant in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, even after Dalaran moved years ago. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; may be back in the Kirin Tor, the Covenant was still watching them like hawks.\nReputation.\nReputation description.\n\"A militant core of high elves that rejects the admission of blood elves into the Kirin Tor.

It is nestled among the &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook%20Hills\"&gt;Silverbrook Hills&lt;/a&gt;, close to &lt;a href=\"Drak%27tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; and just west of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sky%20Logging%20Grounds\"&gt;Blue Sky Logging Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. The town is encircled by a wooden palisade and contains four large towers and a number of loghouses. It is under constant attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Grizzly Hills and began subverting the trappers, they approached the people of Silverbrook and attempted to expand their influence there. At first, the people were reluctant, but over time the cult sympathizers outweighed those that opposed it.\nRecently, the inhabitants have come into contact with both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde has been aggressive to the people of Silverbrook from the start, and the two have clashed in the &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook%20Hills\"&gt;Silverbrook Hills&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance explored a possible pact with the Silverbrook trappers, sending an envoy, &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Ducal\"&gt;Ducal&lt;/a&gt; to the town and assisting the woodsmen with a number of tasks. Eventually, however, Silverbrook's allegiance to the Wolfcult was revealed, starting off a war with the Alliance, too.\nYears later, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers journeyed through &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the town of Silverbrook was still active. He stated that he did not care if the Horde wiped the village out, harboring disdain for their previous Alliance betrayal."}

It is nestled in the northern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; (at the northernmost tip of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;) in their ancestral homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The beauty of the spires and thoroughfares of Silvermoon stand in stark contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, the tainted path that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; tore through the city in his quest for power. Though nearly destroyed by Arthas' attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Silvermoon is once again a thriving city. Most recently, the rebirth of the Sunwell has lifted spirits among the elves, and they have continued to heal Silvermoon's scars in the hopes of returning their beloved capital to its former glory, the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;western half of it&lt;/a&gt; still being in ruins since the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe city of Silvermoon was founded by the exiled &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who had traveled to the northern forests of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; seeking a new homeland thousands of years ago. Using a stolen vial from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, Dath'Remar created the sacred &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, a fount of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power that would be inherently tied to his people for generations to come. Nourished by the arcane energy from the Sunwell, he led the Highborne in the magical construction of their new capital, raising its spires and buildings with their great magical power. The city was constructed primarily out of radiant white stone and adorned in crimson tapestry. The Highborne, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, thus founded the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, with Silvermoon City as its crowning jewel. The country was enchanted to remain in a state of perpetual springtime. Silvermoon itself was constructed over the site of sacred &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; grounds, which earned the elves further enmity from the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; (the highest elven lords in Quel'Thalas), the ruling body of the high elves was also based here. Silvermoon became renowned for its grand libraries and seats of magical learning.\nStrengthened by a Sunwell-empowered shield named &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; (\"Gatekeeper\" in &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;) which interconnected at &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the land, Silvermoon was well-protected from would-be invaders. The elves constructed all manners of arcane indulgences over the years, including &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s to protect their lands, &lt;a href=\"Fel%20crystal\"&gt;crystals&lt;/a&gt; to power their experimentations, and &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Broom\"&gt;brooms&lt;/a&gt; that constantly sweep their streets, which would be useful if anyone could figure out how to make them stop.\nSilvermoon City stood strong for millennia in the face of several conflicts within Quel'Thalas. The &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, perpetrated by the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; (whom the high elves had banished after their exodus to Quel'Thalas), was among the first. Silvermoon established a long-lasting friendship with &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after the war's climax, which lasted for over 2,000 years. Due to their considerable lifespans, it was not uncommon for elves to study magic in Dalaran as well as Silvermoon (some elves claim to have spent several human lifetimes in service to both), though the reverse was less true: Silvermoon gained a reputation for isolationism over the years, a consensus emerging among many high elves that exposing the humans to magic was a mistake to begin with.\nFrom its founding to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; (a period of roughly 7,000 years), Silvermoon had never fallen.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, on the condition that the orcs help displace the elves from Quel'Thalas. Silvermoon itself was left relatively unscathed thanks to Ban'dinoriel, which erected a magical barrier over the city making it impervious to the Horde's dragon fire, though the trolls launched a heavy offensive into &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; and in some cases came close to the capital. The city also had the protection the &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestones&lt;/a&gt; provided, whose mysteries proved difficult even for the practiced orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s to decipher. The Amani had spent many years trying to torture information regarding the runestones out of captured elves in the hope of using them to subvert Silvermoon's defenses, to no avail.\nKing Anasterian held court in &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Spire\"&gt;Sunstrider Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the stage where he and the Convocation swore to end the Amani remnants once and for all. Furthermore, Anasterian reluctantly pledged Silvermoon's strength to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, due in part to Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; collecting on the debt Anasterian owed his bloodline from the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of Alliance forces, the elves pushed the invaders back from Silvermoon and successfully dispersed the orcs and Amani.\nDespite this victory, the high elves and their allies entered into a period of mutual coldness after the war's end. Seeing little value in remaining part of the Alliance (and reasoning that the Alliance needed his people more than his people needed the Alliance), Anasterian seceded his nation on the grounds of poor leadership on the humans' end, which he claimed led to unnecessary violence within his borders. Silvermoon thus went back into seclusion, its people issued with edicts to enforce this withdrawal.\nThird War.\nSilvermoon remained relatively peaceful for years following the Second War, though this was not to last. Named the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, a massive &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army under the command of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, fresh from laying &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to waste, marched to Quel'Thalas in order to defile the Sunwell. After tearing through Eversong and overcoming the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;' attempts to hold back his advance, Arthas and his armies reached Silvermoon and demanded the elves open their gates and allow him passage. Refusing to surrender, Silvermoon's defenders rallied under the command of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, who took over the defense of Silvermoon in the fallen ranger-general &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s place. The archers, &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;, priests, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawks&lt;/a&gt; did what they could to ward off the undead, though they were faced with impossible odds. With the help of the great traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas successfully dispelled Ban'dinoriel and left Silvermoon vulnerable to attack. Knowing the city would not hold for much longer, Belo'vir had &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Archmage Rommath&lt;/a&gt; evacuate as many civilians as he could, and the remaining soldiers left to make a stand with King Anasterian and the bulk of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilvermoon fell soon after their departure. The city was sacked, overrun with undead, and set ablaze. Its fires and smoke could be seen from Quel'Danas.\nArthas succeeded in his goal, defiling the Sunwell and bringing forth the lich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; from its tainted remains. With no more reason to linger, he left Quel'Thalas in ruins, leaving behind large pockets of undead with an undead Dar'Khan for a commander. The war's outcome was devastating: 90% of the high elves had been slain, including King Anasteriasn, Belo'vir, Sylvanas, and the entire Convocation. Ranger Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; gathered as many survivors as he could, and took over part of Silvermoon (&lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;The Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;) to serve as a point of congregation for others who had survived the attack. Rommath also soon returned to search for the living, clearing out groups of Scourge with his powerful magics.\nRise of the blood elves.\nFollowing the decimation of the high elves, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; rushed back to his people in Quel'Thalas. Arriving in Silvermoon, Kael paid his respects to his father -- whose body had been returned to the city -- and organized a strike team of fighters to help destroy the tainted Sunwell, now pulsating with tainted energies that threatened to destroy both the elves and land itself. Returning to Silvermoon triumphantly, Kael renamed his people the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of their many fallen brethren. Their fallen king, Anasterian, was cremated on a funeral pyre in the &lt;a href=\"Bazaar\"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nKael took several of his most powerful followers to do battle with the Scourge in Lordaeron and commanded the great ranger &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard the kingdom in his absence and to find a cure for the elves' innate addiction to magic, which had become apparent in the wake of the well's destruction. The blood elves back in Quel'Thalas made little progress with this goal, drained and exhausted without the Sunwell for sustenance. The already overstretched &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; also made little dent in the remaining &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; pockets. However, this one-sided struggle was soon to take an unexpected turn.\nReclamation.\nFollowing the events of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunwell%20Trilogy\"&gt;The Sunwell Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\", Lor'themar Theron and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; were approached by a contingent of &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; sent back to Quel'Thalas on the order of Kael'thas. Led by Rommath, the magi shared with their people the radical new teachings advocated by Kael'thas (and by extension, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;), leading to the weary blood elves becoming reinvigorated. Under Rommath's command, the magisters quickly went about reclaiming and rebuilding much of Silvermoon City \"almost overnight,\" their great magical powers making quick work of the Scourge.\nSilvermoon City was reconstructed in an elaborate manner, once more becoming a beacon of magic and power in the Eastern Kingdoms. The towering spires of Silvermoon rose skyward once again, and the entire eastern section of Silvermoon has been wholly reclaimed by the sin'dorei. The western portion, however, remains lost for the time being, though the blood elves have recently turned their attention to healing it too.\nA great deal of demonic energy has been used to fully empower the city. Chained crystals, full to the top with harnessed magic, now dot the city and power up all the various magical contrivance, including many floating spires and &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s. Since the blood elves are cut off from the rest of civilization by the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; has been made connecting Silvermoon to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilvermoon is ruled by the Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, who holds court with the &lt;a href=\"ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilvermoon also housed an imprisoned &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; for a time, whose powers were drained by the magisters in order to empower the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;'s command. However, this was not to last: Prince Kael'thas, who had sworn loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, briefly attacked Silvermoon with his &lt;a href=\"felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; servitors and stole M'uru from the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. \nMagically-automated guardians constantly remind everyone in the city of the blood elves' leader and savior, Prince Kael'thas, by reciting lines of carefully-worded propaganda. This helps prevent the blood elven denizens of the city from forgetting to whom they owe their absolute loyalty. However &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.0\"&gt;when Kael'thas has betrayed his people&lt;/a&gt;, the Arcane Guardians have been changed to reflect Kael'thas' betrayal and give propaganda referring to Lor'themar Theron as the savior of the blood elves instead. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s critiqued by &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Vranesh\"&gt;Champion Vranesh&lt;/a&gt; no longer praise Kael'thas as the \"Sun King\".\nWith the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, a bright future lied ahead for Quel'Thalas. The blood elves turned their attention to healing the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;western half&lt;/a&gt; of Silvermoon and restoring the city to its former glory.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20%28Silvermoon%20City%29\"&gt;The Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; building was opened.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAn artifact from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; was shipped to Silvermoon by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who tasked the blood elves with learning more of it. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; are sent to Silvermoon to correspond with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; himself, who had set &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to the task of deducing its modus operandi. Lor'themar also called in the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, to lend his aid to the experiment, which nearly resulted in a &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; being released in the city.\nIt was stored under the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, where several of Rommath's magisters (once seen draining M'uru) were magically probing it. In a conversation with the player, Rommath confirmed that the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s (the green crystals) once around Silvermoon have since been removed. Later, following the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the escaped Sunreavers were funneled back to the safety of Silvermoon.\nA portal was created between the city and the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nThe city was visited by &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; who found &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, living in an apartment. He left Silvermoon to join the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, portals were created between Silvermoon and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elven forces arrived to &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt; from the city.\nSilvermoon and Suramar maintained good relations following the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; rebellion and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power. Lor'themar, seeing much in common between the sin'dorei and shal'dorei kingdoms, invited their new leader to Silvermoon for a visit; Thalyssra soon after pledged Suramar to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The regent also entertained &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had come in an attempt to convince Silvermoon to leave the Horde and ally with the Alliance, but this offer was rejected. Alleria instead sought out &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;exiles&lt;/a&gt; from Silvermoon who had been banished for dabbling in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, which the blood elf leaders consider a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nEach year, Silvermoon holds a ceremony of remembrance for those who fell during the Scourge invasion. Lor'themar summoned a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;sin'dorei champion&lt;/a&gt; to undertake it, taking a lantern imbued with the light of the Sunwell to key locations throughout the kingdom to reenact the defense of Quel'Thalas and honor the sacrifices made in its darkest hour. The ceremony begins and ends in Silvermoon, where champions are awarded the heritage of the sin'dorei regalia by the regent lord.\nExploring the Eastern Kingdoms.\nSilvermoon was visited by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; in their cartography of the Eastern Kingdoms; the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; gave the pair permission to visit Horde lands unaccosted. Fairwind reflected on the blood elves' history and marveled at the beauty of their city, grateful to have visited it. Shaw traveled on to the Isle of Quel'Danas to see the Magisters' Terrace.\nAppearance.\nSilvermoon, like most of Quel'Thalas, borrows heavily from the style. Its extravagances are copious and the city blends the natural and the magical together, with many open plots of grass and trees (many of which are styled, presumably magically, in impossible ways) around the city. Silvermoon has many statues within its walls, the most common depicting &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and a regal female of unknown identity. Others depict hooded female &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and poised &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magistrixes&lt;/a&gt;. The city favors golds, whites, and reds, as it did 7,000 years ago.\nSilvermoon's banner is a gold phoenix on a red background. Many variations of this exist.\nThe city's appearance could be seen as reflective of the blood elves' own psyche. The blood elves are trapped in a struggle with their hunger for magic, caught between mastering this desire or letting it master them, and the duality of Silvermoon reflects their inner struggle. One side ruined, one side restored to its former glory; magnificent on the outside, lingering darkness on the inside. However, the truly interesting insights reveal themselves when players look closer at what is going on in Silvermoon City. Beyond the luscious avenues, behind the rich billowing curtains, lie dark and gloomy interiors, and those who explore the other side of Silvermoon City may find that the city's beautiful facade serves only to hide the true, more-sinister side of the city.\nEmpowerment.\nIt was mentioned in a behind-the-scenes \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" interview that Silvermoon's architecture was originally held together by magic from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and that when the Sunwell was destroyed, the buildings began to deteriorate into what we now see in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ruins of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. It was said that without the Sunwell's great energies, the magi had to rebuild the city using demonic magics. Whether this is still the case with the Sunwell restored and the &lt;a href=\"What%27s%20in%20the%20Box%3F\"&gt;removal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"fel%20crystal\"&gt;fel crystal&lt;/a&gt;s is unclear, if unlikely.\nNotable characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; is the Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas in the absence of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and the current leader of the blood elves on Azeroth. With Kael'thas' betrayal and eventual demise, Lor'themar has seemingly become the sole ruler of his people.\n&lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; is Silvermoon's new Ranger-General, and is the blood elves' military commander on Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of all blood elf magi on Azeroth, and was a fiercely loyal servant to Kael'thas.\n&lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; that the blood elves captured and was the source of the blood knight's power in the Light. He could previously be found beneath the paladin trainers area, where it was watched over by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, who is behind the idea, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who volunteered to be the first ever blood knight. Since &lt;a href=\"2.4\"&gt;2.4&lt;/a&gt;, M'uru has been kidnapped and taken to the Sunwell Plateau where he serves as a 25-man raid boss, and Liadrin is no longer present, instead of appearing in a periodic dialogue scene that occurs in Shattrath with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilvermoon is uniquely adorned by a number of interactive lore events, most of which allude to the politics and factions of Quel'Thalas and its people. Several &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; can be seen speaking of their order's predicament and future, such as Initiates &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Emeline\"&gt;Emeline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Vranesh\"&gt;Champion Vranesh&lt;/a&gt; can be seen patrolling the city, eliciting the respect of the guard force and showing a low opinion for his &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; brethren. In turn, the Farstriders can be seen discussing their own outlook, referencing more healthy methods by which to keep the country safe.\nGeography.\nThe inhabited half of the city is arranged into separate but linked areas that each carry a unique feel.\nPoints of interest.\nThe following points of interest are to be found in Silvermoon City:\nThe Shepherd's Gate.\nThe Shepherd's Gate is the main (and only) conventional entrance to Silvermoon, decorated by a towering statue depicting the likeness of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. An equally large entrance paves the way to the western half of Silvermoon, though this leads only to the town of &lt;a href=\"Falconwing%20Square\"&gt;Falconwing Square&lt;/a&gt;; the western portion of the city itself having yet to be reclaimed. The Shepherd's Gate overlooks much of Quel'Thalas, with colorful gardens to its front and a bulk of blood elven guards to its back.\nThough the Shepherd's Gate holds the distinction of being the only practical entrance to Silvermoon, two others are still in existence: the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; at the back of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;royal palace&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a teleport to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and a massive gate to the west of the Bazaar. However, said gate is closed and guarded, presumably due to the drawbacks a back entrance could prove, and the fact that the blood elves' control of western Silvermoon is perhaps not yet strong enough to warrant another gate to match the Shepherd's. \nThe Walk of Elders.\nThe Walk of Elders offers the first glimpse to the blood elves' beauteous capital. Magical ornaments adorn the streets, while the autumn-touched trees found within Quel'Thalas grow here, too, albeit on a smaller scale, and clash neatly with the rest of the city and its red, gold, and autumn-bathed complexion. It is also perhaps the first sighting of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20guardian\"&gt;Arcane Guardians&lt;/a&gt;; at least, ones under proper control and not prone to malfunction. The hulking robotic constructs will urge the citizens of Silvermoon to remain law-abiding and encourage happiness in addition to singing praises for Silvermoon's leader, the regent of Quel'Thalas: &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;.\nRows of benches shrouded in crimson curtains are slashed across the Walk of Elders, perfect for a moment of respite. The Walk of Elders is also the central point of the city, connecting its neighbors to the east, north, and west. It houses several profession trainers, and offers a back entrance to a &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt;' lounge named the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Loom\"&gt;Mana Loom&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern court of &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Exchange\"&gt;The Royal Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Also of note is the presence of the sin'dorei's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allies in the Walk of Elders; &lt;a href=\"Harene%20Plainwalker\"&gt;Harene Plainwalker&lt;/a&gt; on hand for &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; training and &lt;a href=\"Gez%27li\"&gt;Gez'li&lt;/a&gt; for shaman, just north of &lt;a href=\"Velaani%27s%20Arcane%20Goods\"&gt;Velaani's Arcane Goods&lt;/a&gt;. The celebrated &lt;a href=\"The%20Tauren%20Chieftains\"&gt;Tauren Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; are currently within the blood elven capital too, resting in a spire just east of the Walk's entrance and right of the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Registry\"&gt;Silvermoon Registry&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bazaar.\nThe Bazaar is the primary trading area of the city, housing one of its two sets of &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction houses&lt;/a&gt; along with all of the other practical essentials any sin'dorei could need: an armory, a weapons' barracks, a &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; and a collection of other useful services among them. The Bazaar also houses one of the several &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inns&lt;/a&gt; around the city, named &lt;a href=\"Wayfarer%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Wayfarer's Rest&lt;/a&gt; (a popular spot for &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt;), with enough elaborately-conjured and appetizing food and drink to sate one's hunger and thirst for as long as need be.\nOutside, a colossal fountain neatly nestles itself in the center of the Bazaar, while a gathered crowd on the far-western zone tends to two dissidents, whose anti-&lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; rhetoric takes a conspicuous change in tone after one such magister casts a spell on the pair. &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20Tyren\"&gt;Conjurer Tyren&lt;/a&gt; also begins his rounds in the Bazaar, lighting up the sky with several magical indulgences.\nAlso of wry amusement in the Bazaar is the &lt;a href=\"Keelen%27s%20Trustworthy%20Tailoring\"&gt;Keelen's Trustworthy Tailoring&lt;/a&gt; shop, whose neat work appears to be a dubiously kind front after visiting the &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnomes&lt;/a&gt; employed beneath its main lounge. &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Finery\"&gt;Silvermoon Finery&lt;/a&gt; is on hand for any cloth-related needs a sin'dorei may have.\nThe Royal Exchange.\nThe Royal Exchange is a larger variation of the Bazaar, though perhaps without the dedicated trading theme. Though with both an auction house and a bank, the Royal Exchange is large enough to house a number of other points of interest, in addition to its glittering fountain surrounded by domesticated cats, rabbits, and magically-imbued broomsticks to sweep the streets. \nThe magisters have a room of their own on show, housing a demonic crystal that several magisters can be seen siphoning now and again. The blood elven &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; also has its base of operations here, though its denizens maintain that their vault, treasure, artifacts and secrets are not -- perhaps not even on \"this plane of existence.\" On the opposite side are the jewelrcrafting trainers, who were for a long while the only ones on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMurder Row.\nAs the name attests, Murder Row is a more sinister take on Silvermoon, though its adjacent inn to The Royal Exchange would not suggest it. On the other side, however, lies the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; masters and mistresses of the sin'dorei. \nWithin &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20%28Silvermoon%20City%29\"&gt;The Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; resides numerous blood elven warlocks, and an eerie collage of demonic crystals kept out of sight of the general public. Here, warlocks drain their power effortlessly, surrounded by those of like-minded goals. Above is the rogues' section of the city, seemingly spearheaded by Instructor Cel; housing a considerable training ground and a chance to stock up on poisons and other rogue essentials for trips out of Quel'Thalas.\nAn interesting observation in Murder Row is of the warlock &lt;a href=\"Keyanomir\"&gt;Keyanomir&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"succubus\"&gt;succubus&lt;/a&gt; minion will only come out after dark.\nFarstriders' Square.\nFarstriders' Square is the section of the city allocated to the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;, though the two groups seem to keep their distance. Though the main Farstrider lodges are found outside of Silvermoon (such as &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt;), they have a humble lodge named &lt;a href=\"The%20Rangers%27%20Lodge\"&gt;The Rangers' Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in the northern section. The Blood Knights hold the more formidable section of the city, however, from the intimidating &lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the Blood Knights make their presence known, under heavy guard and with most of their leadership found within; notably missing only their matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain another source of power for the order. The Hall of Blood also houses Silvermoon's battlemasters, &lt;a href=\"Alenjon%20Sunblade\"&gt;Alenjon Sunblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irissa%20Bloodstar\"&gt;Irissa Bloodstar&lt;/a&gt;. Beneath once resided the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, though following his abduction to the Sunwell only &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, several magisters, and Liadrin's second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Lord Solanar Bloodwrath&lt;/a&gt; remain there.\nOutside is the main practice ground, where Farstriders hone their skills and heroes can follow suit, thanks to the training dummies. The blood elven warriors stand vigil over the square, spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"Alsudar%20the%20Bastion\"&gt;Alsudar the Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; trainers are also found within the square, surrounded by arbalests.\nCourt of the Sun.\nThe Court of the Sun is the northernmost area of Silvermoon, excluding the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;royal palace&lt;/a&gt;. Decorated by the largest of the three fountains within the city at its center (a practical bathing house in terms of sheer size), the Court of the Sun looms over both Farstriders' Square and Murder Row. In addition to its beauty, it also houses the remaining profession trainers within the city, including &lt;a href=\"reforging\"&gt;reforging&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the court, the full glory of the towering spires of Silvermoon can be seen -- not least of all surging skywards from the royal palace ahead. \nSunfury Spire.\nSunfury Spire is the royal palace of Silvermoon, where the regent lord of Quel'Thalas &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; holds court with the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spire was built after the previous royal palace, named &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Spire\"&gt;Sunstrider Spire&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed during the Scourge attack. A thick bridge with a crimson-red royal carpet paves way to the royal palace, with two large rows of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardians&lt;/a&gt; standing vigil outside. Decorated by two towering statues, a number of Quel'Thalas emblems, and the considerably large guard force within, the Sunfury Spire is unmistakable.\nTo the left after entering the spire lies the sin'dorei priesthood trainers, while the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; train new members of the order to the right; the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; found within the magisters' portion of the spire too. Straight ahead lies the leaders of Quel'Thalas, surrounded by their &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; force. Behind Lor'themar sits his cobalt-colored throne, a large phoenix symbol fastened to its back.\nBehind the royal palace lies the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Silvermoon%20City%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, where teleportation to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; await.\nTravel connections.\nFlight.\n\"Note: Silvermoon can be reached via flight path from the rest of the Eastern Kingdoms if you have met the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; flight master, &lt;a href=\"Georgia\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, at Light's Hope Chapel.\"\nIn the RPG.\nUnlike the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Woods\"&gt;Blackened Woods&lt;/a&gt;, the former elven capital of Silvermoon is not as devastated. The city almost resembles its old splendor as the living plants and rock used to construct the capital proved immune to the fires and destruction. Trees and buildings still stand and if you walked the city streets you would be surprised as how clean the place appears. Aside from the occasional body sprawled across the cobblestones, one could almost imagine that a war was never fought there.\nSilvermoon's ruined buildings were constructed of white stone and living plants. Slender branches and ivy snake across walls. Many of the plants are dead now, the buildings smashed and the spires toppled. Nevertheless, much still remains intact. The city is not as ruined as one would suspect and is surprisingly nearly devoided of rotting corpses, bloodstains and similar filth. Silvermoon, however, is a deceptive death trap.\nUndead elven guardians and ghosts wander the streets and towers, ensuring that no more harm befalls their city. No living beings inhabit this region, though the lure of elven treasure draws adventurers from far and wide. The &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Spire\"&gt;Sunstrider Spire&lt;/a&gt; palace still hides the legendary Sunstrider treasury.\nSilvermoon was the high elven capital for centuries since the Quel'dorei traveled to this land from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Like the rest of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, enemies despoiled and razed the city in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, though Silvermoon survived the flames. &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces held the city for a time but abandoned it after depleting it of its resources. Silvermoon now reminds us of everything that was once noble and mystical about the high elves \u2014 and how that nobility died.\nSpeculation.\nEtymology.\nSilvermoon's name is peculiar in that the elves, who had renounced their nocturnal ways and embraced the sun, would go on to name their capital city after the moon. Why this is, when even their naming conventions changed to incorporate the sun and brightness/light over the moon and darkness, is unknown. It's possible Dath'Remar felt a twinge of sentimentality for the culture he was in the process of changing and chose to keep but one prominent reminder of where the Highborne had come from. \nIt was mentioned in the \" that Silvermoon became a \"shining monument to the memory of the (Highborne's) ancient empire.\" This might imply that it was named to emphasize that connection; the Highborne were moon-worshipping night elves during the height of their old empire.\nSilvermoon's name may have been inspired by Silverymoon, a capital city in the lore.\nWestern Silvermoon.\nIt has been widely speculated whether or not the western portion of Silvermoon could, in time, be reclaimed by the blood elves. With the much-reduced &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence in &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, and the efficiency of which the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; were able to rebuild eastern Silvermoon, it could (in theory) stand to reason that the other half may be salvaged in time, if not via the powers of the magisters, but via the presence of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; shamans and druids in the city. Several blood elves have made mention of the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; proving an obstacle beyond healing, however."}

The land ranges from fairly flat to hilly, and is nestled among even taller mountains. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; borders the forest to the south, the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, while &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; lays to the north. &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; serves as Silverpine's eastern border.\nSilverpine Forest is the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; homeland, and the southernmost point where effects of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the plant life. This woodland is haunted and wild, characterized by its tall, silver-barked pines towering over grassy knolls. The forest is eerily silent save for the occasional unnatural howling echoing among the trees. Mossy overhangs shiver in the cold breeze, and the trees are all sickly or dying. Dilapidated farmsteads and abandoned mines dot the land, home now to the darker denizens of the woods.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; control the northern forest and that region serves as the staging area for their armies that march into the besieged &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. What remains of the human population retains control of the southern forest, but they are desperate and their forces thinly stretched. Since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the spread of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; curse, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; has decided to strike back at the Forsaken after their first invasion, openly fighting against their oppressors.\nThough the territory belongs to the Forsaken, their claim was disputed by the wizards of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt; and the raised Gilnean noblemen that now have entrenched themselves along with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; remnants in the &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;'s former fortress, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of this dispute, by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken had attempted control over Silverpine; including turning Shadowfang Keep into a bio-weapons facility. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the region became a prime target for the Alliance, claiming some parts of the forest as well as attacking Forsaken outposts throughout the region, with the Bloodfang pack taking command of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after this, the Bloodfang pack claimed Shadowfang Keep, retaining control of it by the end of the war.\nSome &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt;s left Gilneas after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and now roam Silverpine.\nHistory.\n2,600 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; escaped from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to spread his misery across &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, including Silverpine Forest. On the edge of the area, he brought a blight of locusts to destroy the trees and ravage the cropland. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; went to attack him, but the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; overpowered them and killed &lt;a href=\"Ethylar\"&gt;Ethylar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe southern parts of Silverpine Forest, including &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, were originally part of the kingdom of Gilneas before the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; cut them off. The road that goes through Silverpine Forest was usually used by dignitaries traveling to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, and was used by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; when they escaped to Lordaeron after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. It was described as one of the great wonders of Lordaeron.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; invaded the woods, making quick progress until their campaign ground to halt in the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The number of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; was small at first, but it increased over time and they did not flag. Fearing it would break, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; opened the gate and Gilnean soldiers poured from Gilneas into Silverpine Forest. The Scourge, however, defeated the soldiers and raised them into undeath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; threat was contained for millennia, until &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; managed to pull the wolf-beasts from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Summoned by order of King Genn Greymane, the worgen were used to battle the Scourge forces stationed in front of the wall. Yet the feral creatures soon spread their curse throughout the human population of Silverpine Forest, infecting Gilnean soldiers stationed beyond the Greymane Wall. In order to contain this epidemic, Greymane abandoned Silverpine Forest in order to keep the curse at bay, though before long the affliction had advanced through the legendary barrier and was gradually eating away at Gilneas's humanity.\nDriven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the newly dubbed '&lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;', situated above the tiny hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;. He has created a &lt;a href=\"wolfcult\"&gt;wolfcult&lt;/a&gt; in order to spread the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; and expand his worgen family.\nThe Scourge had also set fire to the crops and the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; began to affect the trees, making them pale and lifeless with disease.\nAfter the war, with Lordaeron destroyed, the wizards of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; busy rebuilding their home and the citizens of Gilneas having locked themselves away behind the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, no one was left to take care of the forest.\nThough many pockets of Alliance resistance were scattered across Lordaeron, the largest group had gathered in Silverpine Forest after the Third War. &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;This force&lt;/a&gt; was led by Grand Marshal &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly seized large swaths of land and began preparing for their journey to the ruins of Dalaran.\nA &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; expedition under &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived at Lordaeron through Silverpine Forest, looking for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. They soon joined with Kael and his blood elves and worked together to get through the forest to Dalaran. Later, a fight between a temporary alliance of night elves and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and Illidan against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; also took place in the woods, in an attempt to rescue Tyrande from the undead monstrosities.\nSilverpine Forest was also used as a meeting place between the &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the trio of nathrezim, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe forest became occupied by the Forsaken, minions of &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt;, and the forces of &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the defeat of Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; and the complete takeover of the forest by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, this region was fairly silent for a while. However, the new Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to conquer Gilneas in order to establish a main oversea supply route to the continent of Lordaeron. Silverpine Forest became the staging ground for the Horde soldiers invading Gilneas. Garrosh himself arrived here and brought with him regiments of orcs and tauren for the initial assault.\nThe war proved costly and the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;first invasion&lt;/a&gt; was repelled by the proud, now &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, defenders of Gilneas. After the Forsaken defeat, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; gained the upper hand in the conflict, and the worgen quickly began to wash over Silverpine Forest, reaching even the distant lands of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Forsaken had to resort to more reckless and experimental methods in order to win back their territory, such as using &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, the former servants of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, to raise the Gilnean noblemen: &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Ashbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Walden&lt;/a&gt;, who did not accept the fact that their king became a half-man, half-beast. With their help, the Forsaken managed to drive off the worgen offensive back to Gilneas, but after the deed was done, Godfrey and his henchmen assassinated &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and then fled to the abandoned fortress of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily for the Horde, Sylvanas was resurrected thanks to the power of her val'kyr servants. Now both &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; seek to eliminate the traitorous noblemen that now reside and plot behind the walls of Silverlaine's keep\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Silverpine was heavily targeted by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces, leaving the remaining Forsaken forces in the area defending their remaining holdfasts. Troops under &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20MacDonnell\"&gt;High Priestess MacDonnell&lt;/a&gt; marched on the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Hadrec\"&gt;High Executor Hadrec&lt;/a&gt; attempted to send reinforcements up into Tirisfal. &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; fell under Forsaken control by &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Hayward\"&gt;Deathstalker Hayward&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership, though they were ultimately defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, which took over the island. The Horde later distracted these forces to allow &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; refugees evacuate across &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken which controlled &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, turned it into a bio-weapon facility under &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Plaguebringer%20Harris\"&gt;Chief Plaguebringer Harris&lt;/a&gt;. This was done to manufacture weaponry to use against the nearby kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, though the keep was surrounded by &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tobias%20Zaren\"&gt;Captain Tobias Zaren&lt;/a&gt;, given that &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; is the most immediate area that surrounds the keep, it likely refers to this location.\nAlliance and Horde forces also clashed along the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt;, with the Horde attempting to continue mining operations, while the Alliance was attempting to take over the mine and sabotage said operations using gnomish explosive devices. &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; led a Gilnean army seemingly out of the region to attack the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, which were attempting to send undead reinforcements to attack Gilneas under orders of &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; embarked on their journey to explore Azeroth as well as catalogue the locations of various artifacts, they visited the forest.\nShaw noted his main contact in the area as Ivar Bloodfang, stating that the packleader was his contact within Shadowfang Keep. The pack has apparently claimed it, alongside Fenris Isle, and has taken most of the artifacts within the Shadowfang to Fenris Keep to be guarded closely.\nDragonflight.\nAt the time of the rediscovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; made a surprising resurgence in the region; somehow managing to take over &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;. Threatening the Forsaken holdings in the area, including the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; mobilized their forces to wipe out the threat. Combatting within fringe areas of the forest, such as &lt;a href=\"Valgan%27s%20Field\"&gt;Valgan's Field&lt;/a&gt;, they managed to sneak their way onto the island with the help of a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;hero of their people&lt;/a&gt;. Once on the isle, the hero sabotaged a number of Scarlet outposts along the &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Isles\"&gt;Dawning Isles&lt;/a&gt;; allowing the Forsaken military to invade. After they forced the Crusade's leadership to retreat, the Forsaken encircled Fenris Keep; where &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; fought alongside the hero against &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Forsythe\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Forsythe&lt;/a&gt;. Without their leader, the Crusade was routed from the keep and the isle by the undead.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Forsaken honored the hero; with Lillian claiming that the Forsaken have retaken the keep. It was never explained what happened to the Bloodfang pack, nor the artifacts they guarded within the keep itself.\nGeography.\nSoft mists swirled gently near the moist, pine-needle-covered earth with rich evergreen scent from the moist air.\nThe southern portion of the land is more dreary, and the terrain resembles that of Gilneas, rather than the rest of the forest, because of the close proximity to the kingdom's border.\nSilverpine Forest contains no raid dungeons or PvP areas. &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the level 18-21 instanced dungeon, can be found here, as well as the former &lt;a href=\"Non-instanced%20dungeons\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;. There are Horde-only travel hubs, such as &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20High%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken High Command&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe story covers the Forsaken war effort against the kingdom of Gilneas. After an initial defeat, the Gilneans have launched a counter-offensive against the Forsaken in Silverpine. The adventurer is sent to help out the Forsaken in order to reclaim Gilneas, performing a series of dangerous tasks from small errands to even participating in the final battle against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the region. Lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; oversees the Horde war effort personally and is present throughout the experience.\nWarcraft III.\nSilverpine Forest was home to a large band of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s called &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen%20Trolls\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;, who had dammed the &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt;, putting them at odds with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. It was also inhabited by &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, as in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThere is a non-campaign map in \"Warcraft III\" named Silverpine Forest.\nIn the RPG.\nSilverpine Forest was once protected by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and they kept these woodlands verdant, pristine and beautiful. Now the place is a ghostly haunted and wild land where mists cloak the ground. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; control the forest and clash constantly with the wretched &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Hide\"&gt;Rot Hide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; sometimes go into Silverpine to defend its &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants and to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt; and the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20Curse\"&gt;Worgen Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a small cabin in the forest's southeast lives &lt;a href=\"Halmish\"&gt;Halmish&lt;/a&gt;, an old man who states the forest is cursed. Not because of the plague or the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but by a curse that changes men into beasts.\nHistory.\nThe Alliance once kept Silverpine Forest pristine and beautiful. In those days, the forest must have resembled the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; far to the east. Since the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, no one is left to take care of the forest, and it has grown wild. After the Forsaken broke from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s dominance they claimed Silverpine as part of their territory, though many dispute that claim.\nThe Forsaken have a special contingent called the &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;, which wanders through Silverpine on constant patrol. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken organization devoted to creating new toxins and alchemical substances, also has a strong presence here. The Forsaken leader in Silverpine, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Priest%20Allister\"&gt;Shadow Priest Allister&lt;/a&gt;, is concerned that the Dalaran wizards are showing an increased interest in the forest. A &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; band called the &lt;a href=\"Rothide\"&gt;Rothide&lt;/a&gt;s live here as well. Perhaps whatever afflicts the Forsaken affects the gnolls as well, for their fur is gray and patchy and their eyes yellow, rheumy and sick-looking. No one seems to know where they came from. The Rothides and the Forsaken wage a constant guerrilla war against each other.\nA few humans inhabit Silverpine Forest. These are desperate men and women holding out against the Forsaken, or they are Dalaran wizards on scientific missions. A fortress called &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; and a nearby village called &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; stand in southwestern Silverpine. At night, when the moon rises above the treetops and bathes the world in pale light, terrible howls erupt from Shadowfang and Pyrewood \u2014 as if the men and women within had transformed into wolves. Probably the curse old Halmish mentioned. \nA Dalaran wizard named &lt;a href=\"Alphus%20Wordwill\"&gt;Alphus Wordwill&lt;/a&gt; is researching on what he calls the \"&lt;a href=\"Worgen%20Curse\"&gt;Worgen Curse&lt;/a&gt;\". Only one place in all of Lordaeron bears traces of this strange curse: the fortress of Shadowfang and the nearby Pyrewood Village. Alphus believes this curse is somehow tied to the moon. When the full moon rises, those afflicted by this curse undergo a transformation, turning into strange, man-wolf hybrid creatures. This transformation is mental as well as physical; the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, like Alphus calls them, desire to hunt, slay and eat. No matter their dispositions as humans during the day, at night under the full moon these individuals are bloodthirsty monsters. He believes that a possible cure might solve the problem instead of just simply eliminating them. He hopes that the cure, instead of preventing their transformation, would preserve the afflicted individual's mindset after it. Such an effect would allow good-hearted worgen to take on fearsome physical abilities and use these against the Forsaken, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and other evil powers. Given proper funding and support, he believes he can create such a cure.\nAlphus managed to get his funding and begun working on a cure for the Worgen Curse. He needed heroes to protect him and his servants as they moved through the forest gathering reagents and conducting tests. Later he sent these heroes to sneak into Pyrewood and drop the cure into the water supply, then they sneaked out and observed the changes over several days. This activity undoubtedly angered Shadowfang Keep's mysterious overseers. In addition to staying alive through all of this, Alphus sent the heroes to slay Shadowfang's evil lords to permanently stamp out the curse's evil.\nGeography.\nSilverpine Forest is a vast, primeval wood that stretches along &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s rugged western coast. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; border the forest to the south while &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; lies to the north. The massive &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; serves as Silverpine's eastern border.\nThe land is fairly flat, but small hills, mossy overhangs and grassy knolls are common. There are some rivers throughout the region. Tall, silver-barked pines tower over the knolls. At night, mists creep from the ground and mix moonlight into dancing spirits. Razed &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; and vacant &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s dot the land. \"Forsaken\" is an appropriate term for this region for various reasons. Many wild creatures roam through the trees, though they seem to be more aggressive than is natural. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, vicious animals and mysterious curses fill the land. The undead Forsaken haunt Silverpine Forest, though a few hearty souls hold out against them. The Worgen Curse afflicts some of the inhabitants.\nSpeculation.\nThe traces of a river can be found in Silverpine Forest that was once connected to Lordamere Lake. All that remains of it is a dried up canyon and a few pools of water. This isn't &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt; seen in \"\", as it isn't in the vicinity of Pyrewood Village. The unnamed river's drying up could be due to a hypothesized fall of water around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; that could have also affected &lt;a href=\"Cross%20Island\"&gt;Cross Island&lt;/a&gt;. Basins in the Plaguelands have also seemingly dried out, possibly due to the magical, all-debilitating nature of the plague. Another possibility is that this river only flows during spring snow-melts."}
{"id": "14023", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14023", "title": "Silverpine Forest (Classic)", "text": "Silverpine Forest, or simply Silverpine, is a vast, ancient wood that runs along &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron's&lt;/a&gt; rugged western coast. The land ranges from fairly flat to hilly, and is nestled among even taller mountains. The forest is eerily silent save for the occasional unnatural howling echoing among the trees. Mossy overhangs shiver in the cold breeze, and the trees are all sickly or dying. Dilapidated farmsteads and abandoned mines dot the land, home now to the darker denizens of the woods.\nThis woodland is haunted and wild, characterized by its tall, silver-barked pines towering over grassy knolls. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; once protected Silverpine Forest when it was verdant and lively. Now the place is shrouded in ghostly mists. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; control the northern forest and constantly clash with the wretched &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Hide\"&gt;Rot Hide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s. What remains of the human population retains control of the southern forest, but they are desperate and their forces thinly stretched. &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; sends frequent expeditions into Silverpine to defend these people and study the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt; and worgen curse \u2014 a mysterious affliction that causes its victims to transform into bloodthirsty, lycanthropic &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; when the moon rises.\n&lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; border the forest to the south, while &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; lays to the north. &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt; serves as Silverpine's eastern border.\nThough the territory belongs to the Forsaken, their claim is disputed by the wizards of Dalaran and agents of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; who have taken possession of some of the ruined fields and steadings. Rothide gnolls operate from the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and fiercely attack anyone who dares approach their dealings. In the southwest lays &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, whose people have fallen under archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;'s curse, transforming into bloodthirsty worgen at night-time. Arugal makes his home in the nearby darkened towers of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. \nSilverpine Forest frequently sees battle, as Alliance forces from &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; journey to the forsaken woods to attack &lt;a href=\"the%20Sepulcher\"&gt;the Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; or enter Shadowfang. It is the edge of the Forsaken homeland, and the southernmost point where effects of the undead plague can be seen in the plant life.\nHistory.\nThe Alliance once kept Silverpine Forest pristine and beautiful, at a time when the forest resembled the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; far to the east.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the forest was affected by the plague of undeath. The forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; invaded the woods, setting fire to the crops and massacring its people. With Lordaeron destroyed, the wizards of Dalaran busy rebuilding their home and the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; having locked themselves away behind the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;, no one was left to take care of the forest. The plague began to affect the trees, making them pale and lifeless with disease. Since its fall, the forest has become occupied by the Forsaken, minions of &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt;, and the forces of Arugal. Its fate lies in uncertain hands as the opposing factions vie for control of the strategically important woods.\nPeople and Culture.\nThe Forsaken control Northern Silverpine Forest. As undead freed from the Lich King\u2019s control they serve under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, waging war upon the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of destroying it. Some also take exception to the living, and so their list of allies is thin. Forsaken resemble men and women, but their skin is a decayed gray and dead flesh shows in places.\nThe Forsaken have a special contingent known as the &lt;a href=\"Deathguard\"&gt;Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;, who wander through Silverpine on constant patrol. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken organization devoted to creating new toxins and alchemical substances, also has a strong presence here. They have concerns with Dalaran's increased interest in the region.\nA gnoll band called the Rothides lives here as well. They appear to have been afflicted with the plague of undeath for their fur is gray and patchy, and their eyes yellow, rheumy and sick-looking. Though their origins are unknown, the Rothides and the Forsaken wage a constant guerrilla war against each other.\nNot much remains of the humans who inhabit Silverpine, formed of Gilneas' refugees and the wizards of Dalaran. Those who inhabit Pyrewood Village below Shadowfang Keep bear a terrible nocturnal curse, transforming into worgen by moonlight.\nGeography.\nSilverpine Forest is a vast, primeval wood that runs along Lordaeron\u2019s rugged western coast. The land is fairly flat, but small hills, mossy overhangs and grassy knolls are common. Razed farms and vacant &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;s dot a land commonly described as \"forsaken\". Many wild and aggressive creatures roam through the trees.\nSilverpine Forest contains no raid dungeons or PvP areas. &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the level 18-21 instanced dungeon, can be found here, as well as the former &lt;a href=\"Non-instanced%20dungeons\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;. The only travel hub in this area is the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, though there is easy access to the northern regions from the nearby Forsaken capital, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to cross the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; by exploiting the terrain. It is, however, quite empty, containing only a few token trees and hills before becoming flat, untextured landscape completely walled in by mountains.\nTravel hubs.\nThe only travel hub in Silverpine Forest is the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Alliance players will have to run in from &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nNotable characters.\nSilverpine Forest is home to several forsaken of note. At the Sepulcher, &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Hadrec\"&gt;High Executor Hadrec&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young forsaken to investigate the activity of the local Rot Hide gnolls. He is assisted in his efforts by &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Renferrel\"&gt;Apothecary Renferrel&lt;/a&gt;, who also seeks to concoct a new plague using various animal organs as ingredients. And nearby, the devious &lt;a href=\"Dalar%20Dawnweaver\"&gt;Dalar Dawnweaver&lt;/a&gt; ponders the presence of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; in Silverpine Forest.\nQuests.\nSilverpine Forest quests are exclusively Horde-aligned. They begin at level 10 and run to level 20, though their limited number can make it difficult for &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; players to move into the nearby &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, the next zone for Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Many cross the sea to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; via zeppelin as a result.\nQuests of note in this area include the &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; quest chain, in which players help &lt;a href=\"Dalar%20Dawnweaver\"&gt;Dalar Dawnweaver&lt;/a&gt; research the archmage's lupine curse.\nWarcraft III.\nThere is a map in \"Warcraft III\" named Silverpine Forest."}

The objective of the battleground is to be the first to generate 1600 resources through controlling and capturing mine carts.\nDescription.\n\"This battleground takes place underneath Stranglethorn Vale in a Venture Co. goblin mine. Silvershard Mines is a 10 vs 10 escort battleground, in which each side attempts to control diamond carts until they reach the mine depot.\"\nOverview.\nCarts.\nVenture co. mine carts appear in the center of the map, and automatically move along the tracks to their destination \u2013 one of three diamond drop-off points at the end of the tracks. They\u2019ll keep appearing and heading down the tracks until one team wins.\nMultiple carts can move along different tracks at once, so don\u2019t be afraid to split your efforts in order to control the highest number of carts.\nYour team gains control of a cart when there are more members of your team than members of the opposing team in range of that cart. While you have control of a cart, you\u2019ll accrue resources every few seconds.\nIf you capture a cart \u2013 if your team is in control when the cart reaches its destination \u2013 your team will receive a large number of resources. When a cart is captured, another cart will appear shortly after in the center of the map.\nNo more than 3 carts can be active at one time (one cart per track).\nTracks.\nCarts automatically proceed along 3 different tracks in the Silvershard mines. Each track is a different length \u2013 though capturing a cart will earn you the same number of resources regardless of which track the cart is on, you have an opportunity to earn more resources while proceeding down a longer track.\nKeep this tradeoff in mind, because you can change a cart\u2019s route, directing it to a different track by hitting one of the two switches found at track intersections. These switches take a few seconds to activate, but they give you the opportunity to send a cart in a different direction \u2013 ideally towards your teammates. You don\u2019t need control of a cart to change the track that it\u2019s on, so plan ahead to dodge your enemies and fluster their plans.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The battle took place between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; defenders of the Isle and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assailants, led by the instigator of the attack, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The battle took place for over a day, ultimately culminating in the bombing and subsequent annihilation of Theramore Isle and the majority of its defenders. The events are described in detail in the novel and can be experienced in-game in the scenario &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, obsessed with assuring the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s supremacy over &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, has decided to launch an all-out attack against &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;'s island home of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Following the fall of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, horrified by Garrosh's use of enslaved molten giants, sends &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; to warn &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of Northwatch's fall and that Theramore was next on his target list. With Hellscream deciding to not press the attack, Jaina was able to gather reinforcements and commanders in the form of &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thaddus%20Stoutblow\"&gt;Thaddus Stoutblow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horran%20Redmane\"&gt;Horran Redmane&lt;/a&gt;, while evacuating the children and other civilians by boat.\nNearly a dozen members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; (who was accompanied by his wife &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;), joined in the defense of Theramore, with the reasoning that doing nothing would be tacitly supporting the Horde.\nEven the Naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"General%20Tiras%27alan\"&gt;General Tiras'alan&lt;/a&gt; and other draenei to protect and defend the city from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, many of those defending Theramore found themselves unprepared for the terrible scope of Garrosh's true plans.\nBattle.\nAs the Horde moves into &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; the Horde ground assault splits in two with forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; assaulting the North Gate, while those under the command of &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh's second in command, assault the West Gate. Meanwhile, the Horde navy engages in battle with the defenders at Theramore's harbor. While an ambush on Malkorok's forces is initially successful &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt; and those under her command are forced to retreat to Theramore. Over the course of the battle, Jaina's apprentice &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt; is able to magically empower the West Gate so that it does not fall during the battle.\nWhile Malkorok's forces were faced with these setbacks, Garrosh's forces were luckier. While lives were lost in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wymor\"&gt;Captain Wymor&lt;/a&gt; or by the hidden bombs detonated by &lt;a href=\"Adolphus%20Blastwidget\"&gt;Adolphus Blastwidget&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh who was engaged in combat with the captain was strangely unharmed. Furthermore, as the north gate came under attack it became increasingly weaker due to the actions of &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde spy who had come with the Kirin Tor. While Jaina and Pained stopped the traitor and sent him to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Evencane\"&gt;Captain Evencane&lt;/a&gt;, they were unable to prevent the fall of the North Gate. As the invading army advanced into Theramore, Garrosh would engage in battle with several of Theramore's defenders like &lt;a href=\"Thaddus%20Stoutblow\"&gt;Thaddus Stoutblow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horran%20Redmane\"&gt;Horran Redmane&lt;/a&gt;, Pained would go toe to toe against &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina would focus her attacks on the Horde's long-range support.\nWith Theramore's forces distracted by the battle at the Northgate a small Horde recon team was able to sneak into Theramore Entering the city from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sea%20Wolf\"&gt;The Sea Wolf&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Blastmaster%20Sparkfuse\"&gt;Blastmaster Sparkfuse&lt;/a&gt; Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s crippled Theramore's air defenses by killing &lt;a href=\"Baldruc\"&gt;Baldruc&lt;/a&gt;. With that done they moved to rescue Thalen Songweaver. With Captain Hedric Evencane's death, Songweaver was quickly freed from his arcane shackles. Not wasting any time, he and his rescuers quickly departed from the city.\nDuring the battle the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; aided in Theramore's defense by bringing down boulders around the Horde forces at the North Gate; an act that would prevent any escape. However, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; quickly noticed and realized the dragon's plan and then fought his way to both Garrosh and Baine to inform them of the situation. Trapped between the blue dragon outside and Alliance forces inside the Horde began to suffer heavy losses and Hellscream then called for a retreat ending the attack on Theramore. With the Horde forces retreating from their attack upon the north and west gate, and leaving the harbor Jaina declared to Kalecgos that Theramore's defenders won.\nOutcome.\nSoon after the Horde retreat, both sides learned of Songweaver's rescue. While Garrosh was pleased at such news, Pained was outraged and both Vereesa Windrunner and Shandris Feathermoon took a small source to try and located the spy and his rescuers. Meanwhile, an enraged Baine would confront Garrosh for the loss of so many Horde warriors only to be told that the moment of victory had finally come. To the horror of both Baine and Vol'jin, they learned that the Horde was never meant to win the attack on Theramore. Instead, the attack was meant to draw many of the greatest commanders of the Alliance (like Shandris Feathermoon and General Marcus Jonathan) to the same location. With that revelation, Garrosh orders that a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; be dropped on Theramore.\nAs the mana bomb heads to Theramore, Kalecgos is able to sense it because the stolen &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; is empowering it. After warning Jaina and Rhonin, Kalecgos tries and fails to stop it. Rhonin, realizing that Jaina's tower was steeped in magic, would call the mana bomb to himself in order to localize the detonation. After pushing Jaina into a portal for her safety and declaring that she was the future of the Kirin Tor, Rhonin's plan would succeed. In the explosion that followed, those who remained in Theramore like Rhonin, Kinndy, Pained, General Marcus Jonathan, and &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Aubrey\"&gt;Admiral Tarlen Aubrey&lt;/a&gt; would lose their lives. Meanwhile, those searching for Songweaver, Kalecgos, and Jaina would be the only survivors of those who defended Theramore.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; navy subsequently establishes a blockade of Kalimdor while the armies return to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate their victory. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; journeys back to Theramore and recovers the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;. Craving vengeance, Jaina tries to convince both &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde needs to be destroyed entirely. Upon failing to convince both King Wrynn and the Kirin Tor to help, Jaina decides to use the Iris to destroy &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde armies gathered there. Meanwhile, Varian eventually declares war and leads a naval force towards Orgrimmar in an effort to break the naval blockade. Jaina initially conceived a plan to use the Focusing Iris to summon a tsunami to wipe out Orgrimmar, engaging &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in an intense battle when he attempts to stop her, but Kalec was able to talk her out of it and calm her out of her hatred of orcs at the last moment by forcing her to realize that if she did so she would be just as monstrous as Arthas and Garrosh. Instead, she used her army of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to aid Varian's Alliance fleet in breaking the Horde blockade.\nFollowing Rhonin's death, his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Sullied%20Banner\"&gt;Sullied Banner&lt;/a&gt; in order to get some closure for the surviving &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the battle."}

Scouts report that this base is located somewhere within the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'dare&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt;, just south-east of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; artificers have completed designs for a &lt;a href=\"Foundry\"&gt;Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. With this new innovation, you will be able to construct &lt;a href=\"Transport%20ship\"&gt;Transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s that can ferry your troops across large bodies of water. These vessels should provide great assistance in the completion of your task.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nGiven the threat of enemy ships nearby, the Alliance's first priority was to get a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; into operation as soon as possible. First, they sent their workers into the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of training more. At the same time, the two &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; that had brought them there were sent from the northern shore around to the south where an enemy &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; guarded an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Patch\"&gt;oil patch&lt;/a&gt;. When it was safely below the waves, they remained near the shore to guard the shipyard site. After training several more &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s, they placed half of them in the mines and set the other half to collecting &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;. Soon they raised a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;, and soon after, began construction of the shipyard on the southern shore near camp. Taking no chances, they constructed a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; to train a force of archers for the coming amphibious assault. Though they were still training peasants and building &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, there was more than enough material and sufficient laborers to start the &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, new &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;s began exploiting the nearby patch of &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith all the necessary structures in place and operational, they next began preparations for war. They raised &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt;s on the north shore to fend off landing raiders and spent time upgrading their &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, ship &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, and armor. More destroyers were necessary to clear the way for their &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s, which were constructed only after they already had five destroyers in the water. During this time, they continually trained new archers until there were ten units, which easily defended the camp until transports that would carry them were completed. Their fleet of destroyers began the operation by sailing south and southeast, directly into enemy territory, soon there was little opposition to them reducing the platforms and coastal structures to piles of smoking ash. With that completed, they anchored the destroyers close to shore near the enemy camp and let them fire at orcs for sport while the transports were being loaded with ten archers and two peasants. Once they had landed safely just west of the Alliance destroyers, the archers made sure the workers could construct two guard towers directly north of the destroyers. They were very careful not to let the archers wander into the camp, keeping them close to the towers and destroyers for defense. Once the guard towers were in place and upgraded, next came a barracks, whose completion spelled doom for the orcs.\nWhile they were cleaning up the enemy camp, the remaining enemy ships in the area decided to try for their home base. They were soundly defeated by the guard towers that the Alliance force had constructed along the shore. They then sought out and killed the few remaining orcs, and celebrated their victory among the ruins, which still burned and smoked angrily. It had been a great triumph for the Alliance.\nAftermath.\nAlthough the Horde's base on Zul'Dare had been destroyed, and the Horde driven from the shores of Lordaeron it was a bittersweet victory; the townships of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; had been left in ruins. It was clear to the Alliance that the war would cost the them dearly. Meanwhile, Milan's commander was ordered to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; to assist the forces of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. \nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "16235", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16235", "title": "Attack power", "text": "Attack power (AP) is a physical damage &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; derived from strength and/or agility and character level, that serves to increase your base weapon damage by an amount relative to this statistic. There are two forms of attack power: Melee attack power, and Ranged attack power. These can be found on your &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt; in the Melee and Ranged sections, and each form only affects the related type of weapon damage.\nBy increasing the player's base weapon damage, attack power improves the player's auto-attacks. Many abilities also add some percentage of attack power to the damage they deal (the &lt;a href=\"attack%20power%20coefficient\"&gt;attack power coefficient&lt;/a&gt;).\nAlthough characters of every class will have a listed amount of ranged attack power, the statistic is wholly meaningless to all except Hunters, Rogues and Warriors, as these are the only classes that can use ranged weapons other than wands (wands do not benefit from attack power). Hunters benefit greatly from ranged attack power, while rogues and warriors' benefit is marginal, affecting only a few abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Throw\"&gt;Heroic Throw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shattering%20Throw\"&gt;Shattering Throw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Throw\"&gt;Deadly Throw&lt;/a&gt;.\nLikewise, both types of attack power can be considered irrelevant for priests, mages, warlocks, and is generally not acquired by these specs due to gear and talent choices.\nSources.\nAttack power can be obtained from a number of sources:\nAttack power from gear, items and permanent enchantments contributes equally to melee and ranged AP. Most buffs, talents and enchantment procs either increase melee and ranged attack power separately, or only increase one kind.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, AP is no longer found on gear, instead being provided via the items' agility and strength bonuses. However, pre-4.0.1 gear often provides attack power bonuses.\nAuto-attacks.\nThe base &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; of your &lt;a href=\"auto-attack\"&gt;auto-attack&lt;/a&gt;s (including ranged attacks made using &lt;a href=\"Shoot\"&gt;Shoot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Auto-Shot\"&gt;Auto-Shot&lt;/a&gt;) is increased by 1 for every 14 attack power you have. For example, an AP of 28 will give you 2 DPS. Your DPS is then multiplied by weapon speed to give the real per-attack melee or ranged damage:\n Weapon Damage = (Weapon DPS + AP/14) * Weapon Speed \nIf dual wielding, an off-hand weapon will also receive DPS from AP with the normal damage penalty of 50% by default. Disregarding dual wield specialization talents, the offhand damage is then: \n Offhand Damage = [(Weapon DPS + AP/14) * Weapon Speed] / 2.\nThe bonus from attack power uses the weapon's base speed, not your attack speed (which is often faster because of &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, attack power and haste will give a greater DPS increase together than separately.\nMob attack power.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s have different attack power formulas than players. Damage done per second of mobs is given by:\n (DPS_from_AttackPower + Base_DPS) * Multiplier.\nFor most mobs, attack power is about 30% of total damage; bosses have higher multiplier than trash mobs. That means -attack power debuffs have significant effect on raid mobs. The -AP debuff is capped at -30% total damage effect, as the formula suggests.\nPlayer attack power.\nHunter.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, hunters received 2 Ranged AP per agility, whereas now they receive 1 RAP per agility. Some of this loss was made up for in AP increases from items. The reason given for this change was to keep agility from being the be-all and end-all of hunter stats, allowing for flexibility into intellect or stamina without sacrificing a large amount of AP. However, this is slated to be changed back to 2 AP along with the release of Cataclysm.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, hunters can gain RAP from intellect or/and stamina by Survival and Marksmanship Talent. (See &lt;a href=\"Careful%20Aim\"&gt;Careful Aim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20vs.%20Wild\"&gt;Hunter vs. Wild&lt;/a&gt;)\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.6\"&gt;Patch 4.0.6&lt;/a&gt;, hunters receive 2 Ranged AP per agility again. Beast Mastery hunters gain a 25% bonus (was 15% with &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;) to their total AP through the summary talent &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Handler\"&gt;Animal Handler&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaman.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, shamans received 2 AP per strength. This was changed in 3.0.2 in preparation for &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Shamans now received 1 AP from strength and 1 AP from agility.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, AP calculations changed again; like in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, this was in preparation for &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Shamans now gain 2 points per level, 1 point per strength, and 2 points per agility.\nThe Enhancement passive ability &lt;a href=\"Unleashed%20Rage\"&gt;Unleashed Rage&lt;/a&gt; improves attack power by 10% for all party and raid members within 100 yards.\nDruid.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.8\"&gt;Patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, many weapons listed &lt;a href=\"feral%20attack%20power\"&gt;feral attack power&lt;/a&gt;, making these weapons highly tailored to druids and making other weapons unusable for druids. After the patch, specific feral attack power bonuses were removed. Instead, all weapons with more than 54.8 DPS grant feral attack power equal to [(DPS - 54.8) * 14], rounded down. Only druids see feral attack power in weapon tooltips.\nDruids now gain feral attack power from both agility and strength, whether in cat or bear form. This means that agility is always preferred over strength, even for a bear, which is ironic considering that the \"of the Bear\" suffix denotes strength and stamina. Agility gives dodge which is essential for a bear, given that a bear cannot block or parry.\nCat feral attack power can be increased further with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Wild%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Heart of the Wild (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; talent by 10%.\nFeral druids gain a 25% bonus to their total Attack Power due to the Aggression talent acquired as part of the Feral Combat specialization."}

{"id": "25095", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25095", "title": "Attack speed", "text": "Attack speed is a secondary &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; that describes the delay between auto-attacks, measured in seconds. It is the reciprocal of the actual rate of attack; a higher attack speed means that you will attack less frequently, not more frequently. Essentially, it can be considered the \"&lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;\" between auto-attacks by the given weapon. It is a function of &lt;a href=\"weapon%20speed\"&gt;weapon speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttack speed can be found in two places on your &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt; - under Melee and Ranged. Melee attack speed is determined by melee haste, and modifies the speed of your melee auto-attacks, while Ranged attack speed is determined by ranged haste, and affects the speed of your ranged auto-attacks. The same rules and calculations apply to each.\nAttack speed calculation.\nLike your attack speed, your melee and ranged haste can be found on your character sheet in the appropriate section. This percentage reflects a combination of all current haste effects applicable to your attacks; don't forget to apply melee haste for melee attack speed calculations, and ranged haste for ranged attack speed.\nWhen calculating your own haste effects, you can either calculate the total haste percentage first, or perform the calculation separately for each haste source. &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; sources stack multiplicatively, except for haste rating, which is combined into a single percentage before being multiplied with the others. \nExample.\nAlternatively, multiply the haste sources at the start:\nSo with all 3 speed buffs going the melee attack speed is now 1.0402\nOr, in attacks per minute:\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard rounds to 4 significant digits.\nBasically, all of the calculations are reciprocal operations and are inverted from how you would expect to see them.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard applies attack speed buffs multiplicatively; in this example the buffs provide 73% increase, because 40% increase times 20% increase times 3% increase is 1.4 * 1.2 * 1.03 = 1.7304.\nIf you flip the numerator and denominator, you get your number of attacks per second, meaning that a percentage increase in attack speed has the final result of increasing your damage per second by the same percentage, along with an added bonus of increasing the number of ability &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;s (from weapons (&lt;a href=\"Landslide%20%28enchant%29\"&gt;Landslide (enchant)&lt;/a&gt;) or skills and talents (&lt;a href=\"Go%20for%20the%20Throat\"&gt;Go for the Throat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20the%20Frozen%20Wastes\"&gt;Might of the Frozen Wastes&lt;/a&gt;).\nA quick way to determine resultant attack speed, without applying the formula for each increase, is the following:\n[current attack speed] / (increase1 * increase2 * increase3...etc)\nExample:\n1.8 / (1.40 * 1.20 * 1.03) = 1.0402\nAttack speed and DPS.\nIt must be remembered that attack speed's significance is inverse to the usual meaning of 'speed' - in this case, higher speed means attacking more slowly/less frequently, while lower speed means attacking more quickly/more frequently. Attack speed describes the length of time between a player's auto-attacks. Effects that \"slow\" opponents' attacks actually increase their attack speed.\nExample.\nWhile each attack may deal 7600 damage, because an auto-attack will only occur once every 3.43 seconds, the weapon's DPS is 2216."}

The table is laid out in descending order of the precedence of one attack result over another. That is to say, the entries at the top of the table take precedence over the entries below them. Melee and ranged attacks are resolved in a single server-side \"die roll\" to decide what happens. Spell attacks follow different rules than melee/ranged attacks, and require multiple server-side die rolls. There are additional rules based on whether the attack source is a player character or a creature, and those rules are laid out in more detail in the following sections.\nFor melee/ranged attacks, what the attack table means is this:\nNotes:\nPlayer attacks.\nFor player attacks on creatures or other players, a few rules are enforced that are not applied to creature attacks on players or other creatures:\nPlayer melee and ranged attacks.\nIn the tables below, \u0394level is the relative level between the attacking character and the target. For instance, a level 85 character attacking a level 90 target would use the -5 row. Character attacks against &lt;a href=\"raid%20boss\"&gt;raid boss&lt;/a&gt;es (who display a skull instead of a numeric level) generally use the -3 row, as raid bosses are at minimum always three levels above attacking characters. Values only apply if targets are capable of them, so for example if the character is attacking something from behind, the target cannot parry attacks.\nOff-hand melee swings incur an additional 19% miss penalty to balance &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing two &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons versus using a &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon. &lt;a href=\"Ranged\"&gt;Ranged&lt;/a&gt; attacks (that is, not &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s but attacks like a hunter's &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shot\"&gt;Auto Shot&lt;/a&gt;) use the same attack table as melee attacks, but with 0% parry, glance, or block chance for all rows.\nPlayer spell attacks.\nFor spells, offensive abilities can either first hit or miss. Healing abilities will always hit. Players attacking targets above their character level lose 11% chance to hit for each level above 3. That is, a level 85 character attacking a level 90 target has 22% miss chance.\nCrits and crit suppression.\nThe &lt;a href=\"critical%20strike\"&gt;critical strike&lt;/a&gt; chance listed on the character sheet is the absolute crit chance over all attacks (hits and misses), so to get the actual crit chance, multiply the hit chance (100% \u2212 miss chance) by the character sheet-listed crit chance. For example, if a player has 10% miss chance and 20% listed crit chance, the player's actual crit chance is codice_1, or 18%.\nFor melee and ranged attacks, slot the actual crit chance into the attack table between block and ordinary hit. If the game rolls a successful spell hit, the game then makes a second roll to decide if the ability is a critical strike or a regular hit. \nRegardless of the attack type, players attacking higher-level targets have a reduced chance to crit relative to what's listed on their character sheet. For each level above the attacking character's level, players lose 1% crit. So, a level 87 character with 20% listed crit attacking a level 90 target only has 17% crit chance.\nMultistrikes.\nAssuming a successful player-cast ability in any form (glance, crit, or hit), the game then makes up to two separate rolls to decide if the ability will land any &lt;a href=\"multistrike\"&gt;multistrike&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the main ability for 30% of the effect. If the primary attack landed for 1,000 damage, a normal multistrike would land for 300 damage, and a critical multistrike would land for 600 damage in PvE. Multistrikes can crit independently of the main ability, whether that ability was a normal white-damage attack or a yellow-damage (special) attack, so the initial strike does not need to be a crit in order for the multistrikes to crit. Assuming 20% crit chance and 10% multistrike chance, each multistrike roll would look like this:\nBonus damage to previous-expansion creatures.\nBeyond all of the above, players attacking creatures from previous expansions (creatures from classic to \"Cataclysm\", but not \"Mists of Pandaria\") will increase their damage dealt to those creatures by a multiplier. This bonus is based on \"expansion\", not level, so a level 85 creature in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; will take bonus damage, whereas a level 85 creature in &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; will not. So, for example, a level 80 character attacking a level 75 creature multiplies it's damage dealt by 4 (an attack that would deal 1,000 damage actually deals 4,000 damage).\nCreature attacks.\nJust as there are rules that are only applied to player attacks, creatures are subject to their own set of rules:\nCreature melee and ranged attacks.\nCreatures attacking players have a different attack table than players attacking creatures. Creatures do not receive &lt;a href=\"glancing%20blow\"&gt;glancing blow&lt;/a&gt;s on players, but players can be struck by &lt;a href=\"crushing%20blow\"&gt;crushing blow&lt;/a&gt;s. As in the previous tables, \u0394level is the relative level between the attacking creature and the player. For instance, a level 90 creature attacking a level 85 player would use the -5 row. Raid boss creature attacks against players (raid bosses display a skull instead of a numeric level) generally use the -3 row. Values only apply if players are capable of them, so for example druids cannot parry and characters without shields equipped cannot block.\nValues in the \u0394dodge, \u0394parry, or \u0394block columns indicate the relative chance an attack has being that type of attack as compared to the character sheet. For instance, a level 90 creature attacking a level 87 player with 20% listed parry chance actually has a 15.5% chance for incoming attacks to be parried, or a relative parry chance of -4.5%. Any values that would wind up below 0% will hit the floor of 0%. On the other hand, players that are higher-level than the attacking creature get a bonus to their character sheet values. In this example, a level 90 player being attacked by a level 85 creature with 5% dodge chance listed on the character sheet actually has a 12.5% chance to dodge incoming attacks.\nCreature spell attacks.\nAs with players attacking creatures with spells, creatures can either hit or miss with spells cast on players. For example, a level 85 creature attacking a level 90 player with spells has a 37% miss chance.\nUnlike player-cast spells, creature-cast spells cannot land a critical strike.\nPrevious-expansion creature damage modifier.\nMuch like how players deal bonus damage to creatures from expansions before \"Mists of Pandaria\", those same creatures do less damage to players according to the formula: codice_2 For example, a level 80 creature attacking a level 85 character has it's damage output multiplied by 0.5, or an attack that would normally do 1,000 damage actually only does 500 damage. The damage multiplier has a lower limit of 0.1, so attacks (if they hit) will do at least 10% of their nominal damage.\nAs with the player-on-creature expansion-based damage modifier, this rule comes in to effect based on creature \"expansion\", not level. Level 85 creatures in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; are affected by this rule, but level 85 creatures in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; are not.\nExamples.\nIn an actual attack, the game rolls a number from 0 to 1 to decide what happens. Using the above melee attack tables, add up the values in the correct row and table from left to right and stop at 100%. For example, a raid boss is attacking a level 90 death knight in melee with 10% dodge, 12% parry, and 0% block (as death knights cannot equip shields). Bosses are always at least three levels above a character, and in this example the boss has 5% crit, so use the \"-3\" row in the creature \u2192 player table to get:\nAs another example, suppose a level 83 character is attacking a level 90 creature. Adding up the values in the -7 row in the player \u2192 creature table results in 114.5, but the attack table actually looks like this:\nValues cannot add up to over 100%, so even though the player nominally has an 80% chance to land a glancing blow and a 13.5% chance to get blocked, 1% of the glance value and all of the block value got \"pushed off the table\"."}

While his friends waited up on a far hill, he had sneaked into group of &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s, and they could not see him. He then signaled to his companions that there were four quilboars in the camp. The tauren warrior Gothara rushed the camp, she roared, putting wariness into the quilboar, causing them to fight poorly.\nThe troll priest, Wertala chanted the seven troll words for pain, causing one of the quilboars to suffer. The warlock Sinsear sent his voidwalker to attack the enemy. \nHowever one of the quilboars was undaunted and began to bring the power of elemental flame from the land. The others were already preoccupied to bring force to the foe. Saslen had his own plan however. He snuck behind the caster, and cut into its back, four times in quick succession. The quilboar turned to look at him with fear in its eyes. The quilboar could not finish its spell, as his words were slurred from the poison the rogue had inflicted. The rogue killed the quilboar with one final cut. The creatures called for assistance, but none were left to heed their cry."}

{"id": "387524", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=387524", "title": "Attributes", "text": "Attributes, often referred to simply as stats, are the basic building blocks for a character's combat ability. The four &lt;a href=\"%23Primary%20attributes\"&gt;primary attributes&lt;/a&gt; are strength, agility, stamina, and intellect. These attributes appear on the &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt; under the \"Attributes\" section. &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; with primary attributes on it has the unique property of swapping between the active attribute based on whatever primary is most useful to the current player's class specialization. For example, a plate helm will have equal amounts of strength and intellect on it, but only holy &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s will use the intellect, while protection and retribution paladins (and the other plate-wearing classes) will use the strength. Primary attributes also affect secondary attributes and the &lt;a href=\"%23Derived%20combat%20attributes\"&gt;derived combat attributes&lt;/a&gt;. \nAll characters inherently have a &lt;a href=\"base%20attributes\"&gt;base amount of the four primary attributes&lt;/a&gt; that increases with &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; depending largely upon their class. For example, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; will have more base intellect than a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, whom instead has more base agility. Beyond the base level of attributes, players can increase their attributes with equipment (from items' base attributes, as well as improvements from &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s, temporary effects such as &lt;a href=\"elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;s, and many other means.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"%23Secondary%20attributes\"&gt;secondary attributes&lt;/a&gt; also appear on gear. Secondary attributes include critical strike chance, haste, mastery, and several others. Secondary attributes also affect the derived combat attributes, typically more directly than the primary attributes.\nRarely, &lt;a href=\"%23Minor%20attributes\"&gt;minor attributes&lt;/a&gt; may also appear as a bonus property on gear and include such effects as reduced area of effect damage taken, getting healed from doing damage, or movement speed increases. Individual copies of a piece of gear may or may not have a minor attribute on it.\nNearly all &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; mechanics rely in some way on one or more attributes, many of which are not directly on gear but are derived from attributes that are. Increasing the appropriate attribute will increase damage done, reduce damage taken, increase healing done, affect a character's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, or other benefits. Understanding how these derived combat attributes work is important for effective combat.\nPrimary attributes.\nThe four primary attributes are found on items equipped in the eight armor slots: &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shoulders\"&gt;shoulders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wrist\"&gt;wrist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hands\"&gt;hands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"waist\"&gt;waist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"legs\"&gt;legs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"feet\"&gt;feet&lt;/a&gt;; and additionally on weapons and shields. Modern neck and ring items only receive one primary attribute, stamina.\nEach of the four armor types is assigned one or two non-stamina primary attributes: &lt;a href=\"plate%20armor\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; has strength and intellect, &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; have agility and intellect, and &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; only has intellect. Non-cloth armor has equal amounts of intellect and strength/agility. In class specializations that use intellect, players will get their attributes from the intellect, else they will utilize the other primary stat. Players cannot utilize both attributes at the same time.\nStamina.\nStamina is the source of all &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly all armor has stamina on it, and all classes and specializations wear armor with stamina on it, but &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt; generally have the most. Players convert stamina into an increasing amount of health based on character level, scaling up to 20 health per point of stamina at level 60. Some tank specializations have an additional stamina modifier.\nBefore \"Warlords of Draenor\", players had &lt;a href=\"base%20health\"&gt;base health&lt;/a&gt; that was independent of stamina, but this is no longer the case. As with the other primary attributes, players still have &lt;a href=\"Base%20attributes%23Stamina\"&gt;base stamina&lt;/a&gt; at all character levels that provides an innate level of health, even while not wearing any gear.\nStrength.\nStrength increases &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt; and is the most important stat for &lt;a href=\"plate%20armor\"&gt;plate armor&lt;/a&gt;-wearing classes in the &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage-dealing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; role. This includes:\nFor plate-wearing classes, strength also converts into &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgility.\nAgility increases melee and ranged &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt;, and is the most important stat for most &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mail%20armor\"&gt;mail armor&lt;/a&gt;-wearing classes in the &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage-dealing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; role. This includes:\nFor most mail- and leather-wearing classes, agility also converts into &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntellect.\nIntellect increases &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt; and is the most important stat for &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;-using classes wearing any armor type in the &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage-dealing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;spell caster&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; role. This includes:\nSecondary attributes.\nThere are four secondary attributes: crit, haste, mastery, and versatility. The four all-role attributes may appear on any piece of gear, two secondary attributes per item (with the exception of trinkets).\nThe intent is that all four secondary attributes are close, but not necessarily equal, in value to each other for all classes and specializations.\nCritical Strike.\n&lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Crit\") grants damaging attacks and healing spells a chance to deal 200% of the effect in PvE. That is, if an attack on a creature normally lands for around 1,000 damage, a crit will land for 2,000 damage. While in PvP, critical hits and heals will land for 150% of the effect. There are exceptions, as various abilities can crit for more or less than the baseline.\nPlayers have a 5% base crit chance at all character levels. Additionally, agility users have the passive &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strikes\"&gt;Critical Strikes&lt;/a&gt;, which increases their crit chance by an additional 5%.\nHaste.\n&lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; affects the rate at which melee and ranged auto-attacks are dealt, the cast time of spells, the tick rate of &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"channeled\"&gt;channeled&lt;/a&gt; spells, the channel time of spells, and spells' &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, haste increases the regeneration rate of &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rune%20system\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"focus\"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt;. There are no haste breakpoints, as DoTs and HoTs will add partial ticks at the end as needed, equal in damage/healing to the ratio of that time and the full tick time.\nMastery.\n&lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt; is an attribute that has different effects for each class specialization. For instance, the unholy death knight mastery, , increases damage dealt, while the elemental shaman mastery, , grants a chance for certain shaman spells to strike again for reduced damage. Masteries are learned at level 10 for all classes and specializations.\nVersatility.\n&lt;a href=\"Versatility\"&gt;Versatility&lt;/a&gt; increases outgoing damage, healing, and absorbs and to a lesser extent, reduces incoming damage. With 5% Versatility, players do 5% more damage and healing, enlarge their absorbs (like ) by 5%, and take 2.5% less damage. The healing increase applies to certain self-heals as well.\nTertiary attributes.\nAdded in \"\", minor attributes are one of three rare bonus properties on gear. Each individual \"Warlords\"-level piece of gear crafted or looted has a slim chance to come with a maximum of one minor stat on it.\nThe other bonus properties are a &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;gem socket&lt;/a&gt;, and the indestructible property. Extremely rarely, gear may have any two or all three bonus properties on it. For example, one copy of an item may have avoidance and a gem socket on it, another copy of the same item may have speed and leech, while a third copy may have no bonus properties whatsoever. See for more information on bonus item properties.\nThe design intent of these bonus properties is to limit the prevalence of \"&lt;a href=\"BiS\"&gt;best in slot&lt;/a&gt;\"-seeking in players. Over the course of WoW, players have increasingly perceived the obligation to always be optimal in their gearing, when playing their class better would have had much more of an effect on killing the boss. Instead, players should \"aim for what upgrades are most practical and useful\".\nAvoidance.\n&lt;a href=\"Avoidance%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;Avoidance&lt;/a&gt; reduces the amount of damage taken from &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; attacks, much like how most player pets and minions already have &lt;a href=\"Avoidance%20%28passive%29\"&gt;Avoidance (passive)&lt;/a&gt;. Players will not have nearly as much avoidance as pets \u2014 the goal is to soften the blow of AoE attacks a bit, not to allow players to stand in the fire.\nIndestructible.\n&lt;a href=\"Indestructible\"&gt;Indestructible&lt;/a&gt; pieces of gear are immune to &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; damage in any form.\nLeech.\n&lt;a href=\"Leech\"&gt;Leech&lt;/a&gt; causes players to gain health from a proportion of outgoing damage and a larger proportion of outgoing heals.\nSpeed.\n&lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; increases players' movement speed. Speed is calculated additively (not multiplicatively), and most movement speed buffs will stack. For example, two separate 50% movement speed increases will result in 200% movement speed, not 225%. Prior to \"Warlords\", increased movement speed as a property existed in the form of enchants like &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%27s%20Step\"&gt;Pandaren's Step&lt;/a&gt;, but now appears directly on gear.\nDerived combat attributes.\nMany attributes do not appear directly on gear, but are instead derived from other attributes. These derived attributes are what actually affect combat. Derived attributes are split based on role. Damage dealers either attack using physical attacks (either from melee or at range), or spells. Healers as a rule cast spells, so their attributes are also listed in the spell category. Tanks are primarily concerned with defensive attributes.\nPhysical.\nMost physical attributes are split into a melee and ranged version of the same stat:\nRemoved Attributes.\nMultistrike.\n&lt;a href=\"Multistrike\"&gt;Multistrike&lt;/a&gt; gives most abilities up to two separate chances to hit their original target an additional time for 30% of the original amount in PvE. For instance, if a player has 25% multistrike, abilities have \"two\" chances at 25% probability to strike again. In PvP only one such chance is available. This chance applies to damaging attacks, either single-targeted or area of effect, and also to heals, but not to status-affecting attacks like &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, each tick of a &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt; had an independent chance to land a multistrike. Multistrikes crit independently of the original attack\u2014that is, the main attack does not have to crit for the multistrike to crit.\nMultistrikes are treated as &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;s, not additional casts. In general, multistrikes will not proc other effects, but there are a few class abilities that depend on a multistrike landing, much like the handful of class abilities that react to crits landing.\nMultistrike was introduced with patch 6.0.2 in \"Warlords of Draenor\" and only existed in this expansion. With patch 7.0.3 in \"Legion\", all equipment bearing Multistrike were itemized with Versatility instead, and the Multistrike stat was removed.\nBonus Armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Bonus%20armor\"&gt;Bonus Armor&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;-only stat, and provides &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; that would not normally appear on non-armor items. It largely exists to give tanks items useful only to them, as tanks are generally vastly outnumbered in groups. Bonus Armor was \"re-added\" in \"Warlords of Draenor\" to fill the role that &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; used to. Bonus Armor also provides attack power through the passive ability &lt;a href=\"Bladed%20Armor\"&gt;Bladed Armor&lt;/a&gt;. This attribute had already existed prior to becoming official, as some legacy items (namely: PvP gear, certain cloth and leather armor, and certain cloaks and rings) had additional armor itemized on them.\nSpirit.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;-only stat, and increases their &lt;a href=\"mana%20regeneration\"&gt;mana regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. As with bonus armor, spirit largely exists to give healers items useful only to them. Spirit has changed drastically since launch, and over the years has drifted from being a primary stat to a secondary. Spirit's status as a secondary stat was formalized in \"Warlords of Draenor\".\nSpirit is of no use and should be avoided for any class or spec in a mana-using damage-dealing role (such as balance &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, shadow &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, elemental &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s) due to how their classes' mana regeneration works. Spirit was removed from the game in \"Legion\" and converted into &lt;a href=\"Versatility\"&gt;Versatility&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt; if the item already had Versatility on it.\nSpell Penetration.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Penetration\"&gt;Spell Penetration&lt;/a&gt; (originally itemized as \"Decreases the magical resistances of your spell targets by X.\") was the counter to &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, allowing players to bypass an enemy's resistance on a point-by-point basis: 1 point of spell penetration reduced the target's resistances to all schools by 1. Spell penetration could not lower an enemy's resistances below 0. It was converted into PvP Power or subsequently removed in \"Mists of Pandaria\", when Resistances were retired. Unlike resistances, the Spell Penetration attribute is no longer available on any legacy items.\nUnused Attributes.\nResistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; provides a chance to resist spells and have spell damage reduced by increments of 25%, up to 100% (full resist). Resistance was tracked independently for all six schools of magic (Arcane, Fire, Frost, Holy, Nature, Shadow), but while Holy Resistance exists as an attribute in the game files, it was never made available on any items, and was never displayed in the character sheet. Items which claimed to give \"X\" amount to \"All Resistances\" did not give resistance to Holy damage.\nResistance as a stat was common and important in certain legacy encounters, but was removed from the character sheet in \"Mists of Pandaria\". Resistance still remains itemized on pre-\"Mists\" items, and can still function when worn in adequate amounts at lower levels. Resistance was granted either to a specific school (+40 Frost Resistance) or to all schools except Holy (e.g. +15 All Resistances).\nPvP Attributes.\nIn addition to the other secondary attributes, there were two &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;-only attributes that functioned as counterparts to each another:\nPvP Power and PvP Resilience were phased out beginning with and is no longer available on any items since patch 8.3.0 in \",\" while the attribute still \"technically\" exists in game files."}

These are sometimes referred to as simply \"stats\".\nA number of secondary attributes affect specific areas of combat more directly and are often influenced in some way by a primary attribute. Secondary attributes include critical strike rate, damage absorption, attack power, spell power, and many others.\nAll characters inherently have some amount of each attribute that increases with &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; depending mainly on class. For example, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; will have more base intellect than a rogue, who will have more base agility. Increasing these attributes is mainly done with &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; (from items' base stats, as well as improvements from &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s, temporary effects such as &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;s, and many other means.\nNearly all &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; mechanics rely in some way on one or more character attributes.

{"id": "66389", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=66389", "title": "Attumen the Huntsman", "text": "Attumen the Huntsman is the proud owner of , the strongest horse in the stables. If his horse is put in danger, he will rush to defend and destroy the attackers. As the first and easiest boss in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, he is considered a &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt; for any adventurers who wish to delve deeper into Karazhan. Attumen is optional; it is not necessary to kill him in order to progress to the later bosses. &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maiden%20of%20Virtue\"&gt;Maiden of Virtue&lt;/a&gt; are both considered to be substantially tougher.\nAttacks and abilities.\nAt the start, &lt;a href=\"Midnight\"&gt;Midnight&lt;/a&gt; is alone. When she's at 95%, her master Attumen spawns, right at Midnight's spot. When either reaches 25% health, Attumen mounts Midnight and gains the Berserker Charge ability.\nAttumen\n&lt;a href=\"Midnight\"&gt;Midnight&lt;/a&gt;\nPreparation and Cleanup.\nThe trash undead leading up to Attumen has a 25 minute respawn timer unless Attumen has been defeated. Therefore it is important for the raid to make role assignments before beginning, and to keep moving once the first monster has been killed. Dead players should release and run back in rather than wait for resurrection; tanks should continue pulling as long as they and healers aren't suffering for health and mana, respectively.\n&lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Stable%20Hand\"&gt;Spectral Stable Hand&lt;/a&gt;s should be killed first due to their heal spell. &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; may be used to control other adds. If trash has respawned or has been skipped, those nearby (up to approximately 25 mobs) will join the fight when Midnight is aggro'd. This is probably undesirable even for high level players, since they are still vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Charger\"&gt;Spectral Charger&lt;/a&gt;s' stun.\nOnce Attumen is down, clear the several mobs near &lt;a href=\"Koren\"&gt;Koren&lt;/a&gt;, in the next area after Midnight. He is required for quests, and characters with at least Honored reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; can use him to repair and purchase Blacksmithing recipes.\nStrategy.\nAssign a tank for Midnight and another tank for Attumen. It's best if the Attumen tank is a warrior, to easily disarm Attumen. The Midnight tank is best one that can swap to damage-dealing after Attumen mounts up. Arms warriors or feral druids can typically do this. It's also possible for a well-geared paladin to tank both Attumen and Midnight simultaneously. Assign healers to these two tanks and leave a third for raid healing.\nPhase One - Midnight.\nPhase One starts when Midnight is attacked and lasts until she is reduced to 95% of her health. She is neutral (yellow) and will not attack until she is attacked herself. She calls any respawned undead horse trash to assist her, and initiates a basic heavy melee attack. If Midnight calls any trash, put the Attumen tank on the trash and kill it before initiating Phase Two. Better yet, clear fast enough that there is no such trash.\nPhase One is a brief tank-and-spank. The only issue is making sure that the damage-dealers don't pull aggro off of the tank. Simply allow the tank a few moments to build threat, then attack with light damage output. A warrior Attumen tank can build rage by attacking Midnight with white damage.\nPhase Two - Midnight and Attumen.\nPhase Two starts when Midnight is reduced to 95% health. Attumen spawns near Midnight and begins attacking immediately. He uses his Shadow Cleave and his Intangible Presence curse.\nThe main danger during Phase Two is right at the beginning. A healer can get aggro and die before the Attumen tank establishes any threat. This generally leads to an eventual wipe. If this happens, run out of the Stables area to reset the fight. Quickly run back in, re-buff, and re-start the fight before respawns start.\nWhen Attumen spawns, healers should momentarily stop healing until his tank picks him up, preferably using instant AoE threat generation, such as &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Trade\"&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/a&gt;, if a higher level rogue is present) may be used just prior to the phase transition to help the Attumen tank. Once Attumen is securely hitting the tank, he should be led a short distance away from Midnight, and faced away from the rest of the raid to avoid errant &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Cleave\"&gt;Shadow Cleave&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWarriors and rogues in the raid should keep Attument &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;ed and use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Reflection\"&gt;Spell Reflection&lt;/a&gt; to bounce the curse back onto the boss. Both of these tricks weaken Attumen considerably. The curse should be removed from disarmers and tanks in particular. Healers should conserve mana as much as possible; it's a long fight. Phase 2 lasts until either Midnight or Attumen is reduced to 25% health.\nAttumen may also be damaged during this Phase, resulting in lower health upon entering Phase 3. Trading damage on Midnight (which reduces time in Phase 2) for damage on Attumen (which reduces the eventual time in Phase 3) is ultimately a tradeoff between more time spent healing Midnight's melee attacks (Phase 2) and more time spent dealing with Attumen's Berserker Charge (Phase 3). However, the Charge is avoidable, so most raids focus on transitioning quickly, in which case only classes that can efficiently multi-attack (usually via multi-DoT) should damage Attumen.\nPhase Three - Mounted Attumen.\nThe final phase begins when either Attumen or Midnight is brought down to 25% health. Attumen mounts Midnight and the two of them fight as a single opponent. If Midnight has more health than Attumen, Attumen's health percentage goes up to Midnight's. Attumen gains the Berserker Charge ability, and continues using his Shadow Cleave and Intangible Presence abilities.\nAttumen wipes threat at this transition, so similar tactics as in Phase 2 should be used to reestablish it: briefly stop healing and attacking, use &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;, and use instant AoE threat abilities. Attumen should once again face away from the raid, and the same de-cursing and disarming routines should be maintained.\nThe former Midnight tank should switch to dealing damage with the rest of the raid. Everyone except the tank should stand immediately behind Attumen, so they cannot be hit by Berserker Charge or Shadow Cleave. Berserker Charge has a minimum range of eight yards. Even hunters can attack from less than that range, so nobody needs to get hit with the Charge. If Attumen manages to Charge someone anyway, he returns directly to the tank afterward, so the tank should not move. Attumen does not use Shadow Cleave until he reaches the tank, so it's safe for him to run back through the rest of the raid after the charge.\nThe main threats associated with Phase Three are pulling aggro away from the tank and the healers running out of mana. Generally, however, this is an easy phase of an easy fight.\nQuotes.\nListen to these in-game with the scripts &lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Karazhan%23.C2.A0Attumen%20the%20Huntsman\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

The hall turns hard left at the end, and there are windows on both sides in the new hall; you will take the window on the left with the cannons in front of it (essentially straight ahead of you if you just angle/jog a bit left when hall turns hard left). Jump through the window onto the ground. There will be some patrols, but they are far enough away not to attack. Turn immediately right and you will see an open door. Go through it.\nTurn left and walk off the ledge. You will land just behind the Shadowforge Door, on a bridge with a patrol near the middle and two elementals at the far end. Keep to the right edge, skirt the patrol, and move to the middle of the bridge, where you can then walk between the first three pairs of elementals. Pause before the last set of elementals and watch &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; doing laps around the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Wait until he is moving away from you. Run in and make an immediate left off the bridge and into the lava, and quickly out of the lava onto the ledge ahead on your left (if you have Levitate, you can reach the ledge without hitting the lava; also note that this is where you will begin if you use Direbrew's Remote as mentioned above). Jumping up out of the lava as you move seems to avoid some damage, so do this when possible. \nFollow this ledge north around the cavern, passing one island, keeping out of the lava where possible, until the ledge angles up out of the lava and ends. You will see a second island ahead of you to the east with Four Fireguard Destroyers. The Molten Core bridge that is your ultimate destination is just beyond this island.\nGetting to the Molten Core bridge.\nNow you need to cross the lava and stand on the near edge of that island. Avoid the Fireguard Destroyers patrolling the lava between you and the island, which are easy to spot if you have Show Enemy Name Plates enabled (default toggle-key 'V'), and swim-jump to the edge of the island, out of aggro range of the elementals there (see screenshot). Take a breather and heal up. Your final goal is in sight. \nWait for the Fireguard nearest you to head to the right, and then jump back into the lava on the left. Continue east through the lava, hugging the left wall, to a ramp leading out of the lava, passing under the bridge. Turn left, and hug the right wall very tightly, as you come out very close to an elemental on your left. You now stand before the bridge to &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting past the bridge elementals.\nStealth again to get past these three elementals and the next three elementals at the far end of the bridge. \nGet the &lt;a href=\"Core%20Fragment\"&gt;Core Fragment&lt;/a&gt; from the stalagmite on the left next to the Molten Core entrance. \nYou can now exit Blackrock Depths by grouping with someone, converting to raid, then entering Molten Core and immediately exiting. It'll exit the instance and bring you right to Lothos Riftwalker where you can turn in the quest for your reward. You are now attuned to the Molten Core!"}

It was the location of one of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20seal\"&gt;three seals&lt;/a&gt; that bound &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; until it was broken millennia ago by &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt;. Mythrax was subsequently defeated by &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt;, after which the three &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; worked together to cast a barrier around the pyramid and seal the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse within to prevent anyone from raising the creature again. Each of the Keepers then created a keystone, imbued with their power, to ensure that the tomb would remain undisturbed. Eventually, Korthek began plotting to revive Mythrax in order to use the creature to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. He declared himself emperor, formed the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, and killed Sulthis, but not before the latter hid away his keystone. The Faithless and their allies, the &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sand%20troll\"&gt;sand troll&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;, then began searching Vol'dun for the remaining keys that would allow them to break the barrier around Atul'Aman.\nIn the current day, Sandfury forces are camped around the eastern terraces surrounding the entrance into the pyramid's main chamber containing the broken seal. The &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Passage\"&gt;Abandoned Passage&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest along with an opening in the pyramid's northwestern base lead into the lower areas below the surface, the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Crypt\"&gt;Fetid Crypt&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Font\"&gt;Blood Font&lt;/a&gt;, which are overrun with &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; corruption. All three entrances into Atul'Aman are normally blocked by the Keepers' magic. The &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20Hideout\"&gt;Sandfury Hideout&lt;/a&gt; lies in the dunes on the structure's north side, while the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Dunes\"&gt;Eastern Dunes&lt;/a&gt; stretch to the east and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt; lie directly to the south. A small &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; camp inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Daxx%20Bombhand\"&gt;Daxx Bombhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elisa%20Veilsong\"&gt;Elisa Veilsong&lt;/a&gt; sits above the northwestern entrance.\nWhile passing by Atul'Aman in search of &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; encountered Jakra'zet and his servant &lt;a href=\"Grozztok%20the%20Blackheart\"&gt;Grozztok the Blackheart&lt;/a&gt; in front the main entrance, unsuccessfully trying to find a way past the barrier. Later, the adventurer discovered &lt;a href=\"Sulthis%27%20Keystone\"&gt;Sulthis' keystone&lt;/a&gt; in Zul'Ahjin and brought it to Vorrik, who stored it alongside &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Keystone\"&gt;his own key&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik and the adventurer then went to confront Korthek in his stronghold, leaving Rakera and &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt; to protect the keys. However, while Vorrik and his allies were battling Korthek, the latter revealed that he had already given his key to Jakra'zet. After killing the emperor and returning to the sanctuary, Vorrik and the adventurer found that Jakra'zet's forces had attacked the temple and stolen the remaining two keys, allowing the general to break the seal on Atul'Aman (opening up all three entrances into the pyramid). Vorrik and the adventurer caught up with Rakera and Kaja below Atul'Aman, but they were ultimately unable to stop Jakra'zet: the general sacrificed himself by jumping into the Blood Font, providing the final blood sacrifice needed to raise Mythrax and forcing the adventurer and their companions to flee for their lives.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Elleryn\"&gt;Arcanist Elleryn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Preservation%20Society\"&gt;Magical Preservation Society&lt;/a&gt; was present below the pyramid, in front of the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Font\"&gt;Blood Font&lt;/a&gt;. There, she wished to study the magical &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; seal that blocked entry into the pyramid, but has to be protected by Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Grogash\"&gt;Commander Grogash&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Scout%20%28Vol%27dun%29\"&gt;Horde Scouts&lt;/a&gt;.\nInhabitants.\nIn front of the eastern entrance:\nAt the Reliquary camp on the north side:\nAt the northwestern tunnel entrance while &lt;a href=\"Running%20Interference\"&gt;Running Interference&lt;/a&gt; is available:"}
