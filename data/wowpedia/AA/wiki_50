Led by the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and guided by the divine &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, they traveled throughout the cosmos in search of a safe world to settle on, eventually landing on a planet they would come to call &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Exiles' Refuge\". For centuries, the draenei lived in relative peace with Draenor's native &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, until agents of the Burning Legion found them. As the orcs were corrupted by the Legion and formed the original &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei were &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;slaughtered en masse&lt;/a&gt; and driven into hiding.\nDecades later, the survivors managed to escape the ravaged world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", a vessel of the naaru fortress &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but crashed upon the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; more specifically, on the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; off the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by tales of the heroic &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that stood against the might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei joined their ranks and led the charge during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei completed the desperate mission that first brought them to Azeroth, and some of them were sent back to Outland to revitalize their former civilization. However, the majority vowed to stay and uphold their sacred commitment to the Alliance, as Velen saw through a powerful vision that a great war between the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; was fast approaching, and that Azeroth would be its principal battleground.\nThe draenei as they are known today were first introduced with ', though corrupted draenei \u2014 later identified as &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were seen as early as '. The draenei of also play a significant role in the \"\" expansion.\nHistory.\nLife on Argus.\nLong ago, on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race arose. They were extremely intelligent and had a natural affinity for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in all of its forms. Using their gifts, they developed a vast and wondrous society, in which art, science, magic, and &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; were all as one. They were aided in this development by an ancient artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;, a triangular crystal whose origin was a mystery to the eredar, though their legends suggested it had been a gift bestowed upon them in ancient times.\nAt the height of their society, 13,000 years ago, the eredar's three most prominent leaders, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, were approached by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Fallen Titan. Sargeras claimed he was impressed by the work of the eredar and wanted to supply them with even more power and knowledge in exchange for their loyalty. But while Kil'jaeden and Archimonde readily accepted the deal, Velen had doubts. After touching the Ata'mal crystal in its temple, he had a vision of the future that filled him with dread. He saw the dark future his people were heading towards: siding with the dark titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; saw the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in all its terrible might and witnessed the destruction it would wreak upon all of creation. He hastened to warn &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, but they dismissed his concerns and proceeded to profess loyalty to Sargeras. Together, the latter transformed a majority of their people into an insidious race of warlocks and later allied themselves with the Legion.\nVelen knew he and those who shared his concerns would have to flee Argus, but the impossibility of such a feat brought him to despair. At that time, the Ata'mal crystal started to glow and arose from its pedestal. A voice came to Velen and explained that it was one of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, a race of sapient energy beings bent on stopping the Burning Legion. The naaru, &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, offered to take Velen and any other like-minded eredar to safety and instructed Velen to bring the Ata'mal crystal, revealing that it had been a gift from the naaru in ancient times and a beacon by which the naaru would find Velen and his followers. Deeply relieved, Velen gathered the other eredar loyal to him on the appointed day at the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%27s%20End\"&gt;appointed place&lt;/a&gt;; they numbered only in the hundreds. He entrusted an old friend, &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;, in this task, but Talgath was himself seduced by Sargeras' tantalizing offer and betrayed Velen and his cohorts to Kil'jaeden. With Kil'jaeden and Archimonde hot on their heels, they barely escaped from Argus in the naaru ship \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". In their escape, the Ata'mal crystal was shattered into seven shards. The naaru &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed her well-being by staying behind to delay their pursuers and buy them more time.\nKil'jaeden was furious with Talgath's failure and what he felt was Velen's betrayal, and the demon vowed to hunt Velen and the rest of his followers to the ends of the cosmos if need be.\nNaming themselves the \"draenei\", or \"exiled ones\" in the &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, they hid among many worlds and explored much of the cosmos in their quest to find safe harbor. Still, a hell-bent Kil'jaeden would not give up his pursuit; deciding on mercy for Talgath, he sent his new agent to hunt them down. Meanwhile, the enigmatic naaru race blessed the draenei with Light-given knowledge and power. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion. One day the naaru would forge them into a single unstoppable &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals.\nIn the following years, the draenei temporarily visited dozens of worlds aboard the \"Genedar\", but not all of them were aboard the ship, as the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" and those draenei who would later become &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; split off some time after they fled Argus.\nRefuge on Draenor.\nMore than 200 years before the First War, Velen and his draenei settled upon a remote and peaceful world that seemed an ideal refuge. They named it Draenor, and there they quietly cultivated their society once again. Ever wary of being discovered again by Kil'jaeden's forces, Velen and his mystics kept their magic hidden.\nThe arrival of the draenei had also changed their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish neighbors' society. With the crash of the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" ship in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs had adopted the new crystal mountain as &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mountain of Spirits\". The orcs started holding their &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festivals at the foot of Oshu'gun, communing there with their dead ancestors' spirits. The draenei themselves were peaceful toward the orcs; coming now and then to each &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, ready to trade their carefully crafted tools and weapons and decorative pieces of carved stone in exchange for the thick pelts of the forest animals, brightly woven blankets, and raw materials the ores culled from land and stone. For the orcs, the relationship was a curiosity, an occasion of interest in the clans, but the exchanges only lasted a few hours. The draenei did not invite closeness, and no clan leader had ever asked them to stay and share their hospitality. Relationships were cordial but aloof, and everyone involved seemed to want it that way.\nHowever, no amount of preparation could keep the draenei hidden forever. Eventually, Talgath\u2014after millennia of pursuit\u2014stumbled upon Draenor sensing the sweet minting essence of eredar magic, and reported back to Kil'jaeden.\nKil'jaeden, however, ordered him to investigate this world. After confirming the presence of the draenei, the Deceiver asked for information regarding the other inhabitants of that world, particularly the orcs. The man'ari lord decided to \"punish\" the exiles: he wanted them dead, but broken and humiliated. Through his orc prot\u00e9g\u00e9 &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, he quickly succeeded in corrupting the shamanistic orcs. Smoothly manipulated from a state of wary acceptance into blind rage and blood lust, the orcs attacked the draenei. This bloody conflict lasted nearly eight years, but the orcs' triumph was unequivocal. The orcs killed over eighty percent of the draenei race: approximately nine of every ten individuals. and sent the rest fleeing for safety to the remote corners of the world.\nKil'jaeden's revenge was complete, or so he thought \u2014 Velen and a handful of untransformed draenei have survived the destruction of their cities by the orcs and fled to one of the marshes on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;; presumably it was either the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Shore\"&gt;Zangar Shore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt;, as they were the closest to Shattrath. Draenei who had fought the Horde and survived found that they had been affected by the &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;fel energies&lt;/a&gt; wielded so freely by the orc warlocks, and both &lt;a href=\"anchorite\"&gt;anchorite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s alike, such as &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, immediately found their link to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; had been broken. These draenei have since mutated into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;lesser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a series of subspecies.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the scattered and desperate draenei saw &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt; drive back the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. These acts gave the draenei hope, and they began plans to send some of their people on a diplomatic mission, preluding their move to Azeroth decades later.\nEscape from Outland.\nOne group of Lost Ones battling the fel orcs were led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, Elder Sage of the draenei, and were slowly losing. Cursed orcs under the command of Magtheridon, a terrible lord whose &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; lied to the west, hunted the draenei to the brink of extinction. With the help of Illidan and Kael'thas the draenei hoped to turn the balance in their favor and rid themselves of the fel orcs once and for all. With Illidan's help, they fought back to retake their ancestral lands and hoped that they would end their curse forever.\nAfter coming to Draenor, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; discovered the power of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and successfully seized it. To escape, the draenei came out of hiding and managed to wrestle control of a wing of the keep, \"The Exodar\", and tried to use it to flee and find aid in retaking their home. Before they could, however, the blood elves managed to sabotage what is essentially the \"engine\" of the draenei's &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Ship\"&gt;transdimensional travel&lt;/a&gt;. The remainder of the Keep lies in Outland in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and is now the home of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival on Azeroth.\nWhen the draenei tried to planeshift, their sabotaged engine went haywire, and \"The &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" ended up hurtling out of control through the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; until it crash-landed on a chain of islands, the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, off the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Their arrival on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; wasn't pretty \u2014 they ended up tearing up the landscape over on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst\"&gt;Azuremyst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. While they were of course concerned about their fellow survivors, they were just as concerned with what they'd done to the land and the creatures on it. As the surviving draenei salvaged what they could of their ship and tried to help what was left of their people, they began exploring this new world. Eventually, they came to discover that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; (known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;) had followed them to Azeroth to murder them, enslave &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, and steal the Exodar. After fending off the blood elven incursions, the draenei rescued an injured &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; who thought the draenei to be their demonic &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; kin. Inspired by heroic tales of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and its victories against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei sought out and pledged their loyalty to this courageous faction. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; had long foreseen the friendship the draenei would have with the noble Alliance and his prophecy came to fruition when his people made the first contact with the residents of &lt;a href=\"Odesyus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Odesyus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they uncovered a conspiracy to harm the Alliance and the draenei involving the Sunfury, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, and their traitorous agents: &lt;a href=\"Engineer%20%22Spark%22%20Overgrind\"&gt;Engineer \"Spark\" Overgrind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt;. After further investigation, it is discovered that the traitor eredar Sironas (who has been hiding among the draenei populace) has been leading a group of blood elves called the &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s in abducting draenei survivors, torturing them until they willingly desire to become man'ari eredar, and also opening &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gate\"&gt;Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt;s to prime Kalimdor for a blood elven invasion.\nAfter securing &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei of the \"Exodar\" recognized they would require allies and resources to fend off future threats. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; readily offered her help to the draenei, and &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Paetheus\"&gt;Anchorite Paetheus&lt;/a&gt; sent draenei adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, the closest Alliance settlement, to propose cooperation in the fight against their common foes. They have also sent &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20Valustraa\"&gt;Emissary Valustraa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20Taluun\"&gt;Emissary Taluun&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to maintain diplomatic ties with their new allies and direct their adventurers to support their allies in their troubled lands. Eventually, the Alliance destroyed the Sun Gate and defeated Sironas and her &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s; which consequently prevented Prince Kael'thas from invading Kalimdor and corrupting the draenei into demons.\nNot long afterward, Velen and his noble refugees played a key role in urging the Alliance to invade Outland and disrupt the Legion's nefarious activities. Armed with their unshakable faith in the Light, the draenei ventured to their embattled former home as steadfast members of the Alliance and defeated their ancient demonic rivals. The return to Outland offered many draenei a chance to reconnect with their brethren who had been left behind. Among those who remained behind, the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt; decided to stay at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt; in order to reestablish a presence at their holy places across the broken world. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Amaan%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Amaan the Wise&lt;/a&gt; notably sent the adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Aggonar\"&gt;Pools of Aggonar&lt;/a&gt;, in order to cleanse it of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that infected these waters once sacred to the draenei. After their success, Amaan announced that they could finally begin their work to restore the pools to their former purity.\nIn Shattrath City, a small remnant of the draenei priesthood still conducted its rites in a ruined temple. This remnant, known as the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, were more than happy to see the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, and with their combined efforts, &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; began to truly flourish for the first time in years. Unfortunately, the tentative peace was not to last \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s armies began to attack, including a large regiment of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. These blood elves, led by Voren'thal, were sent to lay waste to the city when something unexpected happened: The blood elves lay down their weapons, and &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal\"&gt;Voren'thal&lt;/a&gt; stormed into the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;, demanding to speak to A'dal. Kneeling before the naaru, Voren'thal simply said: \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\" Voren'thal took up residence along with his followers, forming the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nMeanwhile, the blood elves of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; had been siphoning the Light from a naaru named &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; that had been given to them by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, using its energies to form an order of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; that bore the same powers as &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. Kael'thas Sunstrider, unhappy with Illidan's lack of progress, decided to move a step up on the food chain and ally himself with the Burning Legion \u2014 specifically Kil'jaeden. So Kael'thas took M'uru from the blood elves and fled to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, intent on bringing Kil'jaeden to Azeroth. The Aldor and Scryers immediately dropped their petty bickering and differences and threw themselves into the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of the naaru. This is where the line blurs even further between the two races \u2014 both worked together, as one, to take back the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'danas&lt;/a&gt;, and both encouraged Alliance and Horde to work together. And it was by working together that the Shattered Sun Offensive succeeded in retaking the Isle and to prevent Kil'jaeden's return. M'uru, who had become a darkened naaru and perished, however, Velen appeared shortly thereafter and uses the naaru M'uru's \"spark\" to reignite the Sunwell, returning the blood elves' \"fount of power.\"\nWhile some of Velen's race chose to rebuild their society in the shattered land, the majority of draenei remained on Azeroth, vowing to uphold their commitment to the Alliance.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, a few draenei could be found in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Yaala\"&gt;Vindicator Yaala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Vurenn\"&gt;Harbinger Vurenn&lt;/a&gt; investigate the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, who have stowed away to Northrend on an Alliance ship. &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius the Wise&lt;/a&gt; helped the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with a vision in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; was traveling aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. They also made a presence at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; later on. The sudden absence of the draenei was explained in Borean Tundra, where draenei that have traveled to Northrend were told they were not needed in the north, due to the meddling of the Cult of the Damned.\nProphet's Lesson.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; in deep contemplation on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;' leaders returned to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" in an effort to reconnect with their brethren on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and convened to discuss their people's future on Azeroth in light of the \"Exodar\"'s repair. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; came before them, and was outspoken with his opinion: that the draenei should leave to rebuild their second home on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and assist the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s remaining behind. The &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt; agreed, and it was decided that unless Velen ordered otherwise, within a week the \"Exodar\" would take flight for old Draenor.\nTensions were raised by the presence of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; refugees from across the ocean, who had come to Azuremyst to seek Velen - whom they saw as a mighty deity - and the draenei's protection. However, violence broke out when the increasingly paranoid refugees began slurring the vindicators as \"demons\" and became belligerent. Unsurprisingly, the battle was one-sided in the angered vindicators' favor, leaving the humans broken and dispersed. Following the conflict, Velen himself emerged to quell the unrest, and peace was restored. It was then decided that the draenei would remain on Azeroth to combat the incoming threat.\nCataclysm.\nSometime after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Anchorite Avuun&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt; eager to learn all that he can from &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. Avuun has faith that there is a way to bring the Lost Ones back from the brink and find a way to cure the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies that have consumed them. He worked for years to try to cure the affliction of the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;. The foul energies that corrupted them did more than twist their bodies - it took the comfort of the Light from them so they cannot feel its warmth. Avuun was also eager to help &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt; who became ill and grew weaker every second. Avuun desperately sought a remedy to cure Magtoor but despaired when his remedy failed. As Magtoor began to pass away, Avuun pondered why the Light forsook the innocent. A portal from the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" opened and Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; stepped through. Velen explained that the Light wishes suffering on none, but it does not reign unopposed in their realm. As Magtoor had embraced his plight bravely he was ready to return to the embrace of the Light. In his final moments, Velen performed an unction on Magtoor as he passed away.\nAt some point prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a number of draenei led by &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt; moved into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. While some of them are seen in the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, others settled with the &lt;a href=\"Highvale\"&gt;Highvale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; to train in the ways of the Light and enjoy the peaceful beauty of the region. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; offensive in all the continent, the lodge came under attack. With the help of adventurers, the elves and the draenei settlers were able to repel the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Invader\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt;. The Highvale documents were also retrieved from the chaos by Alliance adventurers and safely delivered to &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Traska\"&gt;Anchorite Traska&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei from an alternate timeline were a major Alliance force in theur battle against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; , which took place in the of past &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 35 years in the past. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; onslaught threatened draenei cities such as and and the cornered draenei aligned themselves with the Alliance expedition from Azeroth in order to stop the advancing orcish armies.\n&lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; also made his return as one of the key characters of the Alliance forces in .\nLegion.\nAfter the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, many of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest defending factions such as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were diminished from their defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s have emerged to take up the fight against the Burning Legion and have rallied together to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; became a prominent leader of the Armies of Legionfall and under his guidance, the Armies of Legionfall orchestrated some impressive victories against the Legion during their &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. While the Armies of Legionfall were preoccupied with the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; campaign, the &lt;a href=\"prime%20naaru\"&gt;prime naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, sent her &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt; to transmit an urgent message to the defenders of Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class order leader&lt;/a&gt;s secured Light's Heart and traveled to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" to get the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the message. Unfortunately, a Burning Legion army under the command of Velen's corrupted son, &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;assaulted the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed O'ros. The draenei and the Legionfall champions fended off the Legion incursion and were forced to slay Rakeesh, much to Velen's sorrow. Still, this trespass by the Legion has solidified Velen's resolve to strike back against the Burning Legion.\nThe Armies of Legionfall were able to unlock Xe'ra's message of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; being a foretold person of importance in the Legion's defeat, and worked to revive the fallen &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;. After which, Illidan, Khadgar, and Velen led an army of Legionfall champions against the Legion's forces in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in order to sever the Legion's connection to Azeroth. The Armies of Legionfall managed to defeat the Legion forces at Sargeras's tomb and dissipate the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, but Velen was not satisfied with the strategic victory and pursued &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. The Legionfall champions followed suit, resulting in Velen and the Legionfall champions slaying Kil'jaeden and ending his evil once and for all. The Legionfall champions returned to Azeroth to celebrate the blow dealt to the Legion. Yet Khadgar was dismayed that Illidan had forced their hands into immediately following up their victory with an invasion of the Legion's homeworld, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; since Illidan had left a rift from Azeroth to Argus open. \nAfter the Burning Legion's attack on the \"Exodar\", the draenei have been hard at work preparing to return to Argus. The draenei had completed the construction of the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", a ship to transport the heroes of Azeroth to invade the Legion's homeworld. The draenei has issued a call to arms to all of Azeroth to support the counter-offensive, and the Armies of Legionfall, the Alliance, and the Horde have answered their call. The draenei then spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and together with the Vindicaar's forces, they reunited with their long lost kin: the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and the abandoned draenei who became the &lt;a href=\"krokul\"&gt;krokul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt;. These disparate factions eventually rallied to form a resistance against the Burning Legion in Argus. Ultimately, the \"Vindicaar\"'s forces launched an attack on the Legion's capital, &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus&lt;/a&gt;, in order to free the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and Argus's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; from the Burning Legion's subversion. The Pantheon was eventually freed and the Vindicaar's champions slew &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt; created from Argus's world-soul. With Argus's world-soul destroyed, the Legion's armies could no longer regenerate their fallen and were thus broken. The Pantheon then imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei returned to Azeroth along with the rest of Azeroth's defenders and celebrated their costly victory. It was revealed, however, that the Argus Campaign had diminished the draenei greatly.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; elicited a worldwide war between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei were called once again to defend the Alliance. While the draenei of Azeroth supported the Alliance in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei from have been busy consolidating the religion of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;'s influence in their timeline. Emboldened by High Exarch &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;'s visions, the alternate draenei began a crusade to convert all of alternate Draeneor's population to the Light \u2014 by force if necessary. Yrel has amassed a group of fanatical Light believers called the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;, and though they have gained major progress in stamping out resistance to their doctrines, some of the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Clans\"&gt;Mag'har Clans&lt;/a&gt; have managed to elude them.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, some of the night elf survivors were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, under the protection of the draenei.\nCulture.\nThe draenei culture is centered around two things: the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The first is the result of their unique relationship with the naaru, while the second is the path that the eredar have always followed. As a result, draenei usually choose religious professions, such as &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, or magical ones, such as the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. Some draenei such as the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; have even mastered the art of talking to the dead. A few have started to follow the path of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, although for some draenei, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic teachings of the Broken were considered as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al and a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; against the Light.\nAs a people, the draenei have devoted themselves to preparing for the day when they will join the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, when they will finally take the fight back to the Burning Legion and atone for the sins of their &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; brethren. In spite of this overarching goal, the draenei still lead personal lives and pursue their own interests, just as other races do.\nAs far as interracial relations go, the draenei still distrust or in some cases hate the orcs after having lost so many of their kind when the orcs turned on them. Certain characteristics of modern orcs, such as their still-green skin and the fact that some still practice warlock magic (though their new allies, the humans and the gnomes, are also guilty of this), as well as personal grudges on both sides, make the road to forgiveness difficult, regardless of whatever peace initiatives Velen or Thrall are willing to launch. Nevertheless, there are still cases of acceptance between the two; for instance, the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; has accepted draenei and Broken shamans to heal Outland. The draenei are also coming to loathe the blood elves, due to the unprovoked assault on &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; by the blood elves under Kael'thas and their new methods of feeding their magical addiction. They do see that not all blood elves serve Kael'thas and even Velen himself has forebodingly told of the redemption of the elven race in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau%20epilogue\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau epilogue&lt;/a&gt;. As with any other races though, there are people among them that have strong opinions and beliefs based on first impressions: Despite the help offered by the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s acceptance of them the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; are in strict competition with them, going so far as not to associate at all with those who have chosen to side with the Scryers.\nEarly overtures of friendship with the Alliance had been met with varying degrees of success. Many of the Alliance races have trouble distinguishing the draenei from the man'ari eredar who nearly brought about their destruction. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in particular have twice suffered heavily at the hands of Archimonde. However, the draenei are quickly being accepted by most races, and ambassadors from the Exodar have been welcomed into the Alliance's halls of power \u2014 even those of the night elves, where a draenei emissary stands at the right of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nThere could be no worse insult than to remind the draenei of their kinship to the eredar of the Legion.\nDraenei do not often have children because they are so long-lived. Draenei children on are taught to keep a wide berth of shallow waters due to &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe draenei favor graceful crystalline weapons and sculptured armor.\nThe draenei do not mistreat or beat their prisoners, even during interrogation. However, they can call on the Broken, as these latter have no issues with violence.\nThe draenei built &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; to protect and shield the souls of their dead from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger eternally for draenei spirits.\nFaith.\nThe draenei society is centered around the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were introduced to the Light by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; while sailing across the cosmos aboard &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. Fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; that consumed their original home, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the enigmatic holy beings taught them the ways of the Light, though they already had a certain experience with it through Velen and &lt;a href=\"T%27uure\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion, and that one day the naaru would forge them into a single unstoppable &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, a grand Light-based coalition of all manner of races and one of Prophet Velen's ultimate goals.\nThe naaru blessed the draenei with Light-given knowledge and power, bestowed a blessing named the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; upon them to signify their new connection to the Light. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;'s sigil being visible at all times. And to this day, the power of the Light is embedded in the draenei so deeply that all of them can call upon their gift, using its power to heal themselves and others.\nDeeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals.\nAs a result, unlike the humans and dwarves, or &lt;a href=\"Light%23Influence\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, whose knowledge of the Light is tied mainly to religious sects, and the blood elves, who usually channel their powers through the Sunwell, the draenei have a more direct link to it through their relationship with the naaru. &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; for example, infuse their bodies with the essence of the Light. Thus, the draenei serve the Light as either a &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;, or an &lt;a href=\"Anchorite\"&gt;Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;, the most common profession choices for the draenei.\nIn fact, unlike other Alliance races with the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, draenei has their own religious institutions centered on the worship of the Holy Light and their own holy places of worship, such as &lt;a href=\"Church\"&gt;chapels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s, although some of them may be present in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; alongside other priests. Among them, they have explicit priesthood such as the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; order of draenei at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Telhamat\"&gt;Temple of Telhamat&lt;/a&gt; who remained on Outland to reestablish a presence at their holy places. There is also the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order of draenei priests and priestesses once led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, calling themselves the \"keepers of the Light\" and in charge with the safeguarding of the draenei holy sites and altars. The &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt; is also present in their society, as an organization of draenei &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s that serve as the primary military and police force of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; are an elite order of draenei &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s commanded by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile worshiping the Holy Light as a concept, the draenei still do recognize individual naaru for their religious blessings. They used to leave bowls of sweet fruits as offerings for the naaru in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, with pilgrims being guided on their long path by various &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;shrines&lt;/a&gt; alongside the roads to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnology.\nThe draenei have learned to shape crystals for all kinds of purposes ranging from power containment to data storage. The purple crystals often associated with draenei that decorate their buildings, weapons, and armor are known as &lt;a href=\"arkonite\"&gt;arkonite&lt;/a&gt; crystals and are used to power everyday draenei society. On Draenor, arkonite pylons were used to generate power for the tombs outside &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, though they were sometimes repurposed to power small towns in emergencies. Arkonite is a powerful source of arcane energy. Before Draenor's destruction, it was primarily mined across &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; with additional mines in and &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sha%27naar\"&gt;Temple of Sha'naar&lt;/a&gt; would often mine the mountains of Tanaan for perfect crystals to power their arcane devices and channel their magics. &lt;a href=\"Luminescent%20Heartglobe\"&gt;Luminescent Heartglobe&lt;/a&gt;s are installed atop poles by draenei civil engineers to provide well-lit paths and common areas.\nThe engineers of the draenei are known as the &lt;a href=\"Artificer\"&gt;Artificer&lt;/a&gt;s, and on Draenor were led by &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Hataaru\"&gt;Exarch Hataaru&lt;/a&gt;. The Artificers excelled in working with arkonite crystals. However, the technology available now is only a shadow of what the draenei had on Argus.\nThe souls of the greatest warriors of the draenei may be called upon for one final service as they stand on the precipice of the afterlife: inhabiting one of the armored &lt;a href=\"vigilant\"&gt;vigilant&lt;/a&gt;s that serve as the eternal protectors of and the draenei civilization on Draenor.\nContrary to popular belief, the &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;s used by the draenei, such as &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and its satellites, were not created by the draenei themselves. They are actually an example of &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; technology.\nMounts.\nDraenei mainly use &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; as mounts. Patient and strong, the creatures exemplify the draenei attitude towards the hardships of life. Some legends say the draenei first befriended the elekk after one of the beasts saved an injured scout from a pack of vicious &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s. The draenei perfected elekk husbandry long ago, adorning the creatures with &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-infused crystals to make them more docile. &lt;a href=\"%3AExodar%20Elekk\"&gt;:Exodar Elekk&lt;/a&gt; are elekk which have been anointed by &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who journeyed from Draenor to Azeroth with Velen and his followers.\nIn addition to elekk, many draenei on have been shown to ride enormous &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian draenei commonly use &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;travel quickly through the air&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe draenei have long relied on the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Breezestrider\"&gt;swift breezestrider&lt;/a&gt;, the swiftest of all &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; breeds, to relay messengers and their missives safely to their destinations.\nCuisine.\nAll draenei settlements make excellent cheese, but only the -&lt;a href=\"Aruuna\"&gt;Aruuna&lt;/a&gt; farming region of &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; can lay claim to the original recipe.\n&lt;a href=\"Talbuk\"&gt;Talbuk&lt;/a&gt;s are the favored food of the draenei.\nLanguage.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; is the name of the official &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; used by all types of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; and uncorrupted draenei. It is likely most of the language is derived from the original dialect of &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;. In \"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\", they also speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Many high-ranking draenei who have been in contact with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s before their corruption also know &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;. Before the slaughter of the draenei on Draenor, there were orcs who learned Draenei to facilitate trade between the two races; the reverse could also be plausible.\n&lt;a href=\"Innkeeper\"&gt;Innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;s are called \"caregivers\".\nSurnames.\nOnly a few draenei are known to have a surname, those that do includes:\nGovernment.\nThough the draenei rely on the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership and guidance, the administration of the Exiled Ones' society on Draenor was run by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;. This body, called the \"Hand of the Prophet\", was formed by the heads of various fields of draenei society and they voted on bureaucratic matters. The Exarch Council consisted of:\nFollowing the destruction of Draenor and collapse of draenei society, the Exarch Council appears to have become obsolete. The &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt; may be some form of replacement for it to at least some extent.\nThe draenei of were also ruled by &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt; administrators.\nFactions.\nAlternate Draenor:\nAppearance.\nDraenei are bipedal ungulates, whose females are on average 7'1\" tall while males tend to reach 7'5\" in height. Their skin tone is generally blue but can range from white to dark violet. Their blood is also blue. Draenei possess hooves and a tail, which tends to be thinner on females and which can be reinforced with plates on males. Tail lengths vary in both males and females though they are often on the longer side. They can also have horns or forehead plates on their heads. While males have tendrils growing out from their chin and neck, female tendrils are thinner and grow from behind their ears. According to &lt;a href=\"Beezil%20Linkspanner\"&gt;Beezil Linkspanner&lt;/a&gt;, draenei females are obsessed with the way their horns look and find ways to reduce \"horn shedding or something\". Some artwork depicts them with fangs. In-game, draenei can choose from a diverse selection of hair colors including gray, white, dark blue, brown, green, and purple.\nTheir eyes glow many shades of blue or purple. &lt;a href=\"Lightforged\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; draenei eyes glow yellow. When draenei die, the glow fades away. Draenei also bear the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, a blessing bestowed by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; upon all draenei which manifests in the form of a glowing blue or yellow rune on their forehead. All draenei can tap into this gift to heal themselves or injured allies. Playable Lightforged draenei have several runes they can choose from, all of which are golden. \nDesigning the draenei.\nThe developers had serious villains like &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; from the race called the eredar \u2014 big giant demons leading the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As the developers were searching for a new Alliance race, the eredar concept led to a decision that it would be great to have a lawful good version of them. One of the difficulties with the draenei was that they couldn't summarize them in one informative speech. The draenei were much harder to design than &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; because it was harder to define what kind of race they were. Everyone understood the worgen were supposed to have an Eastern European Gothic look. With the draenei, they wanted to create a very heroic theme for them leading to the \"-poses\" the draenei model has today. The draenei's poses and animation sets were particularly influenced by ' renditions of Superman in the comic series ' and '. When creating the draenei, the developers wanted them to be very \"otherworldly\" with their blue skin, interesting proportions, height, horns, and the runes on their head. They also decided very early during the designing process that the draenei theme would be defined by crystals. A lot of crystal energy and crystal-related architecture was added to their concept. Even their armor, clothes, items, and weapons have those crystals on them to make a connection between the items you get and the race those items are from.\nThe addition of the draenei as a playable race and their backstory in relation to the eredar led to a lot of controversy since their history contradicted Sargeras' downfall as in the . The inclusion of certain sci-fi elements into the setting also led to concerns.\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; replied: \"The obvious lore contradiction with Sargeras and his encounter with the eredar was clearly documented in the Warcraft III manual. I wrote those bits about four years ago, and to be totally honest, I simply forgot. [...] At this point, even though the NEW lore directly counters the Warcraft III manual, we're still going to run with it. There are a lot of reasons for this, not the least of which is that I think it's far stronger than what I crafted back in the day. The eredar were not necessarily all evil. Sargeras did come to them and tempt them with power. They did NOT make Sargeras crazy. This gives the eredar more dimensionality and roots the draenei to a key moment in Burning Legion history. [...] I remember people getting really upset about dwarves with guns, steam-tech, Gnomeregan as a hi-tech city \u2013 many people had a hard time rolling with those technologies in a fantasy setting. But I ask you all \u2013 can you imagine WoW without those elements now? To be clear, we're not talking about having the Millennium Falcon cruising around the Twisting Nether (I'm certain there would be some legal issues there, to say the least). The draenei \u2018nether-ship' you've been hearing about is far more than it seems. It's part of a larger dimension-traveling fortress called Tempest Keep that essentially teleports through alternate realities. It doesn't bank and roll or shoot proton torpedoes (not yet, anyway).\"\nIn a 2009 interview, then-game director &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Chilton\"&gt;Tom Chilton&lt;/a&gt; stated that one of the things Blizzard learned from the draenei is that it's important to seed races in the world and introduce them to players before making them playable. He explained: \"\"It was harder for players to 'get' the draenei thing because they kind of came out of nowhere. They'd been referred to in previous \"Warcraft\" games but nobody had really ever seen or dealt with them. So it was a little harder to do, whereas with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; it was a lot easier. What we learned from that is we do wherever possible want to seed that potential, even if it's in a small way.\"\"\nTimeframe of arrival.\n' stated that the draenei had been present on Draenor since nearly five thousand years. The TBC flash site said &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; had been used by the draenei for thousands of years, while &lt;a href=\"Ramdor%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Ramdor the Mad&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; have been caring for the dead for 500 odd years. \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" said the draenei arrived on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; crashed 200 years ago. According to Durotan, \"... at least ten generations of orcs had lived and died since the draenei had arrived.\" And \"It was over two hundred summers ago that your people came here.\" In-game, &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt; said they crashed \"many hundreds of years ago\" and &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; said it was \"nearly a thousand years\" ago. \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Beyond the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;\" described Auchindoun as well over a hundred summers old. Following the announcement of ' in 2013, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; clarified that Blizzard will be moving forward with the 200-300 year timeframe of Oshu'gun's crash. confirms that the draenei arrived on Draenor 200 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe draenei lived alongside orcs for countless generations on the planet Draenor. When that world exploded and crumbled into what is now known as Outland, most of the draenei perished. A few managed to survive the cataclysm, however. When the Dark Portal was reopened into Azeroth, a small number of draenei traveled through, scarred by the ordeal of their world's destruction. These ragged wretches now call themselves the \"Lost Ones,\" in mourning of their former world. Though otherwise a peaceful, private race, the draenei carry an intense hatred for all orcs and will slay them whenever the opportunity arises. Their home on Azeroth lies within the Swamp of Sorrows, though some have begun to travel beyond the Swamp's borders in recent times. Scattered tribes of draenei are rumored to wander still the devastated fields of Outland, the last remnants of Draenor that still float within the Twisting Nether.\nHaving lost their home ages ago, the draenei struggle to reclaim their former lives - an impossibility, since their home no longer exists. Still, without the attempt, they would wither and die. Another factor that keeps the draenei alive is revenge against the orcs who once lived among them. They will take any risk to see an orc killed. If they can wipe out the entire race, so much the better. The draenei avoid combat unless the enemy in question is an orc. Then the normally peaceful draenei lash out in a fury, doing everything in their power to destroy their hated enemy. They established a colony in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Fallow%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Fallow Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. They became vicious draenei and sequester themselves from outsiders, called themselves \"lost ones\".\nIn the TCG.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\", draenei have blue eyes, but some have been seen with a glowing purple hue, and a glowing green. There's no pattern or correlation between magic types being used and eye color, and both green and purple hues seem to be a naturally occurring eye color.\nSome have also been seen with glowing yellow eyes, with both of these examples being &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s. As with some &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, this was thought to only occur when channeling powerful &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; spells, though a &lt;a href=\"Gladiator%20Kinivus\"&gt;draenei shaman&lt;/a&gt; has also been seen with yellow eyes. It's possible it is also related to magic, as he's depicted casting a spell in his artwork. If this is the case, yellow would just be a temporary eye color for normal draenei."}

Sargeras offered untold power to the three leaders of the eredar\u2013Kil'jaeden, Archimonde, and Velen\u2013in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty. A troubling vision soon came to Velen, who saw the eredar transformed into unspeakable demons\u2013the first sentient members of the Legion, which would grow to immense size and decimate all life. Despite Velen's warnings, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde decided to accept Sargeras' offer. Velen despaired at his former friends' decision and prayed for help. To his surprise and relief, he was answered by one of the benevolent naaru. These energy beings had, like Velen, foreseen the formation of the Burning Legion.\nThe naaru offered to shepherd Velen and other believers to refuge. Velen quietly gathered those of his fellow eredar who seemed trustworthy and dubbed them the draenei, or \"exiled ones.\" As Sargeras returned to Argus and transformed many willing eredar into demons, the draenei narrowly escaped their homeworld. Furious, Kil'jaeden vowed to track Velen to the ends of creation. Even as the Burning Legion chased the draenei across the cosmos, the naaru instructed the exiles in the way of the Light. Deeply affected, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's ideals. In time the draenei settled on a remote world and met the shamanistic orcs who inhabited it. The draenei came to call their new home Draenor or \"Exiles' Refuge.\"\nKil'jaeden continued to hunt the exiles, however, and he eventually learned of the idyllic world and its unsuspecting inhabitants. Working through the shaman Ner'zhul, the demon lord gradually began corrupting the orcs. When Ner'zhul refused to serve the Legion's agenda past a certain point, Kil'jaeden turned to Ner'zhul's apprentice. Gul'dan worked the orcs into a frenzy of bloodlust, and the newly formed Horde began slaughtering the peaceful draenei. The orcish campaign against the draenei was brutally effective. Over eighty percent of the draenei race was destroyed, though a small group of survivors remained, including the noble Velen. The orcs went on to invade Azeroth through Medivh's Dark Portal. Years later, after the Second War, Ner'zhul's additional portals would tear Draenor to pieces.\nRecently Velen and the remaining draenei survivors gained control of one of Tempest Keep's satellite structures and used it to escape to Azeroth. Now they search for allies in their never-ending battle against the Burning Crusade.\nSince the incursion of Alliance and Horde forces into the land of Northrend, the draenei have played a minor role. Their greatest presence is seen with &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Vurenn\"&gt;Harbinger Vurenn&lt;/a&gt; and his entourage in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Even in Northrend the draenei's stalwart adherence to honesty and the Light are crucial in undercutting the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Located in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the objective of the battleground is to hold orbs of power for as long as possible, accumulating points but taking (and dealing) more damage the longer you hold it.\nOfficial overview.\nThe struggle to absorb the power of ancient mogu artifacts begins with entrants to the temple outside its gates on opposed sides. At the beginning of the battle, each faction\u2019s group will burst through the gates and rush to claim the orbs that appear in the four corners of the temple.\nOnce you or your teammates have retrieved an orb, hold onto it as long as you can; continuing to hold an orb will net you a steady stream of points.\nProtect the orb holders on your team from the attacks of your enemies \u2013 they earn a significant amount of victory points! Also, be sure that your team strikes at the opposing team\u2019s orb carriers for the very same reason.\nOrbs.\nVictory in the Temple of Kotmogu is determined by success in capturing and holding four powerful mogu orbs. The four orbs (green, blue, purple and orange) wait in four corners of the map.\nHolding an orb earns your team victory points for as long as it\u2019s held \u2013 but the power radiated by the orb also grants you the aspect of the mighty mogu, enlarging you to make you a clear target for your opposition. Orb-holders deal and receive increased damage, and the healing they receive is reduced. These effects are minor at first, but they increase quickly over time while the orb-holder lives.\nA player can only pick up one orb at a time (though multiple teammates can pick up multiple orbs); holding an orb also prevents you from using your mount. If you\u2019re slain while holding an orb, it will be returned to its point of origin inside the temple.\nVictory points.\nHolding an orb in different parts of the zone will net your team differing amounts of power, represented as victory points. Stay in the center of the map to earn the most points \u2013 the surrounding plaza earns slightly fewer, and holding an orb outside of the temple even less (though you\u2019ll have more room to maneuver). The farther you are from the heart of the temple, the fewer points you\u2019ll earn.\nDelivering a killing blow to one of your enemies will net your team a significant number of victory points.\nDescription.\n\"The Horde and Alliance wage battle for the ancient Mogu artifact that is foretold to hold great powers. Temple of Kotmogu is a 10 vs 10 Powerball battleground where each side attempts to control the Mogu artifact for as long as possible in different scoring zones.\"\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The temple is an important spot for aspirants on their path to &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;ascension&lt;/a&gt; as they work to rid themselves of any doubts they carry, thus becoming pure according to the kyrian path. The area is overseen by the Paragon of Purity, &lt;a href=\"Vesiphone\"&gt;Vesiphone&lt;/a&gt;, and her followers.\nIt is the base of the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Temple of Purity was one of the central locations on the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; path to becoming &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt;, a journey which each arrival to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; embarked upon. At the temple, aspirants meditated in quiet reflection with the aim of shedding any burdens they still carried from their past lives. Those that fail in achieving this were normally sent on to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Temple of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; to be brought back onto the path.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;anima drought&lt;/a&gt; in Bastion and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Temple of Purity was quickly strained as aspirants' doubts became more pronounced, with many failing their rites, leading to their being sent to the Temple of Loyalty. Unbeknownst to most kyrian, however, the Paragon of Loyalty &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; had since turned against the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;'s path and was planning to seize control of Bastion with her newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; army. As doubt-filled aspirants were sent from the Temple of Purity to Loyalty, they were in fact being recruited into the ranks of the dark kyrian, swelling their numbers.\nWhen the Forsworn finally made their move, the Temple of Loyalty was their first target. Led by &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;, they took the temple's residents by surprise after its wards were sabotaged and occupied most of the complex. In their attack, they corrupted many of the powerful temple vespers which threatened the defenders. It was only a counterattack led by the Hand of Purity, &lt;a href=\"Eridia\"&gt;Eridia&lt;/a&gt;, that was able to turn the tide against the attackers, and she confronted Lysonia herself atop &lt;a href=\"Purity%27s%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Purity's Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. As Lysonia gained the upper hand, &lt;a href=\"Vesiphone\"&gt;Vesiphone&lt;/a&gt; arrived to defeat her and force her to retreat. The Paragon would then return to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; to warn her brethren of the Forsworn threat.\nInhabitants.\n\"Before &lt;a href=\"Step%20Back%20From%20That%20Ledge%2C%20My%20Friend\"&gt;Step Back From That Ledge, My Friend&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"After &lt;a href=\"Step%20Back%20From%20That%20Ledge%2C%20My%20Friend\"&gt;Step Back From That Ledge, My Friend&lt;/a&gt;\""}

It is not know if this temple was built for themselves or for the giants, though. Either way, the Titans have long since vanished and the giants claim this temple as their own. Occasionally lightning can be seen flickering from the dome \u2014 not down to it but up from it \u2014 so perhaps they are doing something more than worship in there.\nRPG speculation.\nMeteorological explanation: Lightning occurs because of a difference in charge between a storm and the ground. The storm cloud acts as the negative force while at the Temple of Storm's spire, a positive charge gained from a stepped ladder gathers energy that is released into the sky; thus the appearance of lightning firing into the sky. Nothing \"unusual\" here. Because energy always flows from negative charge to positive charge, the event described in the materials requires the cloud to have an excess positive charge and the temple itself an excess negative charge. This is a rare event, but does happen in the real world."}

The pandaren said it contained all the arcane magic the Highborne would ever need, but was in fact completely empty. The gift was actually a message of advice and wisdom to the Highborne: that they did not actually need &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; at all.\nIn the RPG.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\", the Temple of Zin-Malor is simply called \"Elune's temple\"."}

Here, overlooking Pandaria's coast, the myriad races of the continent come to meditate for insight or peruse the living archives of the temple's library, where Pandaria's history is literally brought to life.

Using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, you can specific queue for it with a 358+ Item Level at level 85 to 90, and are eligible to receive it as a random dungeon from level 85 to 87. The Heroic Version requires you to be level 90 to queue for it, with a 435+ Item Level. \nWalkthrough.\nAs you enter the dungeon, you see a crossroads. You can't go straight because it's blocked off, so you'll need to find another way around. Go left first to meet Wise Mari. Then walk back and go to the right and run into Lorewalker Stonestep to put the scrolls to rest of the sha. Upon coming out from the other side, guards say that their teacher has \"betrayed\" us and as a matter of fact, she appears before you. Yu'lon appears shortly after to be free of Doubt. Thus, the door swings open and the Sha of Doubt awaits to be dealt with to end the manifestation, once and for all.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The temple also served as the seat of government in Darnassus and &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, with the night elven leaders &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; residing here. Incidentally, it was one of the largest artificial structures in the region.\nThe building itself was built in Darnassus following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; that ended the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; also dispatched missions from the temple, such as that of &lt;a href=\"Gwennyth%20Bly%27Leggonde\"&gt;Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde&lt;/a&gt; to investigate strange happenings near &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;. In its center was the statue of &lt;a href=\"Haidene\"&gt;Haidene&lt;/a&gt; placed in the middle of a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; which was used for bathing and recuperating. The waters of the temple are known to be blessed, being described as the water of Elune herself.\nThe temple was destroyed alongside Darnassus during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; burned Teldrassil.\nHistory.\nThe Temple of the Moon was built around the same time as the rest of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; first made their home on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the temple itself was crafted from stone brought from the mainland and transported by magical means. It would become the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"de facto\" capital building of Darnassus as the residence of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary kaldorei leader.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; ended sometime before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a weakened &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was taken to the temple in order to recover from the struggle, being placed underneath the statue in the main chamber. Soon afterwards, Malfurion and his lover Tyrande would marry within the temple, having been together for well over 10,000 years prior.\nThe night elven hero &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; would emerge from seclusion when he traveled to the Temple of the Moon with his dying wife &lt;a href=\"Shalasyr\"&gt;Shalasyr&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their best efforts, neither the priestesses nor Tyrande herself could save Jarod's mate, and she would die soon afterwards. Her body would be placed within the temple, and her funeral ceremony would also later take place there.\nThroughout its history, the temple has served many different functions. Tyrande and Malfurion eat their meals together in a pavilion on the temple grounds. During the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande was chosen to lead the prosecution as the accuser, basing herself from the temple and returning to it to plan her case after court adjourned.\nSome time after the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in , &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt; led survivors into Darnassus and showed &lt;a href=\"Gavvin%20Stoutarm\"&gt;Gavvin Stoutarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inge%20Ironfist\"&gt;Inge Ironfist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arwis%20Blackstone\"&gt;Arwis Blackstone&lt;/a&gt; the temple. The dwarves were in awe.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the temple was a gathering place for the refugees. Soon, the night elves hurried through the temple, trying to get to the portals, while others tried to submerge themselves into the moonwell. Soon, the Temple's glass dome broke as a massive tree limb, engulfed in flames, crashed down. The branch fell into the bowl of Haidene's statue, but it broke too, sending its head toppling onto the screaming night elves who had sought refuge in the pool. The moonwell shattered, and its sacred waters flowed onto the grass, red with the blood of innocents. After &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; arrived to collect &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt; and the temple priestesses, the last three priestesses refused to leave. Instead, they decided to pray for &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to ease the suffering of those who could not be evacuated."}

Interacting with the shrine is one of the objectives of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Burdens%20of%20Shaohao\"&gt;The Seven Burdens of Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, a Pandaria &lt;a href=\"exploration%20achievement\"&gt;exploration achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Temple%20Tournament\"&gt;Tiger Temple Tournament&lt;/a&gt; takes place on the temple's grounds.\nHistory.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, several important individuals visited the temple.\nPrince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; arrived here to ask Xuen to allow both factions to enter the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and the great celestial tested them in order to prove their worth.\nLater, the temple held trials of battle and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s came to participate in matches against skilled fighters from all across Pandaria. It was also visited by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; who sought Xuen's blessing.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Monkey%20King\"&gt;The Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; also returned here and dueled against the Alliance hero in order to test their strength.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; learned about an intersection of timeways at the temple.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Shin%20Whispercloud\"&gt;Shin Whispercloud&lt;/a&gt; was making a delivery of fish from the &lt;a href=\"Anglers%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglers Wharf&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; to the Temple of the White Tiger. He brought &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; with him, but they didn't stay long.\nShadows of the Horde.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;war against the Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li spent some time at the temple. However, when the trolls attacked, Li Li led the refugees from &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt; to the temple. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; reconvened at the temple, before returning to &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; took place in the temple, attended by the Alliance, Horde, August Celestials, and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh was also held captive here. During the duration of the trial, the welcomers were forbidden to carry weapons, and pavilions were designated for both factions. The temple's monks and merchants were asked to stay away from the temple grounds during the daytime.\nBy the end of the trial, it was attacked by &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;Garrosh's last followers&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; to create a distraction for &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; to transport Garrosh into an .\nLegion.\nThe new Farseer of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; came to the Temple and asked &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;:The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;. Others came to the Temple to present their offerings to him, so the tiger prepared a series of challenges for everyone who wanted to possess the weapons of the storm. The other challengers included &lt;a href=\"Sigurd%20the%20Giantslayer\"&gt;Sigurd the Giantslayer&lt;/a&gt;, and the duo, Chen and Li Li. Upon defeating them, the Farseer proceeded to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;. As they did, the elements in the weapons caused the main temple to tremble and boulders to fall. However, as the hero was attuning the weapons, Legion forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kra%27vos\"&gt;Lord Kra'vos&lt;/a&gt; invaded the temple in order to obtain the storm weapons. His &lt;a href=\"Low%20Inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitors&lt;/a&gt; entrapped Rehgar, Li Li, and Chen, but the shaman hero defeated the demons. As Xuen was congratulating the heroes, &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Temple%20Spectator\"&gt;spectators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Honor%20Guard\"&gt;honor guards&lt;/a&gt; entered the main temple, and then Rehgar and the hero departed using an &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Gate%20to%20the%20Maelstrom\"&gt;Astral Gate to the Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde adventurer returned to the temple to relive a vision of the trial and empower the fragment of the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Gurgthock\"&gt;Gurgthock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wodin%20the%20Troll-Servant\"&gt;Wodin the Troll-Servant&lt;/a&gt; return for the fourth round of their &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, er... &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;, um... &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Carnage\"&gt;Crucible of Carnage&lt;/a&gt;, ah... &lt;a href=\"Arena%20of%20Annihilation\"&gt;Arena of Annihilation&lt;/a&gt; event, for level-90 adventurers only!\nSeveral NPCs at the most likely areas a level 87 would be, namely &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%20Chu\"&gt;Wanderer Chu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farmhand%20Bo\"&gt;Farmhand Bo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hopsmaster%20Chang\"&gt;Hopsmaster Chang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leni%20Kelpenstout\"&gt;Leni Kelpenstout&lt;/a&gt; start the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; storyline with &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nScenarios.\nTwo scenarios take place here: the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20of%20Annihilation\"&gt;Arena of Annihilation&lt;/a&gt;, and the single-player &lt;a href=\"Proving%20Grounds\"&gt;Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Xuen%20Shield%20Bearer\"&gt;Xuen Shield Bearer&lt;/a&gt;s may come from the temple."}

He is a &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; that spawns upon the opening of the 12th portal.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Although relatively young, Temporus was instrumental in identifying many of the Infinite Dragonflight's prime targets. As a reward, he was given the responsibility of destroying anyone who might attempt to interfere with the dragonflight's plans.\"\nStrategy.\nThe main two aspects of this fight are his Mortal Wound and Hasten. \nMove the dragon off to one the side of the gate where he spawns, so that he will not stand between Medivh and the gate. This will prevent any of the small dragons accidentally aggroing on your group (healers and DPS should get out of the path to Medivh as well. If you still have a &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Beacon\"&gt;Chrono-Beacon&lt;/a&gt;, you can spawn a Time Keeper on the path of the small dragons to keep them away from Medivh for some time, but do not spawn your time keeper too close to the boss or else he will instantly despawn it. A well geared protection warrior (good pre-Karazhan level gear) should be able to survive even at high levels of debuff as long as Temporus is taken down quickly. Shield wall, block, last stand, and other abilities will help. It also helps to have a higher block rating because a successful complete block will prevent an additional stack of the debuff from being applied.\nIt is, however, extremely important to dispel his hasten effect when it appears. One effective strategy is to heal the tank with heal over time spells and spot heals as needed, while mashing Dispel throughout the fight. Doing this will usually result in almost no extra damage from the hasten effect, resulting in a very easy fight even with the Mortal Wound debuff.\nIf you have a mage throw up a detect magic early, that helps. Otherwise, be on the lookout for white rings to appear around his feet as an indicator that his hasten buff is up. The effect can be purged. As long as he is not hastened, your tank may be able to run out of the Mortal Wound debuff range once it stacks too high (usually around four debuffs), and Temporus will not be fast enough to keep up with him. Once the main tank is out of range the stack of debuffs on him will fade, and he can then return and resume hitting him. Make sure your tank does not move too far from the portal when waiting or Temporus will reset. \nAnother good option if the debuffs start stacking up too high is to position the tank on one side of the rift with a party member 20 to 25 yards from the tank directly opposite the boss on the other side of the rift, once the timer on the debuffs starts getting low have the warrior use the intervene ability on the party member and run ahead of the boss till the debuffs wear off. /fly \nThe use of &lt;a href=\"Luffa\"&gt;Luffa&lt;/a&gt; trinket no longer clears the stack of the &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Wound\"&gt;Mortal Wound&lt;/a&gt; as of patch 2.010."}

His name, Ten, literally represents the number ten, as his father ran out of interesting names after the fifth son.\nHistory.\nTen was born as the youngest son of a poor turnip farmer. When Ten was growing up his older brother &lt;a href=\"Seven\"&gt;Seven&lt;/a&gt; taught him to read. Upon their father's death when Ten was seven years old, his five eldest brothers split the property between themselves. However, due to the farm struggling as it was already, it was decided that the farm would not be split further with the younger five brothers being giving the option of staying as farmhands or leaving. Rather than stay as a farmhand, Ten decided to leave where he would soon come into a life of an impoverished &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; in and around &lt;a href=\"Halfhill\"&gt;Halfhill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife was hard for Ten, who wasn't proud that he had to steal merely so he could eat, whether by taking food directly or speedy coin grabs. If there was an accident with a cart, he could help out while keeping some smaller pieces of food for himself. He had endured beatings, for instance once from a butcher for stealing the man's garbage, and on another occasion, a blacksmith for warming his paws at his forge. He had slept in sewers and fought off packs of &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt; for food just to survive, and sheltered under the twilight rain in alleys with thieves and murderers. There was the occasional kindness, such as fruit \"accidentally\" rolling off &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Won%20Gi\"&gt;Kim Won Gi&lt;/a&gt;'s fruit cart right in front of Ten. Bartender &lt;a href=\"Den%20Den\"&gt;Den Den&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Turnip\"&gt;Lazy Turnip&lt;/a&gt; once accepted a (obviously stolen) pomegranate in trade for a mug of Stormstout brew.\nOne day when he was 14, concerned with being able to buy another blanket for the coming winter, he stole a scroll from a group of four traveling 'merchants', later revealed to be in fact a group of &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; delivering a message to &lt;a href=\"Haohan%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Haohan Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt;. After a long chase, he was finally caught by the group's leader, &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Hawkmaster Nurong&lt;/a&gt;, the one he had lifted the scroll from, after tricking Nurong's underlings into thinking he'd left in another direction. However, as Nurong had overheard Ten express admiration for his pursuers and being quite impressed with his wits and skills, instead of punishment he was given another choice: to apply to join the Shado-Pan, with the requirement of Ten reaching &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in time for the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%23Trial%20of%20the%20Red%20Blossoms\"&gt;Trial of the Red Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; within three months. For having used the scroll to blow &lt;a href=\"Cindergut%20Pepper\"&gt;cindergut powder&lt;/a&gt; to distract the pursuing acolytes, Nurong dubs him \"Ten of the Peppered Scroll.\"\nAfter a long, hard, and perilous journey, he eventually reached the gates on the very last day of his three-month parole, where he found himself with nine other pandaren who wished to join the Shado-Pan by completing the Trial. After passing the first trial Ten was witnessed to &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Chan\"&gt;Heavy Chan&lt;/a&gt; arriving with the remains of the brazier around his paw. Upon discovering that Chan decided to simply take the brazier (as his paw was too large to remove the coin and the brazier was too hot) Ten silently wondered to himself if the other hopefuls had drowned, been frozen, or simply left once Chan took the brazier.\nDuring the second trial, one of the initiates was killed by a bamboo python, but that was not the true horror as the surviving three initiates were forced to confront a manifestation of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;. Ten led Chan and &lt;a href=\"Pei-Ling\"&gt;Pei-Ling&lt;/a&gt; in working together, and were able to overcome the sha. After recuperating, Master Nurong decided on their final test. Instead of the traditional test, Nurong explained to them the full consequences of having been exposed to the sha at such a young age and if they joined the order, they would be choosing to do so again for the rest of their lives, something nearly all acolytes are blissfully unaware of and only veterans dared to face. He then asked if they would still be willing to swear the Shado-Pan oath and join the order. After some inner introspective, Ten and his new companions accepted to take the oath at sunset later that day before Lord &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, and become Shado-Pan acolytes.\nWith the official business over with, Nurong sat down to rest from his return journey and realized Ten had pickpocketed him again. Just like how they had first met, he asked the smiling Ten to give back his belongings. The future acolyte apologized, explaining that old habits die hard.\nNotes.\nAs he was 14 during \"Mists of Pandaria\", he is 24 in .\nSpeculation.\nConsidering Ten's skill set, he would probably be trained as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and thus eventually join the Wu Kao discipline under Nurong."}

Ruling for over five decades, including the period of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; Wars, Terenas acted as a patron of the Alliance and sought to keep it united as political issues had arisen. His death at the hands of his own son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; deprived the Alliance of its leadership at a critical moment in history.\nBiography.\nTerenas Menethil II was born in the court of the kingdom of Lordaeron, one of the strongest human nations, as a member of the royal &lt;a href=\"Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; family, which had ruled the kingdom for generations. An old friend of &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, Terenas grew up to become a wise and just ruler, greatly loved by his people. His long years of reign saw peace and brought prosperity for Lordaeron, but all this changed with the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerenas' grandfather is said to have had successful negotiations with the elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; over the borders there for his northern vassals.\nTides of Darkness.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; from the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; led by Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by Prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and met with Terenas, giving warnings of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the invasion that was to come. Terenas &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;called delegates&lt;/a&gt; from neighboring human nations, and, after hearing the horror stories from Sir Lothar and his people, they agreed to forge the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Alliance was formed, each king argued in favor of them gaining command of the new unified army. Terenas pointed out that Lordaeron was the largest kingdom with the most troops, and also that he was the one who had summoned the rest of them. The Lordaeron monarch later changed his mind and supported Anduin Lothar himself for the role instead, as a neutral party whose &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; legacy could also be used to convince the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to help. In addition to the elves, Terenas also sent messengers to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, though communications were soon lost. Prince Varian was left with the Menethil family, befriending Terenas' son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and becoming like a second son to him.\nTerenas organized the forces of Lordaeron in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;defense of Capital City&lt;/a&gt; against the onslaught of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. He even personally commanded the defenses despite being no warrior himself, and got almost killed by an orc that was then killed by &lt;a href=\"Morev\"&gt;Morev&lt;/a&gt;. But in the end, the defenders' sacrifices were not in vain, and the Alliance won through, decimating the Horde and rounding up the surviving orcs into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, headed by &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The orc Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was kept as the personal prisoner of Terenas, the human king fervently hoping that a treaty could be arranged with the orcish leader. Terenas thought that if the orcs could be kept pacified long enough, they ought to eventually lose their lust for conquest, and as such he pleaded to keep them interned instead of executing them. Doomhammer eventually escaped captivity and fled into hiding.\nAftermath of the war.\nDespite the end of the Second War, peace did not last long. He and the other kings of the Alliance were present at the meeting in &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he met with &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Lord Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; and discussed the matter with &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. When it was discovered that the rift to the orc's homeworld was expanding, Terenas immediately decreed in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who had assumed his rightful place on the throne of Stormwind, and the other kings to rally the Alliance army that would venture into &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve the artifacts stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and end the orcish threat for good. The &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; undertook the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, eventually succeeding and sealing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; from the other side to prevent Draenor's destruction from destroying &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nSome years later, the matter of what to do with the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; came up. Trollbane wanted to split the lands between Lordaeron and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. However, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; supported &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;'s nephew &lt;a href=\"Isiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Isiden&lt;/a&gt;'s claim to the throne while Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; was opposed to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; influence in the region. &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Lord Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, who appeared to be a relative to the late Lord Perenolde, was one of Terenas' trusted advisors during this time, and Terenas began to arrange a marriage for Prestor to his young daughter &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas even wished his own son was more like Prestor. Prestor was endorsed by most Alliance nations as the new king of Alterac, solving everyone's\u2014and particularly Terenas'\u2014political nightmare. This plan was scrapped, however, when Prestor suddenly disappeared.\nDuring the winter when Arthas' mount, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, died, Terenas and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; were off on a diplomatic mission to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas was later present during a ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where Arthas became a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;. He told him that he was proud of him that day, which confused Arthas as he was unsure if his father was ever proud of him until that day.\nThe Alliance Splinters.\nWhen the political problems culminated, Terenas realized that the Alliance would crumble. The first ally to secede were the elves of Quel'Thalas, as they blamed the humans for not being able to save their burned forests. Terenas tactfully reminded them that it was the Alliance that saved them from being annihilated entirely. Gilneas then separated from the whole world behind the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and Thoras Trollbane proposed a mass execution of the orcs but Lordaeron refused to do so. The quarrels of the two friends ended when Stromgarde too seceded from the Alliance. In spite of these losses, many nations remained with Lordaeron and Uther \u2014 who considered Terenas as a brother \u2014 alongside &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; had helped him to rebuild Lordaeron and other kingdoms.\nThe Reign of Chaos.\nTime wore on and Terenas grew more and more infirm, struggling to hold together the collapsing Alliance despite all of his pleas with the dissident nations of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, Terenas still had allies he could rely on, as the nations of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; remained committed to the Alliance. To compound to his problems, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has been rallying the few remaining &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;orc clans&lt;/a&gt; in revolt against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; internment camps. The \"&lt;a href=\"new%20horde\"&gt;new horde&lt;/a&gt;\" as it was dubbed, had brazenly attacked the northern city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to rescue one of its captured warriors. The horde even destroyed &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the fortress that oversaw the security of the internment camps \u2013 and murdered the officers who ran it. King Terenas sent Uther and his &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to quell the warchief's uprising, but the crafty orcs could never be found. The young warchief proved to be something of a tactical genius \u2013 and evaded Uther's best efforts to corral his hit and run attacks. Furthermore, amidst the strain of the new orc uprising, King Terenas was disturbed to hear ill news on another front. Rumor held that a number of supposed \"&lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;death cults&lt;/a&gt;\" had formed in the northern provinces. The cults attracted the disenfranchised and disheartened citizens of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, offering them \"&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;eternal life&lt;/a&gt;\" on earth as an alternative to servitude to the King. After many years of peace and quiet, King Terenas knew that troubles were only just beginning for his land. Still, Terenas was proud his son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, became the prized prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Uther the Lightbringer and a paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas took comfort that Lordaeron's defenders, both new and old, would see it safely through to a new dawn.\nThe troubles began with the orcish uprisings through &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt; spreading from the North. Many of the Alliance representatives, especially the ones from Dalaran, were pleading for a quarantine. But Terenas refused, saying that the people of Lordaeron had suffered enough. The &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;mysterious prophet&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly materialized during a council of the Alliance, and pleaded with Terenas to make haste to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; or all would be lost. Terenas, however, paid no heed, thinking him little more than a madman. It was here that King Terenas sealed his fate.\nWeeks later, Terenas heard of Arthas' strange behavior, including the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and his expedition to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas immediately ordered the troops recalled at Uther's request, but no word was heard from them for months.\nMurder.\nFinally, Prince Arthas returned, victorious over the &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; he had faced in Northrend. All of Lordaeron's Capital City rejoiced in a festival, celebrating the long-awaited return of their heroic prince. But something was amiss. \nAs he knelt before his father, a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;dark voice&lt;/a&gt; flooded Arthas' thoughts. He rose up, drew his sword, and approached the throne. Taking his father by the throat, Arthas drove the dark runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; through his heart. Thus did Terenas of the House of Menethil, King of Lordaeron, die at the hands of his own son\u2014bringing an end to not only his reign, which had lasted for 50 years, but also to the kingdom of Lordaeron itself.\nTerenas' ashes were kept in a &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;magical urn&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by Uther himself. Arthas, desiring the urn for his own ends, slew his former mentor and discarded his father's ashes which were scattered by the winds near &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; was recovered by an unknown individual and buried on an island in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; as a memorial. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; believe that it was refugees from Lordaeron, but given the involvement of Thoras with Terenas' tomb, he could also be involved.\nFall of the Lich King.\nThe soul of Terenas Menethil II spoke to the Lich King warning him that the combined might of the Alliance, the Horde, the Argent Crusade, and the Knights of the Ebon Blade have finally fought their way to Icecrown Citadel itself to defeat him once and for all.\nTerenas' spirit appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; during the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. When adventurers fell victim to the \"Harvest Soul\" spell, they were brought into Frostmourne itself, where they found Terenas struggling against the spirit warden of the sword. Adventurers aided Terenas in defeating it, at which point the blade became weakened enough for him to be able to return adventurers to the real fight. The Lich King, eventually, killed his enemies and prepared to raise them as his most powerful servants when &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, frozen for the entire fight, broke free of his bonds and shattered &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. As the souls claimed by Frostmourne swirled around the Lich King, Terenas' spirit appeared to resurrect the dead to finish off the immobilized master of the Scourge.\nHaving seen to his dying son, after Arthas passed away Terenas warned Tirion that there must always be a Lich King and vanished.\nShadowlands.\nAs a victim of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Terenas' soul was sundered upon his murder. Its missing fragment, crystallized as \"The Betrayed Father\", came into the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after Frostmourne's shattering. \nMemorial.\nA tomb dedicated to the king stands behind the throne room of Lordaeron:\nIt is not uncommon for tombs to be carved long before the occupant's death. Such is the case with Terenas; the words on the plaque were carved by two different hands - the first half of the first line is one set, and the rest of the plaque was written after Terenas' death. The Alliance doesn't know who added the second part, but SI:7 speculates it was done on the order of &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, who was once a great friend to Terenas. The tomb lies empty as the ashes of Terenas were scattered by Arthas when he put the remains of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;Urn of King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the information in \"Exploring Azeroth\", it was simply said that the tomb was crafted by the ruined city's former citizens, who risked everything to ensure his memory would not be forgotten.\nThe plate containing this inscription is missing from the tomb during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nA second, secret memorial exists on an island in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, behind the lighthouse. With no body to bury, and Lordaeron infested by undead, &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;Terenas' crown&lt;/a&gt; was recovered--likely by refugees of Lordaeron--and buried there so the survivors would have a place to mourn their king. The gravestone marking it bore only a faded, unreadable inscription and was thought to belong to a former lighthouse keeper until &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; discovered the truth. After digging up the crown to confirm his theory, he and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; buried it once more and agreed to continue keeping the secret.\nAlternate timeline.\nA version of existed in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out differently, which was entered by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\nSpeculation.\nClass.\nA statue of Terenas, recovered in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, depicted him as \"a young, long-haired &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; with hammer upraised.\" When the Horde attacked the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Terenas reluctantly picked up a fallen sword with which to defend himself, but he was \"painfully aware that he was no fighter\". also clearly states that he was no &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. He couldn't have trained as a paladin until after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and by then he was far from young. That statue may have been intended as a depiction of Arthas, or a heavily idealized version of Terenas. Alternatively, it could depict Terenas Menethil I who could have been a paladin and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Ra-den was imprisoned beneath the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; until adventurers freed him. After several years, Ra-den reappeared and helped to battle the forces of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, saving the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20the%20Despoiled\"&gt;being corrupted&lt;/a&gt; and put down by adventurers. \nBroken Isles.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Designate of Azeroth, kept watch on Azeroth from the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, the afterlife for chosen &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; warriors who die in glorious combat.

However, a curse from &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; had trapped Odyn and the Valarjar within the Halls since their creation, until &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order hall leaders&lt;/a&gt; killed Helya, freeing the Valarjar from their curse.\nZandalar.\n&lt;a href=\"Titan%20Keeper%20Hezrel\"&gt;Titan Keeper Hezrel&lt;/a&gt; maintains &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, but fell into misuse and was believed by the people of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to simply be an old statue. After being reactivated, he aids the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Nazmir%20storyline\"&gt;Nazmir storyline&lt;/a&gt; to stem the corruption of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; within Ulduir, eventually sacrificing himself. \n&lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt;, another watcher of Uldir, also aids in G'huun's downfall. Later, she relocates to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of Speaker &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to better serve and protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth's world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. \nDragon Isles.\nTitan watchers have been keeping watch over the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; for more than 10,000 years.

Other titles refer to events or mechanics that no longer exist.\nChallenge Mode.\nThese titles were obtainable from &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt;s, mostly for achieving realm-best times in dungeons during the matching expansion.\nPlayer vs Player.\nThe following titles relate to specific Player vs Player events which have been removed from the game.\nDungeons and raids: Realm Firsts.\nThese quests required a raid group to be the first to complete the raid on their server, and are therefore essentially unavailable, unless Blizzard opens new realms.\nHistory of PvP honor system titles.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.0\"&gt;patch 2.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, players could earn titles by participating in PvP; ranks would be assigned based on the number of contribution points acquired by killing opposite-faction players during a week. With the release of Patch 2.0.0 and the Burning Crusade, players can no longer obtain or improve their Honor System title, but can choose to display their highest lifetime title they've earned before the patch. All honor system titles are displayed in the format: \"title &lt;name&gt;\".\nReturn of PvP titles in Cataclysm.\nBlizzard has indicated that in \"\", players will again be able to earn titles by participating in PvP; the old ranks would be given based on a new battleground rating system.\nIn Cataclysm, we plan to make the old PvP titles available based on your performance in our upcoming rated Battleground system, similar to the current Arena titles which are based on your performance in the Arenas. Keep in mind, however, that Cataclysm is still relatively early in the development stages and this information is subject to change. We'll have more on the rated Battleground system and associated rewards in the months ahead.\n[...] I'm going to clarify my original post, as I don't believe it's been decided yet whether they'll be purchased with Arena points or Honor points, or if a specific Battleground rating is the only requirement to unlock them. There are no plans to make these titles available for real-world money.\n[...] We feel they're going to fit well with the new rated Battleground system. The titles were previously earned through a very cumbersome experience that didn't necessarily measure a player's PvP skill. With a new system for measuring performance in the Battlegrounds, we feel it's a good fit to award the honor title to those who excel. We do not intend for the top titles to be earned in a trivial manner. It's going to be quite hard to get High Warlord or Grand Marshal; and not because it's going to require that someone plays in the Battlegrounds more than everyone else on their realm each week, but because it's going to require a very impressive win/loss ratio.\nThe current plan is still for rated Battlegrounds to grant Arena points, though some rewards will require a certain rating from this system just as with the current Arena system.\nSource: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21333885156-confirm-this-rumor-blue.html\"&gt;Blizzard Development Team&lt;/a&gt;"}

An alternative approach is to use &lt;a href=\"Soothe%20Animal\"&gt;Soothe Animal&lt;/a&gt; on a sparrowhawk. Once you've soothed it, you can get close enough to throw the net and catch it before it has a chance to run. This often works first time."}

The clans were united under a single leader, Grommash Hellscream of the . Bent on the conquest of Draenor and Azeroth, the Iron Horde is an enemy to be feared. It is the main antagonist faction of the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion and a successor to the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which was also Garrosh's creation.\nLater in the story, the Iron Horde ultimately fell under the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Curse&lt;/a&gt;, with being the first to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. After this, assumed control of the organization, while Grommash was imprisoned.\n&lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; is the main area of operations of this organization, and their headquarters are situated in their own of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s intent to create a world ruled wholly by the orcish race alienated most of the non-orc members of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; during his reign. He eventually decided to eliminate or enslave every non-orc, no matter if they were members of the Horde or not. This move brought an entire &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to his doorstep. The tenuous coalition ultimately deposed and captured Garrosh, who was then incarcerated by the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. However, at the end of his trial, Garrosh escaped with the help of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;, who brought him to a parallel-timeline before the orcs could drink the blood of the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz's plan was for Garrosh to create an uncorrupted Horde to be the vanguard against the Burning Legion in the prime timeline, along with all other counterpart Hordes from different timelines. However, Garrosh didn't want to become a puppet for someone else's machinations. He killed Kairoz with a shard of the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; and set out to convince this timeline's counterpart of his father, , to form the Iron Horde.\nShowing Grommash events from the prime timeline, Garrosh persuaded him not to drink Mannoroth's blood. Garrosh introduced modern technology from the prime timeline, courtesy of &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; engineers and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; smiths to arm the orcish clans of this parallel Draenor. Using this new technology, they set out to ambush the pit lord Mannoroth, and overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to enslave the orcs. \nWhen Grommash's refusal to drink Mannoroth's blood caused the pit lord to reveal himself, Garrosh signaled the hidden Iron Horde to burst forth, firing catapults and chains at Mannoroth. The mighty demon quickly countered their attempts to trap him and lay waste to the orc army. He was ultimately defeated when Grommash lept through the explosion from one of the orcs' &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;s to drive &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; directly into the pit lord's forehead.\nWith the Legion's plot foiled, the orc clans were united under the single banner of the Iron Horde. Grommash proclaimed a glorious future for their people, with original plans to invade Azeroth repurposed to suit the new Iron Horde lust for conquest.\nGarrosh also encouraged Grommash to begin construction of a at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the staging ground for the assault on Azeroth.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nBy the time the events of \"Warlords of Draenor\" begin, the Iron Horde had existed on for two years and consisted of a legion of 10,000 orcs from Draenor's united clans.\nEventually, the was completed and the Iron Horde began their invasion of the unsuspecting Azeroth. In just a few short days the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;, the force of Iron Horde sent ahead into Azeroth managed to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and destroy &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. By the time word got to the forces of Azeroth, the Iron Horde was pushing deeper and deeper into the Eastern Kingdoms and the Alliance and Horde scrambled towards the Blasted Lands to defend against the new threat.\nA large force of Iron Horde led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Tharbek\"&gt;Commander Tharbek&lt;/a&gt; managed to rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; and take control the of the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to build a weapon that, if unleashed, would destroy a large portion of the Eastern Kingdoms including Stormwind, which would pave the way for the conquest of the rest of Azeroth. Luckily the champions of Azeroth stormed the spire and prevented the weapon form being used.\nThe retaliating forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; launched a naval attack on the Blasted Lands, quickly retaking the shores from the Ironmarch forces and pushing closer and closer to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the allied forces managed to pave a road to the portal, and stormed it once it stopped fluctuating, pushing most of the Iron Horde forces back through the portal. Despite the great threat of the Iron Horde being temporarily disabled, the remaining Ironmarch forces still occupy large sections of the Blasted Lands and the Eastern Kingdoms. \nThe combined Azerothian forces quickly surged through the Dark Portal to a parallel version of the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and held the base against the Iron Horde while the operation's commanders freed the imprisoned members of the Shadow Council and shut down the portal. However the Azeroth vanguard fell just as Gul'dan escaped, and the remaining forces, including the commanders and Khadgar, were forced to retreat through the jungle to escape the Iron Horde's wrath. During their flight through the jungle they freed Frostwolf and draenei slaves and prisoners, including Maladaar and Drek'Thar, and met with each of the Iron Horde's warlords, but managed to evade them each time. At last Thaelin spotted \"The Worldbreaker\", a giant tank, and with the commanders' help reached the controls. They fired the tank at the Dark Portal and destroyed it, but were subsequently forced to flee as the warlords and Grommash appeared on a ridge and ordered the full might of the Iron Horde after the invaders. The Azerothian forces fled to the docks and split into two ships; the Alliance going with the draenei and Horde going with the Frostwolf.\nShadowmoon Valley.\nThe Alliance forces and their commander took their ship to Shadowmoon Valley, and met with Prophet Velen. Khadgar temporarily opened a portal to Stormwind, allowing Alliance workers and soldiers to pass through and begin construction of a base of operations. The garrison became the center of the Alliance's operations in Draenor which were initially concerned with the threat of the Shadowmoon clan. \nAfter accompanying Prophet Velen, Yrel and Maraad across the region and stopping Shadowmoon aggression at every point, as well as learning their reasons for falling to corruption, the commander, Velen and Yrel discovered that Warlord Ner'zhul intended to summon the to the surface of Draenor to use as a weapon in the Siege of Karabor. To prevent Karabor's fall from coming to pass, Velen, Yrel and the commander confronted Ner'zhul at Light's Fall and, when he refused to turn from darkness and accept the draenei's help, Velen sacrificed his life to purify the Dark Star into its original form; the naaru K'ara. With the naaru's backing, the commander and Yrel quickly made for the Temple of Karabor where, aided by her power, they routed the invasion and destroyed the invading fleet.\nFor his failures, Ner'zhul and the Shadowmoon clan fled to the depths of &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20Fortress\"&gt;Anguish Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later the Alliance and Horde commanders assaulted the depths of the fortress and ultimately ended the mad chieftain's life.\nFrostfire Ridge.\nThe Horce forces and their commander took their ship to Frostfire Ridge, and met with Durotan and Draka, the leaders of the Frostwolf Clan. Khadgar temporarily opened a portal to Orgrimmar, allowing Horde workers and soldiers to pass through and begin construction of a base of operations. The garrison became the center of the Horde's operations in Draenor which were initially concerned with the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the Thunderlord clan.\nAfter joining the Frostwolf in a successful siege of Bladespire Citadel, the Frostwolf used their new fortress as a base from which to defend against Thunderlord aggression. However the Thunderlord took advantage of the Frostwolf's siege to attack &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt;, quickly forcing the Frostwolf and New Horde forces into a defense. When the Thunderlord were pushed out of the village, Ga'nar took many of the Frostwolf's strongest warriors to &lt;a href=\"Daggermaw%20Ravine\"&gt;Daggermaw Ravine&lt;/a&gt; to exact vengeance. His vengeance was aided by the Horde commander who assisted him in killing the three sons of the Warlord of the Thunderlord, the Iron Wolf, who also served as strong commanders. The blow struck severely crippled the Thunderlord clan, and led him to proudly attempt to usurp control of the clan. However, after a brief stand-off between himself and Durotan, the two brothers reconciled, with Ga'nar once again swearing loyalty to his brother.\nShortly afterwards, the Horde commander assisted a Frostwolf tracker named &lt;a href=\"Lokra\"&gt;Lokra&lt;/a&gt; and her wolf Asha in hunting down the captors of Lokra's life-mate Karg, with the hope of rescuing him and any other orcs who the Thunderlord had taken prisoner. En route they were intercepted by the Iron Wolf himself who killed Asha as a display of power. Saddened, but not deterred, Lokra and the Horde Commander arrived at Grom'gar where they rescued many Frostwolf prisoners and their wolf companions, including &lt;a href=\"Karg%20Bloodfury\"&gt;Karg&lt;/a&gt; and his wolf &lt;a href=\"Nerok\"&gt;Nerok&lt;/a&gt;, as well as slaying one of the Thunderlord's beastmasters and a Blackrock siegesmith.\nUpon returning to the Horde garrison from this venture, the combined forces had to endure an assault from the Thunderlords before they could lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;Grom'gar&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching the warlord's throne room in Grom'gar, both Durotan and Ga'nar were shocked to discover that the Iron Wolf was in fact their elder brother Fenris who had forsaken the Frostwolf. After slaying him, the Frostwolf and Horde forces pushed onwards to the ridge's entrance and held the line against the invading Iron Horde long enough for to bring down the cliffs around the ridge's entrance, forming a barricade against further invasion. However, Ga'nar sacrificed his life to buy Drek'Thar the last few seconds he needed, allowing himself to be buried as well as his enemies.\nGorgrond.\nThe Iron Horde are seen very little in Gorgrond as the Alliance and Horde find themselves in the center of the ancient, eternal battle between the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;. However the goal of the defenders of Azeroth and Draenor is to capture the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Approach\"&gt;Iron Approach&lt;/a&gt; and assault the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; at the northern end of the region. After several battles with the Primals in the southern jungles and the Breakers in the northern wastelands, they manage to acquire artifacts that can call upon the might of these mighty beings of nature. Wielding this power the defenders attack and conquer the Iron Approach, though lose the artifacts in the process. They are too late, however, to stop the Iron Fleet from departing for Talador. Nonetheless the commanders of the operation successfully assault the Iron Docks and kill one of the enslaved sons of Gruul, as well as preventing the last ship from leaving.\nTalador.\nBy the time the Alliance and Horde reach Talador, the Iron Horde is nearly finished with their attack on and have successfully moved further south into . The commander and their allies, however, succeed in hampering the Iron Horde's lumber operations, destroying their siege weapons, and utilizing a re-engineered shredder to cripple their occupation of Tuurem. Afterwards the defenders of Azeroth and Draenor once again fight alongside Khadgar to push into Shattrath and remove the Iron Horde's occupation of it. During this counterattack they witness Orgrim Doomhammer turning on his , denouncing his bloodlust and thirst for power. The commander is sent to take out a massive, iron star launching cannon while the draenei and Frostwolf leaders aid Orgrim in fighting Blackhand. Khadgar arrives soon after the commander has secured the massive cannon's ship and sends them to aid their allies.\nHowever even the combined forces are no match for Blackhand's fury-powered armour and he utilizes a powerful burst of fire against his attackers. This attack kill Maraad, and incapacitates Durotan and the commander, while Yrel is saved thanks to Maraad's dying intervention. Blackhand proceeds to torture Durotan, but is stopped from killing him by Yrel. While he moves to attack her she heals Durotan and the two work together to drive a Light-infused axe into Blackhand's shoulder; severely injuring him. Khadgar teleports his allies to safety just as Thaelin launches the cannon's remaining payload at Blackhand's flagship, destroying it, while the cannon's ship self-destructs seconds later. Blackhand is thrown into the sea by the explosion and is forced to retreat to Blackrock Foundry.\nNagrand.\nIn Nagrand the Warsong clan already has a tight control on the region. However that doesn't stop the Alliance and Horde from establishing outposts in the region and begin working to loosen the Warsong's grip and take out the Iron Horde's allies in the Gorian Empire. The Iron Horde's occupation of was crippled, their attempts to assassinate one of the commanders in &lt;a href=\"Lok-rath\"&gt;Lok-rath&lt;/a&gt; failed, and most of the strongest of the Gorian Empire were forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; to avoid death. Ultimately the Alliance and Horde laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;, the base of the Warsong, and confronted the escaped war criminal himself; Garrosh Hellscream. He seemed to be losing initially, but lashed out with a raging fury of attacks that almost immediately turned the tables. The commander and their allies were saved by the intervention of Thrall who challenged Garrosh to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the intense battle that followed, Garrosh initially has the upper hand and blames Thrall for all that had happened and denouncing him as lacking the strength of a true warrior. However Thrall reminds Garrosh that he's a shaman, and that his strength lies in the elements. Thrall summons a fist of rock from the ground that incapacitates Garrosh and states that all that has transpired was Garrosh's choices, after which Thrall uses a bolt of lighting to end Garrosh's life.\nDismantling the Iron Horde.\nWith the creator of the Iron Horde dead, the defenders of Azeroth and Draenor set their sights on dismantling the Iron Horde. They first attack Highmaul, the capital of the Gorian Empire and the center of powerful allies to the Iron Horde. Their assault is aided and inhibited by the arrival of Cho'gall and his pale orc armies, as well as a fungal giant from the Sea of Zangar. After killing in the Coliseum, the partially insane Butcher, the fungal giant, and a pale orc enslaved earth fury, the adventurers invaded the Imperator's palace. During their subsequent showdown with Imperator Mar'gok, Cho'gall abruptly arrives and uses his void powers to kill the ogre emperor and take control of his runestones. Cho'gall is killed shortly afterwards by the adventurers.\nWith Highmaul sacked, the defenders of the two worlds turn their attention to the Blackrock Foundry. Their battles through its twisting, sweltering corridors bring them face-to-face with a parallel version of Gruul, an enslaved fire fury, and a giant magnaron. They fight on its assembly lines and in its bestiary, before ultimately confronting Warlord Blackhand. The warlord is killed in the ensuing battle and the Foundry is captured by the invaders.\nAn Inside Job.\nAt Bladefury's Command in Talador, Gul'dan confronted Grommash and Kilrogg and mocked the former for his Iron Horde's failures and losses; which had included the death of Grommash's son. Gul'dan renewed his offer of the demon blood, only for Grommash to still refuse and attempt to attack him. Gul'dan effortlessly incapacitated the Iron Horde's Warchief and elaborated on his offer, promising power like his to any orc who drank. Ultimately it's Kilrogg who decides to agree, stepping forwards despite Grommash's protests and drinking the container's contents. He quickly mutates into a monstrous fel orc, while Gul'dan assumes control of the Iron Horde and pledges to remake it into an unstoppable weapon of conquest.\nFury of Hellfire.\nThousands of Iron Horde orcs accepted the blood of Mannoroth, following in Kilrogg's footsteps, and became a parallel version of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan recalled all Iron Horde forces to Tanaan Jungle to prepare for the arrival of the Burning Legion's field commander; &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler. Once he'd reached Draenor, the Legion and the Iron Horde intended to invade Azeroth once again, using their combined mystical, demonic and mechanical power. Iron Horde siege engines were retrofitted to use fel energy instead of elemental fire, and Siegecrafter Blackfuse's ultimate masterpiece, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Reaver\"&gt;Iron Reaver&lt;/a&gt;, was completed, with hundreds more in production. With the use of fel magic the Iron Horde even made progress with subjugating the magnaron of Gorgrond, including their leader &lt;a href=\"Kormrok\"&gt;Kormrok&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlushed with the thrill of success, Gul'dan brought the imprisoned Grommash back to the where the Iron Horde had first began. Gul'dan once again mocked Hellscream's failures; choosing machines over demonic empowerment and constructing a citadel lacking in grandeur. To show Grommash what a \"true seat of power demands\" he allowed the copious amounts of lava-like blood left behind by Mannoroth's death to flow down from the mountain and form a moat around Hellfire Citadel, causing massive spikes of tainted rock to pierce parts of it and causing corruption to every part of Tanaan it reached. Dismissing Grommash's threats of retribution from the heroes of Azeroth and Draenor, Gul'dan had Grommash placed in the \"care\" of &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord%20Zakuun\"&gt;Fel Lord Zakuun&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking allies, Gul'dan contacted the disgruntled Arakkoa Outcast &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt;, who was frustrated at the unwillingness of his kin to bring Terokk back to Draenor fully, and the truce the Outcasts and Skyreach had reached. Iskar was tasked with searching for Apexis artifacts to aid the Iron Horde, with a promise of power if he succeeded. Iskar began searching the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kra%27nak\"&gt;Ruins of Kra'nak&lt;/a&gt; for an Apexis cipher, and managed to discover half of it. This success, on its own, was enough for Gul'dan to reward him; removing the Curse of Sethe and restoring his wings and High Arakkoa form, though tainted with fel energy. Gul'dan then set the newly elevated Shadow-Lord Iskar with the new task of rallying an army of arakkoa to aid the Iron Horde.\nTo summon Burning Legion forces to Draenor, Gul'dan summoned a Void Revenant named &lt;a href=\"Xhul%27horac\"&gt;Xhul'horac&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the Twisting Nether and fed him overwhelming fel energy. The void revenant, in return, used his powers to open portals to summon hordes of demons to Draenor.\nDiscovering the survival of his old apprentice Teron'gor, Gul'dan had the loyal Sargerei, now also allies of the Iron Horde, retrieve the mutated orc called Gorefiend from the depths of Auchindoun.\nBy the time the Alliance, Horde, Draenei, and Frostwolf clan assaulted Tanaan, the jungle was firmly under the rule of the twisted remnants of the Iron Horde and their Burning Legion masters. Not deterred by this the Horde and Alliance established &lt;a href=\"Vol%27mar\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Watch\"&gt;camps&lt;/a&gt; and quickly took to battle against the Iron Horde. After striking at Iron Horde operations throughout Tanaan adventurers would storm in an final effort to stop the Iron Horde and Gul'dan. While storming the citadel the Iron Horde leadership would suffer the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20High%20Council\"&gt;Hellfire High Council&lt;/a&gt; and , a fate that befall the leadership of their Sargerei and arakkoa allies as well. The assault of Hellfire Citadel would ultimately end with Mannoroth and Archimonde slain, though Gul'dan would ultimately escape by being sent through the Dark Portal by the Defiler in his last moments.\nUpon the demon lords' death Grommash proclaimed that Draenor was free, and he, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and turned their attention to rebuilding .\nAftermath.\nThe survivors of the Iron Horde would unite with the Frostwolves and Laughing Skull under Grommash's leadership into a single &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; known as the , orcish for \"uncorrupted\". They would initially live in peace with Yrel and the draenei and drive the remnants of the Burning Legion from Draenor. Years after the Legion was gone, however, several naaru arrived on Draenor and turned the draenei into fanatics of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, beginning a crusade to &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt; the orcs to their faith; those who would not submit willingly would be made to do so by force.\nMembership.\nAllies.\nAlthough not officially part of the Iron Horde, the following groups have allied themselves with the Iron Horde:\nThrough and the the Iron Horde has gained a number of new allies since accepting the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nMounts and transportation.\nIn addition to traditional &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; mounts, the Iron Horde use a variety of native beasts when riding into battle.\nThe larger part of the Iron Horde's naval might seems to be based on the &lt;a href=\"dreadnaught\"&gt;dreadnaught&lt;/a&gt;s, immense &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s seen in almost every zone with an Iron Horde presence in . They seem to be based mainly in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Ironfist%20Harbor\"&gt;Ironfist Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grimrail\"&gt;Grimrail&lt;/a&gt; is an armored train operating in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnology.\nThe foundation of all Iron Horde technology is the &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;: a primitive, coal-fired centrifugal engine which can be used to turn wheels, belts, and chains, allowing for the construction of crude vehicles and siege weapons including tanks, cannons, and chariots. It was initially used as a massive rolling bomb designed to wipe out whole legions with its explosive power, and was unleashed against the Dwarven invaders under Moira by Siegecrafter Blackfuse, and later against the adventurers during their fight with Garrosh. It's this weapon that Garrosh smuggled to the alternate , and that was redesigned as an engine. However, it is still frequently used as a weapon as well. Many Iron Horde soldiers, mostly from the Blackrock clan, were also trained how to use &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%23Deadeye\"&gt;firearms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fleet\"&gt;Iron Fleet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the technology brought by Garrosh, several orc clans were still using military units similar to those in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;their alternate counterpart&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Spearman\"&gt;spearmen&lt;/a&gt; of the and , the &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the , and the &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s of the .\nThe Iron Horde also lacked air support despite all their armaments, and had to rely on tamed &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s for their air fleet.\nThey frequently made use of iron capsules; armored spherical &lt;a href=\"cage\"&gt;cage&lt;/a&gt;s that could be occupied by several orcs at once, even &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt;s, to deliver soldiers swiftly to the front lines.\nLeadership of the Iron Horde.\nThe figures below were part of the Iron Horde leadership at different points over the course of its history.\nSpeculation.\nWith both the Dragonmaw and the Blackfuse Company apart of the Iron Horde it can be reasonably assumed that the rest of Garrosh's followers, the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, were also assimilated into the organization."}

Created by &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Siegecrafter Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;, this robotic scorpion guards the gates to the city of Orgrimmar. After it destroys the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion's&lt;/a&gt; siege weaponry and reserves, the players must destroy the Iron Juggernaut to allow the rebellion into the city. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"This mechanical terror, designed nearly as much for intimidation as destruction, is the centerpiece of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s siege weaponry. Crafted in the image of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; war scorpion, the Iron Juggernaut guards the gates of Orgrimmar, crushing any who would rise up to challenge Garrosh's True Horde.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"This boss was the product of a particularly rowdy brainstorming session. We started with the idea of a siege tank. We ended up with a mecha-scorpion with a laser-mounted tail, flamethrower mouth, a drill and a sawblade for arms, and many, many cannons. We owe the artist who brought this monstrosity to life a drink or three.\"\nOverview.\nThe Iron Juggernaut gathers energy as it assaults players with an array of cannons, lasers, and explosive attacks. Upon reaching full energy, the Juggernaut engages its Siege Mode, digging its claws into the ground and becoming sessile while employing new countermeasures. The Juggernaut cycles between these two phases until defeated.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1 (Assault Phase).\nAt the pull, the tanks should position the boss in an area with enough nearby obstacles to mitigate the effect of Shock Pulse in Phase 2. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; is best used on the pull, since all players will have their cooldowns available and the phase is less movement intensive than Phase 2.\nTanks need to face the boss away from the raid, and from each other, as Flame Vents is a cone attack. The off-tank should initially taunt when the current tank has 2 stacks (which then gives the current tank ample time to get into position for stomping Crawler Mines), and thereafter swap each time the Crawler Mines have been dealt with.\nThe Crawler Mines will spawn at set intervals (approximately every 20 seconds) in groups of 3. Once they root themselves into the ground, they begin a timer; if the timer runs out, the mine will do high raid-wide Physical damage. To prevent this damage, a designated player needs to run to melee range of the mine and click on it, but the trade-off is an extremely high amount of Physical damage (1.25 M), and a knock into the air (resulting in additional fall damage). As the damage is Physical, the off-tank at the time that the Crawler Mines spawn is always the ideal player that should stomp on the mines, although other players with immunities or high damage reductions (examples being &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dispersion\"&gt;Dispersion&lt;/a&gt; and so forth) can help the off-tank out whenever their immunities or high damage reductions are off cooldown. Letting one mine through is not problematic provided that the raid is topped up, but missing two will take out players with less health, and missing all mines will basically wipe the raid.\nAll DPS and healers should position behind the boss, keeping at least 8 yards apart from each other due to Mortar Cannon (for which players targeted will have to move). Players will also need to move from Borer Drill, and healers will have to heal the unavoidable damage from Laser Burn.\nAfter 2 minutes, the boss will immediately transition into Phase 2.\nPhase 2 (Siege Phase).\nIron Juggernaut will remain rooted in place for the entire phase, and does not need to be tanked. The boss continues to use Crawler Mines, so both tanks should handle the mines together and, when no Crawler Mines are active, contribute to DPS on the boss.\nShock Pulse is the most problematic ability. Players will need to make sure that they have an obstacle a short distance behind them while remaining within range of the boss, so that they do not get Shock Pulsed all the way to the Eastern Kingdoms. Getting knocked back too far away from the rest of the raid can (and will!) result in deaths due to being out of range of healers, and Crawler Mines running off to Stormwind (making it impossible for the tanks to stomp them in time).\nThe raid will need to spread out at least 6 yards from each other to minimise damage from Demolisher Cannons. Players will also need to avoid the Explosive Tar void zones and, if targeted by Cutting Laser, kite the laser beam well away from Explosive Tar (if the beam contacts the tar, the raid will likely wipe).\nHealers will be under considerable pressure to keep the raid up due to high unavoidable AoE damage from Seismic Activity, and should chain defensive cooldowns.\nAfter 60 seconds, the boss will immediately return to Phase 1. Continue to cycle through both phases until the boss is defeated.\nAchievement: Fire in the Hole!\nIf the Cutting Laser in Phase 2 is kited over any Crawler Mines, they become Superheated Crawler Mines (easy to notice, as the actual name of the mob will change). Stomping on 6 Superheated Crawler Mines and then defeating the boss will award &lt;a href=\"Fire%20in%20the%20Hole%21\"&gt;Fire in the Hole!&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trick is to position on one side of the boss until the Explosive Tar gets thrown, then run through to the opposite side of the boss in preparation for Shock Pulse. Shortly after the knockback, the mines will spawn -- the raid needs to quickly stack up just before the mines spawn, then move when the mines have rooted themselves. If done correctly, the mines will be in roughly the same place, making it easy for the Cutting Laser to be kited over them and for all three mines to consequently be stomped. It is important however that the raid only stack just before the Crawler Mines spawn, otherwise Explosive Tar can appear on or around the stack point.\nLoot.\nIt also drops &lt;a href=\"Pile%20of%20Juggernaut%20Parts\"&gt;Pile of Juggernaut Parts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s."}

The fearless mogu commander was dubbed \"Iron Qon\" by the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; for his unrelenting resolve to claim victory after victory for the empire regardless of the cost.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Qon is one of Lei Shen's elite personal guard, and a master of mounted combat. An original concept for this fight was inspired by the Three Kingdoms warlord Lu Bu, a fierce warrior renowned for his skill in fighting with a spear from horseback. Though Qon does have some very cool and unique mounted attack animations, in the end we found it more interesting to explore gameplay via the different abilities of his mounts instead. Thus, the encounter involves Qon switching among different magical quilen, each of which is empowered with vicious elemental attacks, creating a four-phase encounter that is almost like four separate intense fights rolled into one.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nIron Qon's Last Stand.\nHaving lost his prime quilen mounts, Iron Qon faces you himself. In addition to his previous attacks, he gains new abilities.\nStrategy.\nIn all phases, each tank should taunt off the other when their stacks of the Impale DoT fall off, at which point the other will have about 2-3 stacks. Other raiders should avoid clumping, and dodge thrown spears throughout the fight.\nPhase 1: Ro'shak, the Molten Flare.\nThe primary task of this phase is keeping Ro'shak's energy below 100 to prevent a Molten Overload, which will likely wipe the raid. Random casts of Molten Inferno will help with this (-10 energy), but the main method is to trigger Unleashed Flame, which releases 30 energy at once. The boss gains about 5 energy / sec, for a total of 8-10 seconds between Flames (along with an Inferno or two). Predetermined teams must rotate responsibility for attracting Flames due to Scorched, a stacking debuff increasing fire damage taken for 30 seconds. Thus, in the 30 seconds it takes to drop stacks, the raid can expect 3-4 new Unleashed Flames to go out. To attract Unleashed Flame, a team clusters together while the boss has at least 30 energy. When the next team takes over clustering (once their own debuffs expire), the now-Scorched team spreads out.\nThere are several approaches to dividing teams. Using the smallest possible teams (3, 3, and 4 in 10-man, and 5 teams of 5 in 25-man) means frequent team rotation and higher initial Unleashed Flame damage to each player, but fewer debuff stacks at once and less clumping of players. Big teams (2 teams of 5, or 2 teams of 12 &amp; 13) are simpler, lower in individual damage (before the debuff starts piling up), higher in total debuff stacks, and more clumped up. Clumping and debuff stacks make the raid more vulnerable to other AoE, require more total healing, force more people to dodge thrown spears at once, and sometimes require melee to attack from the front (so as to cluster with tanks). Still, well geared raids frequently \"go big\" for its simplicity, and can often burn the boss down before requiring the ranged group to cluster for any Unleashed Flames at all (avoiding the spear dodging issue). Raids looking to maximize DPS and conserve healer mana tend to go with the first approach.\nIf melee players are currently trying to clear their Scorched debuff, they must take care not to get near the tanks and trigger an Unleashed Flame out of turn. If there's a high enough number of melee-ers in the raid (3 or 5 for 10- or 25-man), they must be \"extremely\" careful not to get too close to each other when they're not on clustering duty.\nAdditionally, fire will erupt from the thrown spear throughout the phase, creating a crisscrossing web of fire lines that inflict a stacking DoT for 15 seconds. Players should avoid crossing the lines when possible, but performing the clustering duties takes priority. The phase ends when Ro'shak is dead.\nIn summary: Swap tanks, rotate clustering in teams to reduce energy, dodge spears, and don't cross the lines.\nPhase 2: Quet'zal, the Stormcaller.\nPhase 2 is marked by Quet'zal's most dramatic ability: Windstorm. All players will be pulled to the center of the room, tornadoes will circle around it, and everyone will take an overwhelming effectiveness debuff and continuous damage while they remain in the storm. One side of the room to run to should be pre-designated, often the entrance. Players must exit the storm in that direction as quickly as possible \"without getting hit by any tornadoes\". Warlock portals will help with this, and healers should be given priority so that they can heal from the edge of the storm while others make their way out.\nOnce again, lines of lightning will erupt from thrown spears throughout the phase, creating a crisscrossing web throughout the area. These Storm Clouds will deal a hefty amount of damage and apply a 20 second debuff that will stun you for 20 seconds if it reaches 3 stacks. \"No player with 2 stacks should ever cross a Storm Cloud line.\" While avoiding Storm Clouds, players must also free anyone hit by Arcing Lightning as soon as possible, as the target cannot receive healing until they are rescued. This is accomplished by simply interacting with them from melee range. Arcing Lightning will also apply a 30 second DoT that spreads to adjacent players; both the target and their rescuer should avoid other raiders until it expires. Finally, all players should dodge the wandering tornadoes left over from Windstorm. Killing Quet'zal ends the phase.\nIn summary: Continue tank swapping, run out of Windstorm, dodge tornadoes and spears, free Arcing Lightning players, \"and don't cross the lines\".\nPhase 3: Dam'ren, the Frozen Sage.\nPhase 3 has no signature ability, simply a number of things to avoid and reposition for:\nPhase 4: Iron Qon's Last Stand.\nIron Qon will stop throwing spears and start dealing increasing amounts of raid-wide damage in this phase. The raid should clump together for AoE healing as there is no need to dodge anything but slow-moving tornadoes. The most damage comes from Fist Smash, a 7.5 sec Physical AoE; Ignited Cyclones add to this amount. Bloodlust and other cooldowns should be used for the final push, when his Rising Anger has stacked up a few times. Once again, he can be kept near the entrance to help avoid tornadoes. Some of these will be Frozen, taking down the health of anyone touched extremely quickly. Avoid them while hammering the boss to his death.\nHeroic mode.\nThe fight plays the same way as normal mode, but every mount of Qon retreats at 25% health, and he gets aided by an inactive quilen during each phase:\nPhase 1: Quet'zal targets random players, spawns a tornado, then becomes active a few seconds later, dealing damage to players and knocking them up in the air. Players must simply move from the tornadoes while keeping their stacks of Unleash Flames in mind.\nPhase 2: Dam'ren summons Frost Spikes under random players, which hit for 150k frost damage and knock the players up a few seconds later. Players should simply try to move from them, though getting him by them once isn't that deadly.\nPhase 3: Ro'shak will simply use Unleash Flames on player clusters. The raid must simply use the same stacking rotation as phase 1 and heal though the damage.\nAs soon as the last Quilen reaches 25% ALL the Quilen will join the fight along Iron Qon. The raid should simply &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust%20effect\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; and burn Ro'shak first (to cut the Unleashed Flame damage), then Dam'ren (because of his Dead Zones disrupting dps) and last Quet'zal, who simply casts Arcing Lightning. The Quilen use the abilities listed above and have normal threat tables. As soon as all three Quilen are dead Iron Qon will start to cast Fist Smash with several stacks of Rising Anger and your raid should simply keep burning him and stay alive until the end of the fight, as his damage towards the end will be massive.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

After being defeated during the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Assault\"&gt;Hellfire Assault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siegemaster%20Mar%27tak\"&gt;Siegemaster Mar'tak&lt;/a&gt; pilots the Iron Reaver to show intruders the true power of Gul'dan's Horde. The fight revolves around how easily the raid can dodge the various attacks that come from the boss. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The schematics for the Iron Reaver were found in the workshop of &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt; himself after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, drawing inspiration from the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20reaver\"&gt;mighty constructs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; and designed to be the nefarious &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;'s masterwork. The project was completed after his death, and represents the pinnacle of the Iron Horde's military might.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"We started out thinking of the traditional &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt; here, but the more mechanized side of the Legion is only present in an all-out invasion, and that didn\u2019t really feel appropriate given the nature of their involvement here. So instead we went with an interpretation of the Fel Reaver that reflects the apex of the goblin-influenced siege vehicle that &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; brought to the Iron Horde: an evolved version of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; that once defended Orgrimmar, retrofitted to use fel power.\"\nOverview.\nBefore reaching full power, the Iron Reaver fights enemies on the ground, leveraging her size and technological superiority against opponents. Upon reaching full power, the Iron Reaver takes to the skies. While flying, the Reaver takes 95% reduced damage and has access to an arsenal of new devastating abilities.\nAbilities.\nGround Operation.\nBefore reaching full power, the Iron Reaver fights enemies on the ground, leveraging her size and technological superiority against opponents.\nAir Operation.\nUpon reaching full power, the Iron Reaver takes to the skies. While flying, the Reaver takes 95% reduced damage and has access to an arsenal of new devastating abilities.\nStrategy.\nThis fight is heavy on movement, so speed buffs will be useful. The boss requires 2 tanks and has two phases: Ground, which the boss starts out with, and Air, which starts when the boss reaches 100 energy. Pop &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; on pull, as there is no advantage in waiting and there will be more movement and distractions as the fight goes on. \nShortly after being engaged, the boss will begin firing Barrages at non-tank players, walking backwards 3 paces and then firing a spray of felfire the direction she is facing. The attack can be easily dodged by moving to the side. Artillery and Barrages will also leave large pools of felfire around the raid, simply \"do not stand in the fire.\" In addition, the boss will occasionally use Pounding, causing unavoidable AOE damage to the raid which is increased when players stand within 6 yards of each other. Spread out to avoid unnecessary damage. The force of Pounding also pushes pools of fire away from the boss, so be mindful and position yourself accordingly. Blitz is when the boss charges up for a few seconds, then rushes in the direction of a random player. The charge-up time should give enough chance to move out of the way. Those who are hit will be carried along with the Iron Reaver across the arena before the boss rushes in the opposite direction.\nFor tanks, the Iron Reaver will target it's current tank with Artillery, causing the tank to increase in size and have a large red arrow above them similar to &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Mark\"&gt;Hunter's Mark&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Artillery debuff expires, the targeted tank will be shot with a massive explosive blast. While most tanks will be able to survive this with more than half their health, other nearby raid members will take deadly damage. Set up a marker safely away from the raid (some raids prefer two markers, one for each tank) for your tanks to run toward when they are targeted with Artillery, tank-swapping whenever one is targeted. In regards to Blitz and Barrage, the boss will be moving around the arena and the tanks must be fast enough to pick up the boss while managing to keep Artillery away from the raid. \nOnce the boss reaches 100 energy, she will enter her Air Phase. At this point she reduces all damage taken by 95%, making it useless to attack. Instead the raid should be focusing on the Volatile Firebombs she drops as she strafes the raid. The bombs are on a timer and will cause major damage to the entire raid if the timer runs out, so kill them asap. Complicating matters is that she will also be targeting 3 non-tank players with a weaker, though still potent, Artillery. Targeted players should simply avoid standing near other raid members. The boss will also be firing streaks of ignited oil across the arena. Dodge them as you take out the bombs and stay out of the oil, as well as the felfire left over from phase 1. Once the Iron Reaver reaches zero energy, she will crash down with Falling Slam, creating a large visible circle where she is going to land. Once she lands, finish off any bombs remaining before switching back to the boss. Once her Air phase is done, her Pounding will becoming stronger with a stacking buff, but the raid should be able to kill the boss before it gets higher than 2 stacks.\nVideos.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVXCVkEAi1ac\"&gt;Heroic Iron Reaver - Mage&lt;/a&gt;"}

They all are visibly spent and recharge one at a time.\nIn the RPG.\nThis powerful arcane artifact appears to be a sphere of green magical fire that hovers around the owner in much the same way an &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD%3AIoun_Stone\"&gt;ioun stone&lt;/a&gt; orbits its owner's head. Legend has it the orb siphons a portion of the essence of every evil &lt;a href=\"outsider\"&gt;outsider&lt;/a&gt; slain by its owner. The orb draws on the essence of these &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s for its own powers, the spirits writhing in torment within it for all eternity. The reason it is most sought after by arcane casters, however, is its ability to enhance spells. All fire spells cast by the owner have their range widened, increasing the area of damage."}

Nearly all of Vereesa's &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;extended family&lt;/a&gt; were killed by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Rhonin became leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa created and still leads the Silver Covenant, a militant core of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; that rejected the admission of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; into the Kirin Tor and who took it upon themselves to serve as a military deterrent for any potential &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; uprising. She styled herself as the \"Ranger General of the Silver Covenant\", her own version of the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. After her husband's death and an act of treason both caused by the blood elves within the Kirin Tor, Vereesa joined &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded Rhonin, in the Sunreaver &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nHistory.\nVereesa is a member of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; family of the high elves. Her elder sisters &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; eventually rose to the ranks of ranger captain and &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ranger general&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. She also had a younger brother named &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath&lt;/a&gt;. Her family lived at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the tranquil forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe young Vereesa was inducted into the entry ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; some time before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, rising to become among the best of her training group. More than one of her tutors scolded her for her reckless attitude and fighting style, derogatorily comparing her impatience to that of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;'s. She did not take an active part in the Second War itself, presumably due to a lack of experience, and hadn't battled a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; until her foray into &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, when Quel'Thalas' forest began mysteriously to burn, Vereesa alongside Alleria were attacked by forest trolls. Fortunately, they were rescued by Sylvanas and her rangers. Young for her kind, Vereesa was only a year out of her apprenticeship following the Second War.\nVereesa had a particularly close relationship with Sylvanas, whom she looked up to and tried to emulate her entire life.\nBefore Alleria left through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; assault on Draenor, she intended to give Sylvanas and Vereesa each a necklace, which were once part of a larger one given to Alleria by their parents. She had this necklace melted down and crafted into three lockets in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The emerald she kept for herself, and she gave &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;the sapphire&lt;/a&gt; and the ruby to her second, &lt;a href=\"Verana\"&gt;Verana&lt;/a&gt;, to deliver to her sisters. Within Vereesa's ruby locket was inscribed, \"To Vereesa. With love, Alleria.\"\nAfter Alleria and her husband &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; vanished on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa took in their son &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;.\nDay of the Dragon.\nFollowing in Alleria's footsteps, Vereesa too became a &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;. To her disgust, her first major assignment did not involve hunting down the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s that had been trapped on the planet &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the Dark Portal's destruction. Instead, she was asked to escort a human wizard named &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hasic\"&gt;Hasic&lt;/a&gt;, one of the eastern ports of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. She accomplished her mission only to discover that there were no ships available to take Rhonin to his ultimate destination: &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhonin claimed that his mission was minor and only required him to observe the orc presence in Khaz Modan. Yet he remained unusually determined to fulfill it. He even appealed to a group of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to fly him to Khaz Modan on one of their &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. At first the dwarves refused, for they trusted humans little and wizards even less. Yet Vereesa had grown fond of Rhonin, and she suspected that his mission was more important than he wanted to admit. Appealing to the dwarves, she persuaded them to fly both her and Rhonin to Khaz Modan. Although Rhonin was separated from her along the flight, she tracked him all the way to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, which was a Horde stronghold under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing a magical artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, Nekros had managed to enslave &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and, through her, most of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; had sent Rhonin to Grim Batol with instructions to free Alexstrasza. Disguised as a mage named Krasus, Korialstrasz did not truly hope that Rhonin would be able to liberate the Dragonqueen. Rather, Korialstrasz hoped to trick the Horde into believing that a full-scale invasion was about to occur. While the Horde evacuated Grim Batol, Korialstrasz planned to strike and free his queen. His plan backfired when the massive &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly showed up and began stealing Alexstrasza's eggs. In fact, Deathwing had helped Rhonin reach Grim Batol precisely for that reason: the insane &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; wanted to bolster his own failing flight by kidnapping Alexstrasza's children and raising them as his own. However, the other Dragon Aspects arrived to stop Deathwing. With the help of Vereesa and a group of dwarves, Rhonin took the Demon Soul from Nekros and managed to destroy it. Their powers fully restored, Alexstrasza and the other Aspects attacked Deathwing and forced him to flee. Deathwing has not been seen since that time.\nNot long after their adventure, Vereesa and Rhonin were married.\nWar of the Ancients Trilogy.\nFollowing the success of the mission, Vereesa was asked to act as an Alliance Ambassador by &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. She and Rhonin were tasked with touring the Alliance and reminding everyone that there were other threats in the world besides &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s that would have to be faced sooner or later. Along with Rhonin and Krasus, Vereesa was among the few well-known survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and Quel'Thalas after the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. The day that &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; fell was one of the darkest of her life.\nThe rest of her family was not so lucky. They were one of the hardest hit by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion into Quel'Thalas. Sylvanas was killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and raised as a banshee in his service, later becoming Banshee Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The sisters' grandfather had to battle his own son, their uncle, after he was turned into an undead.\nWhile she and her husband, Rhonin, were preparing for the birth of their twin offspring, &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt;, Rhonin was once again summoned by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; for help. As a reward for Rhonin's courage, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; allowed Rhonin to return to Vereesa at the moment she went into labor to ensure he would not miss a moment of the twins' lives. Nozdormu also offered the children the friendship of the bronze dragonflight. A &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Jalia\"&gt;Jalia&lt;/a&gt; assisted in the birth.\nNight of the Dragon.\nAt one time, Vereesa was close to her cousin &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;: an ambitious young elf whose difficulty fitting the mold of high elven society was similar to that of Vereesa's own. After the rise of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, Zendarin took well to the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, as his withdrawals from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s power were too much to bear. Having suffered from her own magical withdrawal, Vereesa reflected that she too may have joined them, had it not been for &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;'s support which helped her to recuperate. After the birth of her sons, her love for her children was enough to distract her from the pangs of addiction and loss.\nZendarin, now a blood elf who had always hated humans, tried to kidnap her children as he believed the offspring of a high elf and a human mage would have a lot of magic power. He failed in this attempt.\nShe appears again in the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Night of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\", where she braved the depths of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, seeking revenge on Zendarin. Zendarin sought to steal the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; (possibly as an alternate magic source having failed to take Dargonax, or as a secondary objective), the foul creation of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; that had been destroyed by Rhonin years earlier. He would have pulled it off if not for Vereesa's intervention, which resulted in the destruction of the Demon Soul \u2014 and of Zendarin himself \u2014 when the stolen staff of the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; touched the artifact. Vereesa also assists &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priestess\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt;, in destroying &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;, as redemption for Zendarin's murder of Iridi's comrade.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nVereesa is located in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;. She created and is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, a militant group of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; who oppose the inclusion of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in the Kirin Tor. She is involved in the &lt;a href=\"A%20Victory%20For%20The%20Silver%20Covenant%20%28sword%29\"&gt;Quel'delar&lt;/a&gt; quest chain: The champions of the Silver Covenant will fight the forces of the Scourge in the Frozen Halls and its Sunreaver counterpart in Dalaran to restore the magical blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; from its defiled state by the &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;. She appears as part of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; faction within Dalaran, and is &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; to Horde players as a result. She will not attack, cannot be attacked, and cannot be interacted with.\nUltimately, Vereesa's opposition to the blood elves' readmission to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was doomed to failure: Vereesa herself held no political sway within Dalaran, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; were able to overcome their opposition into the Kirin Tor.\nStormrage.\nVereesa was caught in by the Emerald Nightmare. She later attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, two old friends and comrades of her husband, along with their twin boys.\nCataclysm.\nVereesa is called upon by the ranger-general of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, to help address the threat of a revitalized &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire brewing in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. She travels to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and meets with Brightwing alongside the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer presence is not well received in the upper echelons of Silvermoon City, and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; sends a messenger to demand to know why she holds presence in Quel'Thalas. A frustrated Vereesa mentions that Quel'Thalas is as much her home as it is his, and that she will not see it fall to their &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;ancient enemy&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron states that he had personally invited her to supplement his own &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, as it would take time to recall enough of them. The two ranger-generals along with Vol'jin discuss their plans for battle.\nTides of War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; called for aid to defend &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; against an overwhelming attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa came with her husband &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; to help. However, after the battle, she was informed that the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde traitor within the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, had been rescued during the attack. After coordinating with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and her sentinels, Vereesa took a scouting party west into &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to look for him, and so was not present when &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; used a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Theramore and all its inhabitants, including Rhonin. Vereesa returned to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to mourn, and accompanied Jaina to plead the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to take action against &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for Rhonin's death. She later appeared with her children at Rhonin's memorial service.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nVereesa led the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in aiding the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces to purge the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered that &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; steal the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. The Silver Covenant was instrumental in preventing the Sunreavers from escaping and neutralizing any Horde insurrections or Sunreaver sympathizers who were aiding and abetting their resistance to incarceration.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nVereesa was serving as secondary leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, stationed near the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, where she would accompany members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s flagship, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Seabolt\"&gt;The Seabolt&lt;/a&gt;\", on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. She revealed that the pandaren were concerned about the return of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; the Thunder King, but personally she was more concerned about the Horde. Vereesa expressed concern with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; presence on the isle, fearful that the world at large would suffer should they get their hands on the source of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s power. She was also eager to avenge the death of her husband.\nVereesa also appeared within the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; when the base had been established.\nVereesa eventually accompanied Jaina to the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Crossing\"&gt;Bloodied Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and does battle with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; forces in the area. After they won the battle against &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa was present when Jaina and Lor'themar face off in the courtyard. United by sharing &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;an unlikely enemy&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina and the regent lord came to an agreement, though Vereesa was uneager to retreat, stating that they killed &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;her husband&lt;/a&gt;, but Jaina reminded her that fighting here wouldn't bring him back.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nVereesa accompanies King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s force to seize &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; from Hellscream's forces, and takes part in the &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; encounter. During the battle Vereesa wears a new outfit that more closely resembles her artwork.\nWar Crimes.\nVereesa accompanied &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; to the trial of Garrosh Hellscream. Embittered by the loss of her husband and fuelled by vengeance, Vereesa desired the death sentence to be passed on the former warchief. As the trial continued, however, it became increasingly apparent to Vereesa that he may yet escape this fate and face life imprisonment instead, with even the possibility of acquittance. Unwilling to let this happen, Vereesa reached out to her sister, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, by sending her ruby necklace and arranged a meeting at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa asked Sylvanas to provide her with a potent, untraceable poison she could use to murder Garrosh, which Sylvanas agreed to consider. While the sisters were wary of each other at first, they rekindled a surprisingly positive bond over the course of their meetings, as they reflected on their childhoods, their deceased loved ones, and the lives they'd both left behind.\nAs the sisters continued to plot and bond, Vereesa came to doubt what she had left in the Alliance. Noting this, Sylvanas made her an offer: Vereesa could join her in the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and co-rule with her. She could rise to a position of great power, with the ability to shape things as the Windrunners saw fit. Seeing what they were about to accomplish in killing Garrosh (something both the Horde and Alliance had failed to do), Vereesa agreed to consider the offer.\nThe following court day, Vereesa was forced to witness Rhonin's last moments in Theramore through the Vision of Time leaving her in tears. Fuelled with anger and grief at seeing her husband's selfless sacrifice for her, she left for &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, where she met with Sylvanas, who had provided the poison - a particularly potent strain, that would no doubt give Garrosh a painful end. She had chosen Tirisfal over the Ghostlands to become better acquainted with where she would soon be living; though dark, she believed the glades had a certain beauty. Vereesa's increasing affinity for her soon-to-be home pleased her sister greatly, though Sylvanas had not given her the full story: the Forsaken would never accept a living ruler, so she planned to give Vereesa a painless death and resurrect her as a powerful banshee, like her, so that the two could rule together forever.\nVereesa integrated herself into the temple's kitchens, giving her access to Garrosh's food. Putting aside all reluctance, she succeeded in lacing his meal with the poison, and left to reflect on what now awaited her. On the cusp of joining her sister in the Horde, however, Vereesa began to have her doubts. On one hand, she looked forward to ruling alongside her sister and having access to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; again, though her time with the cook &lt;a href=\"Mu-Lam%20Shao\"&gt;Mu-Lam Shao&lt;/a&gt; (and then a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;) made her think of her boys back home in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing they would have no place in the Undercity, Vereesa left for Dalaran to be with them, promising never to consider leaving them again. She sent a letter to Sylvanas to tell her of this. Her decision was a blow to Sylvanas, who had greatly lowered her defenses around her sister.\nBefore leaving, Vereesa told Anduin of her plot to poison Garrosh, leaving the warchief's fate in the prince's hands. Ultimately, Anduin chose to rescue him, though kept Vereesa's secret.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; acquired information on the whereabouts of Vereesa's sister &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa traveled to &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20Isle\"&gt;Darkstone Isle&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to join forces with them and plan a rescue attempt. She summoned the soon-to-be leader of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to assist in this endeavour. Although she was unhappy to trust the word of a demon, who claimed Alleria and her &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;fabled bow&lt;/a&gt; were present on a Legion world known as &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; demons, Vereesa was willing to take the risk. &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Orestes\"&gt;Ranger Orestes&lt;/a&gt; argued that the mission was too personal on Vereesa's side, which she unconvincingly denied, claiming it was simply to recover a strategic asset and nothing more. Vereesa forbade Orestes from taking part in the mission, not wanting to risk lives until Alleria's presence was confirmed, but he went ahead regardless. Vereesa fought her way through Niskara to rescue both Orestes and Alleria; however, Orestes was heavily wounded, and died encouraging Vereesa to rescue Alleria. Vereesa narrowly avoided succumbing to an inquisitor's mental attack, but Alleria was nowhere to be found. Only her bow was left, and Vereesa inferred that the demons had hoped to lure Alleria back with it. She suggested the hunter champion be the one to claim it, acknowledging them as a hero on par with her sister. She returned to Dalaran and intended to sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; about Orestes' death.\nVereesa then led her rangers to &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, where she reunited with Halduron and informed him of the mission's events. Representing the Silver Covenant among the Unseen Path's union of all hunters on Azeroth, Vereesa promised the aid of her order to the Path's new leader following their inauguration. As a member of the Unseen Path, Vereesa participated in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Vereesa can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, she is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nInsurrection.\nVereesa, along with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her sentinels, leads a group of Silver Covenant war mages to Suramar to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their attempt to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; from its Burning Legion-aligned masters. Still vengeful for the death of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;her husband&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;her king&lt;/a&gt;, she counselled against trusting the nearby Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, but a formal, if tense, truce was made between the two armies regardless. Kirin Tor guards comment that &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; has had to step in and stop Vereesa from shooting at Rommath more than once, and Liadrin does not trust Vereesa to protect their flank when the time comes to attack the city. Vereesa also finds it peculiar that she'd ever share a camp with the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting that desperate times call for desperate measures.\nShe takes part in the strike into Suramar, and the combined elven army fights its way to the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself, where the kaldorei, sin'dorei, quel'dorei and shal'dorei rebels are confronted by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. When she turns to address Vereesa, the magistrix derides the quel'dorei as \"peasants playing at nobility\", unworthy of the name high elves, and mocks their tendency to \"mingle\" with lesser races that dilute their bloodline. Elisande then unleashes her time magic, trapping the entire elven army, Vereesa included, in a time stasis, causing their defeat.\nVereesa is freed and can be seen later in the Nighthold cinematic with Khadgar and Lady Liadrin.\nArgus.\nVereesa later travels with her nephew &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. She witnesses the return of her sister &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and Alleria's husband &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. Arator has a conversation with Vereesa regarding the fate of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and what Vereesa will tell his mother, to which Vereesa responds that the thought of the conversation fills her with dread and the truth will break Alleria's heart.\nWhen Vereesa later informed Alleria that Sylvanas was now &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, Alleria refused to believe it after everything the Horde did to &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;their people&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa was unsure of how to tell Alleria that Sylvanas was also undead, or if it was even the right time or place to do so. When Alleria pressed her for answers, Vereesa decided the matter would be best discussed in private.\nVereesa can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where she fights demons seeking to reach the \"Vindicaar\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa commented about how much Alleria changed with her wielding powers that she couldn't comprehend. But in her heart, she remained her beloved sister. Vereesa knew that the news of Sylvanas weighed heavily on Alleria, and that some matters had to be settled face to face. The Windrunner sisters had to meet, and there was only one place for it to be done.\nThree Sisters.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa discussed her impending family reunion between the Windrunner sisters with her sons. While &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; had hopes this reunion could heal the rift between their families, &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt; argued their aunt &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; was evil and was now working with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that killed their &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;. Giramar thought that accusing people of being evil only challenged them to show people how evil they could be, while Galadin saw little potential in the goodness of undead beings. Vereesa ended the argument by reminding her sons that they were brothers and there may come a day when they may only have themselves to rely on, silently musing there was a time when she and her sisters had relied on each other. Vereesa's sons hugged their mother goodbye and agreed to Vereesa's wisdom before Vereesa entered a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; portal to her destination.\nVereesa met &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; in their favorite spot in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria greeted Vereesa by affectionately, calling her \"Little Moon\". With such golden hair, Vereesa replied that it was only fitting that Alleria's nickname was \"Lady Sun\", although since her transformation with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria felt she could no longer bear that name. When Vereesa questioned how the Void had affected her, Alleria assured Vereesa she was capable of resisting the Void's dark power and her love for her loved ones kept her anchored. Vereesa and Alleria catch up on what has transpired since Alleria was away, including the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; escalated by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the death of Vereesa's husband &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;bombing of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa mentioned that she had a brief reconnection with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; when they plotted revenge against Garrosh during his trial in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, but she had abandoned the plot and warned &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; who subsequently saved Garrosh from being poisoned. Although concerned about Sylvanas' apparent darker nature, returning to their homeland has given Alleria hope of them starting anew as she reminisces about happier times with her sisters and their late brother &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas interrupted Alleria's nostalgia by locking hands with her as they did when they used to dance together, and despite her initial shock, Alleria greeted Sylvanas by her old nickname, \"Lady Moon\".\nThey made their way to the undead portions of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas told Alleria the tale of how &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to desecrate the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas provided the Windrunner sisters &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt;s as they proceeded to purging the undead they met in their path to their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;. During their journey, the sisters played the game \"One is a lie\" in which they each made three statements with one being a lie. They eventually encountered &lt;a href=\"Goldenmist%20Village\"&gt;Goldenmist Village&lt;/a&gt; which was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s of people they once knew. As the Windrunner sisters defended themselves against the attacking shades, Alleria accused Sylvanas of manipulating Vereesa into murdering Garrosh Hellscream. Sylvanas defended her character and revealed it was Vereesa's plan from the beginning and held Vereesa's lack of nerve responsible for the fallout of Garrosh's actions thereafter, including the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas' rage culminated in her unleashing her banshee powers on one shade and brutally eviscerated it. Disgusted by Sylvanas' savage brutality, Alleria transformed into her &lt;a href=\"Entropic%20Embrace\"&gt;Void form&lt;/a&gt; to declare that the sister she once knew was gone. Sylvanas retorted she had no choice in becoming undead while Alleria abandoned them and chose to become a Void abomination.\nAs the two sisters argued, Vereesa tried to stop the quarrel and claimed that neither of her sisters were there for her when she needed them and had hurt her feelings when they let her believe they both had died. Vereesa tried to dissipate the hostilities by refocusing their efforts in clearing their home of the undead and revealing the verdicts of their game. Vereesa was the first to reveal her truths: she does believe the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; will reflect on their actions and rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and she does fear losing her sisters, but her lie was she has moved past Rhonin's death and that she sees him every day in her sons. She concluded her confession with her telling Alleria she envies her time with Turalyon. Alleria told Vereesa that much has changed between her and Turalyon, and she has doubts of their love surviving. When it was Sylvanas' turn to reveal her truths and lie, she refused to continue the game. Alleria told Sylvanas to keep her secrets, acknowledging that her family was broken, and created a Void portal to return Vereesa and her home, the three sisters apparently dropping their necklaces from the spire at the end of the meeting. Before they left, Vereesa apologized to Sylvanas for promising to stay with her after their plot with Garrosh and changing her mind at the last minute by letter. In tears, Vereesa told Sylvanas that she hoped that one day her older sister would forgive her, and subsequently returned to her sons in Dalaran.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSeeking to protect Azeroth and depose of Sylvanas, Horde revolutionaries led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance planned to strike at &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and to that end set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. However, before combined Horde-Alliance forces could strike against &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Sylvanas's forces&lt;/a&gt;, Varok and Anduin were approached by Vereesa and Alleria. Knowing that &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; had been freed, Alleria revealed her belief that Sylvanas commanded what may be the only army capable of defeating the Old God, and thus she suggested that the Alliance and Horde revolutionaries stand aside and let her. In response, Anduin was quick to point out that Sylvanas wouldn't fight for them and that she had lured both fleets into &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s hands to meet death when the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be on the cusp of ending. Remarking that they couldn't fight two wars at once, Anduin told her that Sylvanas must fall here before all was lost. Swayed by Anduin's argument, Alleria declared that she and Vereesa would scout Sylvanas's lines for weaknesses.\nThough Vereesa was prepared to face against Sylvanas's forces, Varok Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. During the duel, Saurfang was able to get Sylvanas to admit that she considered the Horde nothing, which caused the Warchief to swiftly kill him and abandon the Horde altogether. With Sylvanas's defection, the Horde united once more with Sylvanas's former loyalists defecting to Saurfang's revolution. With Saurfang dead and Sylvanas no longer in command of the Horde, the Alliance forces (Vereesa among them) departed from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nTowards the end of the events in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was reunited with a portion of her soul that she had long been missing. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa and Alleria traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to attend Sylvanas' trial, during which the latter submitted to the judgment of her archenemy &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe three sisters only had time to exchange a brief farewell before Tyrande sentenced Sylvanas to her fate - to scour the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and free all the souls trapped therein, especially those of the night elves she sent there. Sylvanas accepted this and exchanged a last look with Vereesa and Alleria before jumping into the Maw. Afterward, Vereesa and Alleria stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt; for a time and discussed how, having lost so much of their family already, they had to hope that Sylvanas could one day complete her penance so they could be reunited with her, and perhaps the sister that they once knew.\nPersonality.\nLike her sisters, Vereesa is a talented ranger, and was among the best of her class. At first, Vereesa was unimpressed with the humans and the Alliance, but like Alleria (and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;perhaps&lt;/a&gt; Sylvanas), she would go on to romance a human hero of distinction. Vereesa came to love and marry &lt;a href=\"Rhonin%20Redhair\"&gt;Rhonin Redhair&lt;/a&gt;, with whom she had two &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; children, and their presence provided huge support to Vereesa in the testing years to come. She was left crushed by Rhonin's death, and resolved to avenge him. Interestingly, despite the historical tension between their races, Vereesa would also come to develop a cordial relationship with several prominent night elves, allowing &lt;a href=\"Moonbell\"&gt;Moonbell&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; ranks and &lt;a href=\"Muran%20Fairden\"&gt;Muran Fairden&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt;; personally attending &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s wedding in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; with her family (her husband Rhonin having helped her ancestors win the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;); sharing the same camp with Tyrande and her Sentinels in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;; and having helped her daughter &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; hunt down &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, and later protect &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as fellow leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;.\nVereesa is a sworn enemy of the Horde, especially after the events of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the deaths of her husband and her king, but still cares for her sister, the Horde leader &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and it is mentioned that as the two middle children, the two Moons had always shared a special bond that set them apart from Alleria and Lirath. Nevertheless, it is later revealed that Sylvanas shared an even deeper bond with Lirath, and Vereesa and Sylvanas even developed a personal rift after Sylvanas learned Vereesa was indirectly responsible for Lirath's death by training him prematurely. Vereesa was originally unaware of Sylvanas' fate; however, when she learned of it, Vereesa mourned her sister and was enraged when her cousin Zendarin recklessly called Sylvanas a &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;. The two would be reunited years later, and the sisters reconnected to a point that Vereesa considered leaving the Alliance to join her sibling in the Forsaken. Ultimately, she could not bear to leave her two sons &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt; behind, and returned to them in Dalaran, vowing to herself to never contemplate forsaking her children again. Like her elder sister Alleria, Vereesa especially loathes the orcs for murdering her younger brother as well as her husband, reminding Sylvanas that they had ever been their people's enemies, but was ultimately unable to bring herself to go through with an assassination of Garrosh Hellscream, as she ultimately considered it dishonorable and a betrayal of her ideals. It is also strongly implied that in contrast with Alleria (who regards Sylvanas with much greater hostility and expressed regret for not killing her several times), Vereesa still deeply loves Sylvanas, yearning for more time together with her sister, and staunchly refusing to give up on her \"if even a chance that a spark of Sylvanas\" has returned.\nShe also appears to share a close bond with &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, as well as her nephew &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; (whom she mentions being a blessing in her home to her two sons as well as herself), a bond likely cemented by their mutual continued affiliation with the Alliance, from their reunion on Argus, to their joint appearance at &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and later in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. Alleria, in turn, has expressed deep gratitude towards Vereesa for her caring for Arator in her absence, and is apparently especially protective of her, the Unseen Path's champion saving Vereesa the main reason why Alleria deemed them worthy of wielding &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah\"&gt;Thas'dorah&lt;/a&gt;, and the assumption that Sylvanas manipulated Vereesa to attempt to kill Garrosh a major reason why the two sisters nearly clashed, and why their reunion ultimately failed. Vereesa fears losing both Alleria and Sylvanas forever, being the one who stopped their hostility towards each other, asserting that their failure to reach out to her over the years wounded her deeply, and crying when realizing how deeply Sylvanas herself was hurt by her refusal to join her in the Undercity; she previously also stated that regardless of what changes she underwent, in Alleria's heart, she remained and would always be Vereesa's beloved sister.\nVereesa is one of the few remaining &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. While she considered becoming a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of her bereaved race, Rhonin was able to help her recuperate from the elves' arcane withdrawals, and she did not declare herself a blood elf. Vereesa left &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and relocated to Dalaran, although she still considers the elven kingdom to be as much her home as the blood elves', and does not wish it ill. Nevertheless, Vereesa developed an animosity toward at least some of the sin'dorei, implied to be due to their leaders' association with the Horde, whose races she holds responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. This feud took form in Dalaran, when Vereesa opposed the re-admittance of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; into the Kirin Tor and formed the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to deter any potential Horde uprising. The relationship was further strained by the destruction of Theramore (where some of the few remaining quel'dorei had settled for years, and after which Vereesa urged the Kirin Tor to expel Aethas) as well as Vereesa's controversial actions in the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa mentioned that while the wise but \"short-sighted\" Rhonin ignored her pleas to banish the Sunreavers from the city, she has believed the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s destiny has always been to serve the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and while she did not agree completely with Jaina's methods, she did understand them, arguing that capturing escaping Sunreavers was necessary in order to prevent them from plotting future counterattacks against Dalaran.\nIn addition, Vereesa at times seems to show greater hostility towards the blood elves than others; for example, her high elves were openly hostile towards the sin'dorei at Suramar, with Vereesa herself targeting Rommath several times for unclear reasons. She also once openly called Lor'themar a coward after he objected to her presence as an \"exile\" in Quel'Thalas, and the Regent Lord also scowled when Aethas mentioned his being a ranger being possibly able to bridge the gap between himself and the hostile Vereesa (implying some kind of personal history between the two leaders), but is cordial towards him when greeting him during the Trial of Garrosh Hellscream, having recently fought beside him at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, she was able to cooperate extremely well with &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Orestes\"&gt;Ranger Orestes&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, mourning his death and telling her fallen comrade to rest in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and further expresses her belief that the blood elves can be \"redeemed\" and will eventually rejoin the Alliance during the reunion of the three sisters. Despite lingering tensions and the fact that Vereesa is generally unwelcome in blood elf lands, she seems to still regard Quel'Thalas as her home, willing to risk her life to defend the kingdom if need be, and appears to be on fairly good terms with the blood elf military leader, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, especially after they joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; together, having worked cordially with members of her former order, the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, several times since.\nVereesa appears to be both highly prone to emotion and a pragmatic strategist - for example, for all her hostilities towards Rommath, she still ultimately joined the rest of her brethren in their assault on &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, standing alongside the other elves. She also successfully cooperated with the Horde members of the Unseen Path during the conflict, joining them at &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and refusing to abandon her city after Khadgar took charge, compared with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who resolutely refused to work with any Horde mages or tolerate their return to the ranks of the Kirin Tor, and abruptly left Dalaran to fend for itself. Vereesa even openly insisted that rescuing Alleria was nothing but an effort to \"re-acquire a strategic asset\" and \"retrieve a valuable ally\", although it was apparent that her true and most pressing objective was simply to save her older sister.\nThe youngest scion of the Windrunner family is now in a position to stave off future tragedy \u2013 if any remains to prevent.\nApperance.\nVereesa is a pretty High Elf of short stature with pale skin, unlike her sisters who are blonde, she has shoulder-length platinum white hair hence the nickname her sisters gave her, \"Little Moon\" and eyes that shine light blue. He wears blue and white armor with the symbol of the Silver Covenant with a matching cape and black boots.\nQuotes.\nPandaria.\nGossip.\nI have long waited for an opportunity to deal with the Sunreavers. I asked my late husband to remove them from the city, but he believed too firmly in the neutrality of the Kirin Tor.\nHe was wise, but he was short-sighted. This has always been the destiny of the Kirin Tor: to serve the Alliance.\nEnemies litter this isle, both old and new. We will not gain a foot of ground here without spilling blood for it.\nLegion.\nMeredil.\nFor the record, I counseled against trusting any Horde in this campaign. I have lost a husband and a King to the treachery of the Horde.\nI see no reason to trust you now or ever.\nI never thought I would share a camp with the kaldorei. But, desperate times, desperate measures.\nIn Hearthstone.\nVereesa appears as for the hunter class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Her Battlecry effect causes the player to equip &lt;a href=\"Thori%27dal%2C%20the%20Stars%27%20Fury\"&gt;Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon, even though Vereesa has never been associated with Thori'dal in &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa's flavor text reads: \"Good things come in threes: Windrunner sisters and arrows of Thori'dal.\"\nSpeculation.\nShe appears to hold a mutual animosity with the regent lord of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, referring to him as a 'coward' before being chided for it by &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt;. Exactly where this stems from is unclear, considering Lor'themar himself has been &lt;a href=\"The%20Return%20of%20Quel%27Delar%20quest%20chain\"&gt;generally tolerant&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; kin since the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was restored, perhaps implying a personal grudge between the two. Lor'themar's courier refers to Vereesa as an exile, which is correct - \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;In the Shadow of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" states many high elves were exiled because Lor'themar could not lead a divided nation, and Vereesa is presumed to have been one of them. It was presumed that her exile was self-imposed by fans also, as Vereesa was thought to have relocated to Dalaran of her own accord, as she was residing in Dalaran with Rhonin long before Aethas and the Sunreavers reconnected with the Kirin Tor. It is perhaps interesting that Vereesa's two sisters, Alleria and Sylvanas, the former once being his comrade, and the latter his superior and eventually leader, have also shared a previously close but complicated relationship with Lor'themar themselves.\nIronically, the closest thing to personal interaction Vereesa and Lor'themar have had was mutually (and in Sylvanas's opinion, surprisingly) respectful and courteous.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Neutralizing Drak'Tharon as a threat to Zul'Drak's future will be a task requiring immense bravery, and unless it is done soon, the entire empire, along with the power of its wild gods, may fall to the Scourge.\"\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; stronghold has been claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to betrayal from within by a troll named &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt;. With the intact fortress as a base of operations, the Scourge turned on Zul'Drak and began their invasion in earnest. The undead Drakkari &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s also began to pouring from Drak'Tharon Keep into the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, assaulting the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;. However, the invasion was oddly credited to the Drakkari themselves, not the Scourge.\nIts former leader, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20Tharon%27ja\"&gt;The Prophet Tharon'ja&lt;/a&gt;, was transformed into a massive &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20wind%20serpent\"&gt;skeletal wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;, and began to send his minions towards Zul'Drak in order to try to defeat the ancient ice troll empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;'s base in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; where he was \"killed\" by Arthas wielding &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; was close to Drak'Tharon Keep.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; years later, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that Drak'Tharon Keep is still under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and that the main focus for the undead Drakkari seems to be the complete destruction of Zul'Drak.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Drak'Tharon Keep once served the Drakkari trolls as a formidable outpost at the edge of their kingdom, Zul'Drak, but a recent Scourge invasion has delivered the fortress into the Lich King's hands. The keep's fallen defenders are now the Lich King's undead minions, and they are advancing into the heart of Drakkari territory.\"\nIn the RPG.\nDrak'Tharon Keep is an ancient stone citadel located on the northern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; (very close to the border with &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;) that once belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari trolls&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; drove them out, took possession of it, and now have a garrison here holding the mountain passes. It is a well placed, solidly built structure, and the small group of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; within can easily hold the keep against forces ten times its size, particularly since they don't need food or water during a siege. \nThe Scourge forces here are typical: nasty, violent and focused. The passes they hold the are located between Zul'Drak, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of the Grizzly Hills, so that more Scourge forces can reach the east or return to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. They use it as the Scourge's powerbase in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s southeastern corner. Two thousand Scourge creatures patrol the ruined old keep and often fight Drakkari and occasionally &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, though they have yet to attack either &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; directly. Thus far, the Scourge has not penetrated into Zul'Drak to any degree.\nSome stories say that the Drakkari built Drak'Tharon Keep before the furbolgs built Grizzlemaw, and the existence of the later affected the balance of the former. The furbolgs' victory over the Drakkari in a series of skirmishes may have led to Drak'Tharon's eventual loss of to the Scourge.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He was once a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, but went into exile after the clan was eradicated at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, he was encountered by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; during her pursuit of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSecond War.\nWhen the Stormreavers and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, they fled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and raised the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; from the seafloor. Drak'thul followed his chieftain Gul'dan inside the Tomb in search of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic power within, but Gul'dan was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Guardians\"&gt;Tomb's demon guardians&lt;/a&gt;. Between them and the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; forces, the Stormreavers and Twilight's Hammer were both nearly eradicated, with Drak'thul being one of the few survivors. He chose to become a hermit, wandering alone around the Broken Isles, constantly haunted by the ghosts of the many orcs who died in the battle.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nMany years later, Drak'thul was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, who asked him what happened on the isles. Drak'thul, wishing to be rid of the ghosts, said that he would tell her his story if she destroyed the battling apparitions. Maiev destroyed the skeletal orcs, took the &lt;a href=\"Soulfeast%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; that was reviving them from the pits and returned to Drak'thul to show the artifact to him. When the orc told her his story, Maiev regretted doing his bidding, saying that he deserved far worse than the company of his slain brethren for what he and his comrades had unleashed on the isles. Drak'thul responded by silently retreating back into his hut.\nLegion.\nDrak'thul remained on the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Thal'dranath&lt;/a&gt; all those years. He at first refused to talk to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;visitors&lt;/a&gt; but, after they found the &lt;a href=\"Weathered%20Relic\"&gt;Weathered Relic&lt;/a&gt; in a cave near the center of the island, Drak'thul revealed that a while after Maiev left, the ghosts' whispers returned. But they were different, deeper and darker. Drak'thul learned many things during his time on the Broken Isles, delved into places he wished he had not, and learned things he longed to forget. He now only wished to be alone until darkness overtook him at last. It is implied that the whispers he heard were related to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kosumoth%20the%20Hungering\"&gt;Kosumoth the Hungering&lt;/a&gt;, since at one point Drak'thul unconsciously spoke &lt;a href=\"Shath%27Yar\"&gt;Shath'Yar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThis weathered &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; wears a tattered wolf pelt and a pair of tarnished bracers sprouting wolf hair. The wolf's head falls over his face, obscuring his eyes, but his long gray hair spills, greasy, down his shoulders. He moves with arthritic care. Drak'thul didn't survive to become one of the last Stormreavers by being stupid. He is a canny combatant, staying back when he needs to stay back and striking preemptively when the situation warrants. He prefers ranged attacks, like shadow bolt, to eliminate his opponents early; if forced into melee, he uses spells like demon skin and mirror image to improve his chances. He avoids using his battle rage ability, as it clouds his mind and prevents him from fleeing if he is outmatched.\nSome time later, Drak'thul attacked the renowned explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, thinking that he was a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;. After he realized his mistake, Drak'thul apologized and agreed to share the history of the Broken Islands with him."}

{"id": "19028", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19028", "title": "Draka", "text": "Draka was a courageous &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, the mate of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, and the mother of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; (Thrall). After her death, her &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and became a baroness of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. She later joined the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; following the Eyes' near-destruction, and subsequently led the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in their battles against the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; houses. When Maldraxxus' lost ruler, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, returned to the realm, he named Draka the new Margrave of the Chosen, making her the house's official leader.\nBiography.\nA Warrior Made.\nShortly after Draka's birth to &lt;a href=\"Kelkar\"&gt;Kelkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zuura\"&gt;Zuura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; the young heir of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; blessed her on his mother &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;'s request. He did so but noticed that Draka was ill. Draka indeed turned into a weak and sickly child. Not only did her clanmates discriminate against her, but orcs from other clans also claimed she was a dishonor to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish race. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; said that if she was born in his clan, she would have been drowned at a young age. Draka and her family were forced to move to the outskirts of the Frostwolf village by &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;, though her parents understood the chieftain's reasons.\nAs a teenager, Draka asked &lt;a href=\"Kashur\"&gt;Mother Kashur&lt;/a&gt; if there was any way to strengthen her sickly body. Visited by a vision of the ancestors, Mother Kashur told Draka that there was a way, but it could mean death. Kashur sent Draka on a hunt to obtain a wing feather of &lt;a href=\"windroc\"&gt;windroc&lt;/a&gt;, horn of &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;, and fur of &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt;. From the three ingredients, Kashur claimed that she could make a potion to cure Draka's illness.\nHaving helped their daughter pack for her quest, Kelkar and Zuura saw her off with heavy hearts, believing it was more likely that they would never see her again. Young Draka started her adventure alone. She had never been allowed to join any orcish hunts, and now she had to learn from the world itself. As time passed, Draka's skill increased and, although still weak, she defeated and claimed her first kill of a windroc.\nDraka was eventually successful in defeating a talbuk and a clefthoof and obtained all the ingredients she needed. She returned back to Kashur, who revealed the true meaning of Draka's hunt, that the ingredients and potion were not truly needed. The hunt itself had been intended to make Draka a strong and determined Frostwolf orc. In the end, now proud and beautiful, Draka joined a &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; celebration, where she was noticed by &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nDurotan met Draka again at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; celebration without first recognizing her, now that she was healthy and strong. He was not sure whether she was of the Frostwolves, but finally understood who she was after seeing her eyes. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt; regretted that she was of another clan, for he would have claimed her otherwise.\nThe next day, Durotan asked her to join him on a hunt, something which often meant that a male orc intended to choose a female mate. Draka responded that she was too young to be anyone's mate. Durotan then offered that it would be simply a hunt between equal warriors and nothing more. Draka agreed, and they set out together, hunting a &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; but ending up ambushed by a great black &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. However, together the two orcs were able to survive and kill the beast, at the cost of a wound on Durotan's arm. After nursing him, Draka admitted that while the day prior she wasn't lying when saying she was too young, this day was actually her birthday and she was now adult. They kissed, marking the beginning of their relationship, and then had sex while unknowingly being observed by the &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, Draka stood by Durotan and his decisions through the years, although she did not like the situation of the orcs. She stood by Durotan when orcs accepted the &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt; and when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was created. Draka, Durotan, and their clan were exiled and found their homes in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore leaving &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Draka and Durotan visited Durotan's mother &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;. Draka told her she was pregnant, and Durotan added that the child would be named Go'el.\nDeath.\nIn the year 1, Draka gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt;, child of Durotan, shortly before joining her chieftain on his secret meeting in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; with their old comrade Orgrim Doomhammer. There Durotan explained what he knew about &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic bargain. Orgrim decided it was time to stop the evil warlock. He urged Durotan and Draka to take shelter in the north until he sent word to them. Orgrim commanded his guards to accompany the Frostwolves on their journey home and keep them safe. That would be a mistake that Orgrim would regret to his dying day. His guards were not loyal to him, but to the Shadow Council.\nThe guards had heard every word between Orgrim and his visitors. They decided they didn't need Gul'dan's permission to eliminate the Frostwolves - clearly, he would want Durotan, Draka, and their child dead. After traveling north for several days, the guards fell upon Durotan and Draka. The Frostwolves fought bitterly against their attackers, killing one of them. But the remaining guards struck down Durotan and Draka, and Go'el was left to die in the frigid cold.\nShadowlands.\nIn the House of Eyes.\nFollowing her death, Draka's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the plane of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where she became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. As a warrior, Draka initially found the house's ways of subterfuge and stealth to be a strange fit for her. However, under the training of &lt;a href=\"Akarek\"&gt;Margrave Akarek&lt;/a&gt;, she eventually grew comfortable with her new role and gained the skills of a master spy in addition to those of a warrior. Her training included traveling to worlds outside the Shadowlands; at one point, she and Akarek traveled to a world controlled by &lt;a href=\"Azgoth\"&gt;Azgoth&lt;/a&gt;, a lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and stole a set of maps from his stronghold. Draka eventually became one of the Eyes' two baronesses. The other baroness was &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, but she and Draka did not get along.\nAfter the mysterious destruction of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;, Akarek suspected that Maldraxxus' purpose was in peril and sent Draka to deliver a vital message to &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. However, shortly after Draka set out from the Eyes' &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nurakkir\"&gt;Nurakkir&lt;/a&gt; on her &lt;a href=\"darkhound\"&gt;darkhound&lt;/a&gt;, it exploded behind her, taking Akarek with it. Draka found herself surrounded by traitorous necrolords but managed to fight her way through them and reach the House of the Chosen, where she delivered her lord's final message to Margrave Krexus. The message stated \"I offer the key to saving Maldraxxus\". Draka was at first confused by this, telling Krexus that Akarek hadn't given her a key, but Krexus realized that Draka herself\u2014being an unyielding warrior and master spy\u2014was \"a key to many things\". That day, Draka joined the House of the Chosen as its baroness to continue protecting Maldraxxus. She took the place of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who had been lost to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlade of the Primus.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Maldraxxus' &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt;, they found themselves in the middle of a confrontation between Krexus and the margraves &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, who had betrayed the purpose of Maldraxxus by sending their forces to invade &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Draka rescued the Maw Walker from the battle and began transporting them to safety on her &lt;a href=\"Draka%27s%20Flayedwing\"&gt;flayedwing mount&lt;/a&gt;, but the group was shot of the sky and crashed in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Trench\"&gt;Iron Trench&lt;/a&gt;. After taking the opportunity to recruit nearby scavengers to the Chosen and dispatch local threats in the form of &lt;a href=\"deathwalker\"&gt;deathwalker&lt;/a&gt;s, Draka and the Maw Walker reached the House of the Chosen and reported to Margrave Krexus. The baroness and margrave left to discuss strategy in &lt;a href=\"Vortrexxis\"&gt;Vortrexxis&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walker was sent to Draka's fellow baron &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;. Krexus sensed great potential in the Maw Walker and soon commanded them to take on the trial of reaching the standing stone at the center of the Chosen's citadel, which resulted in the hero uncovering an &lt;a href=\"%3AUnfinished%20Blade\"&gt;unfinished blade&lt;/a&gt; and a message from Maldraxxus' missing ruler, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that this had a deeper meaning, Draka sent the Maw Walker to &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;, who helped them forge the object into a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;finished runeblade&lt;/a&gt;. Krexus concluded that the runes covering the blade were the same as the runes on the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; and sent Draka, Vyraz, and the Maw Walker to investigate. The blade proved to be a key to the Seat, but Vyraz insisted that unlocking the fortress would do the Chosen no good if they lost the war against the other two houses.\nDraka admitted that her fellow baron was right and sent the Maw Walker to recruit the aid of her old rival Vashj, search for survivors at the destroyed House of Plagues, and help Vyraz defend the Chosen forces at the &lt;a href=\"Spearhead%20%28Maldraxxus%29\"&gt;Spearhead&lt;/a&gt; from the House of Constructs. These efforts resulted in three more runes being awakened on the Blade of the Primus, meaning there was only one left before the Chosen could enter the Seat. Draka and the Maw Walker returned to the House of the Chosen to inform Krexus of their progress, but when they arrived, they found that the citadel had been attacked by Constructs and that Krexus had been killed. Draka insisted that the Chosen now had to open the Seat if they were to have any hope of victory, but Vyraz claimed that the Seat was a fool's errand and that the Chosen instead had to gather their mightiest forces, including the missing baron &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker traveled into the Maw and managed to rescue Alexandros, but when the two met with Draka in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, Mograine revealed that Vyraz was a traitor and that it must have been he who killed Krexus. Draka sent Alexandros and the Maw Walker to confront Vyraz at the House of the Chosen while she returned to the Seat to warn their allies, but the Seat soon came under siege from Vyraz's forces and Draka turned back to bring Alexandros and the Maw Walker with her to defend the fortress. The Maw Walker subsequently used the Blade of the Primus to open the way into the Seat, unleashing the Primus' power and forcing Vyraz's forces to retreat. Inside, the hero and their allies discovered a dire warning from the Primus. Draka asked the Maw Walker to return to Oribos and deliver the warning to the other &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Before parting ways, she told the hero that it would be an honor to fight with them again.\nArt of War.\nDraka and her forces remained entrenched at the Seat of the Primus even as the combined forces of the Constructs, Chosen, and Rituals moved against them. The baroness welcomed Maw Walkers who had chosen to side with the necrolords into the Seat and guided them into receiving the power of the Primus. In addition, she welcomed the allegiance of &lt;a href=\"Emeni\"&gt;Emeni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rathan\"&gt;Rathan&lt;/a&gt;, and other Construct defectors who chose to join the Seat. The baroness later tasked the Maw Walkers with driving back the forces besieging the Seat with help from &lt;a href=\"Ragewing\"&gt;Ragewing&lt;/a&gt;, Bonesmith Heirmir, and Plague Deviser Marileth. This was no long-term solution, since Draka's forces couldn't continue keeping their enemies at bay using only air strikes, but Vashj devised a plan to steal a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to permanently bolster their defenses. Draka asked the Maw Walkers to assist Vashj with this plan, since the other baroness was more agreeable toward the outsiders than she was toward Draka. With assistance from surviving members of the House of Eyes and defectors from the other houses, Vashj's plan resulted in the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;. Aboard the necropolis, the Maw Walkers discovered the &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20Fleshcrafting\"&gt;:Bindings of Fleshcrafting&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the armor pieces that once belonged to the Primus\u2014and brought them to Draka. She declared that they should be returned to their rightful place\u2014the statue of the Primus\u2014and that if any more pieces were found, the necrolords would claim them for their covenant.\nAfter the Maw Walkers and Alexandros helped repel another Construct attack on Bastion, Draka met with &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; Paragon of Courage\u2014to forge an alliance against their common enemy: Margrave Gharmal. Together, kyrian and necrolord forces assaulted the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; with the Zerekriss, with Maw Walkers assisting the two covenants on the ground while Draka remained aboard the necropolis. After gaining control of the stronghold, the Maw Walkers, Alexandros, and Xandria engaged in combat with Gharmal in order to buy enough time for Draka to focus the Zerekriss' weaponry. During the battle, Gharmal told Draka to face them before mockingly asking if she would beg to join the Constructs the way she had joined the Chosen. The battle ended with Draka using the Zerekriss to fire a single massive bolt of energy at the margrave, killing them. The baroness subsequently investigated Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"Gharmal%27s%20Tower\"&gt;private tower&lt;/a&gt; for evidence of treachery and made an unsettling discovery: canisters of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, not plundered but given from an ally. The baroness returned to the Seat to prepare for a journey to Revendreth and asked Alexandros and the Maw Walkers to search the rest of the tower for anything of value, resulting in the recovery of another one of the Primus' armor pieces, the &lt;a href=\"%3AMantle%20of%20Eternal%20Victory\"&gt;:Mantle of Eternal Victory&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after, Draka received a missive from &lt;a href=\"the%20Accuser\"&gt;the Accuser&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to discuss Gharmal's anima reserves and revealed the presence of Maldraxxi conspirators in Revendreth. Draka and the Maw Walkers immediately traveled to the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; realm and accompanied the Accuser to the House of Rituals encampment of &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20End\"&gt;Death's End&lt;/a&gt;. The Accuser explained that the Ritualists seemed to be siphoning &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;' anima stockpiles, and also revealed that she would force one of the souls in her care\u2014&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to accompany the necrolords on their mission as a way of humbling him. Draka, the Maw Walkers, and a reluctant Kael'thas worked together to destroy the Ritualist operation before confronting the camp's overseer, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ouix%27Ara\"&gt;Lady Ouix'Ara&lt;/a&gt;. Before killing her, Kael'thas got Ouix'Ara to reveal the name of her master, the one responsible for the unrest in Maldraxxus: &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The group subsequently discovered that Ouix'Ara had been drawing on the power of yet another armor piece of the Primus, the &lt;a href=\"%3APauldrons%20of%20Imperium\"&gt;:Pauldrons of Imperium&lt;/a&gt;. When the Maw Walkers picked up the pauldrons, an &lt;a href=\"image%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;image of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; briefly appeared to taunt the group into facing him in the House of Rituals. Kael'thas\u2014who had &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;personal grievances&lt;/a&gt; with Kel'Thuzad\u2014tried to convince Draka to escort him to Maldraxxus immediately, but she retorted that they had to learn more about the threat first and that once the necrolords' forces were ready, they would call on Revendreth to join the fight. The baroness and the Maw Walkers subsequently returned to the Seat of the Primus with the pauldrons.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; later recruited Draka to counter the growing threat posed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Tithelord\"&gt;the Tithelord&lt;/a&gt;, the venthyr responsible for providing Ouix'Ara with anima. After a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, Renathal, Draka, and the baroness' trusty &lt;a href=\"helhound\"&gt;helhound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathfang\"&gt;Deathfang&lt;/a&gt; met up with venthyr Maw Walkers at &lt;a href=\"Stonevigil%20Overlook\"&gt;Stonevigil Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, where they set about freeing the Tithelord's oppressed subjects. Draka tasked the Maw Walkers with draining anima from the Tithelord's &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; to return it to the town's well and helped them kill the head stoneborn, &lt;a href=\"Third%20Talon%20Vartox\"&gt;Third Talon Vartox&lt;/a&gt;. Upon spotting a carriage running off with the last of the anima, Draka and the Maw Walkers mounted Deathfang, chased after it, and killed its driver, &lt;a href=\"Provisioner%20Kraus\"&gt;Provisioner Kraus&lt;/a&gt;. Renathal's forces continued to the Tithelord's base, the &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Caretaker's Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where Draka led the Sinfall forces in battle while Renathal and the Maw Walkers pursued their enemy. Although they killed the Tithelord, Kel'Thuzad got away with the immensely powerful &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;:Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. The venthyr began preparing for an attack on Kel'Thuzad while Draka and Deathfang returned to the Seat.\nDraka was eventually approached by &lt;a href=\"Balmedar\"&gt;Balmedar&lt;/a&gt;, a lich who offered to help the necrolords infiltrate the House of Rituals. Draka disapproved of the plan and told Maw Walkers not to trust the lich, but conceded that his offer might be the only way to uncover the Ritualists' schemes. Balmedar and the heroes partially foiled Kel'Thuzad's plans but subsequently returned to Draka with the news that Kel'Thuzad had overthrown &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; to take full control of the House of Rituals. After mustering the covenant's forces, Draka\u2014accompanied by Balmedar, Vashj, Alexandros, Emeni, and the Maw Walkers\u2014led the necrolords in marching in on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Ritualist stronghold&lt;/a&gt; to remove Kel'Thuzad's influence. The heroes and Emeni's abominations destroyed the barricades blocking a side entrance to the house's southern portion, allowing the attackers to push into the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt; and confront Kel'Thuzad's servant, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Baroness Ninadar&lt;/a&gt;. After empowering herself with anima, Ninadar began battling Draka, Alexandros, and the Maw Walkers until they nearly defeated her, at which point she started draining even more anima and inadvertently destroyed herself in the process. She left behind the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Staff of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, which she had seized from Sin'dane during Kel'Thuzad's coup. Balmedar picked up the staff while the attackers continued to the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Arcanum\"&gt;Prime Arcanum&lt;/a&gt;, where they were unable to stop Kel'Thuzad from summoning a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Infernous\"&gt;Maw Infernous&lt;/a&gt;. However, the necrolords received sudden reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the form of Kael'thas and &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to defeat the creature. The attackers pressed on to the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt;, where Kel'Thuzad was waiting with the captive Sin'dane. Draka told Kel'Thuzad to surrender or be destroyed, but he merely replied that the plan of his master\u2014&lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was unfolding as intended and that they would not live to see its completion. Draka and most of the other attackers spread out to hold off Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;skeletal minions&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walkers focused on weakening the traitorous baron himself, allowing Balmedar to free Sin'dane by returning the Staff of the Primus to her. However, before the attackers could detain the defeated Kel'Thuzad, he escaped to the Jailer's side with the help of a group of &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterward, Draka asked Sin'dane to join the necrolords' cause, since they would need her strength against the Jailer. The margrave agreed and gave Draka the Staff of the Primus\u2014the final item missing from the Eternal One's regalia\u2014as proof of her good faith. Draka commended the Maw Walkers and told them that their deeds would be remembered for all eternity. The necrolords then returned to the Seat and returned the staff to its rightful place, completing the Primus' statue.\nChains of Domination.\nAfter the Jailer launched an attack on the kyrian's Archon &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia&lt;/a&gt; to claim her &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;covenant sigil&lt;/a&gt;, Draka attended a meeting with the other covenant leaders in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; as the representative for Maldraxxus. She declared that the necrolords would drive back the Jailer's minions from their next target, &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, and it was decided that all four covenants would work together to defend the realm. The Jailer nonetheless managed to claim the sigil, and both Draka and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; suggested directly taking the fight to the enemy in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. The baroness was among the covenant forces whom Maw Walkers rallied to charge into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; after they established a portal link between it and Oribos.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the Maw, Maw Walkers discovered that &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; was working together with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; under the Jailer. Upon hearing of this, Draka declared that she would kill the traitorous baron and avenge Krexus. The heroes later rescued the Primus himself, who had been kept prisoner in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; after his disappearance from Maldraxxus, and he sent Draka and a Maw Walker to deal with the Jailer's two underlings. The orc hero &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; approached the baroness and hero in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; and asked to accompany them on the mission. The moment she saw him, Draka noticed that Thrall had &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes and thereby recognized him for who he was: her long-lost son, Go'el. She chose not to tell him this at first, instead focusing on the mission and dismissing his attempts to tell her about their kinship. The trio fought their way through the Mawsworn in Desmotaeron, summoned a series of death gates the covenants could use, and then summoned the Zerekriss to begin the four covenants' assault. With lower Desmotaeron engulfed in chaos, Draka, Thrall, and the hero slipped through the gates to the upper hold of &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; (where they took the time to rescue some &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; who regretted their pact with the Jailer) and confronted Vyraz and Helya themselves. Helya empowered Vyraz with her magic, but the Primus teleported in and gave Draka his own blessing to match. This allowed the baroness and her allies to kill Vyraz\u2014finally avenging Krexus' murder and ending the last of Maldraxxus' traitorous house leaders\u2014after which the Primus banished Helya from the Maw.\nAs they returned to Keeper's Respite, Draka called Thrall by his birth name, thereby revealing that she knew who he was. She asked him who he had grown to be since her death. He began telling her about his time as &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, but she cut off him and pointed out that that was who he \"had\" been, not who he currently was. Thrall replied that he was uncertain about his future, and Draka gave him a lesson: to remember his past, but also to take pride in who he was. She expressed joy over seeing who he had become, assured him that he had much farther to go, and took him aside to hear more about his life. The Primus subsequently summoned Draka and other necrolords back to the Seat to reward her for her loyalty to the covenant. He declared that she had proven herself time and again and named her the new Margrave of the Chosen. Draka stated that this honor was unexpected, but that it was only another challenge to overcome and that she would uphold Krexus and Akarek's legacies. Thrall, who had accompanied his mother to the Seat, commented that the position and the challenges that came it with it were not unlike those of a warchief. Draka replied that she'd have to rely on her allies to find victory, and added \"Perhaps a similar road lies ahead of you, my son\".\nWith Maldraxxus reunited, the Primus reforged the lost necrolord sigil and entrusted it to Draka. After the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Draka and other covenant representatives were summoned to Keeper's Respite and delivered their sigils to the Primus so that he could use them to pursue the Jailer to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The margrave subsequently stayed at the respite to talk with Thrall, who confided that he felt responsible for the actions of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, whom he had tutored, named warchief, and eventually been forced to kill. In response, Draka shared something that Durotan used to say: \"a wolf decides whether to come when called or to turn on its master\". She added that Garrosh had chosen his own path and that it had now ended, whereas Thrall's continued moving forward. Thrall agreed on this and thanked his mother for the advice.\nDragonflight.\nAt some point after the events in the Shadowlands, Draka was reunited with the soul of her beloved Durotan. During Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Draka and Durotan briefly manifested from the Shadowlands alongside the spirits of other famous orcs in response to an offering prepared by an orc adventurer and Draka's grandson, &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;. Before disappearing, Draka told the adventurer that she was glad that Go'el had their aid, and that the return of the Kosh'harg signaled the beginning of a brighter future for the orcs.\nAlternate timelines.\nWhen Thrall fled into a passage in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; to escape &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;an armored assassin&lt;/a&gt;, he found himself in the time and place of his parents' murder of an alternate history. Thrall pretended to be one of the bodyguards assigned to protect Durotan and Draka by Doomhammer as they returned home. Draka noticed that he had blue eyes and that he seemed very interested in the infant Thrall she was carrying. When the other bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Grukar\"&gt;Grukar&lt;/a&gt; summoned the assassins that attacked Draka and Durotan, Thrall could only watch, as saving them would alter the timeline.\nAnother appears in the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Draka%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nAs Durotan is buried at the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20of%20Durotan\"&gt;Rock of Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, Draka may also be buried there or at least near it.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

As the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;-allied encroached upon Frostwolf territory, Draka, Durotan, and met with agents of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt; vouching for the newcomers, both sides agreed to provide mutual aid in their efforts against the Iron Horde. When Durotan led his warriors into the &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Citadel\"&gt;Bladespire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to claim it, she remained in &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt;. While the clan fought against the ogres, the Thunderlord clan attacked the home of the Frostwolves only to be met with the resistance of Draka and the adventurers. Later on, she asked Thrall about his mate and learned that she remained home with their newborn kids what surprised her as she maintains that a family needs to be together in times of war. She also watched the dispute between his mate and his brother. Eventually, Draka, alongside &lt;a href=\"Lokra\"&gt;Lokra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karg%20Bloodfury\"&gt;Karg Bloodfury&lt;/a&gt; and Thrall went to &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gar\"&gt;Grom'gar&lt;/a&gt;, home of the Thunderlords and attacked it. Draka joined her clan and their allies in &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Thunder%20Pass%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Battle of Thunder Pass (quest)&lt;/a&gt; where she killed and suggested Drek'Thar to collapse the cliff and then watched Ga'nar's sacrifice.\nAfter mourning the loss of Ga'nar, Draka joined Durotan and the Horde commander in their journey to &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; to recruit aid against the Iron Horde. Their aid came in the unexpectedly compliant &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; and their shaman &lt;a href=\"Kaz%20the%20Shrieker\"&gt;Kaz the Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;. During the Lumber Mill campaign, Draka and Kaz journeyed with the commander through the wilds, finding the captured orcs. At first, she maintained that Kaz was just using them but agreed to work and watch her eventually changing her attitude. They eventually defeated the great &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iyu\"&gt;Iyu&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Iyu%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Iyu (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; while Durotan stayed behind and guarded the outpost. After recovering Primals and Breakers's artifacts, she lent her strength to the adventurer in &lt;a href=\"Strike%20While%20the%20Iron%20is%20Hot\"&gt;Strike While the Iron is Hot&lt;/a&gt;, killing and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gar\"&gt;Commander Gar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Gorgrond campaign, Draka and Durotan are later found at &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Vol'jin's Pride&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; where her orders led to diminishing the numbers of enemy orcs and machinery. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Shattrath\"&gt;The Battle for Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, she aids in the initial charge, but retreats to tend to the wounded while Durotan, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the commander pursue .

She later helps during &lt;a href=\"And%20Justice%20for%20Thrall\"&gt;And Justice for Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in the siege of &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;. Draka and her mate witness the death of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, and she acknowledges that the unity of the orcs can be great but the Frostwolves should be the voice to guide them.\nBack in Frostfire, Draka urged on Drek'Thar to reconnect with the elements. The two entered &lt;a href=\"Farseer%27s%20Rock\"&gt;Farseer's Rock&lt;/a&gt; where she defended him from the attacking &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt;s while he was meditating. With the help of the adventurers, the Frostwolves journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Magnarok\"&gt;Magnarok&lt;/a&gt; where the elements have been imprisoned. She eventually assisted in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kron\"&gt;Kron&lt;/a&gt; who held the fury &lt;a href=\"Exurotus\"&gt;Exurotus&lt;/a&gt; under his sway.

The two arrived in &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27Kur\"&gt;Zeth'Kur&lt;/a&gt; and began scouting the orcs in the Dark Portal area. After the got their intel, they were warned by two shadow hunter trolls about the orcish machinery. After the cannons were dealt with, they found a perfect location for &lt;a href=\"Vol%27mar\"&gt;Vol'mar&lt;/a&gt;. Once it was built, she sent the adventurer to Durotan in the west. She remained and watched over the situation and events in Tanaan.\nShe is ultimately seen with her mate in the as the commander received an elemental blessing.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFor years after Archimonde's death, the draenei and orcs lived in peace until naaru arrived on Draenor and the draenei became fanatical.

Decades after the battle against Archimonde, Draka commanded a garrison in Nagrand against the Lightbound.

When the Frostwolves were exterminated by the other orcs, Draka fled, with the aid of , taking Go'el with her. She was killed defending her child, shortly after sending him to safety on a river, afloat in a basket.\nHistory.\nDying Draenor.\nAs a youth Draka would be exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; due to her weakness, however on the day of her exile that fact she marched forward without looking back would be admired that elders of the clan would remark \"In this, at least, she is a Frostwolf.\" Draka would later return to the clan during Midsummer after proving herself strong and the Frostwolves would welcome her among them, though Draka would discover that in her exile her parents had passed away. \nAs Draka began teaching what she learned to the clan, she and Durotan would become close and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20%28wolf%29\"&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt;, would choose her as his companion. However unknown to Durotan the dormant volcano near their home was close to erupting and in their weakened state Drek'Thar and the other shaman were unable to hear the spirit's warning. As such the clan would be caught off guard but Durotan would be able to successfully save the bulk of the clan. Sometime later he and Draka would become mates, with Draka later becoming pregnant with his child.\nIn this time of uncertainly Gul'dan would try to once again to gain Frostwolf support for the Horde and Durotan would be greatly tempted to join. However he ultimately rejected convinced that doing so would make them the warlock's slaves. A surprised &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; would use the Draenei tongue to warn them that Gul'dan was dangerous, and Draka (who had learned the tongue in her exile) informed her that they knew, though when Gul'dan demanded to know what was said Drake informed that warlock that Garona had called them fools. Accepting this Gul'dan then called Durotan stubborn but remarked that should he see wisdom and change his mind all he had to was head to Tanaan Jungle. While the likes of Doomhammer and Drek'thar would praise Durotan, other Frostwolves were in disagreement with rejecting the Horde and Durotan would be challenged by &lt;a href=\"Nokrar\"&gt;Nokrar&lt;/a&gt; and despite winning Durotan would refuse to kill arguing that too many Frostwolf lives had been lost. Nokrar, still convinced to join the Horde, would take his family and leave and Durotan would give chase to prevent the loss of Frostwolf lives. While Nokrar's family would be recovered Nokrar would be killed and eaten by the Redwalkers, a fact that would horrify Durotan and Draka.\nSometime later the spirits would be able to get a message of sorts to Drek'Thar and Durotan decided to lead a party north to aid the spirits, while leaving Draka and Doomhammer in charge. With Durotan and his war party gone the opportunistic Red Walkers decided to strike out against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply. Unknown to the Redwalkers the weakened spirits still had enough energy to give one final gift to the Frostwolves and Durotan and his party rushed south and the Frostwolves under the command of Draka and Orgrim Doomhammer fought to kill their enemies. During this battle Doomhammer would become locked in combat against the Red Walker chieftain who successfully knocked out after hearing Durotan's orders to keep him alive. Draka would later hear, along with Durotan, how the noble Red Walker clan had fallen so low and then witness Durotan swift kill of its chieftain, thus putting end to the Red Walkers. \nIn light of the war with Redwalkers and hardships had taken a toll on the Frostwolves and Draka would support Durotan's order to join the Horde.\nWarcraft.\nAfter entering the Great Gate Draka would give birth to a still birth &lt;a href=\"Go%27el%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; but Gul'dan's magic would quickly give him life. Durotan and Draka would dote upon their child and become worried about his future. \nWhile Durotan and the Frostwolves joined the Horde war effort Draka would remain within the Horde encampment to look after Go'el. As Gul'dan's fel magic starting destroying the land around them Durotan, wishing the best for his son and his people, would decide to work with the humans to stop Gul'dan. However Doomhammer unable to see how working with the humans would secure victory would betray the Frostwolves and cause the parlay to become an ambush. The Frostwolves would be brought to the Horde encampment and Durotan would be imprisoned. At Gul'dan's order the Frostwolves would be attacked and Draka would attempt to kill Doomhammer, only for guilt ridden orc to implore her to think of her child and run. Though clearly furious with Doomhammer, she would take his advice and run.\nAfter safely sending her son upon the river Draka would be attacked and though killing her attacker, would soon die from a mortal wound.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Though not as strong as their parents, they are still dangerous. Drakes can be around the size of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, roughly six feet long but with a wingspan wider than that. They are distinguishable from fully grown &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s by their smaller heads and by having only a few spikes along their back. Drakes are almost always flying while moving, while &lt;a href=\"Nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether drakes&lt;/a&gt; tend to walk. Fully grown dragons typically walk while moving. Drakes can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but are especially prevalent in some areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, and in many &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s.
