Exceptionally skilled in magic, their mastery of the arcane arts were renowned throughout the scattered worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Led by a triumvirate of wise and powerful leaders \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 they built a vast civilization of wondrous cities and a peaceful way of life on their homeworld.\nHowever, 13,000 years ago, the Dark &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; shattered the tranquility of Argus by offering the eredar immeasurable knowledge and power. The eredar were a knowledge-seeking race, as such Kil'jaeden and Archimonde accepted Sargeras' offer. The titan bathed the eredar in his fel might, and turned them into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Velen and his followers, however, managed to flee Argus with the help of the divine &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, who would rename them &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Exiled Ones\".\nThe draenei refer to their corrupted brethren as man'ari (pronounced man-ah-ree), or \"unnatural beings\". They have stopped referring to themselves as \"eredar\" because of the negative connotation it now has, following the vast majority of eredar being turned into demons, although it is still the name of their race. The man'ari eredar now act as some of the most powerful weapons in the Burning Legion's arsenal. Skilled sorcerers in both &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; magics, they are often found in command of contingents of demon forces. When facing man'ari eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part. Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.\nHistory.\nNearly 25,000 years ago, on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the noble and enigmatic eredar race arose. They are one of the oldest known races in the universe. They were extremely intelligent and had a natural affinity for magic in all of its forms. Using their gifts, they developed a vast and wondrous society in which art, science, magic, and technology were all as one. Their society was powered by &lt;a href=\"argunite\"&gt;argunite&lt;/a&gt;. They were aided in this development by an ancient artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;, a triangular crystal whose origin was a mystery to the eredar, though it had been a gift bestowed upon them by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in ancient times. The eredar hunted great horned beasts for sport.\nThe eredar were apparently ruled by political regimes under the rule of multiple capable persons. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Duumvirate\"&gt;Second Duumvirate&lt;/a&gt; consisted of Kil'jaeden and Velen. Velen was an exceptional master of holy magic, who once used &lt;a href=\"T%27uure\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;, a holy artifact of the naaru, to cure a curse that robbed the eredar of their mental capabilities. An order of eredar mages called the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt; first delved into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and summoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Presenting this before the duumvirate, hoping to gain the acceptance of them. When denied, he secretly summoned even more demons to usurp the duumvirate and become the sole dictator of Argus. He was betrayed by his apprentice Archimonde, who decapitated Thal'kiel and his order was hunted and their scriptures burned.\n13,000 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, in order to create a great Legion, planned to bolster his ranks by creating demons. He was attracted by the eredar's magical affinity, and he contacted them under the guise of a benevolent being, promising their three leaders, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, vast powers and that he would use his power to transform their race into an even greater one so they may spread his universal union. A troubling vision soon came to Velen, who saw the eredar transformed into unspeakable demons. But despite Velen's misgivings, Archimonde and Kil'jaeden agreed to join Sargeras' &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The eredar were the first sentient race to pledge their allegiance to Sargeras. Knowing that other sentient beings would inevitably join the Legion, the eredar declared that their primary language, &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;, would be the Legion's common language. &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; became a demon world, and the stronghold of the Burning Legion.\nWith his fellow eredar already becoming corrupted by demonic power, Velen, along with those who would follow him, split from the bulk of eredar society \u2014 who were, by now, a \"twisted demonic reflection of\" the original eredar \u2014 on Argus with the help of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"exiled ones\" in &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;. The man'ari (so called because of their transformation into demons) continued to call themselves \"eredar\" under Kil'jaeden and were infuriated with what they perceived as a betrayal. They hunted Velen and the draenei across dozens of worlds for thousands of years as the draenei used a massive naaru dimensional ship called \"&lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;the Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" to escape. Every time it seemed that the draenei had found a new home, the Burning Legion would fall upon them. One such world was &lt;a href=\"Fanlin%27Deskor\"&gt;Fanlin'Deskor&lt;/a&gt;, whose surface was ripped apart by the Legion, after which nothing was left behind. The indigenous races of many worlds were oftentimes mutated by the eredar's malevolent &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; powers and turned into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, marking such twisted demonic beings as man'ari themselves.\nBoth factions continued to use the Eredun language, though specific dialects have evolved: the &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;demonic Eredun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; languages.\nThe draenei traveled through most of the cosmos and eventually discovered another, safer world to settle down upon. They named this world &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, or \"exiles' refuge\". At first, there was peace with the native &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s living there, and they struck up trade and diplomacy with the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic race. But soon the draenei's existence there was discovered by Kil'jaeden via his agent, &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;. This time, however, Kil'jaeden decided that instead of launching a full invasion of the planet, from which the draenei had managed to escape in the past, he would use the native orcs to do his bidding for him; thus Velen and the draenei wouldn't realize the Legion was involved and flee until it was too late to do so. Kil'jaeden and the eredar then began to corrupt the orcs, turning them into a bloodthirsty, war-like race by granting them access to warlock magics. The orcs formed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently hunted down the draenei, almost wiping out the entire race; indeed, they believed they had, but Velen and a few others had managed to escape the onslaught. The draenei used the dimensional ship known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", a vessel of the great naaru fortress &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; to escape to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to ally with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo this day, the draenei remain loyal members of the Alliance, and the man'ari eredar, now the most stalwart enemy of the draenei, comprise the commanders and strategists of the Burning Legion. The eredar have rewritten Argus history books to paint Velen as a traitor.\nDemonic eredar.\nDemonic eredar, described with the term man'ari (pronounced man-ah-ree) eredar (or simply by the broad category 'man'ari'), are eredar that have been turned into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. 13,000 years ago, the Dark &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; bathed the eredar in his fel might, and turned them into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe man'ari eredar now act as some of the most powerful weapons in the Burning Legion's arsenal. Skilled sorcerers in both &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; magics, they are often found in command of contingents of demon forces. When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part. Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.\nName.\n\"Man'ari\" is an &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; term that translates to \"unnatural beings\". It was originally described as a word with no specific translation, use to describe something considered \"horrifically wrong, something twisted and unnatural and defiled\". \"Man'ari\" is most often used by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; to describe the eredar followers of Kil'jaeden and Archimonde, as the draenei believe that these demonic minions are no longer recognizable as true eredar, but it could reasonably be used to describe any species that Sargeras has twisted from their natural state to a demonic one (such as satyr).\nDemonic eredar also appear to refer to themselves as \"man'ari\", and usage of it as a species name to refer to the eredar of the Burning Legion can be considered grammatically correct as Kil'jaeden appropriated the term for his own use, though the man'ari mostly refer to themselves simply as \"eredar\". The draenei no longer call themselves eredar, likely because the name is mostly associated with the demonic man'ari eredar.\nBiology.\nThe eredar are bipedal ungulates, physically similar to their original shape, with a few minor differences (the original eredar shape has been preserved in the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;). The most obvious difference is their skin color; though several man'ari eredar, such as &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sacrolash\"&gt;Lady Sacrolash&lt;/a&gt;, retain a blue-gray skin color, most have blood-red skin. Their eyes glow fel-green; much like draenei, the glow in an eredar's eyes will fade away when they die. Many male man'ari lack cranial hair, and man'ari females have longer tails than their draenei counterparts. Eredar hands are clawed.\nMost significantly, many man'ari eredar tend to be larger than draenei, though few could match Archimonde's preferred height (he has been shown of being capable to change his size at will).\n&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; shows a greater amount of physical variation, having sprouted both horns and wings in his most recent incarnation in addition to the more regular man'ari mutations; though these additional appendages could be a result of his shape-altering abilities rather than the influence of fel magic.\nAny draenei that allows themselves to become corrupted can become a man'ari eredar, transforming from humanoid to demon. Two recent examples are &lt;a href=\"Levixus\"&gt;Levixus&lt;/a&gt;, an eredar who was born as a draenei, and &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt;, who became a man'ari and took the name &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt; when he swore himself to the Burning Legion.\nThe old eredar believed in the value of phrenology - the measurement of skull in order to divine mental aptitude. Believing that an eredar's mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual's skull, it was theorized that skulls of proficient spellcasters could channel magical energies even after death.\nCulture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; was the most sacred artifact of the eredar, accessible only by their three leaders - &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe eredar used to practice the ancient sport of &lt;a href=\"Jed%27hin\"&gt;Jed'hin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; contained the vast sum of knowledge cultivated by the ancient eredar.\nThe eredar had the habit of using tail jewelry, such as &lt;a href=\"Delicate%20Tail%20Band\"&gt;Delicate Tail Band&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Small%20Tail%20Ring\"&gt;Small Tail Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The more decorative the cuff, the more prestigious the individual.\nThe eredar do not seem to use surnames.\nOther accounts.\nOriginal lore.\nEredar were supreme sorcerers at the dawn of the universe. Some believe that they devoured their own world by using radical warlock magics. They consumed all life around them and set out to find more places of mystical power.\nOver the eons, Sargeras encountered two powerful demonic races, both of which were bent on gaining power and dominance over the physical universe. One of them was the eredar, an insidious race of devilish sorcerers, who used their warlock magics to enslave a number of worlds that they had invaded. The indigenous races of those worlds were mutated by the eredar's chaotic powers and turned into demons themselves. Though Sargeras' nearly limitless powers were more than enough to defeat the vile eredar, he was greatly troubled by the creatures' corruption and all-consuming evil. Unable to fathom such depravity and spite, the great &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; began to slip into a brooding depression. Despite his growing unease, Sargeras rid the universe of the warlocks by trapping them within a corner of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill, Sargeras went mad and decided to undo the Titan's works throughout the universe, he set out to form an unstoppable army that would set the physical universe to the flame. In his fury and madness, Sargeras shattered the prisons of the eredar and the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; and set the vile demons free. The cunning demons, bowing before the dark Titan's vast rage and power, offered themselves to him and swore to serve him in whatever malicious way they could. The eredar were Sargeras's first recruits in the Burning Legion, serving as tactical advisors and intelligence officers.\nFrom the ranks of the powerful eredar, Sargeras chose two champions to lead his demonic army of destruction. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to seek out the darkest races in the universe and recruit them into Sargeras's ranks. The second champion, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;, was chosen to lead Sargeras's vast armies into battle against any who might resist the Titan's will.\nNew lore.\nThe idea that eredar were previously mortal before being corrupted has existed long before \"The Burning Crusade\"'s release. &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; stands by the lore described in &lt;a href=\"Eredar%23History\"&gt;the history section&lt;/a&gt;, who for better or worse are among the primary antagonists, more firmly in the backstory.\nIn the newer lore, Sargeras' first battles with demons may not have been with the eredar; it is possible he may have fought some other demonic race from the Twisting Nether before his battles with the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is confirmed in the WoW magazine which shows Sargeras also fought the &lt;a href=\"ered%27ruin\"&gt;ered'ruin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sayaad\"&gt;sayaad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nAll demons, including the eredar, were mortal once, but have been transformed into demons by corruption caused by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel energy&lt;/a&gt;. This change included a powerful command of arcane energy. It is said that Sargeras believed that the demons originally were not corrupt, and that it was the Titan's ordering of the universe that was ultimately responsible for the demons corruption. In this scenario, it would imply that the titans considered the various natural races that pre-existed on worlds they visited to be demons, but were actually corrupted by the titans themselves. Sargeras later came back and freed many of them, bent on using them to destroy the Titan's work.\nThe eredar consumed all life around them and set out to find more places of mystical power. Until now, only the titans have ever challenged them. Each of the leaders, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, built a hierarchy of demons, jealously protected from the will of the other. These groups strove for dominance of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and other worlds. But now, at long last, Archimonde is dead, killed by the forces of Azeroth. Individual eredar and a few hopeful heroes of the lesser races have decided that they are the best candidates to replace him. These prideful few have taken their first careful steps toward locating and eliminating the presumptuous competition that might seek to displace them.\nThese creatures are of impressive size, far larger than any &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, with a bulky muscular body and a long tail. Long pointed ears sweep back from its bestial face and horns sprout from its wide brow\nSociology.\nPre-eminence in eredar warlock society depends almost entirely upon magical power. Those who command the greatest selection of paramount spells \u2014 and thus, in theory, the greatest magical arsenal \u2014 rise to higher ranks. Those whose arcane abilities top out at such pitiful cantrips as wish and shape change are grunts and lackeys, scarcely worthy of notice. Because of the very nature of magic, rank, magical power, and overall intelligence go hand-in-claw.\nThis rule of rank is never deviated from; Archimonde's status among his brethren is backed up by his mastery of the most destructive forms of magic, and his adeptness of all others (recall his single-handed destruction of Dalaran). However, while Archimonde is violent and destructive, Kil'Jaeden is ruthlessly cunning, and coupled with his powerful magic, may even make him an even more dangerous demon than Archimonde."}

They are behind &lt;a href=\"Agamath\"&gt;Agamath, the First Gate&lt;/a&gt; and ahead of &lt;a href=\"Rohendor\"&gt;Rohendor, the Second Gate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Agamath\"&gt;Agamath, the First Gate&lt;/a&gt; of Sunwell Plateau was opened to the US and EU on 4/8/2008 after standard Tuesday/Wednesday maintenance. The opening of this gate made the Eredar Twins available to the community as a killable end game boss.\nPhase 1 of the fight involves fighting both Twins at once. When you kill one of the Twins, she will merge with her sister, who will gain some of her abilities, and phase 2 will begin. Killing Alythess before Sacrolash is the easier order. As of June 19, 2008, Bornakk confirmed that killing order would no longer matter, but before that date, killing Alythess second and Sacrolash first would give more loot. As of the arrival of patch 2.4.3, the Twins now always drops the version with the most loot.\nAbilities.\nGrand Warlock Alythess.\nEither Twin will go &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D26662\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; after 6 minutes.\nStrategy.\nAlythess.\nHave someone dispel, purge or Spellsteal Pyrogenics from Alythess whenever she casts it on herself. The tank must be constantly moving to avoid the fire patches Blaze leaves behind. Let your healers put HoTs on people affected by Flame Sear and Conflagration. The tank taking Alythess must be constantly healed, since Flame Touched does a lot of damage as it stacks.\nSacrolash.\nSacrolash must have at least two tanks when Confounding Blow is used, so that the other tank can regain the aggro that was lost by the current tank. Have everyone spread out so that they are not hit by Shadow Nova, although this can also be used to remove the Flame Touched debuff. Dark Strike isn't much of a problem, except for when the Sacrolash tank needs to switch sides due to the movement speed decrease.\nAt level 80.\nIdeal Raid Composition: 4 healers, 3 tanks (2 melee, 1 caster), 18 dps\nAt level 80, the high dps, hp and healing increases make this fight much easier than at 70, however, to ensure a smooth kill, some rules should still be followed, including:\n1) Dps should still concentrate on burning down Grand Warlock Alythess and then Lady Sacrolash.\n2) The 2 melee tanks should still be tanking Lady Sacrolash up the ramp (but never out of line of sight) and at distance from the other raid members so that Conflagration doesn't spread more than it needs to.\n3) Any of the melee tanks who are not human should still equip their PVP trinkets in case one is hit with Conflagration and the other with Confounding Blow (so that at least one tank is not disoriented and is able to continue tanking Lady Sacrolash).\n4) Considering the raid composition, it would be best to assign a high dps/tps caster (such as a warlock) to tank Grand Warlock Alythess. [NOTE: At TotC-gear levels, it is often not necessary to have a caster remote-tank this. The damage can be healed through as she is burned down.]\n5) Assign a mage or shaman to spellsteal/purge Pyrogenics from Grand Warlock Alythess if possible as it will make the healer's jobs easier.\n6) Depending on dps performance, Dark Touched / Flame Touched should not stack too high for it to be a serious concern anymore.\nLoot.\nKilling the twins will give you one of the nine tier 6 boot/belt/bracers tokens, one of the Sin'dorei PvP necks, and four of the items listed on the third table, along with four &lt;a href=\"Sunmote\"&gt;Sunmote&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nSpoken as:"}

Their chaos magics have burnt out whole worlds and annihilated countless species over the aeons. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; taught the orcs the secrets of warlock magics, but the orcs could never master the powers of entropy and destruction as well as the wicked eredar. Under &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s command, the warlocks serve as the Legion's tacticians and strategists.\nEredar warlocks.\nEredar creeps in \"Warcraft III\" were together known as \"Eredar Warlocks\".\nEredar warlock creeps.\nEredar Warlock mobs of \"Warcraft III\":\nIn the RPG.\nEredar were supreme sorcerers at the dawn of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;. Some believe that they devoured their own &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; by using radical warlock magics. They consumed all life around them and set out to find more places of mystical power. The eredar were Sargeras's first recruits in the Burning Legion, serving as tactical advisors and intelligence officers. Eredar warlocks are now counted as some of the greatest sorcerers in the universe.\nAn eredar warlock led a group of demons in the tunnels from the &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; leading to the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and were draining its waters. He planned to consume the water in a ritual in an attempt to gain enough power to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSociology.\nPreeminence in eredar warlock society depends almost entirely upon magical power. Those who command the greatest selection of paramount spells - and thus in theory the greatest magical arsenal - rise to higher ranks. Those whose arcane abilities top out at such pitiful cantrips as wish and shapechange are grunts and lackeys, scarcely worthy of notice.\nCombat.\nEredar warlocks are spellcasters first. They have been known to flick their fingers in an enemy's direction, causing flesh, bone, and even steel to flare with entropic fire. They avoid combat with even an innocuous foe until they can establish a collection of defensive and self-enhancement spells. Most maintain a mage armor or frost armor effect continuously. If the enemy seems weak and not worth the expenditure of spells, eredar warlocks wade into combat with their claws. If the enemy is strong, an eredar warlock creates an advantage of numbers, summoning monsters, enchanting his opponents, and using spells that divide his enemies."}

The written version of the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim%20%28language%29\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; vaguely resembles Eredun.

Draenei cannot understand \"Demonic\" (Eredun).\nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words look like \"Demonic\" (Eredun). It does not actually translate words. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true \"Demonic\" (Eredun). It is not certain if these words are true words in the Eredun language or not.\n\"Amanare\" represents two separate words in the Demonic language parser, as words #627 and #628.

Tyrande said she would accompany Eriadnar to Darnassus, but Eriadnar knelt and said something heartfelt to Tyrande in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, moving the high priestess and causing her to embrace the Sentinel. After meeting with the newly-arrived refugees, Tyrande declared that she would instead stay in Stormwind for the time being, and Eriadnar instead returned to Darnassus with &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nEriadnar and Delaryn reunited near the border between Ashenvale and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; after Delaryn's forces had fought the Horde's soldiers in the forest for days.

The primary quest giver was &lt;a href=\"Kravel%20Koalbeard\"&gt;Kravel Koalbeard&lt;/a&gt;, a dwarf who makes profit from the races of &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; and has many contacts in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis chain was rather long with arguable benefits for its length. Especially disappointing was the final quest, which seemed like it should have had a follow up but went nowhere. However, most of the quests were very simple and essentially gave free XP, so for players traveling to those areas anyway, this chain was an attractive option to level quickly. \nGnomish Deliveries.\n&lt;a href=\"Kravel%20Koalbeard\"&gt;Kravel Koalbeard&lt;/a&gt; is a shrewd and cunning dwarf who knows how to make a profit in any situation. Rivaling a goblin in his eye for opportunities to make money, Kravel has traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; to pursue fame and fortune - or at least fortune. Kravel uses his position as a neutral supplier to both the gnome and goblin teams to gain leverage and support against each. And he is always looking for seasoned adventurers to do his dirty work.\n&lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Car%20Parts%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Rocket Car Parts (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nKravel has hatched a scheme: to sell the gnomes and goblins their own parts back to them. He hires you to scour the flats for rocket car parts left behind by crashed vehicles. Since you were running errands around the flats anyway, you agree. The unscrupulous dwarf is delighted by your finds and rewards you accordingly.\n&lt;a href=\"Wharfmaster%20Dizzywig%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Wharfmaster Dizzywig (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter your success on your previous job, Kravel hires you again, this time to check up on a parts order from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. These parts will go to the gnomes, and Kravel needs to keep his clients happy. You agree, provided he pays you well, and head off to see &lt;a href=\"Wharfmaster%20Dizzywig\"&gt;Wharfmaster Dizzywig&lt;/a&gt; in the goblin settlement.\n&lt;a href=\"Parts%20for%20Kravel\"&gt;Parts for Kravel&lt;/a&gt;\nIt turns out Dizzywig has the parts on hand, and the transfer occurs without a hitch. Kravel pays you well, again, but you notice him removing something from the box. However, when asked about it, Kravel dismisses the item he removed as worthless - the gnomes surely won't notice.\n&lt;a href=\"Delivery%20to%20the%20Gnomes\"&gt;Delivery to the Gnomes&lt;/a&gt;\nKravel wants you to give the box to the gnomes personally. Figuring you can get a few extra silver pieces from them for your trouble, you agree, though you wonder secretly if he's pushing the blame for the missing bit he took onto you. But the gnomes seem ecstatic about the new parts, and indeed pay you ten extra silver for your trouble. All in all, the job went quite well.\nDigging up Dirt on the Goblins.\nThey say there's no rest for the wicked, and certainly Kravel seems to agree. It looks like he has another job for you.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Rumormonger\"&gt;The Rumormonger&lt;/a&gt;\nKravel has decided it's time to do something for the goblins. But that something doesn't appear to be a favor. Kravel is hiring you to go to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and meet one of his many contacts there, to find out about the secret past of the goblin racing pilot. Depending on the juiciness of the secret, the rewards could be staggering.\nWith some misgivings, you set out to the far off &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. There you meet &lt;a href=\"Krazek\"&gt;Krazek&lt;/a&gt;, Kravel's contact who knows who is who in the goblin society. But Krazek isn't talking... for free.\n&lt;a href=\"Dream%20Dust%20in%20the%20Swamp\"&gt;Dream Dust in the Swamp&lt;/a&gt;\nIt turns out Krazek is partial to Dream Dust, a drug of sorts found on green dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. If you want the dirt on the goblin pilot, you need to get him some of that dust. Wondering if this is really even worth your time, you nevertheless travel to the swamp and hunt the baby dragons there. When you return, Krazek has found the information Kravel wanted.\n&lt;a href=\"Rumors%20for%20Kravel\"&gt;Rumors for Kravel&lt;/a&gt;\nNow you need only return the letter to Kravel for your reward. Feeling a little like a snoop but wanting to know just what kind of trouble you were getting the goblin pilot into, you take a peek at the contents of the letter. Turns out, the goblin Nazz is in reality the son of a merchant prince, who stole some of his family's fortune and ran away to the flats to race. Were his father to learn of his whereabouts, Nazz would be dragged home and never race again.\nUpon receiving the note, Kravel seems pleased, and pays you well, once again. Somehow you suspect this will not be the last you see of him, however...\nThe Fool's Stout.\nAs you suspected, Kravel soon has need of your services again. It seems he has come to find you quite dependable.\n&lt;a href=\"Back%20to%20Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Back to Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;\nKravel has hatched yet another plot, though this time he is being very secretive about it. He seems to think this is the \"big one\", though, and sends you to speak with another of his goblin contacts in Booty Bay. When you deliver Kravel's message, the goblin mumbles to himself, and you catch the word \"Zanzil\" amidst his muttering. For some reason, the name makes you shudder.\n&lt;a href=\"Zanzil%27s%20Secret\"&gt;Zanzil's Secret&lt;/a&gt;\nFizzlebub, Kravel's contact, suddenly asks you to bring him some samples of , from the zombies in the lower ruins of Stranglethorn Vale. He mentions that the mixture can be used for controlling people. Though he doesn't say why he should need it, you begin to understand what Kravel may have had in mind. Besides, the goblin is offering very good compensation for the task, in addition to a nice belt.\nYou set out to collect the mixture, killing many zombies since not all of them have samples of the liquid on them. Finally you have it all, and return to Fizzlebub to collect your payment and to see what he can cook up for Kravel. In addition, he throws in a as a bonus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zanzil%27s%20Mixture%20and%20a%20Fool%27s%20Stout\"&gt;Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout&lt;/a&gt;\nFizzlebub has concocted an alcoholic drink made from the mixture of Zanzil. The goblin thinks this is just what Kravel needs. He warns that the drink is so strong it has become unstable, and will lose it's potency if not used quickly.\nHurriedly you return to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; with the so-called . You deliver it to Kravel and relay Fizzlebub's explanation. Kravel smiles, saying that this should work just fine.\n&lt;a href=\"Get%20the%20Gnomes%20Drunk\"&gt;Get the Gnomes Drunk&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Get%20the%20Goblins%20Drunk\"&gt;Get the Goblins Drunk&lt;/a&gt;\nKravel tells you to quickly pick a team and deliver the stout to them. You choose the team you like the least and give the crew the stout. The crew seems delighted, and the stout is passed around. Your task completed, you return to Kravel, expecting a reward.\n&lt;a href=\"Report%20Back%20to%20Fizzlebub\"&gt;Report Back to Fizzlebub&lt;/a&gt;\nIt seems Kravel has placed a bet on the other team, and expects it to come through quite well. In the meantime, he wants you to return to Fizzlebub and tell him the good news. A little miffed that you had not yet been paid, you nevertheless agree, and head back to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fool%27s%20Stout%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Fool's Stout (quest)&lt;/a&gt;\nFizzlebub informs you that he can make of the stout if you want it. Assuming Kravel will want to try the stunt again since it was so successful, and expecting a bonus for your trouble, you gather more Zanzil's mixture and have Fizzlebub brew it into another Fool's Stout. However, upon returning to &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt;, Kravel refuses to talk to you. Not only had you been stiffed, you had gone out of your way to get more of the stout for nothing. It seems it really was a \"Fool\"'s Stout.\nRewards.\nIf the player follows the entire quest chain from beginning to end, he or she will receive:\n&lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Belt of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;"}

The sentries patrol the northwest part of the Isle, so if the area near the harbor has too may players, move farther west."}

From the cavernous realm of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, this faceless general will bring to bear the next generation of draconic power to obliterate those foolish enough to challenge him.\"\nStrategy.\nErudax periodically casts Binding Shadows at random party members; it is a projectile-based AoE attack that should be avoided if possible; the debuff it leaves behind roots and damages players, as well as healing the boss. Enfeebling Blow will knock back the tank and place a +damage taken debuff; the tank should avoid re-engaging Erunax until the debuff has faded.\nEventually, Erudax will announce a Shadow Gale (), spawning a dark swirl somewhere within his room. Party members must move to the center of the swirl to avoid Shadow Gale's AoE damage. After Shadow Gale, a Faceless Corruptor (two on Heroic difficulty) will appear at the doorway. The Corruptors cannot be stunned, but should be snared and killed before they manage to hatch any eggs. Should they finish casting Twilight Corruption, two Twilight Hatchling adds will appear and do random party damage through out the remainder of the fight; if the corruptors are not killed immediately after that, they will also heal Erudax for 20/40% of his health. This can and should be interrupted.\nIt is imperative that the Corruptor adds die before hatching any eggs. Consider explicitly assigning DPS to specific adds to ensure that both are snared and killed within the desired time frame. Root effects do not work, but slow effects do. Crippling poison, slow, frostbolt, frost trap, and chains of ice all are effective.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

As a tidesage, she served aboard the two-master \"&lt;a href=\"Windward\"&gt;Windward&lt;/a&gt;\" and was very deeply loved by the people of Boralus for her bravery and quickness and for having vouchsafed her ship over many journeys, from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and farther beyond. The sun burned her skin brown and her duty made her serious and pensive. Although she was liked and respected by her crew, she did not seek company in anything but prayers to the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt; and, as a result, felt a deep loneliness.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt; eventually fell in love with Ery and began swimming near the \"Windward\" when it was in port so she could admire the sea priest's long brown hair. The sailors begged the captain to let them scare off or kill the mermaid, but Ery forbade them, and she never failed to give Halia a salute when the \"Windward\" arrived to Boralus or bid her goodbye when the ship left. Some new crew members tried to jeer at the tidesage for making a mascot out of a mermaid, but she silenced them with her hard fists. When the ship was anchored in Boralus and Ery went swimming in &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;the harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Halia left gifts for her in the form of half-dead fish or (when the fishing was poor) pearls. Because Ery was as sensible as she was serious, she dumped the pearls back into the water weeds. According to the tale, this is why Boralus Harbor has so much bubble seaweed: it is all of Halia's discarded pearls.\nBy observing her and offering her gifts, Halia became more familiar with Ery's ways than anyone else and unwittingly disrupted the tidesage's loneliness. Ery was at first solemn over the gifts, then touched, and finally amused. She was attracted to Halia's beauty as well, and spent a whole voyage sharpening a gut-hook knife to give as a return gift. Upon returning to the harbor, she waded into the shallows, called for Halia, and gave her the knife. The shy mermaid and the grave tidesage kissed and confirmed their feelings for each other. Halia then asked Ery to come live with her underwater, explaining that if she slit her feet and walked into the harbor, the &lt;a href=\"Mother%20%28mermaids%29\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt; would take pity on her and turn her into a mermaid. Ery refused, citing her duties as a tidesage. In response, Halia instead begged Ery to make a house by the shore and let her swim alongside her ship on voyages, but the tidesage replied that they had to keep their relationship secret or else her crew would reject her, which would be the death of them. Halia wept at this but agreed out of her love for Boralus and the \"Windward\". From that day onward, sea priest and mermaid met in secret coves and waterways, growing more dear to each other in the process.\nOne day, when the \"Windward\" was in dock, a great storm came to Boralus and threatened to destroy the town. With no hope of reinforcements, Ery and the handful of other tidesages who were present gathered in tiny boats at the river's mouth to divert the water. The other priests faltered one by one until, on the fifth day, only Ery was left. Halia begged her to slit her feet and save herself, but Ery replied that there was still a chance if she could hold back a large waving coming toward them. Halia decided to help her, and while the priest parted the waters with one blow, the mermaid held the water back from the other side so that they together ripped the seas in twain. Ery stated that their work was not yet done, and Halia declared that she would build a wall while her beloved held the water. She began piling rocks and mud on the seabed, pausing every so often to check on Ery, but the tidesage always said that the work was not yet done. Eventually, Halia was joined in her work by her fellow mermaids, but Ery knew nothing of this, still standing in the wreck of her ship and pulling back on the waves. At this point, the \"Windward\" arrived and tried to rescue their tidesage, but she refused to come to them. The mermaids' wall grew so tall that it began to rise under Ery's feet, lifting her above the water until it towered over the harbor. Halia returned over and over to ask if the work was done, and when the tidesage finally turned around to answer, she collapsed from exhaustion and fell into the water. Without her power to hold them back, the waves crashed into the seawall, but it held steady.\nHalia immediately dived after Ery and pulled her to the surface, but the priest was neither breathing nor moving. The crew of the \"Windward\" hauled the two onto their deck, where the sailors and other tidesages tried to revive Ery without any luck. Eventually, Halia drew a knife, slit open her lover's feet, and cried for the sailors to push the two of them over the railing and into the harbor. The crew did so and wept for their tidesage, but after a long wait, Ery's head broke the surface. Her hair now had a strange sheen and her legs had been replaced by a tail, but her face remained the same: the Mother had taken pity on her and transformed her into a mermaid. Halia held her arms around her beloved's neck, alternately weeping and laughing with joy.\nEry never returned to Kul Tiras a tidesage or a fellow in arms, but the entire island now knows her story. On certain calm sunsets when the red is deeply reflected on the surface of Boralus Harbor, old sailors call it \"Ery's blood\", which presages good weather, in remembrance of the dutiful tidesage and the mermaid who loved her so faithfully."}

Her family was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe becomes a champion of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; and will remain near the sick &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe can be gained by completing the Mage campaign. You gain her by going to an &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;exotic magic society&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; appointed Esara as the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;' Seeker of Wisdom, an individual who travels beyond &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in search of power and information for the order. Esara believes this was a relief to both her and Rommath, as she is somewhat atypical for her kin, outspoken in her opinions, and prefers a life on the road. Esara began to find the confines of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; to be stifling after spending several years on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. She is an acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Ravandwyr\"&gt;Ravandwyr&lt;/a&gt;, who tries to convince her to join the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nEsara is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, investigating the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean%20Society\"&gt;Empyrean Society&lt;/a&gt;, a group of renegade mages with an interest in forbidden magics. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror&lt;/a&gt; of the Tirisgarde, who had travelled to Azsuna on the trail of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;, accompanies Esara through the society's camp. They discover the rampant use of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic among the Empyrean members, a power Esara firmly believes no mage should dabble in. After rescuing Ravandwyr, Esara accepts a position in the Tirisgarde and becomes one of the Conjuror's champions. She is then found in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, eagerly browsing its lore tomes. She states that she will ensure the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom have worked with the Kirin Tor in the past, will support the reformed order."}

According to the sacred words of the First Ones, they placed the waystones at crucial locations where they would one day be needed, and they would respond only to the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014the living mortals destined to save the Shadowlands. While dormant, waystones appear as stone obelisks adorned with a looping spiral pattern. Maw Walkers can drawn on their own &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to activate them, causing them to unfold into glowing portals. With the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Translocator\"&gt;Ancient Translocator&lt;/a&gt;s, all known waystones connect to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal City.\nKnown.\nThe Maw.\nA &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos\"&gt;Waystone to Oribos&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Cocyrus\"&gt;Cocyrus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. It was formerly dormant and was mostly ignored by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, having been sealed long ago. However, during their escape from the Maw, the waystone reacted to the presence of &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; with a unique connection to the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to activate it and escape to Oribos. This surprised &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, who had thought it impossible for a relic of the First Ones to respond to a mortal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; notes that the waystone's existence is curious, since the Maw was intended to be an inescapable prison. One possibility is that the infallible First Ones placed it there as a failsafe, though this is a contested theory since it opens the possibility of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; wrongly assigning souls to the Maw even when she was working correctly. Another theory is that the First Ones foresaw the coming of the Maw Walkers and placed the stone in the Maw for their benefit, which seems to be confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ara\"&gt;Elder Ara&lt;/a&gt;'s statement about the First Ones putting waystones where they knew the Maw Walkers would need them.\nKorthia.\nA second &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos%20%28Korthia%29\"&gt;Waystone to Oribos&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;. Korthian prophecies claimed that it would one day be needed by a Maw Walker and prove crucial to the fate of the Shadowlands. Until that day arrived, &lt;a href=\"Pathscribe%20Roh-Vess\"&gt;Pathscribe Roh-Vess&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for watching over it.\nAfter Korthia was pulled into the Maw, the attendants in Oribos sensed the emergence of this second waystone. &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; created an anchor to one Maw Walker's anima in Oribos and sent the hero to attune themselves to the waystone, thereby connecting it to the anchor and allowing the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s to enter and leave the Maw just as Maw Walkers could. In Korthia, &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt; examined the hero's anima and determined them to be the \"true Maw Walker\", foretold by prophecy, and allowed them to activate the waystone.\nZereth Mortis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; found a dormant &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waystone\"&gt;Ancient Waystone&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Geometric%20Cavern\"&gt;Geometric Cavern&lt;/a&gt; when they first arrived in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;.

However, they bear little resemblance to other waystones in that they're only connected to each other and work by sending the user as a beam of energy across the landscape instead of teleporting them directly.\nOribos.\nAn object which appears to be a dormant waystone is located at the center of the &lt;a href=\"Idyllia\"&gt;Idyllia&lt;/a&gt; in Oribos.

Each &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; has certain &lt;a href=\"Class%20proficiencies\"&gt;weapons it is allowed to use&lt;/a&gt;. \nDevices which cause damage when used but are not equipped are not weapons in a game mechanic sense, being more akin to stored spells.

Only hunters can &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shot\"&gt;auto-shoot&lt;/a&gt; with a bow, crossbow, or a gun. \nHunters should take into consider their racial specialization when deciding on a ranged weapon; after all, if that weapon type is not their personal preference, it can always be &lt;a href=\"transmogrified\"&gt;transmogrified&lt;/a&gt; into one that is. In situations where it is known that there is a possibility that weapon &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; can be broken (such as &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%20%28tactics%29%23Phase%202\"&gt;class-call outs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"BWL\"&gt;BWL&lt;/a&gt;), hunters should always carry a decent-quality backup weapon because they will do little DPS without it.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, these ranged weapons required &lt;a href=\"ammo\"&gt;ammo&lt;/a&gt; to fire: &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s use &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s which could be stored in a &lt;a href=\"quiver\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s used &lt;a href=\"bullet\"&gt;bullet&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"shot\"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt;, which could be stored in a &lt;a href=\"ammo%20pouch\"&gt;ammo pouch&lt;/a&gt;. The ammo provided a damage bonus. Hunters were also allowed to use thrown weapons, but as they don't have any special abilities pertaining to them, it was recommended for them to use a non-thrown weapon as they would do far more dps with a bow, crossbow or gun anyway.\nNPC specific weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren%20totem\"&gt;Tauren totem&lt;/a&gt; weapons, &lt;a href=\"blowgun\"&gt;blowgun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt; whips and &lt;a href=\"%3AUmbra%20Crescent\"&gt;:Umbra Crescent&lt;/a&gt; glaives are unique weapons found among some NPCs."}

The hooves have a 100% drop rate.\nProgress.\nPatience is earth's greatest virtue. The earth witnesses the cycle of all things: the mountains becoming deserts; rivers becoming canyons. The earth is the most stubborn and wise of all the elements and it does not tolerate impatience.\nThe earth beckons you now because a time of conflict draws near. When you return to me successful, then you shall be that much closer to being made whole.\nOthers will be envious of your wisdom and hate you for their ignorance.\nRequired items:\nCompletion.\nExcellent. Your success shows that you are prepared.\nOf all the elements, earth represents the foundation of all things. It is your strength, your stamina, and your patience. Earth will protect you, but only if shown the proper respect. Like the other elements, even earth can be fickle. Earth is the basis for life, and by observing its laws, you will gain greater wisdom. Never forget the secrets earth shares with you.\nI shall make a &lt;a href=\"sapta\"&gt;sapta&lt;/a&gt; for you now, and by accepting it, you will realize your path.\nAdditional Notes.\nIf you haven't done them already, do this quest in conjuction with one of the following quests, as they involve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Coven\"&gt;Burning Blade Coven&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis quest is in the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; starting area, but it is not restricted to them - &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; can complete it as well.

Rewards are also determined by the character's level, with those at max level receiving more than other characters. \nPlayers only receive additional rewards for completing CtA battlegrounds when having queued for that specific battleground. The Call to Arms and Random Battleground systems offer players two different ways of earning the same Bonus Battleground rewards, and CtA battlegrounds chosen randomly through the Random Battleground option do \"not\" grant double rewards.\nThe following rewards are offered by both the Call to Arms and Random Battleground systems:\nRotation.\nThe Call to Arms system cycles through battlegrounds in an apparently random order, with all existing battlegrounds included in the Call to Arms cycle. You can find the schedule for Call to Arms battlegrounds in the in-game &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, by selecting 'Battleground Call to Arms' from the drop-down 'Filters' list.\nA new Call to Arms battleground is selected twice weekly, with a given battleground featuring from Tuesday to Thursday, or from Friday to Monday. Call to Arms battlegrounds change at 12:01 AM (midnight), server time.\nThere is always a Call to Arms battleground. However, since battlegrounds are restricted by level, non-max level players may at times be unable to participate in the Call to Arms system. Battlegrounds above a player's level are not displayed in the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, so if no Call to Arms option is currently displayed, it is likely due to the current battleground being unavailable at your character's level.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Call to Arms battleground feature was removed with \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\". Senior PvP Designer &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Holinka\"&gt;Brian Holinka&lt;/a&gt; explained that while originally added in order to increase variety to the battleground experience and allow players to regularly 'binge' on specific battlegrounds, the feature came to have an \"adverse affect\" on queue times in \"a pretty profound way\" due to players of one faction typically queuing heavily for the current Call to Arms battleground, while the other faction avoids it. In \"Warlords\", the feature was removed, with players intended to use the Random Battleground feature instead."}

The system is offered through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny time the Dungeon Finder queue is longer than a few minutes, the system will automatically determine which class role is currently the least represented in the queue, and offer that role additional rewards for entering the Dungeon Finder queue and completing a random heroic dungeon. In the case of tanking being the least represented role, the \u201cCall to Arms: Tanks\u201d icon will display where class roles are chosen in the Dungeon Finder UI, and will also display on the UI when the queue pops and you are selected to enter a dungeon. Regardless of your role, you\u2019ll always be able to see which role currently has a Call to Arms, if any.\nTo be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random max-level heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Satchel%20of%20Exotic%20Mysteries\"&gt;Misty Satchel of Exotic Mysteries&lt;/a&gt; that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount.\nNotes.\nIf a member leaves the party (either voluntarily or by being kicked) during a dungeon, and you choose to search for a new member to replace them, the new search will reset the Call to Arms process. Therefore, if your role is no longer eligible for Call to Arms when you re-queue, you will be ineligible from that point to receive the additional rewards.\nQueue times.\nThe system is intended to lower queue times for dungeons. Since &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt; are usually far harder to find than those performing a &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; role, the system attempts to encourage players to play dungeons in tanking or healing &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;s, by offering extra rewards for these roles. \nAs stated by &lt;a href=\"Bashiok\"&gt;Bashiok&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2129252\"&gt;4.1 Preview -- Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt; blog:"}

The warband is a party of &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Salyis\"&gt;Chief Salyis&lt;/a&gt; and mounted atop &lt;a href=\"Galleon\"&gt;Galleon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The ruthless saurok roam Pandaria, stealing what they can and harassing the island's other inhabitants. The most infamous of these reptilian pillagers are Chief Salyis and his warband. For years, the saurok commander and his raiders have stormed through the Valley of the Four Winds atop Galleon, a colossal and well-armed mushan that is more a moving fortress than a simple mount.\"\nStrategy.\nSalyis's Warband is mostly a &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; fight, with some &lt;a href=\"add%20fight\"&gt;add fight&lt;/a&gt; considerations depending on the raid's efficiency, and including high amounts of raid damage. Still, the mechanics are straightforward, and there are no phase changes aside from the periodic influx of adds. Its difficulty is therefore modest even with a raid of at-level players. As a world boss, the Warband was designed to be faced by a large raid, but any given group may bring more or less players to adjust the difficulty accordingly. By the end of the \"Mists of Pandaria\" raid progression, a group of 15-20 players were easily sufficient to defeat the boss in just a couple minutes, with only one moderately-geared healer to keep everyone alive.\nOnly one tank is required to hold Galleon's attention; the adds may be picked up by an optional second tank or simply killed before they become a problem. The main tank must make sure to stay close enough to Galleon's head not to be hit by Cannon Barrage, while the rest of the raid should stay under or behind Galleon. Healers should be prepared for intense raid-wide healing after each Stomp, as well as an increase in pressure when adds arrive. Damage dealers will primarily be focusing on Galleon. At high enough gear/roster levels, the raid may be able to simply focus down Galleon before or slightly after the first adds arrive, otherwise they should be killed with &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; abilities or &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d. Once the primary boss is defeated, Salyis will announce the retreat and the adds will disappear.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Every goblin that encounters it seems to be impressed with it, even though no one seems to know what it actually does. &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Copperplug\"&gt;Boss Copperplug&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Samophlange%20Manual\"&gt;samophlange manual&lt;/a&gt; is over 600 pages long (30 of which are intentionally left blank). The samophlange moves when handled and makes the sound of intricate gears. Its components include a centrifugal rotary ball clutch, at least two load-bearing fluxors, a deregulator gear, a release valve, a differential casing, a reverse crankshaft flywheel pulley, a high-pressure expansion condenser, and oscillating coolant pressure valves. Its structural integrity can be measured by adding extra gauges to it. A samophlange can kill from thirty yards if the reduction caliphracts are misaligned.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Control%20Console\"&gt;control console&lt;/a&gt; in which a samophlange was kept by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; can be used to \"automatically regulate the flow of fuels, gasses, liquids, and related machinery\" with various valves and gauges. The console's main power lever \"enables\" the samophlange. Whatever that means.\nHistory.\nClassic.\nThe samophlange was invented by &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Copperplug\"&gt;Boss Copperplug&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;. He hoarded the secrets of the device, giving out bits of knowledge about it to people he trusted. &lt;a href=\"Sputtervalve\"&gt;Sputtervalve&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Union\"&gt;Tinkers' Union&lt;/a&gt; engineer in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that the Venture Co. was experimenting with the samophlange at one of their research sites near the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fen\"&gt;Sludge Fen&lt;/a&gt; and sent adventurers to retrieve it so he could examine it. After deactivating the samophlange &lt;a href=\"Control%20Console\"&gt;control console&lt;/a&gt; and opening it with a key from &lt;a href=\"Tinkerer%20Sniggles\"&gt;Tinkerer Sniggles&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers tugged the samophlange loose and brought it back to Sputtervalve, who stated that he'd send it to the Tinkers' Union headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt; for dissection, in the hopes that they'd be able to \"make some sense of it\".\nSputtervalve's colleagues were intrigued by his description, but he accidentally broke the device before he could send it. He sent the adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Wenikee%20Boltbucket\"&gt;Wenikee Boltbucket&lt;/a&gt; to fix it. Although Wenikee didn't know what a samophlange was, she was interested in seeing what it did. However, her attempts to fix it by putting extra gauges and dials on it didn't work, so she sent the adventurers to the ex-Venture Co. member &lt;a href=\"Rilli%20Greasygob\"&gt;Rilli Greasygob&lt;/a&gt; instead. Rilli immediately recognized the samophlange and claimed to be able to fix it if he got the user's manual from Boss Copperplug. He promised to let the adventurers know if he ever got the device fixed.\nCataclysm.\nSputtervalve, now an independent contractor at &lt;a href=\"Nozzlepot%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;Nozzlepot's Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, again asked adventurers to obtain the samophlange from the Venture Co. research site. He stated that while it would be best to carefully analyze and reverse engineer it, there wasn't time for that and he instead fired it up right away to see what it did. As a result, the samophlange broke immediately. &lt;a href=\"Brak%20Blusterpipe\"&gt;Brak Blusterpipe&lt;/a&gt; tried to bang it back into shape, only for it to break further. The adventurers took it to Wenikee Boltbucket again, but her attempted fix resulted in it breaking a third time and its structural integrity reaching an all-time low. However, in the process, she discovered Boss Copperplug's stamp on the device. The adventurers took the now unrecognizable re-engineered wreckage of the samophlange back to Sputtervalve, who asked them to get the device's manual from Copperplug and his followers. Sputtervalve was impressed by the manual, even though he still hadn't figured out what the samophlange's purpose was. Sputtervalve and Brak fired the device back up and, this time, managed to get it working. &lt;a href=\"Nozzlepot\"&gt;Nozzlepot&lt;/a&gt; told them to throttle it up to \"max power\", which caused it to explode. Nozzlepot declared Sputtervalve to be a genius and ordered him to make 30 more samophlanges.\nIn preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Krazz\"&gt;Captain Krazz&lt;/a&gt; wanted the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; engines of the &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%20warfleet\"&gt;Hellscream warfleet&lt;/a&gt; to use an &lt;a href=\"Induction%20Samophlange\"&gt;induction samophlange&lt;/a&gt;, which to the untrained eye is identical to an ordinary samophlange. This caused the engines to be delayed, since induction samophlanges hadn't actually been invented yet. &lt;a href=\"Fleep\"&gt;Fleep&lt;/a&gt; tasked the engineer &lt;a href=\"Smoot\"&gt;Smoot&lt;/a&gt; with creating one based on stolen Venture Co. schematics, but upon building a working model, Smoot became drunk with power and started running around &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with it. Adventurers took the samophlange from him, allowing Fleep to \"samophlanginate\" and install the engines. When &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27s%20Airship\"&gt;Garrosh's Airship&lt;/a&gt; crashed at the start of the invasion, the induction samophlange went down with it. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stole it and brought it to &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt;, but adventurers and the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; recovered it and gave it back to Captain Krazz so he could rebuild the fleet.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nThe samophlange first appeared in the canceled \"\", lying next to &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;'s crashed &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;. He was upset when &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; almost stepped on it. Gazlowe described it as \"one of the most revolutionary tools ever invented by the goblins\" and \"very delicate\". It was essentially a high powered drill designed to attach the snabgasket to the bleemseal's intake valves (both were zeppelin components). It attached to a hose of some kind."}

Desperate for aid, their prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; pledged allegiance to Illidan Stormrage who taught them how to siphon magic, and how to wield &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves, or &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to avenge their fallen brethren, participated in Illidan's attempt to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; intervened, and the two armies clashed, but the undead ultimately defeated Illidan's forces at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The surviving blood elves returned to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; along with Kael'thas.\nA few remained lost and scattered in the frozen wastes of Northrend, but Arthas sought out one by one those who had challenged the Lich King. He shattered their forces and raised the most powerful ones into the Lich King's service as &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt;, organizing them into the San'layn. Among those survivors was &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;, wielder of the draconic blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, who was no match for the power of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. She was chosen by the Lich King to serve him in undeath as the queen of the San'layn.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe San'layn oversaw the Scourge's operations throughout Azeroth, holding an important position amongst the Scourge offensive, with its members, most of the times, performing important tasks on the behalf of the Lich King. They were often found in strongholds of other Scourge-affiliated races alongside with its local leadership, or in command of Scourge bases or operations across Northrend, acting as agents, leaders, or ambassadors.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%23The%20second%20Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge's second invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the San'layn Prince &lt;a href=\"Tenris%20Mirkblood\"&gt;Tenris Mirkblood&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; by orders from the Lich King, in a mission to learn about the strengths of their enemies. The operation was thwarted by experienced heroes sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey took part in the assault upon the Scarlet Enclave, were responsible for the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, the creation of the massive flesh titan &lt;a href=\"Thrym\"&gt;Thrym&lt;/a&gt;, challenged heroes in battle at Valhalas, and acted as ambassadors to the vrykul of the Howling Fjord and as agents of the Scourge forces attempting to conquer Azjol-Nerub. The San'layn maintained an especially strong presence in the Borean Tundra, leading the assaults from &lt;a href=\"Temple%20City%20of%20En%27kilah\"&gt;Temple City of En'kilah&lt;/a&gt; and the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt; floating above the fortress.\nThe alliance between &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge meant that the Lich King sent an ambassador, the San'layn &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Prince Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, to reside at &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He oversaw Scourge operations in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, working with &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar the Plunderer&lt;/a&gt; to organize raids. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s eventually killed him.\nThe San'layn faced heavy resistance from the Alliance and the Horde. With most of their blood princes slain by the end of the Northrend campaign, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; raided the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Hall\"&gt;Crimson Hall&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, their headquarters. The blood-princes &lt;a href=\"Valanar\"&gt;Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keleseth\"&gt;Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taldaram\"&gt;Taldaram&lt;/a&gt; were raised into undeath by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to avenge themselves, but were killed again, along with their &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;blood-queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nBlood-Queen Lana'thel's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Blood-Princess%20Thal%27ena\"&gt;Blood-Princess Thal'ena&lt;/a&gt;, had been imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. She was freed by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Malgath\"&gt;Lord Malgath&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to strike &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from within, but was killed by a group of heroes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWith no home left, several San'layn were employed into the Horde's ranks, although &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; did not trust them. Sylvanas came into an agreement and gave them a chance; besides having to respect the hierarchy of authority within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, if the Darkfallen could work with them they would get a home with the Horde, if not they would be gone.\nThey were tasked to clear the rubble in a collapsed tunnel that connects &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt; and his followers came into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, eventually killing members of her party. Hunted by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the blood prince was cornered traveling via boat. Aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Squall\"&gt;Crimson Squall&lt;/a&gt;\" he was training &lt;a href=\"San%27layn%20Neophyte\"&gt;other San'layn&lt;/a&gt; and alongside his followers were siphoning power from blood-infused crystals to bolster their unholy abilities, indicating that the San'layn were growing their ranks again. When cornered, Dreven killed and drained the Forsaken troops aboard his ship, intending to blame their deaths on the Alliance. The blood prince and his followers were ultimately slain by Shandris and an Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nWith the breaking of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, the san'layn &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; marshaled the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and marched them to attack the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the sin'dorei helmed by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; defended the village and launched a counteroffensive across the Dead Scar into &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s managed to kill Vorath with their newly empowered ranseurs.\nAppearance.\nSan'layn mostly retain the builds of their still-living kin, with slim, athletic, and strong bodies, and have fairly long hair.\nHowever, unlike blood elves, their flesh appears necrotic and, though universally pale, ranges from fleshy pinks and red to gray and light green, and they tend to have either white, blond, red or dark hair. Their eyes have white, yellow, green, blue, or black glows. Some San'layn have clawed fingers and ears more closely resembling those of a bat, and a few have developed wings.\nCulture.\nThe San'layn are cold, arrogant &lt;a href=\"vampyr\"&gt;vampyr&lt;/a&gt; who inflict pain for pure entertainment. Bearer of a curse which makes them hunger for blood, they are often found siphoning from blood globes and crystals.\nSan'layn, most of the times, dress in red, orange and black garments, like tarnished versions of their living cousins, the blood elves. They have assimilated the Scourge shared culture, and contributed with their own, which can be seen in the decoration of the Crimson Hall, inside the Icecrown Citadel.\nTheir most common mount is the &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt; and they have been shown to keep bats, spiders and blood worms around them.\nSkilled in a variety of magic schools, they often make use of vampiric skills, have even demonstrated some shape-shifting abilities and possess great mental influence over human minds, when empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nDuring the Northrend campaign, the San'layn possessed two main bases of operations across Northrend: the Temple City of En'kilah and the Crimson Hall. The Temple City of En'kilah served as the command center of the Scourge in the Borean Tundra. The Crimson Hall was the headquarters and home of the San'layn, located inside the Icecrown Citadel, and was the place where the most powerful ones could be found. Blood-Queen Lana'thel held the leading position in the San'layn hierarchy, and the Blood Prince Council were the second in the chain of command of the faction.\nLater, during the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the San'layn attempted to join the Horde's ranks, only to be slain alongside their leader Blood Prince Dreven by the hands of the Alliance. \nThe current status of their leadership and its organization is unknown. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Be sure to prevent your units from running into a Blizzard after your enemy steps out of it. Whenever possible aim Blizzard on low hit point units such as ranged units and spellcasters. Try to move the enemy into areas where their retreat is cut off so you can Blizzard them. Cast Blizzard on any enemy units that can't run away. If you see that you are casting Blizzard on friendly troops immediately cancel it.\nBlizzard does 50% damage to buildings.

Based from their home island of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari fleet is one of the most powerful on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, despite the recent hardships for the nation. Although the Zandalari civilization is ancient, its legendary fleet has only come into existence since it became an island nation following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The ships are blessed by &lt;a href=\"Kaza%27jin%20the%20Wavebinder\"&gt;Kaza'jin the Wavebinder&lt;/a&gt; through the power of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the Sundering, the Golden Fleet has been integral to most of Zandalar's operations in the wider world. Shortly after the opening of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the fleet set sail under the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; to wage a campaign in the north of the continent, centered around the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. More recently during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari Empire has joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, bringing its massive fleet with it. The majority of it was destroyed by the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPandaria campaign.\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; would be damaged by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; to such an extent that many ventured out into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in search of a new future. Leading &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;this faction&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt;, who directed the Golden Fleet to the northern coasts of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Only recently rediscovered, Pandaria held the remains of the legendary &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; ruler &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King, who the Zandalari intended to resurrect. The fleet made landfall on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, beginning a full-scale invasion.\nParticularly on the Isle of Thunder, the Zandalari invasion force clashed with expeditions sent by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and were eventually defeated along with the Thunder King himself. Having met with failure, Zul and the Golden Fleet returned to Zandalar.\nBlood War.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; erupted between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari had rebuilt much of their civilization, and their fleet was once more a powerful force. &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; would travel on \"&lt;a href=\"Rezan%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Rezan's Wake&lt;/a&gt;\" to open negotiations with the Horde, but her ship was captured en route and impounded in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. When the Princess escaped, she was pursued to the coast of Zandalar itself, where the Golden Fleet lay waiting. Guided by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji parted the mists surrounding her ship, revealing the assembled fleet which unleashed a devastating volley on the following Alliance &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. Only a single vessel survived the bombardment, and the event would convince Alliance leadership of the Golden Fleet's potency.\nThe Horde would recruit the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; to their cause, with a motivating factor being the strength of their fleet. In particular, this was to counter the potential of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, which the Alliance simultaneously sought. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Zandalar\"&gt;war in Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, mutineers loyal to &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; joined with &lt;a href=\"Kao-Tien\"&gt;a force&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to seize much of the Golden Fleet while it sat in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Bay of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. This was part of a wider coup engineered by the Prophet, and saw &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tusk%20Isle\"&gt;Tusk Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Fangs\"&gt;Isle of Fangs&lt;/a&gt; fall under the traitors' control. It was only with the help of Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; that the Zandalari were able to reclaim their ships and drive back Zul's followers.\nAs part of the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;war campaign&lt;/a&gt; on Zandalar, a major focus was placed on crippling the Golden Fleet. A plan devised by High Commander &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; saw Alliance agents infiltrate the various sections of the fleet stationed in the Bay of Kings. In addition to recovering important intelligence and carrying out other acts of espionage, they covertly planted special explosives on almost all of the major Zandalari vessels. These remotely-detonated bombs would be used in preparation for a planned attack on &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; itself by an Alliance invasion force. After the success of the mission, the Alliance forces also boarded and destroyed the flagship \"&lt;a href=\"Gral%27s%20Call\"&gt;Gral's Call&lt;/a&gt;\" to prevent their cover being blown, though they took no pleasure in being forced by circumstance in eliminating the entire crew with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zalkran\"&gt;Captain Zalkran&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Zandalar\"&gt;war in Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari Empire would officially ally itself with the Horde. In doing so, it added the strength of the Golden Fleet to that of the Horde's naval forces. This was welcomed at a time when the Blood War against the Alliance continued to reach new heights of tension, especially at sea.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter receiving reports of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invading &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; and conquering the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari and the Horde decided to combine their forces and drive them out with a counteroffensive. With the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; said to be just off the coast of Nazmir, Princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to get the Golden Fleet to attack them. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rez%27okun\"&gt;Captain Rez'okun&lt;/a&gt; however, could not mobilize the entire fleet and could only redirect the ships that were already not docked at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Once a majority of the Horde's forces were lured to Nazmir, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the assault on Nazmir was a ruse and began their true objective: the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. The Golden Fleet sought to impede the Alliance navy's path and harried them with &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt;s, having no clue about the explosives on their hulls.\nJust as &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin&lt;/a&gt; was about to remotely detonate the explosives with his remote detonator machine, the deck behind him collapsed from the impact of one of the Golden Fleet's ballistae missiles into &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;Jaina's ship&lt;/a&gt;. Gelbin and the machine fell below to the lower deck and while Jaina shielded the ship, not knowing if the High Tinker was alive or dead, he pulled himself out of the rubble so he could rush to upright his remote detonator. The second the machine reestablished signal contact, Gelbin slammed the detonator button and blew up the entirety of the Golden Fleet stationed there, allowing the Alliance navy to invade &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; with little resistance. More than half the Zandalari vessels were destroyed in this initial strike.\nRise of Azshara.\nA few of the remaining ships wrecked on &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; opened the seas."}

The Golden Lotus have recently noticed &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; trespassers sneaking into the Vale and have called upon the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from the Horde and Alliance to help solve the mystery of their resurgence.\nWhen the Vale was desecrated by the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, many members of the Golden Lotus were killed.

Several important members of the Lotus were stationed here, including &lt;a href=\"Leven%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Leven Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rook%20Stonetoe\"&gt;Rook Stonetoe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Tenderheart\"&gt;Sun Tenderheart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kun%20Autumnlight\"&gt;Kun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anji%20Autumnlight\"&gt;Anji Autumnlight&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; awakened the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, feedback from the event destroyed the Golden Pagoda and surrounding areas, killing many of the residents there. All Golden Lotus quests were relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Setting%20Sun%20Garrison\"&gt;Setting Sun Garrison&lt;/a&gt; on the western side of the zone. The area is now a desecrated crater, home only to the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; that now haunt the vale.\nAfter the Vale of Eternal Blossoms was restored, the pagoda was also reconstructed."}

He embodies ferocity, savagery, and an unyielding will, and legends tell that he possesses unparalleled rage and fury. His is the spirit of the hunter, the animal instinct that kicks in when wild things smell food or feel their children are in jeopardy.\nDevotion and worship.\nGoldrinn is known across all cultures and, according to &lt;a href=\"Takrik%20Ragehowl\"&gt;Takrik Ragehowl&lt;/a&gt;, has appeared in many forms on both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. His legend extends throughout Azeroth. Worshiped as an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; know him as Lo'Gosh. &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; all have their own versions of the legend. Each tale tells of how the wolf demigod's unyielding will and ferocity enable him to push through the boundaries of the afterlife to aid his people. Lo'Gosh has always been with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on Draenor as a part of their &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, in their instincts and blood. When the orcs arrived on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, they were told of Lo'Gosh by the tauren. The orcs adopted him as their hero on this new world, for they considered that the will of orcs is strong like his and, like him, not even death can stop them.\nDruids that worship Goldrinn may earn the &lt;a href=\"pack%20form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;, which is difficult to control.\nThe wolf god is indirectly responsible for the worgen curse. It was from a fang of Goldrinn and the staff of Elune that &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, intended to tame the feral spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, but the power of Goldrinn and Elune turned them into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; refers to the affliction as Goldrinn's Curse, and Goldrinn later refers to his gift when granting Tess Greymane a vision.\nBiography.\nFrom the moment the wild creatures first stirred on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Goldrinn was there. &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; the moon goddess was said to be disappointed in Goldrinn's feral insistence. It was his unwillingness to tame his savagery and bloodlust that overshadowed his noble heart. When Elune's great light illuminated the dark during the full moons, it was as if her eyes glared down upon him in judgement. His anger at her conviction caused Goldrinn to become even more bloodthirsty and indomitable than ever.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the white wolf Ancient slaughtered hundreds of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. It was during this time that Goldrinn's tenacity became legendary. While others quaked at the sight of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, their numbers only spurred the wolf Ancient to ever greater feats of strength. He would wade into the demons' ranks, fangs bared and spattered with their vile ichor, his great claws thrashing them by the dozen. He eventually fell to the demons' great numbers, yet his spirit was said to live on, watching over those he favored.\nAccording to a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; legend, Lo'Gosh confronted the Burning Legion in the lush land that later became the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Though hopelessly outnumbered, he slaughtered hundreds before succumbing to his wounds. However, not even death could destroy his will to save his people.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; have a similar tale of how the ghost-spirit of Goldrinn aided the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in holding their city against the Burning Legion. It was said he stayed behind to cover the elves' retreat from Eldre'Thalas and his spirit guided the elves to key defensive positions at critical moments during the battle. After the battle, Goldrinn was never seen again.\nWar of the Satyr.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; were a sect of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s who followed Goldrinn. The druidic &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;, which drew on the fury of Goldrinn, was uncontrollable and therefore banned by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to control it, &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; tried merging Goldrinn's essence with that of Elune by affixing one of Goldrinn's fangs onto a staff that the moon goddess had blessed, creating the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. This backfired horribly, as Goldrinn rejected the moon goddess. The druids were &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; into the feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; instead, whom Ralaar led to seek revenge on the satyr and night elves alike. The other druids agreed that these worgen had to be locked away, and thus put them into eternal slumber beneath the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; assault on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; summoned the worgen from the Emerald Dream in order to unleash them upon the undead.\nWolfheart.\nGoldrinn's spirit seems to live on, favoring and inhabiting the human king, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. It is suspected that Goldrinn not only admired Varian's ferocity, but also his ability to tame it; something he himself was never able to do. Whereas Goldrinn's noble heart was overshadowed by his desire for bloodlust and vengeance, Varian's ferocity was tempered by his desire to protect and uphold justice. His choice to champion Varian seems to be another last redeeming act to Elune.\nCataclysm.\nPlayers will find the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Goldrinn\"&gt;shrine of the wolf god Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by corrupted worgen, and recover it. After recovering the shrine, the player must purify the shrine by summoning and slaying the &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian%23Dark%20Ancients\"&gt;dark ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lycanthoth\"&gt;Lycanthoth&lt;/a&gt;, who is the twisted version of Goldrinn. Thereafter, his spirit will appear to aid Hyjal's defenders in routing the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nGoldrinn chose &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; as his champion because of his ferocity, but also because of his ability to conquer his bloodlust to uphold his beliefs and protect his people. After Varian's death at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Goldrinn retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; to reflect. While sleeping within the Emerald Dream, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attempted to corrupt his physical body but were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;, who had been sent by &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;. At first Goldrinn was not aware of what had happened, but upon learning the fate he narrowly avoided, Goldrinn realized that he would not be the last Wild God to be targeted. Thisalee and the Archdruid vowed to find the demon responsible for this plot, and Goldrinn ran off into the wilds.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Goldrinn fights alongside many &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove%20Mender\"&gt;Dreamgrove Mender&lt;/a&gt;s against &lt;a href=\"wrathguard\"&gt;wrathguard&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xargraxach\"&gt;Xargraxach&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, the princess of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, wished to become a worgen so she could better know the plight of her people to better rule them when she becomes queen. As her &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; were against it, they asked the night elf druid &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; to help Tess understand the worgen's plight without becoming a worgen herself. Vassandra called on Goldrinn at the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and Goldrinn put Tess into a dream scenario within the Emerald Dream. In her dream Tess was a worgen at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, but was unable to save her &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; from his death and she fell into the rage of the curse. With Goldrinn's help Tess realized that she did not need to be a worgen to understand her people, for it was being Gilnean in spite of the curse that defined them.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIrritated \nFarewell\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Its prime location makes it an important trade town. Travelers, merchants, adventurers, Stormwind guards, and priests from the abbey all stop and make regular visits to the town on their way to and from Stormwind, usually enjoying the hospitality of the Lion's Pride Inn, one of the most respectable ale houses in Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Dughan\"&gt;Marshal Dughan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the security of town and its surrounding areas.

To the east is &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Lake\"&gt;Crystal Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; who found prosperity through the farmsteads that dotted the surrounding fertile region. As its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably Goldshire in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;, the village was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Goldshire and &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; were the final two towns to fall to the &lt;a href=\"old%20Horde\"&gt;old Horde&lt;/a&gt; prior to the razing of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, as the goal of the orc &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; was to sever the lifeline between &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; and his people in preparation of the sack of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nFollowing the victory of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the town was rebuilt with the help of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; who oversaw the efforts to repatriate the kingdom's citizens.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Stormwind%29\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; launched simultaneous attacks on Goldshire and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Unit%20Goldshire\"&gt;Unit Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe former &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; lived in the village. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a visitor was murdered in Lion's Pride Inn, and Mardigan was held responsible for his death even though he just found his body.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAs part of the , &lt;a href=\"Shieldwall%20Peasant\"&gt;several peasants&lt;/a&gt; left Goldshire and arrived to &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nElegy.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the flood of night elves &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; spread to seemingly every surface of Stormwind, and spilled out most of the way to Goldshire.\nShadowlands.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were mobilized under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Lenna\"&gt;Crusader Lenna&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the town and its inhabitants. The situation being rather calm, the crusaders remained vigilant and Crusader Lenna announced to the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who came to help them that their patrols reported outbreaks of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; activity to the east, leading her to send a &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Falk\"&gt;a scout&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captain%20Josephine\"&gt;Guard Captain Josephine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. She also transmitted a report to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gregor\"&gt;Commander Gregor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to brief them on the situation in the region.\nSecurity threats.\nDefias Brotherhood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; have camps throughout &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, especially to the south and east of Goldshire, which they use as staging grounds for raids on the local farmers and merchants. They have also taken over a number of homes and farmsteads, including the &lt;a href=\"Brackwell%20Pumpkin%20Patch\"&gt;Brackwell Pumpkin Patch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerod%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Jerod's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, where they smuggle contraband from &lt;a href=\"Redridge\"&gt;Redridge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the more notorious thieves in the region include &lt;a href=\"Dead-Tooth%20Jack\"&gt;Dead-Tooth Jack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20the%20Collector\"&gt;Morgan the Collector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erlan%20Drudgemoor\"&gt;Erlan Drudgemoor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Surena%20Caledon\"&gt;Surena Caledon&lt;/a&gt;. There are rumors the Defias have a relationship with the &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s in Elwynn Forest, enlisting them to collect gold from the mines. They may even be associated with the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s along the border of Westfall. The &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt; frequently sends out patrols to search for thieves entering Elwynn Forest from &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiverpaw gnolls.\nA significant number of &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt; have set up camps along the western borders of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, led by their chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Hogger\"&gt;Hogger&lt;/a&gt;. While currently held back by the &lt;a href=\"Westbrook%20Garrison\"&gt;Westbrook Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, if left alone they could pose a significant threat to Goldshire.\nMurlocs.\nThere have been rumors of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; attacks near the rivers to the east of Goldshire, especially near &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;, as well a fatal attack on two Stormwind guards. A report by &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Thomas\"&gt;Guard Thomas&lt;/a&gt; states that the murlocs pose a significant threat to Goldshire and are, at a minimum, affecting the region's fishing industry. There is a bounty on murloc fins placed by the Stormwind army.\nKobolds.\nKobold clans have infested the &lt;a href=\"Fargodeep%20Mine\"&gt;Fargodeep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jasperlode%20Mine\"&gt;Jasperlode&lt;/a&gt; mines, forcing out the local workers. While they don't pose much of a threat to Goldshire, their foothold in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; will only grow stronger if ignored.\nWolves and bears.\nWhile not really a threat to Goldshire, the &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s in the region are quite aggressive, especially in the area of the &lt;a href=\"Eastvale%20Logging%20Camp\"&gt;Eastvale Logging Camp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Cairn%20Lake\"&gt;Stone Cairn Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren of Goldshire.\nA bit to the north of Goldshire there is a house with skinning and leatherworking trainers. On the second floor of this house, six children can sometimes be seen forming the pattern of a pentagram, silent and unmoving. They will occasionally move out of the house to walk/run in a pentagram formation. They return to their house at around 7:40 in the morning, and at this time a soundfile will play something eerie, usually \"You will die\". Whether they make their rounds at other times of the day is unknown. Unconfirmed rumors also say they despawn at 8:00 pm.\nQuests.\nTo find all the quests available in Goldshire and elsewhere, check out the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Elwynn%20Forest%20NPCs\"&gt;List of Elwynn Forest NPCs&lt;/a&gt; and also the &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Elwynn Forest questing guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayer activity.\nPlayers from the server have given Goldshire a unique reputation as a consistent &lt;a href=\"Roleplaying\"&gt;role playing&lt;/a&gt; hub since at least 2008 with the most concentration within Lion's Pride Inn, where during most server hours hundreds of players can be found.\nMany players can be found here, outside of the inn dueling can usually be found while on the inside players engage each other in roleplay ( Usually through whispers, since all other forms of chat are usually filled nearly constantly due to the high amount of players. )\nSome players try to make themselves as obtrusive as possible, using combinations of various toys or spells to make their model as large as they can in order to disrupt the experience of others and be silly.\nWhat Goldshire is most known for has to be its &lt;a href=\"Erotic%20role%20play\"&gt;erotic roleplaying&lt;/a&gt; community (ERP for short). On most hours players can be found here whispering each other and roleplaying in private in tones of usually an erotic nature. The roleplay in these scenes usually forgoes the cohesive narrative that most normal RP carries, often being one-off stories of both characters meeting up and engaging in romantic affairs. This aspect of Goldshire has been referenced in several community-made videos and is usually seen as an oddity by those outside of the roleplaying scene\nIn August of 2010, Blizzard deemed this an issue for new players creating &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and having to be exposed to this community, they have since then started to look for individuals breaking the Terms of Service through things like unwanted, unsolicited messages and dealing with them in private. Since then Blizzard has announced no further plans in regards to Lion's Pride Inn.\nIn 2016 with the release of patch 7.0 Blizzard would give a reference to Goldshire inn as one of the possible results of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Confessional%20Book\"&gt;Scarlet Confessional Book&lt;/a&gt; toy: \"I really, really like the Goldshire Inn\".\nIn Warcraft III.\nGoldshire is also a 4-player map for \"\" called \"Goldshire Map\". Its description is the following: \"War and hunger have brought interlopers to &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, endangering the town of Goldshire. Sweep the woods free of this threat so that &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;masons&lt;/a&gt; can begin laying the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\" The town of Goldshire is in the center of the map and consists of a &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nGoldshire is heavily protected and patrolled by the Stormwind guards, has a goblin merchant and sports a population of 7,000 citizens \u2014 mostly farmers, miners, and traders. Its leader is Marshal Dughan.\nFilm universe.\nGoldshire is depicted close to its \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation, even to the locations of the guards. It still contains the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn%23Film%20universe\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt;."}

They formerly lived in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, where Man'zul was usually the brains behind many of the gang's thefts. In Zuldazar, Grenja got the gang out of a lot of sticky situations by holding open and knocking down a lot of doors as well as people. The group was eventually banished to Vol'dun, but while Zuldazar betrayed and exiled the gang, they never betrayed each other.\nMost of the gang consists of &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s that are invisible to outsiders, so Rhan'ka (the only living member) initially appears to merely be an insane troll talking to imaginary friends in the form of Grenja, Man'zul, and Volni's skulls. When &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s arrive at the Goldtusk Inn, Rhan'ka sends them to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Pass\"&gt;Dead Man's Pass&lt;/a&gt; to gather &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; blood for his famous scorpid blood drinks and search for Zulsan. While the heroes are gone, however, &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury trolls&lt;/a&gt; attack the inn and kidnap the Goldtusk Gang. After the adventurers rescue the gang members, kill the Sandfury leader, and retrieve a batch of &lt;a href=\"Rikati\"&gt;Rikati&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt; \"honey\", the gang agrees that it is time to initiate the adventurers into the group. Rhan'ka conducts the gang initiation ritual by having the adventurers drink the boiled blood and stingers they've collected, uniting them with the whole gang and letting them see what the gang sees by revealing the ghosts of the other trolls. After the adventurers further help ensure the Goldtusk Inn's successful opening, Rhan'ka declares that the inn is officially open for business and tells the heroes that they will always be welcome, as they are members of the gang for life."}

The inn offers several excursion activities and packages, such as the \"Warlord Package\" (which is required for access to excursions to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Pass\"&gt;Dead Man's Pass&lt;/a&gt;), the \"Scorpid King Package\" (unlimited all-day access to Rhan'ka's famous &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; blood drinks), and the \"Giant Deadly Unstoppable Killer Cobra Experience\" (an activity which challenges guests to travel to the dunes north of the inn and try not to be killed by &lt;a href=\"Sevriss\"&gt;Sevriss&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s first arrive at the inn, it offers no commodities and the visitors are only able to see the seemingly insane Rhan'ka talking to skulls.

Certain &lt;a href=\"Wizard%23Renegade%20wizards\"&gt;renegade wizards&lt;/a&gt; were also known to create their own golems to protect their secret dens and lairs. Most golems were magically protected from spells, so that enemy mages couldn't turn them against their creators.

Recent reports tell of golems roaming the countryside as if independent of any masters. Some sages suspect a hybrid form of arcane magic is causing this phenomenon.\nThe word \"golem\" refers to any vaguely humanoid-shaped construct built by another creature. Golems can be found in stone, metal, straw, iron and even flesh types. In some cases, a bound elemental or eldritch magic animates the golem; other golems are purely mechanical constructs. All golems share a number of traits. As mindless, soulless constructs, they cannot feel, nor do they require food, air, or sleep. They follow orders literally and unrelentingly. Adventurers cannot reason with golems. They cannot bargain with golems. A golem is a tool, a weapon, with a specific purpose. It fulfills that purpose or dies trying. Golems are able to withstand even the harshest environments. This trait combined with their loyalty makes them excellent guardians for vaults and underground lairs. The harvest golem is one type; other types of golem undoubtedly exist."}

Each &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; then imbued a number of them with their powers. Khaz'goroth bestowed his mastery over the earth and forging to &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the fall of the Old Gods, the Pantheon set out to order Azeroth. They gave the Keepers great tools to help them shape the world known as the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, among which was the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nablya\"&gt;Nablya&lt;/a&gt; observed and performed experiments within &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; on his behalf. Through Archaedas, Khaz'goroth bestowed some of his vast power upon the mighty black wyrm &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, who became one of the five &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. The great-hearted Neltharion, known thereafter as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest supporter.\nKhaz'goroth was killed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; alongside the rest of the Pantheon during the battle at &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;. While their bodies were destroyed, their souls survived and launched themselves throught the Great Dark. The spirits then slammed into the Keepers of Azeroth.\nSargeras would eventually capture the spirits of the Pantheon and bring them to the planet of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to be tortured and corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; into serving the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Aggramar was the first to succumb and be raised as an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe titans' spirits were freed by the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni, the Speaker of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. They brought the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; where Sargeras turned Argus against them. The titans assisted the mortal champions, and Khaz'goroth personally empowered them with \"Titanforging\", increasing their offensive and healing capabilities. Together, they managed to ultimately defeat &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. The titans then pooled their energy together along with the last remnant of Argus's power, and imprisoned Sargeras within their Seat, decisively ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, but not before he managed to the world with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nHis name is spelled as Kaz'goroth.\nKhaz'goroth is a male &lt;a href=\"Vanir\"&gt;Vanir&lt;/a&gt; titan. His classes are &lt;a href=\"Expert\"&gt;Expert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;. He uses a hammer named &lt;a href=\"Vulraiis\"&gt;Vulraiis&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaper of mountains and canyons, Khaz'goroth is the ultimate craftsman. He is a master of many arts and disciplines; with Eonar's help, he created Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troggs\"&gt;troggs&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s. He crafted the mountains in which the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; dwell \u2014 their kingdom's name, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, means \"mountains of Khaz.\" A fiery, brooding entity, Khaz'goroth loves working at his &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; and listening to tales of heroism and valor.\nKhaz'goroth's portfolio encompasses earth, stone, metal, dwarves, troggs, mountains and craftsmanship. Most Ironforge dwarves know that the titans created them, but do not know exactly which titan \u2014 so Khaz'goroth receives little veneration. As the dwarves uncover more titanic mysteries, they will undoubtedly find ways to revere their creator.\nHe was once in charge of a titan facility under &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;."}
