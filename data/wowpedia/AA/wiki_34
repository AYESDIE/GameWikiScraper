It granted the elves immortality, and allowed the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; with ease, until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, which severely wounded the tree and where the night elves lost its powers. Nordrassil's roots grow deep into the earth, spreading life-giving energy across the world. This is similar to what the first Well of Eternity did before it was destroyed.\nOriginally, Nordrassil had served two purposes - Not only had it been designed to keep others from abusing the magic of the new Well, but also to prevent the second fount's power from growing too great overtime.\nHistory.\nThe tree was grown from a single acorn of the recently lost Mother Tree, &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;great dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; in the waters of the newly reborn Well of Eternity on the sacred Mount Hyjal. After that, she blessed the tree with strength and vitality, which also extended the night elves. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing upon the tree bound it and the elven druids to the Emerald Dream, allowing them to enter her realm freely where before it required difficult meditation.\nBut the most important blessing came from &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, which ensured that so long as the tree existed the night elves would remain immortal. This would ensure that even the most corrupt of night elves would be drawn to protect the tree.\nThe night elves then took up residence in Nordrassil and the surrounding forests.\nDuring the Battle of Mount Hyjal, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; proposed a plan to sacrifice the Dragon Aspects' enchantments upon Nordrassil to save Azeroth. He and his druids prepared the tree, and he blew on the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; to summon forth hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;nature spirits&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, who was about to rip Nordrassil in order to gain control of the second Well of Eternity, thereby sacrificing the night elves' immunity to diseases and aging, and causing a devastating shockwave which destroyed the Legion, and heavily damaged Nordrassil. &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; believed that planting a new World Tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, would restore the night elves' immortality. However, Teldrassil was not blessed by the Aspect of Time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, who was the one to give immortality to the night elves through Nordrassil.\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Splinter%20of%20Nordrassil\"&gt;splinter&lt;/a&gt; of Nordrassil was used to recreate the sacred staff &lt;a href=\"Benediction\"&gt;Benediction&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn \"\", Nordrassil has fully regrown but the elemental Lord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; has set his forces to attack the tree, with the goal of destroying it. Malfurion, having returned from the Emerald Dream, along with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;armies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; are defending the World Tree.\nYsera, Alexstrasza, and Nozdormu later gathered with Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to restore Nordrassil.\nLegion.\nA dream portal opens up by the shores of the Well of Eternity, nestled within the roots of Nordrassil itself, allowing druids exclusive access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile attempting to cleanse the branch of &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; from corruption, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;druid hero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyessa%20Bloomwatcher\"&gt;Lyessa Bloomwatcher&lt;/a&gt; come upon the aftermath of a terrible battle. Nordrassil itself is unharmed, but the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was able to destroy most of the Well of Eternity. There they aid &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Omnuron\"&gt;Omnuron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celestine%20of%20the%20Harvest\"&gt;Celestine&lt;/a&gt; in fighting back the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt;, protecting the last vestiges of the stricken Well. After the battle, some of its magical waters yet remain and, according to Celestine, as long as at least one drop remains there is still hope.\nThe druid hero returns here with the most senior of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; as they attempt to commune with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. They discover that he has become trapped within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and resolve to rescue him.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; scars and &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the area under the World Tree, disturbing the &lt;a href=\"Frantic%20Faerie%20Dragon\"&gt;local faerie dragons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tholo%20Whitehoof\"&gt;Tholo Whitehoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anren%20Shadowseeker\"&gt;Anren Shadowseeker&lt;/a&gt; fought against them and &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Warden\"&gt;Hyjal Warden&lt;/a&gt;s stood in defense as well. &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; came to aid, fighting against an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Leviathan\"&gt;Azerite Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; that had emerged in the lake. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; felt that Nordrassil is in danger and arrived here with an adventurer to aid it.\nShadows Rising.\nThe area where Nordrassil is located has become a temporary home for the night elves following the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, with the elven leadership moving here from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. A meeting between &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; was also held here.\nIn the RPG.\nThe key point of interest on Hyjal is Nordrassil, the World Tree. It stands thousands of feet high, and its vast canopy almost blocks out the sky. Although the tree suffered much damage in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, it is healing itself. It did not flower or grow leaves the year past the war, but the druids hoped that the coming year it would begin to grow again. Guarded by three dragonflights, the World Tree Nordrassil is slowly regrowing. The bones of Archimonde, the great demon lord who led the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the Third War, still hang from the massive tree\u2019s mighty branches. Many speculate that when the tree regrows completely, the night elves will regain their immortality; but that day may never come if they fail to assist the dragons against the continuing threat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; speculated that &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;' last sane act was to aid in the creation of the World Tree."}

Norgannon imbued a portion of his intellect and mastery over magic into &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Norgannon used Loken as a conduit to channel his power into &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, granting him incredible &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; powers, as well as access to \"the limitless realms of magic and hidden arcana\" to forevermore share, explore and protect.\nWhen the traitor &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, former defender of the Pantheon, began his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to scour the universe of life, the Pantheon confronted him near the world of &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;. Their attempts to reason with him failed, and instead Sargeras killed his former student and friend, &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged by this murder, the Pantheon launched an all-out assault on the fallen titan and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but could not stand against his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; might. Just as Sargeras summoned a great fel storm to finish the Pantheon off, Norgannon wove a protective shroud around the Pantheon's souls, launching them into the Great Dark just as their bodies were destroyed. The spirits then slammed into the Keepers of Azeroth.\nSargeras eventually captured the spirits of most of the Pantheon members, with the sole exception of Eonar, who escaped. Aggramar succumbed to Sargeras's torture and was revived as an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; on the planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Aman'Thul, Khaz'goroth, Norgannon, and Golganneth were tortured by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of breaking them just as the Legion had Aggramar. \nAfter Norgannon and his brethren were freed, they reunited at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, where they attempted to sever &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Legion, and subsequently assisted the mortal champions against &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;'s temporal blast succeeded only in splitting and reshaping Argus into seven &lt;a href=\"Constellar%20Designate\"&gt;Constellar Designate&lt;/a&gt;s, Norgannon summoned his Discs and used their arcane abilities to expose elemental weaknesses in each of the Designates, rendering them vulnerable to harm. After Argus was finally defeated, Sargeras struck out at Azeroth and wounded her heavily in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately thereafter, the Pantheon combined their powers with the last remnant of Argus's essence, and imprisoned him within the Seat of the Pantheon, decisively ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; at long last. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed behind while his comrades left, serves as Sargeras's jailer.\nIn the RPG.\nNorgannon is a male &lt;a href=\"Aesir\"&gt;Aesir&lt;/a&gt; titan. His class is &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blank expression on this platinum-skinned titan's face is unreadable. Arcane power emanates from him like a tangible force, making skin prickle and hair stand on end. Lord of mysteries and master of &lt;a href=\"arcane%20magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;, Norgannon is the ultimate keeper of secrets. Though titans usually avoid the arcane's corrupting nature, Aman'Thul charged the implacable Norgannon to catalog all &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s and magical currents in the universe \u2014 the Dreamweaver's knowledge will, hopefully, enable the titans to better understand and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and their other enemies. Norgannon knows almost everything and is utterly passionless. He is the definitive magical historian.\nNorgannon's portfolio includes arcane magic, knowledge, secrets and mysteries. Though his name is generally unknown on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; (so far), spellcasters on many worlds revere this paragon of their craft. Some whisper his name whenever they cast a spell, while others beseech his protection against the corruption of the arcane."}

His blades were some of the finest in the world, and adventurers far and wide traveled to Thorium Point to have a weapon made by him. His skills created weapons that became known to be unbreakable, and wielding a weapon forged by Nori \"almost assured victory.\"\nNori, however, grew greedy. He left Thorium Point and traveled to the port city of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where he earned a month's pay in the Gorge twice in one fortnight and opened a shop called Black Finger. After his business proved successful and the town began to like him, he sent for his son, Eli. Nori would continue his business with Eli until a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; entered his shop one day to make an order. Eli was suspicious of the elf, for he asked for a discreet midnight transaction, but Nori simply rebuffed Eli. At the meeting, Nori handed the blade to the elf and was given his payment, then Eli saw who the blade was for; a merciless orc bandit named &lt;a href=\"Havoc%20the%20Heartless\"&gt;Havoc the Heartless&lt;/a&gt;. Eli tried to compel Nori to stop him from taking his blade, but Nori responded coldly \"It's none of my business.\" The next day Eli left, being disgusted with how greedy Nori had become. Nori grew angry, and in his anger, took his blade away from Eli and gave him a rusted weapon in return, telling him that he was no longer his son. Nori never spoke of Eli in public after that, but often wondered about him. When he next saw Eli, however, Eli was dead.\nA farmer, who brought Eli's corpse to the town, told him of how Eli had come to his aid after an ambush by Havoc, the same bandit he had sold his blade to. Though Eli managed to defeat several of Havoc's gang (including the elf), Havoc himself slew Eli, breaking the weapon Nori had given Eli to pieces with the weapon Nori had forged for Havoc. This changed Nori completely. He forged one final blade, a blade he would use to destroy Havoc with, as well as reclaim all the blades he had forged. Over the course of three years, Nori reclaimed the weapons, some through peaceful transactions, but others with blood and violence. This took a severe toll on his body, as he lost an eye during this period. He tossed the collected weapons into a water.\nHe saved Havoc for last, eventually tracking him down and killing the remainder of his group. He tied Havoc up to a tree and told him his story, with himself disguised but revealing that he was the blacksmith. He then cut Havoc loose and gave him his blade and took up a rusty blade similar to the one he had given Eli, claiming he would only have what Eli had. The two then fought in a bloody and fatal duel, with Nori being the victor. Havoc claimed in his dying breaths that Nori was just like him, to which Nori replied he was right, and that he would be right behind him. Nori then kicked Havoc into a fire, setting him ablaze and killing him. Nori then sits back down, pulls out his pipe and is last seen engulfed by the blaze as well."}

{"id": "63349", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=63349", "title": "Normalization", "text": "Normalization refers to an Attack Power adjustment made to instant attacks in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.8\"&gt;patch 1.8&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter ranged instant attacks were also normalized in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.10\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Auto-attack\"&gt;Auto-attack&lt;/a&gt; damage consists of two components: the weapon's nominal damage, and damage from &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt; (AP). (&lt;a href=\"Wand\"&gt;Wand&lt;/a&gt;s are an exception; they aren't affected by AP.) To keep AP's effect on &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; (DPS) constant given equal values for other stats, AP is multiplied by an amount proportional to the weapon's nominal speed (time in seconds between attacks). (This is not the same as your actual attack speed with the weapon, which means that &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; and AP give a larger increase to auto-attack DPS together than separately.)\nBefore normalization occurred in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.8\"&gt;patch 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, instant-cast special attacks used the same weapon-damage formula as auto-attacks, even though their rate was determined by the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; and therefore independent of the weapon's speed. Because of this, slow weapons with lower weapon DPS could lead to a higher total damage per second than faster weapons with higher nominal DPS.\nOne notable example is the &lt;a href=\"Barman%20Shanker\"&gt;Barman Shanker&lt;/a&gt;, which was at this time considered by many as the best &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; dagger due to its exceptional high swing time, although there were other &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; daggers with higher nominal weapon DPS (or &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;) available.\nFormulas.\nThe normalized weapon damage for instant attacks is:\nwhere codice_2 is: \nPrior to patch 1.8, the weapon damage used for instant attacks was:\nNote that ...\nis simply the formula for weapon (white) hit damage, as codice_9. The nomalized formula treats your weapon as if its swing time was a certain normal value for its type (1.7 sec for daggers, 3.3 sec for two-handed weapons, etc).\nNearly all instant attacks based upon weapon damage are affected by normalization; only a few are not. Druid feral attacks are not normalized, and are unaffected by weapon speed. Mages, warlocks, and priests have no instant melee or ranged abilities.\nTips.\nWith normalization, the weapon speed is now less influential on the total &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; of characters, although weapon speed still has a small influence because the base weapon damage of instant attacks is higher for slow weapons of same weapon dps. \nNowadays weapons with higher weapon dps are generally preferred over ones with lower weapon dps (regardless of weapon speed), although there are exceptions like &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Weapon\"&gt;Windfury Weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe normalization coefficients mean that a two-handed weapon will give the most damage from attack power, except when using an attack that can explicitly use two weapons. This means, for example, that a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; should always use a two-handed weapon, unless using the talent &lt;a href=\"Threat%20of%20Thassarian\"&gt;Threat of Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and a rotation built around it. (Even as a tank, the death knight will otherwise be unable to generate enough threat, since most threat comes from instant weapon-based attacks and is proportional to damage.)"}

Tonga then sends players to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Stagnant%20Oasis\"&gt;Stagnant Oasis&lt;/a&gt; before thanking them and continuing his research. While at these two oases, players can accept side quests which involve the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;s who have grown in power recently. These quests involve taking down Kolkar warriors and leaders before eventually taking out &lt;a href=\"Verog%20the%20Dervish\"&gt;Verog the Dervish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Verog%20the%20Dervish\"&gt;the quest of the same name&lt;/a&gt; and putting a large setback in the Centaur expansion.\nThe Fungal Spores line is started by the Fosaken &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Helbrim\"&gt;Apothecary Helbrim&lt;/a&gt; who is trying to create a new biological weapon using the life energy of the oases. He has players use the power of the oases to create explosive spores that he tries to send back to Undercity. However before he can, the research is taken to Orgrimmar and players are warned to stay away from the Undead.\nAfter spending some time in the zone and leveling up, another quest line opens up from &lt;a href=\"Thork\"&gt;Thork&lt;/a&gt; in Crossroads who sends players to &lt;a href=\"Regthar%20Deathgate\"&gt;Regthar Deathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Regthar is preparing to eliminate the Kolkar threat once and for all, starting by eliminating &lt;a href=\"Hezrul%20Bloodmark\"&gt;Hezrul Bloodmark&lt;/a&gt;. After this, the centaur are enraged and launch a full-scale attack on the Horde outpost in &lt;a href=\"Counterattack%21\"&gt;Counterattack!&lt;/a&gt; Players resist the attack and defeat &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Krom%27zar\"&gt;Warlord Krom'zar&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Kolkar, to end the Kolkar threat in the Northern Barrens once and for all.\nRatchet.\nThe Sergra Darkthorn and Fungal Spores quest lines both lead players to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; where more three short quest lines can be started.\nThe first quest chain is started by &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, who has players locate his lost treasure by speaking to the captured pirate &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Longshore\"&gt;Baron Longshore&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the treasure, Gazlowe sends the player to Nozzlepot's Outpost, up the river, to pay Nozzlepot for his help.\nThe second short quest line is also started by Gazlowe, who is annoyed at the constant interference of the Alliance in his city. He has players blow up the Alliance ships in his harbor to get them out.\nSide quest:\nThe final short quest line in Ratchet is started by &lt;a href=\"Wharfmaster%20Dizzywig\"&gt;Wharfmaster Dizzywig&lt;/a&gt; who is dealing with &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooter\"&gt;Southsea Freebooter&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt;. He supports &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Two-Tusk\"&gt;Tony Two-Tusk&lt;/a&gt; with weapons and money (with players' help of course) and in return, Tony takes out &lt;a href=\"Alicia%20Cuthbert\"&gt;Alicia Cuthbert&lt;/a&gt; and takes over the pirates himself. With Tony in charge, the attacks on Ratchet stop.\nSide quests:\nAnother quest available in Ratchet has players killing &lt;a href=\"King%20Reaperclaw\"&gt;King Reaperclaw&lt;/a&gt; for his horn.\n&lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Gotta%20be%20the%20Horn\"&gt;It's Gotta be the Horn&lt;/a&gt;\nNozzlepot's Outpost.\n&lt;a href=\"Nozzlepot%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;Nozzlepot's Outpost&lt;/a&gt; is the final questing location in the Northern Barrens. In the Outpost players help &lt;a href=\"Sputtervalve\"&gt;Sputtervalve&lt;/a&gt; steal a machine from the nearby Venture Co. camp known as the Samophlange. After retrieving it, the Goblins of the outpost work together to put it back together (with the help of the player) and it explodes triumphantly.\nA side quest in the Venture Co. camp has players steal a shredder to bring back to Nozzlepot's Outpost.\nA couple of sidequests are also given by &lt;a href=\"Nozzlepot\"&gt;Nozzlepot&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nAlso at Nozzlepot's Outpost, Sputtervalve gives players the option to take his new invention back to Crossroads. Needless to say, it goes badly and players end up near the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Pools\"&gt;Forgotten Pools&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Darsok%20Swiftdagger\"&gt;Darsok Swiftdagger&lt;/a&gt; is dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Witchwing%20Harpy\"&gt;Witchwing Harpies&lt;/a&gt;. He enlists players to help take down the Harpies and eventually their leader &lt;a href=\"Serena%20Bloodfeather\"&gt;Serena Bloodfeather&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, once the player deals with the harpies, they are directed back to Crossroads for one final questline that eventually leads to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;."}

While the Horde initially fought against the night elves, at great cost to both sides, eventually all three groups were willing to cooperate when faced with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the night elves joined the Alliance, and hostilities have broken out against the Horde once again. The Horde now inhabits much of central Kalimdor, and northern borderlands like &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; have turned into war &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s. Many night elves wonder how they ever could have worked with races that use &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-designed &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy the ancient trees, while others still remember the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic ways of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who fought side by side with them on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and seek to find a way to return peace to the land. While the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; scarred all of Kalimdor, it was the land surrounding the mighty Mount Hyjal where the most damage was done, and where the final battles were waged. While the combined efforts of the night elves, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a demonic taint remains on the land and many &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s have survives to continue their chaos. &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, where the massive &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s first scorched the land, remains almost entirely under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, a group of powerful &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and demons. &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; hides a massive army of demons powerful enough to besiege Mount Hyjal \u2014 but they seem to be waiting for something. The threat of another demon invasion is very real, and with the resources of the night elves taxed by the strife with the Horde, each passing day makes the warring lands more vulnerable.\nIn spite of all the brutal combat that has occurred in Kalimdor, the night elves are still dominant here and a wise and powerful priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, leads them. Still, even with such a well-respected leader, many night elves seek change \u2014 a return to their &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; and idyllic lifestyle, potentially at great cost. &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, was an attempt to recreate that past glory \u2014 and many fear that attempt has failed.

According to the map in \"\", this area straddles the boundary between both kingdoms and has a bay in it which should be the location of the port of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, this region must be the place where the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt; is born geographically.\nIn World of Warcraft.\n\"Northern Lordaeron\" has appeared in the maps since vanilla. But otherwise, it has never been referred to, apart from a small easter egg in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Gloves%20of%20Northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Gloves of Northern Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The whole region is found within the limits of the unfinished &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas/Eastern%20Kingdoms%20terrain\"&gt;Quel'thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and trying to reach it (which can only be done by unconventional means) will tell you that you are in \"Quel'thalas\" instead. This is because the borders of \"Northern Lordaeron\" are only drawn on the world map, and there is no other evidence in the game.\nAs seen in the \"\" documentary, the area of Northern Lordaeron was originally going to contain a raid zone called \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles%20%28original%29\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;\", designed for players at level 65 - 70.\nCurrently, the only areas of notice found within \"Northern Lordaeron\" are the uninstanced copy of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and some elven ruins on the coast.\nDue to the revamping of Azeroth to accommodate flying mounts in \"\", the area was textured and sparsely filled in with mountains and grass. It was expanded on the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm_map_comparison%23Continents_and_flights\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms map&lt;/a&gt;, but the actual area was unchanged. However, an invisible wall was placed all around the zone, so that was impossible to reach it in any way, flying included, unless terrain exploits were used.\nIn \"\", after your character has done the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the invisible walls disappear allowing you to travel freely the region, but otherwise, nothing has changed.\nSpeculation.\nHigh elves.\nThe architecture of the area (a tower, a dock, and a few other buildings) is based from &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; designs found in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and other areas, perhaps implying that the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; made use of it prior to founding their own culture in Quel'Thalas. It is important to note, however, that these buildings have been present since the game's initial release before Quel'Thalas even existed in-game, and are probably just a leftover.\nHuman lands.\nThis could be the land that &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; disguise used by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;) claimed to have originated from during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; as he was described as being from the north, a tiny domain deep in the mountains of Lordaeron.\nIt could also be the land of the \"northern vassals\" whom &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt;'s grandfather helped in their negotiations over their borders with the elves of Quel'Thalas."}

It was named for the region in the north of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe conflict was primarily a result of &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s decisions to leave the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, to isolate his kingdom from the world behind the Wall, and for abandoning his people and the refugees from Lordaeron to the undead of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rebellion occurred after the closing of the Wall and the use of &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to repel the Scourge, but before the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;. The civil war raged on between the \"Royals\" (those loyal to the king) and the \"Rebels\" (those loyal to Lord Crowley) and led to a massive loss of life among the Gilnean populace.\nIn addition to also damaging much of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, the Northgate Rebellion had the effect of sowing disunity in the kingdom. These divisions would eventually resurface and become relevant again with the second outbreak of the worgen curse and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, several years later.\nHistory.\nPrior to the Rebellion.\nTowards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; threatened to overwhelm &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, King of Gilneas, deployed forces against the orcs as part of his commitment to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Greymane, however, was an unapologetic critic of the Alliance's existence and began highly reluctant to be involved in the organization.\nShortly after the conclusion of the Second War and the defeat of the Horde, Greymane chafed at having Gilnean taxes pay for orc &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; and the construction of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In a discussion with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Vincent Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, Greymane questioned the wisdom of listening to the advice of Crowley and Godfrey in joining the Alliance, stating that it had gotten them nothing but dead Gilneans. In order to protect the kingdom from future threats but in reality to seal Gilneas off from the rest of the world, Greymane had come to the conclusion that the Alliance of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms were simply not worth the many Gilnean lives it had cost, and so decided on an isolationist response. Greymane then stated his plans to withdraw from the Alliance and wall off Gilneas from the rest of the world.\nUpon looking at the map of Gilneas, the King's decision to close Gilneas's borders and construct the great wall would cut through the lands of a newer, but still well-respected nobleman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, as the noble's lands had the mountains as a natural barrier the wall could be built into. Should the wall be finished, it would separate the towns of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Gilneas. Greymane agreed and was confident that Crowley would understand his reasoning. However, to complicate matters, this coupled with the fact that Crowley was a known supporter of the Alliance led to a build-up in tensions between the two sides.\nYears after, the departure of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; who stated that the humans' poor leadership had led to the burning of their forests during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, led to the departure of Gilneas and its military from the Alliance, and the beginnings of the construction of the Wall to split his kingdom off from the world.\nSoon, however, with the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; began to ravage the human lands north of Gilneas. In the midst of this region-wide crisis, tensions once more began to flare within the kingdom. As the epidemic in the north developed to become a fully-fledged &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; invasion, the Kingdom of Lordaeron requested aid from the reclusive Gilneans, only to be ignored. Before long, Gilneas found hordes of the undead encroaching on their lands, their number was small at first, but it increased over time and they did not flag. Fearing it would break, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; opened the gate and Gilnean soldiers poured from Gilneas into Silverpine Forest. The Scourge, however, defeated the soldiers and raised them into undeath.\nDesperate to find a solution, King Greymane enlisted the aid of the famous &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, who used his power to summon the lupine &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to combat the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. While the undead were repelled, it came at a great cost; the feral worgen creatures soon turned on the humans and spread their curse throughout the human population of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe refusal to send aid to the beleaguered Alliance, as well as the fact that Pyrewood and Ambermill had been caught in the crossfire of the undead and worgen, caused tensions in Gilneas to once more reach a boiling point.\nThe final straw.\nUnable to remain idle as his king went about what Crowley considered to be \"tyranny\", the nobleman sent a platoon of his own soldiers, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, to aid the Alliance, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, Genn had tried to reason with the noble, to make it clear that this wall was the way forward, and to explain why assisting the Alliance was so wrong. But Crowley refused, and insisted that he was doing what was best for the future of Gilneas, that he would end the King\u2019s \u201ctyranny\u201d. The king angrily confronted Crowley, accusing him of committing treason against Gilneas, while Crowley, unrepentant for his actions, started a rebellion against Greymane, gathering like-minded Gilneans including his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; in forming the Northgate rebellion. The resulting civil war weakened the kingdom and split the populace into two groups, \"royalist\" and \"rebel\".\nCivil war.\nThe Northgate Rebellion, so-called for the region in the north of Gilneas around the Greymane Wall, immediately began to gain support among disgruntled Gilneans and spread across the kingdom. Soon, fighting erupted across Gilneas, with the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebels\"&gt;Northgate rebels&lt;/a&gt;, led by Crowley, battling the Gilnean loyalists, led by Greymane.\nAs part of his bid to secure the capital, Crowley succeeded in getting cannons smuggled and hidden within Gilneas City, under the loyalists' noses. The final, deciding moment of the conflict occurred when Crowley's army marched upon the capital city, setting it ablaze with artillery fire. Much street fighting likely followed, but the rebels were ultimately unable to overcome Greymane resistance. Having broken upon the city's defenses, the Northgate Rebellion was defeated, with the majority of its leaders, including Crowley, captured and imprisoned for high treason.\nFollowing the coup's failure and Crowley's imprisonment, the remaining rebels went into hiding. Many rebel weapon stashes throughout the city of Gilneas remained largely undiscovered. When eventually uncovered, the weapon stashes were said to have been powerful enough to take out half of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20District\"&gt;Military District&lt;/a&gt;. The failure to take Gilneas City and Crowley's imprisonment effectively ended the Northgate Rebellion, as Gilneas returned once more to the unchallenged rule of King Greymane.\nAftermath.\nImmediately following the defeat of the rebellion, a period of relative peace ensued for Gilneas. Some time after, however, the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the kingdom and began terrorizing the forests of Gilneas. Fearful of causing panic following the end of the brutal civil war, and aware of the fragile state Gilneas had now found itself in, Greymane and several other nobles began discreetly hunting down and killing the wolf men.\nThe worgen numbers only continued to grow, however, and soon they began attacking Gilneas City itself. Countless worgen swarmed the city's districts and began to overwhelm its inhabitants. Unable to withstand the invasion alone, Darius Crowley and his Northgate Rebels were released from imprisonment on Greymane's orders and promptly aided in holding back the worgen masses.\nThe Gilnean people would go on to confront numerous other challenges, such as the worgen curse, &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;a Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and exile from their kingdom but the damage wrought by the Northgate Rebellion was largely healed by the pardoning of those involved and the unity in facing a common threat."}

Soon, the Northgate Rebels marched onto the city itself.\n&lt;a href=\"Ana%20Ramsey\"&gt;Ana Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; offered safe harbor to rebels in her house in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;. She later sent her own sons off to war, only to see them returned to her in pine boxes, which led her to commit suicide out of grief.\nAs part of his bid to secure the capital, Crowley succeeded in getting cannons smuggled into the cellar of the house of &lt;a href=\"Josiah%20Avery\"&gt;Josiah Avery&lt;/a&gt;, hidden within Gilneas City under the loyalists' noses. The final, deciding moment of the conflict occurred when Crowley's army marched upon the capital city, setting it ablaze with artillery fire. Much street fighting likely followed, but the rebels were ultimately unable to overcome Greymane resistance. Having broken upon the city's defenses, the rebels were defeated, with the majority of its leaders, including Crowley, imprisoned for high treason within &lt;a href=\"Stoneward%20Prison\"&gt;Stoneward Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the coup's failure and Crowley's imprisonment, the remaining rebels went into hiding. Many rebel weapon stashes throughout the city of Gilneas remained largely undiscovered. When eventually uncovered, the weapon stashes were said to have been powerful enough to take out half of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20District\"&gt;Military District&lt;/a&gt;. The failure to take Gilneas City and Crowley's imprisonment effectively ended the Northgate Rebellion, as Gilneas returned once more to the unchallenged rule of King Genn Greymane, but the kingdom was left in a weakened state.\nIn the years that followed, many gruesome murders were discovered across Gilneas, and the &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher&lt;/a&gt; was the name given to the culprits. Their primary victims were \"Greymane loyalists\", leaving many to believe that these murders were done by remnants of the Northgate rebels. In truth, these murders were done by the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; as an initiation right for &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; to turn them into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nShortly before the attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; by feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, King Greymane was thinking about granting Crowley amnesty, as together they would be able to beat the worgen and the Forsaken. However, he also feared that he and Darius wouldn't be able to put aside their differences.\nThe day of the attack, &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and a Gilnean &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; worked together to find Crowley's hidden arsenal, and let it at the disposal of the king and his men.\nDuring the evacuation of Gilneas, Greymane ordered Gilnean adventurers to release the rebels to fight the beasts. After Crowley gave his men a speech of a union, and made use of their hidden artillery stash, the Northgate rebels rejoined their Gilnean brethren to stand united against the tide, the two old friends mend their differences, ending any hope of the rebellion returning. In order to divert the worgen's attention from the fleeing citizens, Crowley led a group of rebels to stand against them at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were overwhelmed and &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;became worgen&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nFollowing the death of Alpha Prime, and the start of the Forsaken invasion, King Greymane decided to stop concealing his infection and let his people know that he too was afflicted by the curse. Now united, rebels and loyalists, humans and sane worgen, accepted him and rallied when he called for a &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;counterattack&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her armies.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Crowley formed the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, mostly composed of &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; soldiers (both rebels and loyalists) who chose to remain behind after the evacuation of most of Gilneas's citizenry. They were a key factor in reclaiming the mainland of Gilneas from the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allies."}

It is one of the most infamous locations in all of Azeroth. As with the other continents, it was once part of the original &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; landmass that was broken apart during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The area was the birthplace of numerous would-be empires, though not all managed to survive to the modern day, and even fewer in the forms they originally took.\nForemost among all other civilizations were that of the titanic watchers and their servants. The massive titan city of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; laid within the region that would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over by several &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s chosen by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s themselves. These &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, as they would come to be known as, were led by one known as &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, who took command of the titan-forged armies against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. He was imbued with the powers of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; and together with &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, he battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;. They ultimately devised and succeeded in the final plan to bring down &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. For his leadership, determination and courage, he was granted the title of Prime Designate, leader of the titan-forged on Azeroth, and was tasked with watching Yogg-Saron's prison and maintaining the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. Under these watchers were other titan-forged and their nascent civilizations, the mighty &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, who tunneled within the deep places of the earth. The &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, who served as defenders of the various titan-forged locations. The &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, who managed and constructed the great wonders of the titanic civilizations. The &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; who acted as watchers and servitors of the keepers. And the &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s, who were given tasks ranging from battle to craftsmanship.\nWhen the other Keepers decided to ask the Pantheon to empower the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; for their heroism against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn was vehemently against it, stating that only titan-forged could be trusted to defend Azeroth. The Aspects were empowered despite his objections, and so Odyn took a section of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and raised it into the sky, creating the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so relinquished his position of Prime Designate.\nThe keeper &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; had discovered &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; and, attempting to determinate its properties, he experimented on various races. He found that the ore was extremely potent and that it increased the intellect of his subjects. One of these subjects was a small primitive life race that roamed around the forests near &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. By consuming kaja'mite, they were transformed into a new, highly intelligent race known as the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLoken's betrayal.\nOne of the mighty keepers and son of Odyn, Loken, had an affair with &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of his brother &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, from his prison within Ulduar, muddled Loken's thoughts and made him lash out at Sif, scared at the thought of losing her, and he killed her by accident. Horrified at what he had done but too scared to tell Thorim the truth, Loken tricked Thorim into believing that it had been the work of &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, turning Thorim against his allies. Loken would stop the war between Thorim's and Arngrim's forces with an army he had created with the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, but unknown to Loken Yogg-Saron had planted the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt; inside the forge, which would slowly convert titan-forged into flesh and could also spread to those forged before the curse was created.\nAfter Thorim retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in despair, Loken was desperate to cover his actions, even if it meant using Yogg-Saron's power to do so, for if &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; or the Pantheon ever found out his life would be forfeit. He arranged the death of &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, making it look like a lab accident, though Mimiron's &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; followers would create a new mechagnome body to house the Keeper's soul. Loken subdued &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting them into complacency with &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. He convinced the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to imprison Odyn, the Prime Designate, within his &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the title of Prime Designate that Odyn had abandoned in the process. Loken expected &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; to come up from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;the south&lt;/a&gt; and investigate what was going on, but Ra never arrived. This is because he had discovered that the Pantheon was dead, killed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and had locked himself up in the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; in despair. Afterward, Loken exiled all titan-forged from Ulduar and retreated into the depths of the complex.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; subdued most of the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s and banished the titan-forged from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt; sought to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. They armed the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; vrykul to attack other titan-forged across the Storm Peaks, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;. They caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; when they attacked the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. Tyr asked the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s for aid, and the war ended with &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; putting the Winterskorn into a timeless sleep beneath northern Kalimdor.\nTyr and his allies Keeper &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and Watcher &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; gathered great numbers of titan-forged who dwelled around Ulduar and whom they saw as innocent victims of Loken's treachery. A large group of peaceful vrykul afflicted by the curse of flesh, most of the surviving earthen, and many of the mechagnomes agreed to flee with them, spiriting away the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from falling into Loken's hands. They traveled for weeks until they reached what would one day become known as the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that Tyr sacrificed himself fighting off the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, who had been sent by the corrupted Loken to retrieve the Discs. In a mighty battle, Tyr unleashed a massive explosion of energy that killed him and the Corruptor, though Kith'ix managed to escape, albeit heavily wounded. This was done in order to allow the rest of the titan-forged to flee further south with the discs and to survive. The vrykul were so moved by the keeper's deeds that they decided to settle at the battle site and stand vigil over his grave until the end of days, forming the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchaedas, Ironaya and the earthen and mechagnomes continued south until they reached the easternmost titan-forged vault on Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. The keeper and the giantess expanded the site, carving out new chambers, and as years passed, some of the earthen exhibited signs of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing that the effects would only worsen, they asked to be placed in hibernation until a cure could one day be found. Archaedas agreed, promising to rouse them at some time in the future. He sealed his followers within the vast subterranean vaults. The mechagnomes, however, remained awake. Even though they knew the curse would one day overtake them as well, they heroically vowed to watch over the facility and maintain its wondrous machineries. A small number of the earthen had chosen not to be placed in stasis as well, deciding that they would watch over and maintain the facility alongside their mechagnomes companions.\nPre-Sundering.\nFollowing his defeat at the hands of Tyr, Kith'ix laid dormant under the ground and healing in the area that would eventually become &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Awakened by mystics of the trolls who incorrectly believed Kith'ix to be one of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; that they worshipped; a massive world-spanning war began between the trolls and Kith'ix's servants known as the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to stop these foes, the trolls struck out against their insectoid enemies. The first to rush into battle was the tribe known as the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt;, heading into the frozen wastes. There, they found the corrupted tol'vir watchers had reinforced the Aqir's ranks, brought over from the city of Ulduar which laid in Loken's hands. These tol'vir, known as &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, wreaked havoc on the Drakkari lines; though with ingenuity and cunning they discovered methods of toppling their stone wrought foes. In the conflict that would follow, the tribes united into the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, from which the Drakkari ruled in the north. The trolls ultimately succeeded in their venture against the Aqir, causing the insectoid race to splinter, and the Drakkari laid the seeds that would eventually evolve into the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Empire\"&gt;Drakkari Empire&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring these times, creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; would eventually migrate north, searching for a new home away from the wars of the south against the renegade titan-forged followers of Ra known as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Their proximity to the titan-forged facilities would cause them to eventually evolve into creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; had also managed to settle in this area, forming a city known as &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; within the forest of &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Moonsong&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith the disappearance of Winterskorn clan, the remaining iron vrykul clans continued to dominate the north, fighting a local race of bear-men known as the &lt;a href=\"jalgar\"&gt;jalgar&lt;/a&gt;. The Curse of Flesh ran rampant through the clans, turning their iron skin soft and into flesh, causing the clans to look for solutions for this issue.\nOne clan, in particular, struggled against the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. After exhausting all natural attempts, the tribe sought the aid of its priestesses. These women plumbed the world of spirits for answers, but they found the malevolent Helya, lying in wait. Their ritual went horribly wrong, as Helya further corrupted those that sought freedom from their curse. These eternally vengeful beings would swell the ranks of Helya's &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the other hand, a powerful clan, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer clan&lt;/a&gt;, arose. Becoming weaker because of the curse, they balanced their diminishing strength by taming &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Oktel%20Dragonblood\"&gt;Oktel Dragonblood&lt;/a&gt; was among one of the first to ride these dragons. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt;, they didn't see them as mere beasts of war. They used the dragons as hunting companions and rode them during the battle. Over time, the proto-dragons became an inseparable part of the clan's culture and powerful allies against their mortal enemy, the jalgar, driving a large swath of their race south where they would evolve into the &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPost-Sundering.\nAfter the sundering, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; had seen the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; crystallizing creatures and drawing &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; out of them. Desperate for a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and stole artifacts of the flight, earning the dragons' ire. When the dragons confronted them in the forest the elves attempted to crystallize part of the area and draw magic from the crystals to fight the dragons off, but the spell was much more powerful than anticipated and transformed the entire region as well as twisting the elves' spirits. All that remains now of them are ghosts, the &lt;a href=\"crystal%20satyr\"&gt;crystal satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"crystal%20dryad\"&gt;crystal dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and the ruins of their proud civilization.\nBy the time of the Sundering, the iron vrykul had fully succumbed to the Curse of Flesh. Under &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, the curse caused vrykul children to be born in a disfigured state, which was considered \"weak and ugly\" by vrykul standards. These infants were dubbed \"aberrations\" and \"runts\", and vrykul society was deeply divided on how to deal with them. Some vrykul were disgusted by these \"aberrations\" and beseeched their ruler, Ymiron, to have them all killed, citing a need to keep the vrykul race pure; others pleaded with him to show them mercy, protesting that despite their weakness, these infants were still their children. Ymiron meditated on the issue for some time before reaching a dangerous conclusion: that because the titans had not come to aid them in their hour of need, and because the vrykul knew of no other beings with power on the same level as their gods, the curse must have been created by the titans. Although this was not the case, the vrykul believed it, and at Ymiron's bidding they forsook their gods and titan worship was outlawed. Ymiron then took the side of those calling for the death of their malformed infants, and decreed that all parents with so-afflicted children must kill their young or be taken to &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt; for execution.\nHowever, not all vrykul could bear to kill their own flesh and blood. Despite their king's harsh decree, they sheltered their children and took them away to a land far away from Northrend, the modern &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. They had heard stories of the vrykul clan that had followed Tyr and had settled in that area and decided it was a safe haven for their children. There they nursed and raised their children in secret, and taught them the stories and values of ancient vrykul society as well as the ways of foraging, masonry, smithing, and warfare. Finally, with heavy hearts, they left them in the care of the vrykul that inhabited Tirisfal, before returning to Northrend. These outcast vrykul \"runts\" would later form their own cultures and kingdoms, and became known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. It is unclear what happened to all of those parents who did not kill their children, but many if not most of them would come to no good end; a vicious vrykul warrior, Skadi, relentlessly hunted them down and killed any of them he came across. For this, he was judged to have committed a true act of depravity and was thereafter known as &lt;a href=\"Skadi%20the%20Ruthless\"&gt;Skadi the Ruthless&lt;/a&gt;. In an effort to stave off the curse of flesh, the Dragonflayers went to sleep beneath &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in facilities such as &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, a record of false history created by Loken, erroneously claims that he ordered this hibernation. The vrykul left their homes, villages, and keeps vacant as they slept. There they would remain undisturbed for thousands of years, even by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, many vrykul groups took the seas and left Northrend. Some of them settled on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. At an unknown point, humanity would eventually return to their birth place. Colonies were made on the continent, in areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, even forming &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Fields\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them became &lt;a href=\"trapper\"&gt;trapper&lt;/a&gt;s, distinct and self-reliant.\nRemnants of the aqir had survived the near destruction of the world and their ancient war with the trolls, having burrowed underground. After thousands of years of evolution, the aqir became the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s: a sinister, shadowy race of spider-men. They cast off their overlords, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, becoming their own people that built a subterranean empire that spanned the continent, &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthrend also contained the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;: an enormous ice plain covered with the bones of thousands of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. As they near death, the great beasts flew to Northrend so that they may die with their ancestors. The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, watched over the Dragonblight to ensure that the remains are undisturbed. The blue dragons were successful in their task for many thousands of years, until the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\n500 years ago, &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; reached Northrend. The &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; found her, and she learned their ways.\nSome &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; reached the continent during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, eventually dying frozen in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe coming of the Lich King.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; was captured and tortured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, the demonlord transformed the ancient &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; into a dark being of immense power. Now called the Lich King, Ner'zhul was imprisoned within a block of ice and cast back into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Ner'zhul's prison landed at the base of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, by far the largest glacier in Azeroth. From this secret location, the Lich King used his telepathic powers to enslave many of the native life forms, including ice trolls and &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt;. With these servants, Ner'zhul created a small army for himself. The nerubians, aware of the Lich King's threat to themselves and the world at large, launched an attack on Ner'zhul's forces. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nerubians were eventually defeated by the Lich King's endless supply of undead warriors and aid from the Legion's nathrezim. Most of the nerubians were slain and reanimated as soldiers in the Undead army, while those who remained alive continued a guerrilla war against the lord of the dead. Satisfied that Northrend was his, Ner'zhul began consolidating his forces for the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, the Scourge stole many sets of remains from the Dragonblight, which were then reborn as lethal &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEventually, the Dalaran mage &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; heard the call of the Lich King and traveled to Northrend in order to meet his new master, becoming his first &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; after long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands. The Lich King eventually tested his &lt;a href=\"Plague\"&gt;Plague&lt;/a&gt; upon some of the humans of Northrend, killing them and turning them into the undead; proving the effectiveness of his disease.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Northrend had seen the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who had followed the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; to the cold north in an attempt to stop the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.During the Third War, a small band of &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Northrend. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt;, embittered by the trials they had to suffer through, they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty, and they accepted to become &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to his service. Overtime, rumor reached the south, where it was said that Northrend was lost and their cities destroyed.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the northern continent was targeted by an attempted destruction from &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The renegade &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in order to weave a spell intended to rend the continent apart and split it asunder. The goal of the spell was to melt the polar ice caps, to make Icecrown vulnerable, and to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; but the attempt failed. Illidan's &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; forces later attacked the continent to destroy the Lich King, as tremors still shook the continent. However, this invasion was thwarted by Arthas and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, and Ner'zhul successfully merged with his champion to free the Lich King from the Frozen Throne.\nWhile the mortals fought on the surface of Northrend, they ignored that Illidan's quakes and tremors had awakened &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20one\"&gt;horrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Third War.\nThe Lich King now holds complete domination over Northrend, and the living dare not tread on the frozen continent\u2014especially after a disastrous invasion attempt of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; which ended in the expeditionary force being decimated. Even though the Crusaders reached as far as Icecrown Glacier, the heavy losses suffered from this defeat marked an end to the counteroffensive and forced the Crusade into a defensive stance, consolidating their powers in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Scattered remains of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet are likely to be found amongst the Frozen Coast, the skeletal shipwrecks a warning to any vessel navigating too close to the shores of Northrend. \n&lt;a href=\"Invar%20One-Arm\"&gt;Invar One-Arm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orman%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Orman of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; were also lost by the Crusade there.\nGetting to Northrend.\n&lt;a href=\"Boats\"&gt;Ships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelins&lt;/a&gt; departing from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; provide access to Northrend from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeppelins.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20travel%20guide\"&gt;Cataclysm travel guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the ship and zeppelin routes to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and maps of intercontinental mass transit routes.\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.\nNorthrend is the setting of .\nIn terms of size, the Northrend expansion is similar in scope to the \"Burning Crusade\" expansion: Northrend has been shown to contain ten zone-like areas, compared with the seven zones of Outland plus four zones of draenei and blood elf starting areas featured in \"Burning Crusade\".\nAs for the sizes of the zones themselves, a few (especially the Borean Tundra and Dragonblight) are huge, making them similar to the larger-than-average zones in Outland. At the same time, however, Northrend also include a few rather small zones (namely Sholazar Basin and Wintergrasp). Northrend is bigger than &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; by a couple of zones, and some of the zones themselves are larger than Outland's largest zones.\nUnlike Outland, there is no minimum-level requirement to enter Northrend.\nWorld of Warcraft: Cataclysm.\nQuestions have been raised about the continuity of the Wrath of the Lich King storyline following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and blue-poster &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt; has addressed this issue:\nYou have to consider the changes with some form of leniency, while technically you could say that if the story progresses then we need to remove a bunch of the content from Outland and Northrend as those are over - but for numerous reasons, you can probably see why that would be a bad idea. This is the same type of thing that happens by just having a persistent world, just because one quest was completed where something was killed doesn't mean it vanishes from your sight forever.\nWhile a level 80 doesn't need to return to the locations of Outland and Northrend and can focus on the new stories - a new character hasn't helped defeat the villains in those areas so they still need to answer the call and fight them off (or in the terms people are tossing around, they need to level). &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19820526504%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D2%2326\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nA day before the launch of Cataclysm during an interview, a Blizzard Employee stated changing &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and Northrend in a future patch.\nWorld of Warcraft: Legion.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.3.5\"&gt;Patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt;, level scaling was implemented in Northrend, with its entry level requirement lowered to 58 (originally 68)."}

These bosses individually are &lt;a href=\"Gormok%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Gormok the Impaler&lt;/a&gt; (a magnataur), &lt;a href=\"Acidmaw\"&gt;Acidmaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreadscale\"&gt;Dreadscale&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Acidmaw%20and%20Dreadscale\"&gt;pair of jormungar&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Icehowl\"&gt;Icehowl&lt;/a&gt; (a yeti).\nStrategy: Normal mode.\nThe Northrend Beasts is a three phase boss fight. First comes &lt;a href=\"Gormok%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Gormok the Impaler&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Acidmaw\"&gt;Acidmaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreadscale\"&gt;Dreadscale&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, and finally &lt;a href=\"Icehowl\"&gt;Icehowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase 1: Gormok.\nPhase 1 is &lt;a href=\"Tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;Tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; with a few refinements:\nTanks taunt the boss off each other when their Impale debuff has expired. With two tanks, this normally results in a taunt at 3 stacks, three tanks can keep themselves at 2 stacks. It's possible to heal through 8 stacks or more, but a high Impale stack makes the start of Phase 2 very difficult. With careful management of timing, it is easily possible for two tanks to keep themselves at 2 stacks. Taunt off after the second Impale on the other tank, when your debuff should have 8 seconds left. As the cooldown on Impale is 10 seconds, this keeps the stacks on both tanks from going over 2 stacks. This is essential for Hard-Mode 10man, where there is only 2 tanks, and the damage is increased greatly.\n\"Don't stand in the fire!\" All ranged classes must avoid the fire patches. They are rather short range AoE, but deal substantial damage. They randomly spawn on players, and rather quickly too. This means that while moving away from one's own fire, it's possible to enter somebody else's. To avoid this, ranged should spread out in a semi-circle, and move outward when they get fire.\n\"Kill snobolds!\" Gormok throws Snobold Vassals onto random players (even on tanks). Snobolds don't deal a lot of damage, but they regularly interrupt and/or stun their targets, which is particularly dangerous on healers. Ranged (if not all DPS) should kill Snobolds quick, relieving healers first. A common mistake that players new to the instance make is not killing snobolds under the assumption that a tank is supposed to pull it off of them and tank it.\nGormok's damage can be greatly reduced by disarming him in normal mode.\nPhase 2: Acidmaw and Dreadscale.\nThe key mechanic in this phase is interaction between Burning Bile and Paralytic Toxin.\nBoth worms can be tanked normally. They apply their special attack depending on their state, that is the mobile worm applies it only to its tank, while the stationary worm puts it on a random group of players (AoE). The mobile worm also spawns poison circles around itself (similar to &lt;a href=\"Grobbulus\"&gt;Grobbulus&lt;/a&gt;), thus must be moved.\nInitially, Dreadscale is mobile and Acidmaw stationary. This means that random raid members get Paralytic Toxin, and they must run towards the Dreadscale tank to get rid of it. After the first burrow, only the Acidmaw tank gets Toxin, but he must get close to the random raid member who has Burning Bile. Usually it's better if one of the players affected by Burning Bile runs to the Acidmaw tank, not vice versa.\nPositioning is important. No players except the tank should ever stand in front of one of the worms. The distance between players should be as large as possible, so that fewer raid members get Paralytic Toxin at once (it's an AoE centered on one player with 10 yard radius). At the same time, players can't be more than half the room away from the Dreadscale tank, else the toxin freezes them before they reach the tank.\nNormally, Acidmaw is killed first, to get rid of Paralytic Toxin, even though after one worm dies, the other enrages for at least 50% extra damage (10 and 25 player normal).\nHunters should &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Mark\"&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt; both snakes when they burrow so they are easily followed underground.\nPhase 3: Icehowl.\nAside from &lt;a href=\"Icehowl\"&gt;Icehowl&lt;/a&gt;'s melee range knockback and periodic tank stun, the main mechanic of this phase is the Massive Crash and Ferocious Butt charge:\nAvoiding the charge is critical. Other than that, healers need only watch out for the Arctic Breath freezing cone attack, which can be broken altogether if the main target breaks the stun using &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;, a PvP trinket, or immunities like &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Melee should stand at maximum range to avoid his periodic melee knockback ability. This keeps them doing DPS instead of running back from a knockback.\nStrategy: Heroic mode.\nLike normal mode, this is a three-phase encounter. However, the three phases are now on a timer and do not wait for the raid to kill the previous phase's boss. These timers are quite tightly tuned (2-3 min each). This makes the fight a major DPS race and you may have bosses overlap for a short time. It helps to have enough tanks to handle two phases simultaneously, at least for a brief period. \nPhase 1: Gormok the Impaler.\nThe principles of the fight remain the same, but all his abilities hit harder. The tanks take more damage, and Impale ticks for much higher amounts. Tanks should limit themselves to 3 stacks in 10 player, and 2 stacks in 25.\nThe Fire Bombs thrown at the ranged now stack a 20-second DoT, 2-3 stacks of which will prove fatal. Ranged must react much faster to fires.\nIn normal mode, Snobold Vassals are only really dangerous when hindering a healer. In heroic mode, they are a significant hazard when they hit a damage dealer because they cut down on the victim's DPS in a very tightly tuned encounter. All DPS in the raid should prioritize snobolds and burn them down as fast as possible. Ranged players with a snobold on them must immediately run to the melee. This positioning has two main benefits: melee can help kill the snobold, and it guarantees the player is within range for everyone.\nGormok throws a total of four snobolds. After the fourth, Fire Bombs stop too. At this time, everyone should blow their pots and cooldowns to kill him quickly, because Phase Two is about to begin. Gormok should be at 10% or less when the NPC announces the arrival of Acidmaw and Dreadscale: \"Steel yourselves, heroes, for the twin terrors Acidmaw and Dreadscale. Enter the arena!\"\nPhase 2: Acidmaw and Dreadscale.\nThere are no changes to the mechanics of &lt;a href=\"Acidmaw%20and%20Dreadscale\"&gt;Acidmaw and Dreadscale&lt;/a&gt;. As at least one tank is still affected by an Impale stack, it is useful to have Acidmaw picked up by a ranged tank such as a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Paladin's can also use &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt; on the tank with the Impale stacks to remove them. The tank with HoP should remember to take off buff before tanking, or else they won't be able to attack or gain threat. It's also a good idea to blow &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; right at the start to get Acidmaw down as fast as possible.\nPositioning is even more important in Heroic mode. The whole raid must be spread at least 10 yards from each other to avoid having more than one person hit by Acidmaw's Paralytic Toxin - the raid can't afford to have 3 or 4 people stop DPS and run across the room to remove it. Alternatively, two tanks can take turns on Dreadscale. As soon as the first one gets Burning Bile, the second one taunts so that Tank 1 is free to run around and clear toxin from affected players.\nOnce Acidmaw dies, Dreadscale enrages. It's a good idea to save some cooldowns for this part of the fight. If Dreadscale burrows just as Acidmaw goes down, he does not enrage. Dreadscale should be at most at 20% when Icehowl enters.\nPhase 3: Icehowl.\nAgain, positioning is more important than in normal. Initially, Icehowl should stand in the center of the room, ranged spread evenly in a circle. (If there are any poison clouds left from Phase Two, everyone must make sure not have their back towards them, so they don't end up knocked back into one during a Whirl or Massive Crash.) Among other benefits, spreading out reduces the number of players affected by Arctic Breath. It helps a lot to have a Retribution Paladin with 2/2 &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Purpose\"&gt;Divine Purpose&lt;/a&gt; who uses the following macro:\nThis breaks Arctic Breath on the initial target, and thus everyone else affected is freed too. Next, healers must quickly top everyone off before Massive Crash, as it now hits for around 18k HP and can easily kill players who are not at maximum health.\nWhirl is easily avoided by standing at maximum melee range. All melee DPS should attempt to stand at maximum range to avoid Whirl and be able to keep doing DPS to the boss. If that is not possible, stand with your back to the nearest wall, to minimize the knockback.\nWhen the stun breaks, players no longer receive a speed buff to avoid Icehowl's charge. Moving sideways (strafing) is a very good method to avoid it, but keep an eye out for nearby columns. Speed enchants (&lt;a href=\"Tuskarr%27s%20Vitality\"&gt;Tuskarr's Vitality&lt;/a&gt;) or abilities like &lt;a href=\"Pursuit%20of%20Justice%20%28paladin%20talent%29\"&gt;Pursuit of Justice (paladin talent)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Swiftness\"&gt;Feral Swiftness&lt;/a&gt; etc. can help too. The enrage after Icehowl hits a player can be removed as in normal mode, so a hit in and of itself won't cause a wipe. However, the loss of DPS due to missing a stun phase can cause you to wipe to the enrage timer.\nWhen the enrage timer expires, the next Massive Crash one-shots everyone affected by it. However, it can be survived by &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; or Paladin Bubble. If Icehowl is nearly dead, mages and paladins should Ice Block or Bubble through the initial crash, get out of his way if targeted by a charge, and try to nuke him down before the stun wears off.\nLoot.\nAs with the other bosses in the instances, there are separate versions of each item for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; raids and for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raids.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is unusual in that it is a boss encounter in difficulty and in loot, but does not involve fighting a boss per se. Rather, you must only survive and protect Brann from the waves. Nevertheless, many people would find this encounter more difficult than the other three boss fights of this instance! Successfully completing this event grants access to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Chest\"&gt;Tribunal Chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tribunal of Ages is a false system created by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; to cover up the crimes he had committed and is not an accurate record of historical fact.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Abedneum\"&gt;Abedneum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaddrak\"&gt;Kaddrak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marnak\"&gt;Marnak&lt;/a&gt; make up the Tribunal of Ages, librarians for the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; discs that contain the ancient histories of Azeroth. The immobile constructs do not give up the titans' secrets easily, but adventurers such as the intrepid &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believe the reward is worth the risk.\"\nAbilities.\nThe Tribunal.\nThe Tribunal security measures attempt to stop Brann Bronzebeard and players from accessing the archives of the ages.\nThe Encounter.\nTo begin the escorting event, talk to to start &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Halls of Stone (quest)&lt;/a&gt; quest. Escort him through the room with three stone golems. The real fight encounter takes place in a circular room (called the Tribunal of Ages, hence the article title) at the end of &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt; wing of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Brann will stop and allow you to rest after clearing this trash, talk to him again to begin the encounter. There are three large faces surrounding your party in the room. If you are facing the exit, they are (clockwise) &lt;a href=\"Kaddrak\"&gt;Kaddrak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abedneum\"&gt;Abedneum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marnak\"&gt;Marnak&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after Brann enters the room (~20 seconds after talking to him), Kaddrak, the face directly to the right of the entrance, will activate. This face will shoot Glare of the Tribunal, a bolt that deals roughly 500 Arcane damage to a random party member every ~3 sec for the remainder of the fight. Waves of groups will start to appear. The first waves come slowly, with each group appearing roughly 45 seconds after the last. Groups consist of three elites, two melee (&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune%20Protector\"&gt;Dark Rune Protector&lt;/a&gt;) and one caster (&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune%20Stormcaller\"&gt;Dark Rune Stormcaller&lt;/a&gt;) (3 melee on heroic). Mobs will go directly to Brann, if not picked up. Brann doesn't have so much health, so they must be tanked. \nAfter several waves (~75 seconds after Kaddrak activates), Brann will yell and the face to the left of the entrance, Marnak, will activate. This face fires a shadowy orb, Dark Matter, at the ground where one person is standing (similar to &lt;a href=\"Void%20Reaver\"&gt;Void Reaver&lt;/a&gt; and his orbs). Any player hit by this will be afflicted by a debuff which increases damage taken by 50% on normal and 100% on heroic for a short time. Waves will begin coming faster now, about every 30 seconds, and two non-elite casters are added to every second wave.\nAfter several more waves (~100 seconds after Marnak activates), Brann will yell once again, and the final face opposite of the entrance, Abedneum, will activate. The third face fires a channeled beam, Searing Gaze, at a location on the floor that deals 500 damage per second to anyone within 10 yards of it. On heroic, the damage is about 2000 per second, coupled with the damage debuff from the second face the beam can reduce your health at an astonishing rate. The damage will be ramping up at this point, so avoiding beams by moving out of them is paramount. Mobs will be coming at an increasing pace, ramping up to roughly every 15 seconds by the end of the event. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem%20Custodian\"&gt;Iron Golem Custodian&lt;/a&gt; will be added into the waves also. At this point, killing the mobs is not a priority so much as survival \u2014 proper use of CC and various AoE stuns (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Shadowfury\"&gt;Shadowfury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungering%20Cold\"&gt;Hungering Cold&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) can save lives. Survive for another ~90 seconds and Brann will yell last time, causing faces to turn on mobs, destroying them quickly. A &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Chest\"&gt;Tribunal Chest&lt;/a&gt; containing the event's loot will then appear against the wall to the right of the console. The entire event lasts approximately 5 minutes from when Brann is talked to to when the chest appears.\nStrategy.\nPositioning.\nThe positioning of the group can make a big difference in this fight. There are generally two strategies:\nOn the Stair.\nWith a skilled and geared AoE tank (paladin or death knight), this method can reduce damage taken from the beam and bolt. Have the whole group stand on the stair, with the tank in the front. The tank needs to grab the aggro of all incoming mobs. DPS then AoE down the mobs quickly. Note that sometimes the beam can still hit people standing on the stair, so everyone still needs to stay alert. NOTE: this technique is not reliable on heroic.\nIn the Room.\nIf the tank has difficulty AoE tanking, the group may find this method easier. The tank stands close to the bottom of the stair. Other group members scatter in the room. This way the tank will have more time to get the aggro of incoming mobs. DPS should try to focus fire on tank's target to avoid drawing aggro. With this method the group can handle the mobs much more easily. However, everyone will need to move away from the beam and bolt constantly.\nTips for Damage Dealers.\nFor groups with very good DPS and AoE, it is possible to burn down most of the mobs so that the tank only needs to take care of a few mobs throughout the fight. \nFor groups with lower DPS, it is still possible to clear the first few waves before the next waves emerge. However, as new mobs emerge faster and faster, more and more mobs will remain when the next waves come. This does not mean low DPS cannot handle this encounter. At the later part of the encounter, the tank should try to hold aggro of as many mobs as he/she can. Healers should focus on healing the tank. At this point, the DPS should use all the available crowd control and snaring abilities to CC/kite any free mobs. (Hunters' &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt; and shamans' &lt;a href=\"Earthbind%20Totem\"&gt;Earthbind Totem&lt;/a&gt; are very helpful here!) As long as the group can keep the mobs tanked/CC'ed/kited, Brann will be unharmed and the defense system of the room will kill all the mobs at the end.\nTips for Tanks.\nThis fight can be a real nuisance. Your first priority is to pick up every add, after that you can start building aggro. By the end the adds are coming really fast so try to keep up, and don't let any get through your defenses! For paladins in particular, its not possible to build mana fast here, and if you have no mana between waves you are going to be unable to pick up mobs. No mobs hitting you means no mana. No mana means you wipe. If you ever hit a no mana situation do whatever you can, blow potions, divine plea, tell your dps to not attack while you hit them with your weapon manually for a second. Keep in mind, if you have to do the last thing the waves won't let you dick around, once you have aggro the mobs you have on you have to die faster than usual, otherwise you're going to have 50 guys on you in a minute or two."}

Like the gnomish &lt;a href=\"mechanostrider\"&gt;mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;s, the trike is mechanical by nature. Trikes can be purchased from in the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Slums\"&gt;Goblin Slums&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWith the Bilgewater goblins now in the trenches with the bigger brutes of the Horde, a significant number of trampling deaths have been reported. Normally unconcerned with such matters, &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; was alarmed to learn that Garrosh\u2019s Forsaken accountants refused to pay soldier death benefits if the soldiers never got to the actual battle, and accidental stomps caused by tauren maneuvers made it extremely difficult to calculate how many goblins had made it to the battlefield before they were rendered flat. Gallywix offered a substantial cash reward for an invention that could both lift goblins out of hoof traffic and speed them along at comparable velocities so that goblin soldiers could die in \u201ca calculate-able and reimbursable fashion.\u201d\nHundreds of submissions were made. Most exploded upon delivery. In the end, the clear (and relatively undamaged) winner was the sturdy transport trike created by the remarkably aged &lt;a href=\"Jibidiah%20Gragglefutz\"&gt;Jibidiah \u201cNo Fingers\u201d Gragglefutz&lt;/a&gt;. Gragglefutz had been a street-side grenade salesman for decades, and years of product-related mishaps had borne fruit in this speedy, durable, and mostly unexplodable vehicle. Jibidiah gained some renown for his creation, and he now claims that Gallywix has him hard at work on a speedier \u201cturbo\u201d version of the trike. Jibidiah\u2019s one complaint is that the substantial cash reward for designing the trike has been stuck in a particularly insidious mess of red tape and mail delivery issues. The trade prince apologizes for this and promises to put his top goblins on it immediately.\nHowever, goblin trikes existed on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, before the goblins joined the Horde.\nMounts.\nThe normal mount is learned from &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Trike%20Key\"&gt;Goblin Trike Key&lt;/a&gt; while the epic is learned from &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Turbo-Trike%20Key\"&gt;Goblin Turbo-Trike Key&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the location of the past battle between the followers of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Khazaduum\"&gt;Echo of Khazaduum&lt;/a&gt; is encountered here.\nHistory.\nMillennia ago, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; received a vision of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; would doom the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; and transform them into &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities, and so Velen had to gather his followers to the highest mountain in the land on the longest day of the year. The prophet managed to gather only hundreds &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;for exile&lt;/a&gt;. Not all were sincere in their commitment to Velen, however, and his old friend &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; betrayed them. Thousands of man'ari discreetly surrounded the place until they were seen, and then a battle erupted. Velen's followers activated the multiple &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Pylon\"&gt;defensive crystals&lt;/a&gt; around the arena to shield the fleeing &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus%20%28Eredath%29\"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt;, wile &lt;a href=\"Stalwart%20Echo\"&gt;stalwart&lt;/a&gt; defenders fought for their unarmed brethren.\nThe battle eventually turned in favor of Kil'jaeden when his servant &lt;a href=\"Khazaduum\"&gt;Khazaduum&lt;/a&gt;, first of &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20brute\"&gt;his kind&lt;/a&gt;, shattered the &lt;a href=\"Argunite%20Matrix\"&gt;Argunite Matrix&lt;/a&gt; protecting and powering the area. All seemed lost for Velen's loyalists, with Talgath going for the kill. &lt;a href=\"Hatuun\"&gt;Hatuun&lt;/a&gt; and his men sacrificed themselves to slow down the man'ari's advance, until the prophet called for help from the naaru &lt;a href=\"Ku%27re\"&gt;Ku're&lt;/a&gt;. The Ata'mal crystal then shattered into seven shards, shielding the remaining exiles and signaling the arrival of the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". As Velen's followers flew upward to the ship, the naaru &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; stayed behind to hold the way open for them.\nCurrently, the area is teeming with ghosts from that fateful day. After the arrival of the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" and the activation of its &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Pylon\"&gt;defenses&lt;/a&gt;, Triumvirate's End becomes the location of a &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20beacon\"&gt;Lightforged beacon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; is eventually able to reform the Argunite Matrix, securing the area for their own use."}

{"id": "15242", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15242", "title": "Trogg", "text": "The troggs are a race of brutish, cave-dwelling humanoids, originally descendants of the first type of &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; manufactured by the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. Known for their low intelligence, troggs often come into conflict with their distant &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; relatives.\nSome troggs that somehow managed to make their way into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; were not afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, unlike their cousins on Azeroth, and are therefore known as &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, the \"true form\" of troggs.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nFollowing their war with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s set to work creating a new generation of titan-forged by using the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. However, their initial designs proved too complex, and the result was a race of stone-skinned brutes known thereafter as \"troggs\". Distressed by the savage creatures, the keepers refined their design, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; race. The keepers could not bring themselves to destroy their already-existing defective creations, and instead the giantess &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; created the vault of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a stasis chamber for the troggs. However, some troggs later managed to escape the vault and began wandering the world. One group somehow managed to make their way into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; more than 15,000 years ago. These troggs were not afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, unlike their cousins on Azeroth, and are therefore known as &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, the \"true form\" of troggs.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tian\"&gt;Emperor Tian&lt;/a&gt; encountered troggs. The emperor, who needed messengers and deliverymen, warped the troggs using &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shaping&lt;/a&gt;, enhancing their strength, smell and sense of direction, creating the first &lt;a href=\"grummle\"&gt;grummle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRecent history.\nBuried deep within the earth, the troggs slept undisturbed for thousands of years until the dwarves excavated &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; strongholds, such as Uldaman. Once disturbed, the troggs poured out of the ground, eager to take out their aggression on their distant dwarven cousins. The troggs gleefully slaughtered the dwarven explorers, forcing the survivors to flee back to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves were relieved to find that the troggs didn't pursue them, but in truth, the troggs were hunting them from underground by carving tunnels through the earth. As they neared their prey in Ironforge, the artificial noises produced by the great factories in the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; caught the troggs' attention.\nThe troggs burrowed into the lowest levels of Gnomeregan, encountering no resistance from the physically smaller and weaker gnomes. &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; organized defenses to hold the invaders at bay, but the troggs repeatedly burrowed through the earth to bypass the defenses. The troggs continued besieging Gnomeregan throughout the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their ingenuity, the gnomes were heavily outnumbered and couldn't hold back the invaders. The troggs eventually dug into Gnomeregan's engineering quarters, cutting the gnomes off from their best inventions and placing dangerous and unstable materials in the hands of the simpleminded creatures. The traitorous &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; convinced Mekkatorque to bathe the overrun sections of the city in lethal radiation to kill off the troggs. In truth, however, the radiation was meant to anger the troggs and kill the gnomes, and in a few days the radiation wiped out nearly eighty percent of the gnomish population, forcing the survivors to flee to Ironforge.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, an earthquake destroyed the home of the &lt;a href=\"Rockjaw%20tribe\"&gt;Rockjaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; of troggs in &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Believing the dwarves to be responsible for the earthquake, the Rockjaws came to the surface in numbers never seen before and lashed out in anger at the nearby dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;. The hordes of troggs also forced the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s to move east, causing the trolls to come into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large amount of troggs in &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; were also enslaved by &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20Rat\"&gt;Tunnel Rat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20of%20Awful\"&gt;Axis of Awful&lt;/a&gt;. The kobold &lt;a href=\"geomancer\"&gt;geomancer&lt;/a&gt;s managed to create some kind of parlor trick to control the brutes, as the troggs are ultimately \"creatures of the earth\".\nDescription and culture.\nTroggs are powerfully built, with muscular arms hanging almost to the ground. They have some vague similarities to &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in their shaggy beards, stout forms, and thick bands of muscle that appear to have been carved from granite. However, that is where the similarities end, for they also tend to have a sloped, apelike posture as well as the heavy browridges and pronounced canines of a predator. Troggs have jagged, bony growths on their shoulders and elbows, a testament to their rocky heritage. They also have heavy minerals in their physiology. Troggs are known for their foul smell, which resembles a mixture of mold, mange, and sour monkey.\nTroggs are much larger and physically stronger than &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and can be easily twice the size of a gnome. One trogg is usually a match for four or five gnomes, assuming they are armed and experienced in subterranean warfare.\nForce of will and a strong sense of cunning are the only driving factors in the psyche of the trogg. Troggs are known to engage in &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalism&lt;/a&gt;; they consume stone and anything else they can acquire \u2014 including other troggs. Troggs value strength over anything else, and so the biggest, strongest, and most vicious trogg often becomes chieftain through displays of power.\nThough they are cunning in battle, troggs usually do not possess high intelligence. Instead, they depend on their ferocity and tough hides to see them through. Most are vicious fighters, though some slightly more intelligent troggs have become spell casters as well.\nMost troggs loathe traveling aboveground and instead prefer using their jagged claws to dig tunnels through the earth. Some troggs are known to hoard &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, and some luminaries in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s prestigious &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to this behavior as a reflection of the dwarves' own reverence for such wondrous devices. Exquisite specimens of trogg engineering are nearly indistinguishable from simple rocks, and their most advanced craftsmanship apparently takes the form of using rocks as tools. However, troggs are also known to have developed axes, arrows, and even rudimentary spoons.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"High%20Examiner%20Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, one must not be so hasty as to overlook the troggs. While they may be simple, they know things about the deep, hidden places of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nThe creature is a grotesque parody of a dwarf, with oversized head, bent spine, arms that drag along the ground, and a mouth filled with ragged, oversized teeth. It wears rough, smelly hides and carries a crude club covered with spatters of blood. The creature is barrel-chested and powerfully-built, with a thick forehead and jutting lower jaw. Malicious cunning is apparent in its deep-set eyes.\nTroggs have a distinctly neanderthal look \u2014 low, sloping forehead; thick skin covered with bristly black hairs; and the long arms and bent spines of an ape. Troggs are a barbaric, almost \"caveman-like\" race with very low intelligence but a great capacity for violence of all kinds. They were the titans' first attempt to create life from living stone, but the experiment was a failure. Dwarven scholars postulate that the experiment went wrong due to the interference of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. (The successful second attempt gave rise to the dwarven race.) When the titans saw how brutal and misshapen the troggs were, they buried them in vaults all over the land that would become Khaz Modan. The main vault of troggs was the old Titan city of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; in Khaz Modan. There they stayed for countless ages, until the dwarves began excavating Uldaman. The dwarves dug too deep and released the troggs from their ages-long slumber. Now the troggs have begun to spill out of every deep hole to spread terror across the dwarven kingdom. The troggs have an unnatural hatred of their \u201cpretty\u201d cousins the dwarves. They may be dumb, but they are hell-bent on taking out their aggressions on the dwarves.\nThey are dull-witted and savage, but possess a ferocious cunning that makes them dangerous despite their lack of civilization. Troggs are related to dwarves, but if anything, the two races are distant cousins. Some legends say that both dwarves and troggs descended from the original earthen race left behind by the titans after the world was shaped in ages past. While the dwarves evolved into the stocky creatures known today, the troggs retained a stronger connection to the stone from which they were made. For reasons not yet fully understood, the troggs' evolutionary path led them to their present state \u2014 crude, stupid creatures only barely above the level of beasts. Troggs look and act nothing like their distant cousins, however. They dwell in rocky areas, but don't mind living above ground if they must. They eat just about anything, supplementing their diet of plants and raw meat with dirt and rocks they crush between powerful, flat teeth. The resulting gravel helps with digestion and is partially absorbed into their bodies, increasing their toughness. Troggs stand about 5 feet tall in their normal hunched-over state, but if they draw themselves fully erect, they exceed 6 feet in height. They weigh around 300 pounds. Troggs do not speak, but can make themselves understood with guttural growls and grunts.\nTroggs are brutal and cunning in battle (indeed, that is their approach to most things in life). Their flesh is living stone, offering them a useful natural armor. Troggs lack subtlety in combat (or in anything else, or that matter). They typically rush toward the closest opponent and bash it over the head until it dies, then move on to the next victim. A trogg usually begins combat by raging.\nTroggs are usually barbarians. Warriors and rogues are less common, with healers and elemental shaman being the only known spellcasting classes (though even they are exceedingly rare). Arcane casters are wholly unknown among the troggs, as are tinkers. Some scholars argue that with proper education a trogg could learn such skills, but so far no one has bothered to try teaching them. While hunter might seem to be a logical class for a trogg, that class is rare among them \u2014 apparently, these creatures lack the patience required for animal handling. Although an adventuring trogg is not an impossibility, such a creature would have many hurdles to overcome \u2014 the primary ones being stupidity and language. Troggs are almost universally brutish, primitive menaces in civilized lands. They are ugly, smelly, barbaric savages that most would sooner kill than look upon. A trogg that could get past these social stigmas would be an exceptional individual indeed.\nCulture.\nTroggs worship the massive reptiles known as &lt;a href=\"salamander\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt;s. Troggs will attempt to capture and train young salamanders as mounts. If these primitive humanoids slay or encounter a slain salamander, they will feast on its remains and make crude armor and weapons from its claws, teeth, and hide.\nLanguage.\nTroggs do not normally speak, although they can use grunts and bellows to get their messages across. Troggs with exceptional intelligence sometimes learn to speak Low Common; truly gifted individuals might learn Common or Dwarven. Some troggs use Low Common or Dwarven as their primary languages.\nIn Hearthstone.\n were first introduced to \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" with the \"&lt;a href=\"Goblins%20vs%20Gnomes\"&gt;Goblins vs Gnomes&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. Many trogg cards gain in power whenever an enemy spell is cast; this may be meant to be a representation of their low intelligence and inability to learn magic, and that they, therefore, become angered when spells are cast near them. Alternatively, this may depict the trogg absorbing or \"eating\" the spell, as the triggered effects of both the and cards are labeled as \"Metabolized Magic\".\nIn the \"\" adventure, a giant trogg called &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Scarvash\"&gt;Chieftain Scarvash&lt;/a&gt; serves as the first boss of the adventure's second wing, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;."}

Training and practice can only get one so far. From here, you must perfect your technique out in the real world.\n&lt;Puzzlemaster Lo sinks back into deep meditation.&gt;\nWelcome, &lt;class&gt;! This elemental realm at the precipice of the Maelstrom is the Heart of Azeroth, a most sacred place for those with shamanistic beliefs. In this room, those who proclaim a mastery over the elements may test their strength or spirit in a series of challenges.\nBut for you, there is nothing.\nNot even snacks.\nTotem puzzle.\nTo develop harmony with the elements, one must study and understand the interactions between them. The totemic matrix is an ancient training method, a puzzle that will challenge one's mind and spirit. The object of the exercise is to transform all the totems to water totems. Simply touch a totem to invoke it. Know that all things are connected, a lesson invaluable in this puzzle... as in life!\nRules.\nYou will be presented with a five-by-five matrix of elemental totems. Some are fire, some water. Your objective is to change them all to water totems.\nSimply touch a totem to flip its elemental alignment. Ah, but the elements are connected to one another! Flipping a totem will also change the four totems adjacent to it.\nThrough patience, trial, and error, you should be able to coax all of the totems into water totems. Try your best, shaman!\nIf you find yourself completely lost, speak to me and I can reset the puzzle for you.\nPuzzle 2.\nI can see why you answered the call of the shaman, &lt;name&gt;. You have a natural instinct for the interconnectedness of all things.\nAre you ready for a slightly more difficult challenge?\nPuzzle 3.\nI am impressed. You are not just a shaman... you are an elemental craftsman. An artist! &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is your canvas.\nSo far the challenges have all been balanced in their own right. But as you know, such order rarely appears in nature. How will you fare in an asymmetrical challenge?\nPuzzle 4.\nThe totemic matrix is a training method that has been in use since before the mortal races recorded the passing of the days. Long, long ago, totems were not used at all. Instead, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s were set on fire. That was a joke, shaman. You may laugh now, should you choose.\nThe next challenge may appear simple, but it will truly test your abilities.\nPuzzle 5.\nThe final challenge is a grueling tests of your mettle as a shaman. This is the puzzle that killed my father. Know that if you succeed, you will have the spirit, intelligence, and tenacity to conquer any challenge that life throws your way... in this room, at least.\nIt is easy to remain strong when fate is going our way. The TRUE test of character is how one fares when EVERYTHING is on fire..."}

These sources were gradually removed or converted to other stats over the course of the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, and PvP Resilience can no longer be found in game.\nFormulas.\nOne percent of resilience reduces damage taken from all player attacks by 1%.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"combat%20rating%20system\"&gt;combat rating system&lt;/a&gt;, the amount of resilience rating needed to get a certain amount of resilience increases with level. A higher level player will need more resilience rating to get the same effect as a lower level player.

If the player's PvP flag is enabled, they are able to be attacked and interacted with by players of the opposite faction. If the player's PvP flag is disabled, they cannot be attacked by a player of an opposing faction, and cannot attack, heal or apply buffs or debuffs to PvP-flagged targets.\nThe PvP flag can be seen in the top corner of the screen next to your player's portrait. You may see or next to your &lt;a href=\"portrait\"&gt;portrait&lt;/a&gt; depending on your &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. If the icon appears, then your flag is up. If it does not, your flag is down. If your flag is temporary, the time that it will be up will be displayed. That is, as long as you are not in &lt;a href=\"Contested%20territory\"&gt;contested territories&lt;/a&gt;, not in PvP combat, and not having quests in your log that flag you for PvP. PvP flag timers of other players are not displayed.\nIf you use any mods that change your &lt;a href=\"unit%20frame\"&gt;unit frame&lt;/a&gt;s (your portrait, your target, and your party members), you may see that your name changes color according to your PvP flag status. Generally, other players' names will show as blue if their PvP flag is down, or green, yellow, or red if it is up; your own name will be blue if your flag is down, or green if it is up.\nPutting up your flag.\nYour flag will be put up in any of these situations:\nBringing down your flag.\nWhatever the reason for flagging was, there is a five-minute delay to pulling down your PvP flag, after which you will return to normal &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; mode without fear of those of the opposite faction. The exception is &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20All\"&gt;FFA&lt;/a&gt; flag which is removed in just a few seconds.\nYour flag timer continues to run even if you die (although getting ganked counts as PvP activity, and resets it to five minutes), so if you're tricked into turning on your PvP (or otherwise engage in PvP combat with the other faction) in friendly territory, and die, you can wait the five minutes while dead, so you can resurrect without your PvP flag up.\nOther solutions include taking a ride on a flight path (on PvP servers this \"must\" be a flight to friendly territory), or entering a &lt;a href=\"sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so will also automatically remove the PvP flag if it is up.\nColor scheme.\nTo help a player determine the status of players quickly, Blizzard has set a color scheme to make this obvious:\n1 This is possible only when you are standing outside and friendly player inside &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20All\"&gt;FFA zone&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each piece of PvP gear will have its alternate PvP item level displayed on its tooltip.\nThe item level boost can only be triggered through the stated forms of PvP participation, but once activated will function against all targets including PvE targets for as long as the player is participating in PvP.\nPvP Item Level Minimum.\nAll gear (including PvE and PvP gear) is scaled up to a minimum &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; in designated PvP areas, including battlegrounds, arenas, skirmishes and Ashran. The level is lower than that of current season and even starter PvP gear, but reduces the disadvantage suffered by newly levelled characters and those who have not yet acquired higher quality gear. However, items below a certain level will not be scaled up.\nThe PvP item level minimum is often increased each season in order to keep up with current gear, this was particularly the case in . \nPvP Item Level Cap.\nThe PvP item level cap was a mechanic introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3\"&gt;patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt; that scales down the &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; of all players in all designated PvP areas to a specified maximum &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;. The season's current &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;conquest point&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"PvP%20reward\"&gt;PvP reward&lt;/a&gt;s are exempt from the cap.\nThe item level cap could be ascertained by participating in one of the related forms of PvP, while wearing non-PvP gear above the cap; the gear's item level will be scaled down, with its adjusted item level reflecting the current item level cap.\nDesign.\nThe item level cap was introduced along with a number of other changes to &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.3\"&gt;patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to improve players' experience and to make PvP more accessible to players not already possessing appropriate gear. As explained in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/9331806/\"&gt;PvP Gear in Patch 5.3&lt;/a&gt; blog:\nDespite these changes, Conquest (and Honor) gear should still prove superior for use in PvP: \nPvE Only.\nThe catch-all PvP item level cap was removed with the prepatch of , &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, as PvP gear was shifted to using &lt;a href=\"PvP%20item%20level%23Alternate%20PvP%20item%20level\"&gt;alternate PvP item levels&lt;/a&gt; higher than that of the at the time available PvE gear, which made the cap counter-effective to achieving the new design goal.\nHowever, already in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1.0%20%28undocumented%20changes%29\"&gt;Patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, a new item level cap applicable only to non-&lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP gear&lt;/a&gt; was added following player critique of non-&lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP gear&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href=\"BiS\"&gt;BiS&lt;/a&gt; in PvP content.\nOverall PvP item level.\nThe combined effect of these mechanisms within PvP areas is that the item level of all gear is brought to within a specific range: no lower than the PvP item level minimum and no higher than the PvP item level cap. In addition, PvP gear will be boosted by several item levels, giving it an advantage against otherwise comparable PvE gear. This design reduces the disparity between highly and poorly-geared players, while still allowing PvP gear to provide advantages over PvE gear of the same item level.\nIn PvP encounters outside designated PvP areas, only the alternate PvP item levels will activate, allowing players in PvP gear to gain an edge over PvE gear-equipped players. The PvP item level minimum and PvP item level cap will not apply."}

Obtaining any of these mounts will give you the achievement.\nSome players call the &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; mounts \"welfare epics\" or \"welfare mounts,\" due to the fact that they are basically free (the marks of honor needed to purchase them are obtained simply by being in a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; match, regardless of victory or defeat).\nOther PvP mounts can be rewarded after turning in a number of &lt;a href=\"tokens\"&gt;tokens&lt;/a&gt; to a specific vendor.

Each season has its own name (i.e. season 13 is called Tyrannical) and rewards. A season usually starts one week after the release of a major patch and ends when a new major patch is released. These seasons also usually coincide with &lt;a href=\"PvE%20season\"&gt;PvE season&lt;/a&gt;s. While the length of time between seasons varies, there is a PvP season active most of the year. With the release of \"\", seasons returned but they usually launched with the release of a new patch (or Phase).\nDuring a PvP season, players can join rated &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rated%20Battleground\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest Points&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to buy powerful PvP gear.\nOnce the latest season has ended, arena and rated battleground matches will be unavailable for one week, and all Conquest Points will be converted to &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt;. Any Honor above the 4,000 cap will be converted into in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. Those characters eligible for end-of-season rewards (see below) are then determined, and rewards are typically awarded within one or two weeks of the end of the corresponding season.\nWhen a new season begins personal ratings are reset. Matchmaking ratings are sometimes also reset at this time. With each new season, the available &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt; are also refreshed, although the exact details of this process vary. Typically, the previous season's non-elite Conquest Point PvP rewards are made available for Honor Points, while a new tier of items is made available for purchase with Conquest Points. In this way, players are encouraged to once again begin gathering points with which to purchase new, more powerful gear.\nRewards.\nAt the end of each arena season, players that rank among the highest ratings within their respective arena brackets (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) are awarded titles marking their accomplishments. Team members who have been in at least 20% of a top arena team's matches and are within 100 personal rating of the team's rating, in each &lt;a href=\"Battlegroup\"&gt;Battlegroup&lt;/a&gt;, will receive a title according to their standing (highest to lowest). Those who were in the Top 0.5% would also receive that season's unique PvP mount, with the first season awarding the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Nether%20Drake\"&gt;Swift Nether Drake&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting in ', earning the Gladiator mount would also get you a Feat of Strength achievement in the same name of the mount (example: &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Nether%20Drake%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Swift Nether Drake&lt;/a&gt;). This was changed in ', where you would earn a Feat of Strength achievement and that achievement would award you with both the mount and title (example: ). You would still get a second Feat of Strength for earning the mount itself (example: &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Gladiator%27s%20Felblood%20Gronnling%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Primal Gladiator's Felblood Gronnling&lt;/a&gt;). A second change that was made is that you had to win at least 50 games to be eligible for the rewards.\nStarting with \"\" &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;, the number of games you had to win was increased from 50 to 150 (for the seasonal Gladiator title) and be with your current faction. A warning was added to every season ending announcement to not faction change as you may not get the rewards if you currently are eligible. An example is if you won 150 games on a Horde character, but you faction changed to the Alliance before the end of the season. You would need to win another 150 games as an Alliance to earn the reward before the season ended.\nWith \"\", the ranking system was changed from percentage-based to formal ranks in a bracket format. As you rose in rank, this unlocked PvP gear that you could buy. Several changes were made in order to obtain PvP titles and the seasonal mount:\nWith , the ranking system had its values slightly changed for the brackets. Combatant would now range from 1000-1399 (down from 1400-1599) and Challenger would now start at 1400 (down from 1600) while all other ranks remained the same from Battle for Azeroth. The ranks of Combatant, Challenger &amp; Rival were further broken down into two rankings of I &amp; II. The rank of I would range the first 199 of Combatant, Challenger &amp; Rival while rank of II would range the second 199 of Combatant &amp; Challenger and the last 99 of Rival. Each rank would unlock PvP gear and be able to upgrade that gear to higher item levels. The rank titles are awarded when you reach rank I of the associated rank since there are achievements for reaching both ranks I &amp; II.\nWith \"\", no major changes were made to the ranking system. A new title and two achievements were added: Legend title for 100 Rated Solo Shuffle wins and seasonal Legend title for top 0.1% of the Solo Shuffle ladder with at least 50 games played. The Legend achievement rewards the title and a pennant which is learned as a toy. Due to the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Dragonriding\"&gt;Dragonriding&lt;/a&gt;, you get both the seasonal mount and a glyph to customize your drake to have the same appearance, if you earn the seasonal Gladiator title, mount, and achievement. That way you are able to ride it both as a normal mount and a Dragonriding mount.\nWith the release of \"\", rewards were awarded similar to how they are in retail than how they were during the expansion's original release. If you placed in the Top 0.5% (Gladiator &amp; Season Gladiator titles), you also would receive that season's custom mount. The titles would last until the end of the following season (example: if you earned it with Season 1, you would have the title until the end of Season 2). In , the rewards were mostly kept the same from BC Classic but you are required to participate in at least 50 games during the Season and not be disqualified for breaking the Blizzard EULA."}

Its general concept originated with ''s &lt;a href=\"honor%20talent\"&gt;honor talent&lt;/a&gt;s system, and a number of PvP talents began as honor talents. Unlike honor talents, however, PvP talents are unlocked simply by leveling up and do not require the player to grind &lt;a href=\"Honor%20system%20%28Legion%29\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPvP talents' effects are always active in PvP instances, such as &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;s; and always inactive in PvE instances, such as &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s. In the open world, PvP talents are active as long as &lt;a href=\"War%20Mode\"&gt;War Mode&lt;/a&gt; is turned on. Because of this, PvP talents can also be used in open-world questing and &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nPvP talents can be changed during the beginning of a PvP match, or while in a &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; area in the open world.\nFull listings of the PvP talents available to each class can be found on that class's abilities page, e.g.: &lt;a href=\"Priest%20abilities%23PvP%20talents\"&gt;Priest abilities#PvP talents&lt;/a&gt;.\nGaining PvP talents.\nOn the right-hand side of the &lt;a href=\"Talent\"&gt;Talent&lt;/a&gt;s pane, three PvP talent slots can be seen after level 20, when the first is unlocked.

The term \"PvP trinket\" may also be used more loosely to refer to any trinket sold as part of the &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; reward system.\nNotes.\nThere are a number of different PvP trinkets, with progressively more powerful trinkets becoming available as the player increases in level. Each is available in a separate Alliance and Horde version (obtainable only by members of that faction), and all are &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt;, except for the &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt; trinkets which are &lt;a href=\"bind%20to%20account\"&gt;bind to account&lt;/a&gt;. \nTrinkets are available for level 60, 70, 80 and 85. Level 60 and heirloom trinkets have a 5 minute cooldown, while all others have a 2 minute cooldown. Higher-level and heirloom trinkets also grant additional secondary stat bonuses. Level 70, 80 and heirloom trinkets grant &lt;a href=\"resilience\"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt; bonuses, while at level 85 numerous versions are available, each improving a different secondary stat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; abilities &lt;a href=\"Will%20to%20Survive\"&gt;Will to Survive&lt;/a&gt; (Human) and &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; (Undead) provide the same effect as a PvP trinket, and with only a 2 minute cooldown, offer a significant advantage for players under level 70. &lt;a href=\"Will%20to%20Survive\"&gt;Will to Survive&lt;/a&gt; shares a full cooldown with the PvP trinkets, \ngiving human players little reason to equip one, thus saving a &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt; slot. However, &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; shares only a 30-second partial cooldown with them, meaning that forsaken players with PvP trinkets can achieve the same effect as often as twice per 2 minute period.\nWith the exception of the lvl 60 &lt;a href=\"Insignia%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Insignia of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Insignia%20of%20the%20Alliance\"&gt;Insignia of the Alliance&lt;/a&gt; which are granted as quest rewards, and those matching the current PvP season (eg &lt;a href=\"Cataclysmic%20Gladiator%27s%20Medallion%20of%20Tenacity\"&gt;Cataclysmic Gladiator's Medallion of Tenacity&lt;/a&gt;) which are purchased using conquest points, all PvP trinkets are purchased in exchange for honor.\nAvailable PvP trinkets.\nAlliance\nHorde\nNumerous trinkets are available at level 85 in exchange for honor or conquest, corresponding with the current PvP season (eg &lt;a href=\"Ruthless%20Gladiator%27s%20Medallion%20of%20Meditation\"&gt;Ruthless Gladiator's Medallion of Meditation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cataclysmic%20Gladiator%27s%20Medallion%20of%20Cruelty\"&gt;Cataclysmic Gladiator's Medallion of Cruelty&lt;/a&gt;). All of these trinkets have a 2 minute cooldown, and offer various secondary stat bonuses.\nSources.\nMost PvP trinkets can be purchased from various &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster\"&gt;Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;s found in the &lt;a href=\"Champions%27%20Hall\"&gt;Champions' Hall&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Legends\"&gt;Hall of Legends&lt;/a&gt; (Horde), while a few can be found elsewhere. See &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%23PvP%20quartermasters\"&gt;PvP Quartermasters&lt;/a&gt; for a list.\nPrevious trinket effects by class.\nThe original trinkets (Insignia of the Alliance/Horde) have a class requirement, but the trinkets for all classes are identical. In the past, each class's trinket countered different effects.\nAll classic World of Warcraft trinkets had a 5 minute cooldown and dispelled up to three forms of CC from the user. They were usable while under the effects of the CC, even if the CC otherwise prevented trinket use.\nThe following table lists which form of CC each classes' trinket neutralized. Notice trinkets did not provide immunity; they only reactively dispelled already existing effects."}
{"id": "134244", "revid": "168424", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=134244", "title": "PvP zone", "text": "PvP zones or world battles are non-&lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;d &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s designed for &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; combat, featuring &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, destructible buildings, and multiple objectives with lasting effects. &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s on non-&lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s are automatically &lt;a href=\"flagged\"&gt;flagged&lt;/a&gt; for PvP when entering a PvP zone. There are currently two PvP zones: &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. \nA new PvP-oriented zone, &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, is planned for the upcoming \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. However, while often described as a PvP zone, Ashran is in fact an extensive and highly developed form of organised &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nPvP zones are a unique form of PvP somewhere between &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. They are a non-instanced form of PvP encounter, and are not affected by the &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zone\"&gt;cross-realm zone&lt;/a&gt;s feature. PvP zones are essentially normal areas of the game world, with the addition of specific battleground-like objectives, vehicles and rewards.\nPvP zones are always available for players to explore. However, battles for each zone take place at regular intervals. Players accepting an invitation to join the battle will be summoned directly to an appropriate location within the zone. Unlike battlegrounds, players are not returned to their prior locations at the conclusion of battle; instead, players are granted the option of teleporting out of the PvP zone at any time, resulting in the player being returned to their current &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; location. This feature will activate the cooldown on the player's Hearthstone, but will function even if the Hearthstone is already on cooldown. Players far from their Hearthstone location may therefore have to spend some time travelling back to their previous location following participation in a PvP zone. Players can of course also leave the area by ground or flying mount.\nVictory in a PvP zone will result in control of that zone being transferred to the winning faction. Control of each PvP zone grants access to unique features in that zone. These include additional &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s and entrance to &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; instances hidden within the PvP zone. These features are available only to players of the controlling faction, giving players additional motivation to participate in PvP zones. Additionally, numerous faction-specific NPCs will spawn in the zone following battle, offering services to the controlling faction's players and attacking enemy players on sight.\nThe realm-specific nature of PvP zones can lead to participants finding themselves fighting along the same players on a regular basis, or often battling the same opponents, especially on quieter realms. This can lead to greater opportunities for guild membership and other lasting interaction.\nBattle.\nEach PvP zone has its own objectives, rules and elements - see individual pages (&lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;) for details.\nPvP zone battles involve the attempt by the attacking team to take control of the zone. To accomplish this, attackers will need to capture and/or destroy bases, while defenders may attempt to systematically crush the offensive, or simply ensure the attackers do not succeed before the allotted time expires.\nThe basic play of PvP zones is very similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Victory is attained through completing objectives, with coordination and strategy often paying dividends. However, unlike battlegrounds PvP zones offer an extremely polarised experience, with players often engaging in very different tasks depending on which faction currently controls the zone.\nBattle for each PvP zone takes place at fairly regular intervals of around 2 hours 30 minutes. The time until the next battle is displayed in the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, provided the player is of sufficient level to join. \nUnlike battlegrounds, PvP zones do not have regular brackets for various level ranges. Instead, each PvP zone currently exists separately in two versions: one for level 90 players, and one for all other players. NPCs in each version are scaled appropriately.\nAnother difference to battlegrounds is that PvP zones do not have a fixed number of players; instead the system seeks to balance play by admitting equal numbers from each faction. This is particularly important for players on realms with significant faction imbalance.\nConclusion.\nAt the conclusion of a PvP zone battle the outcome is announced, and most objective-related elements such as vehicles despawn. However, unlike battlegrounds, players are not prevented from taking actions, and combat is not interrupted. Numerous NPCs will also spawn shortly thereafter, depending on the winning faction. No scoreboard is shown at the end of a PvP zone battle.\nRewards.\nParticipation in PvP zones is chiefly rewarded through &lt;a href=\"honor%20points\"&gt;honor points&lt;/a&gt;, as well as through access to additional features. Victors may also be rewarded in related currencies, such as &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad%20Commendation\"&gt;Tol Barad Commendation&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntering and leaving PvP zones.\nPvP zones can be entered at any time by simply travelling to that area. Some PvP zones require flying mounts (or at least a fearless proficiency in base-jumping) to access, while others can simply be walked into on foot or by ground mount.\nUnlike battlegrounds, leaving a PvP zone does not flag players with the &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Deserter&lt;/a&gt; debuff. At the conclusion of a PvP zone's battle, players are not teleported out of the area, but are free to travel as they wish, or to remain in the area. Note that after a short period NPCs will spawn, some of which may wish to attack the player.\nPlayers can leave PvP zones simply by travelling out of the area, or by using a special button found on the edge of the minimap. This option has the effect of instantly using the player's &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, even if it is already on cooldown.\nHistory.\nPvP zones were introduced for the first time with &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Lake Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.3\"&gt;Patch 3.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, described as the first \"non-instance PvP zone\", and featuring \"siege weapons and buildings, because blowing stuff up is cool.\"\nVictory in Wintergrasp rewarded players not only with honor, but with access to additional quests, faction rewards and the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt; raid, aiming to make Wintergrasp relevant for PvE players as well as those focused on PvP.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" brought the second PvP zone, &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, which while broadly similar to Wintergrasp, featured several new developments, including a far greater selection of bonus quests, and the extensive &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt; area &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tol Barad Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; cited numerous ways in which they sought to improve upon the perceived design flaws of Wintergrasp with Tol Barad:\nHowever, while featuring the introduction of a number of features intended to encourage world PvP, Blizzard decided not to implement a PvP zone with \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\":\n\"Mists of Pandaria\" did however see a level 90 bracket added to the existing PvP zones. Prior to this, as fully non-instanced zones, all players on any realm would fight alongside each other, regardless of level. The introduction of a level 90 bracket was designed to encourage players back into these zones, using them more similarly to battlegrounds, \"to earn bonus honor.\" This was arguably also intended to maintain the PvP zones as a permanent part of the game's PvP vocabulary, rather than as more content-specific zones mostly abandoned by players once the related expansion had passed. With the overhaul of the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.2.0\"&gt;Patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt; also saw PvP zones re-labelled \"world battles\".\nWith the introduction of the consolidated &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" saw PvP zones removed from the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;, effectively moving them out of reach of most players, and likely consigning them to obscurity for the time being. While this was likely due in part to interface constraints, with the need to make room for the return of &lt;a href=\"skirmish\"&gt;skirmish&lt;/a&gt;es, it was also due to a general lack of interest from players. &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Holinka\"&gt;Brian Holinka&lt;/a&gt; has stated that in order to find wider success, the PvP zones should probably be redesigned and reinvented as battlegrounds. However, this would be a substantial undertaking which for the time being is not high on the list of priorities, with the developers preferring to focus on creating wholly new content. As a direct reversion of \"Mists of Pandaria\"'s introduction of PvP zones into the PvP interface, this change may be interpreted as a statement as to the failure of that attempt to bring players back into the zones."}

In a world filled with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, magic insinuates itself in ritual. Founded in the mysteries of certain cults on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the pyremaster is the enactor of ritual. This funerary priest guides the dead through fire, through loss of flesh, so their naked spirits may conquer the elements; in order to protect his duties (and his person), he commands both bone and fire. Orc pyremasters are scattered across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Places where fire and heat are dominant (particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;) are cult strongholds. Orcs are the only pyremasters, though it is conceivable that orcs could teach the class's secrets to others. They are &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; or are members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nA pyremaster conducts the funeral rites of the challenge of flame and flesh, which allegedly burns away impurity and weakness as the deceased spirit goes to the afterlife. This ritual takes an hour to perform and requires a pyre, along with sacred oils and musks. These rites have a practical benefit as well as a religious one: the ritual brings the pyremaster closer to the spirits and bestows special blessings.\nThe pyremaster can summon &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and the creatures that he summons are aflame. He can set his weapons ablaze with magical fire at will. He can cause a section of ground to erupt in magical flames. A skilled pyremaster gains immunity to both natural and magical fire. The pyremaster may stare into the embers of cremated bones and receive a portent of the future. When a highly skilled pyremaster takes fire damage, he instead heals damage; if a pyremaster uses the Create Pyre ability on the ground he stands on, he heals himself as long as the fire is burning.\nThe skilled pyremaster may speak with the ashes of a dead creature. He may ask as many questions as he wishes. The ashes\u2019 knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic or repetitive. The pyremaster cannot actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). This ability instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the ashes. The ashes retain the imprint of the soul that once inhabited them, and thus they can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The ashes cannot learn new information, and will not remember being questioned."}

The village was a settlement, with a &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by a group of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who had survived the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, though not without paying a &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moonrage%20pack\"&gt;price&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the town fell into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, but quickly became the center of a struggle with the Alliance to gain its control during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, before finally being burned down by agents of the Horde on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the ruined town seems to have been taken back under the control of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, thus coming into conflict with the Forsaken who gained control over &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; regains control of the keep at the end of the war.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe village, along with &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, was originally a part of the kingdom of Gilneas before the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; was erected.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20Splinters\"&gt;splitting&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance, King Greymane started the construction of the Wall. &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, who was the landholder of both Pyrewood and Ambermill, was displeased by King Greymane's decision to cut off his holdings from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and disagreed with Greymane on the rationale of seceding Gilneas from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Stilwell\"&gt;Jordan Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Stilwell\"&gt;Daphne&lt;/a&gt; once resided in the village and the keep above it.\nThird War and aftermath.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of the Wall were closed, cuting off Pyrewood from any support from Gilneas, and leaving its people to their own means while the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; draws closer.\nSome of the citizens of Pyrewood did not stay during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;fall of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After finding the Greymane Wall would not open for them, they departed on a ship called the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20Wolf\"&gt;Sea Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\", headed for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. After a severe storm that blew them off course, they landed on the western shores of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, where they founded &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;, escorted by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, made it to Pyrewood Village as their last stop on their travel before &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt;. The village was mostly intact and was built right on the edge of the river. Numerous &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces however started converging toward Pyrewood in a massive ambush against the living. While holding the bridge that led out of the town and across the river against the undead, Tyrande fell into the river due to the bridge collapsing.\nIt is unknown what happened to the village after that, but Tyrande's &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Starfall%20%28Ultimate%29\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; may have successfully driven off the undead, as the village was still inhabited by humans in its later appearances.\nFollowing the War, still unable to persuade Greymane to change his mind and upset by being cut off from his holdings and his people, Crowley instigated the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually led to a civil war.\nThe worgen curse.\nTo the north, overlooking the village, there was a keep owned by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;. Silverlaine, his servants, and his forces led by the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Springvale\"&gt;Commander Springvale&lt;/a&gt;, were slain by Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, who then took residence in the keep renaming it &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. From there, Arugal cursed the inhabitants of Pyrewood, so that they underwent a nightly transformation into the bestial &lt;a href=\"Moonrage\"&gt;Moonrage&lt;/a&gt; worgen, then returned to their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; forms upon the arrival of dawn. It was during this time that they became hostile to all regardless of &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. Despite all its hardships, however, the village continued to service &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; travelers by selling cloth, leather, and mail armor to customers.\nDuring the efforts to eradicate the worgen from &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; eventually disposed of Pyrewood Village, which was under the control of Arugal. &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Faerleia\"&gt;Deathstalker Faerleia&lt;/a&gt; enlisted &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers aid to bring down the &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Council\"&gt;ruling council&lt;/a&gt; of Pyrewood, hoping that without their guidance the other villagers would turn against Arugal.\nArugal himself was later &lt;a href=\"Arugal%20Must%20Die\"&gt;defeated and beheaded&lt;/a&gt; by agents of the Horde, and buried in an &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Grave\"&gt;unmarked grave&lt;/a&gt; just south of the village. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; saw fit to bring him back as one of his puppets, so the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; princes &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Theraldis\"&gt;Theraldis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Atherann\"&gt;Atherann&lt;/a&gt; resurrected Arugal as a ghost in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and sent him to the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; to subvert the &lt;a href=\"trappers\"&gt;trapper&lt;/a&gt; communities.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken managed to take control of the town (which was half-ruined) for a period of time. However, Pyrewood was attacked by Alliance forces supporting the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated most of the Forsaken stationed there. The Forsaken were able to retake the village one last time, but on the orders of Godfrey they also burned it to the ground, leaving only ruins behind.\nA squad of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the ruins.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tobias%20Zaren\"&gt;Captain Tobias Zaren&lt;/a&gt; at their head surrounds &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, taking control of the areas immediately around it as the Forsaken gained control over &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into a bio-weapons facility, in order to develop a new bio-weapon to unleash against &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Given that Pyrewood is the most immediate area that surrounds the keep, it likely refers to this location. Captain Tobias Zaren was later encountered by the Horde champions, while his forces were targeted by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Plaguebringer%20Harris\"&gt;Chief Plaguebringer Harris&lt;/a&gt;' plague.\nNPCs.\nAt daytime, the inhabitants of Pyrewood were human, but by night fall, they would have transformed into worgen (measured at 8:59PM\u20139:00PM server time).\nLove is in the Air.\nThe remains of Pyrewood are claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Chemical%20Company\"&gt;Crown Chemical Company&lt;/a&gt;. They are performing experiments that turns a host into a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20eruptor\"&gt;Plague eruptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nPyrewood, at &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s threshold, is afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20Curse\"&gt;Worgen Curse&lt;/a&gt;. Its inhabitants transform into lycanthropic &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; rises, and the worgen stalk through the forests and slay anything they encounter. One excellent lesson &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; learned is never go outside at night in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.

The system did not track individual candies from the stack, so had no way of knowing that you ate the oldest one and did not extend the timer when one was consumed. Basically, the clock started when you received your first one, and did not reset until they disappeared or you had consumed them all. \nThis aspect of how the item works has not changed. Your stack of these will still be treated as a lump that all expire at the same time. In fact, by trading all of your candies to another player and getting new ones from a Handful of Candy, your old candies' expiration timers will be set to equal the timers on your new candy when they are traded back to you.\nThis item does not &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt; and can be transferred. However, due to the timer issues already noted, this means that when you obtain one from another source, your whole combined stack will likely obtain the shortest remaining lifetime.\nThe effect of this item stacks 4 times and has a duration of 30 minutes"}

Upon witnessing the civil war raging in the Firelands, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; ordered their forces to scout out the area and learn about the two leaders. After learning that Smolderon was more willing to work with mortals over Pyroth, the Farseer decide to back Smolderon as the new Firelord. To that end, the Earthen Ring disposed of Pyroth and brought his core to Smolderon, in a bid to earn his favor and in turn unite the Elemental Lords against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "19605", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19605", "title": "Red", "text": "The color red is used in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; in various different ways. One way it may be used is as part of the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; color system for items (gray, white, green, blue, purple, orange, red) or mobs (gray, green, yellow, orange, red). Probes into the code indicate that the highest (&lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;) level of rarity has been switched to a dark yellow color referred to as gold (no relation to the metal &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;).\nRed Items.\nThere are no items with a red rarity level (&lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard has supposedly proposed gold as the replacement color). You may see though, items with various properties of that item Red. Thus meaning you cannot use that item. For example, a Weapon might have the words \"Mace\" in red, that means your character cannot use that item. Levels requirements and armor type may also effect your ability to use these items.\nFor the most part, in World of Warcraft, when items are red in some way, you cannot use or obtain them yet. When browsing at a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;, some items will have a reddened icon. These cannot be used at this time, due to a requisite that is not met. When looting an item that you cannot use, however, its icon is \"not\" red. But in both cases, the tooltip that appears when you move the mouse over the item, it indicates the unmet requirement in red. In these cases, the item may be said to be red, even though it may also be said that it is &lt;a href=\"blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"green\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"white\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, or some other color.\nRed Mobs.\nRed &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s can mean any of two different things. Either:\nAt very early levels, all mobs that you will meet will not by itself be aggroed to attack you. These such mobs will have a yellow name. From early on, however, you will see mobs that have red names. These mobs \"will\" automatically be aggroed. The aggro radius depends on the level differential, and can be either very close or very far away.\nAt all levels, you may see from time to time a mob that has a red level number. &lt;a href=\"Gray\"&gt;Gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"green\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; mobs (having gray and green level indicators) should be easy for you to solo; &lt;a href=\"yellow\"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt; should be a little harder, but easy enough for a party of two; such red mobs should be considered rather dangerous, but you may be able to take them on with a party of three or more.\nRed Names.\nRed names might refer to two different things:\nThe color of the name of a &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; mob in the main play screen will always be red. In the &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs%20Player\"&gt;Player vs Player&lt;/a&gt; system, if two members of opposite factions were allowed to attack one another, each would appear with a red name to the other.\nIn the target pane, the name of a now-hostile (whether hostile or not by nature) mob will have either a yellow name with a red background, or it will have a yellow name with a &lt;a href=\"gray\"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; background. The red background means that if it is killed, the credit will go to you and your party. The gray background means that if it is killed, the credit will go to someone else and his party."}

Due to 's hardships (longer winters, short springs and summers, a shortage of game to hunt) the Red Walkers struggled to find enough food to survive, and took to covering themselves in the blood of animals in order to frighten other orcs from what was theirs. This tactic worked well for the clan until a talbuk herd was accidentally chased off by a group of wandering draenei and in a great rage the clan killed them. As it was their habit by then, they covered themselves with the draenei's blood and some dripped into the mouths. Rather than being repulsed the Red Walkers found it sweet and devoured the draenei corpses. When the clan later encountered a band of orcs they slaughtered and devoured them as well, convinced that flesh was flesh.\nThe Red Walkers later took to harassing the Frostwolf clan, and during their first battle killed &lt;a href=\"Garad%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt;. Over time the Red Walkers grew bold and eventually directly attacked the Frostwolves, but were repelled and with the death of their hunting party the retreated north. While leaving a few scouts to watch over the Frostwolves the Red Walkers through unknown means began to steal the strength of the spirits, correctly anticipating that the Frostwolves would come to the spirits' aid.\nWhen Durotan led a party north to aid the spirits, the Red Walkers took advantage and struck out against the Frostwolves in order to wound them and use them as a food supply. Unknown to the Red Walkers the weakened spirits still had enough energy to give one final gift to the Frostwolves and Durotan, and his party rushed south and the Frostwolves under the command of &lt;a href=\"Draka%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; fought to kill their enemies. As a result, Durotan arrived in the midst of the fighting, and the Red Walkers were ultimately destroyed, its chieftain living just long enough to inform Durotan of how a once noble clan had fallen.\nWhile the Frostwolves wanted to leave their corpses rot, Durotan ordered that the Red Walkers should be buried, because despite their sins, they were still orcs and by them treating with respect the Frostwolves would remind themselves of what they never would become.\nWhen the Frostwolves finally traveled to join the Horde, Durotan was informed by that the Frostwolves were the last clan to join; there had been one other clan, but according to Gul'dan they were now gone. Durotan thought the clan in question may well be the Red Walkers."}

Their fire can either destroy or bring life. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the Life-Binder; with most of their race being part of the eponymous &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; charged Alexstrasza with protecting life. The red dragons generally wish to protect all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as their queen does, while battling those who wish to do the world harm. In particular, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; aberrations served as the red dragon's foremost enemies. Despite their mission, some red dragons hold a mistrust, even animosity, towards mortals because of the events of the Second War.\nMany red dragons were enslaved during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza's flight aided the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, while the mortals aided her against the insane &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragons spearheaded the assault on the last bastion of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s flight in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; storyline.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nRed dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nSeveral of these dragons also take unorthodox forms to those traditionally found; such as the &lt;a href=\"wylderdrake\"&gt;wylderdrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"velocidrake\"&gt;velocidrake&lt;/a&gt;. As these are specified as drakes, it is unknown what their 'dragon' forms or whelp forms would look like; though they are presumably just smaller and larger variations of these appearances. With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s being discovered; &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found baring red scales.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nAccording to legends, before the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s departed Azeroth, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the red, held dominion over their brethren and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;, the titan patron of all life, gave a portion of her power to the red leviathan. Ever after, Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, and she would work to safeguard all living creatures within the world. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.\nIn truth, in Azeroth's ancient past, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza faced Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. After killing Galakrond, Alexstrasza and the others were approached by the other Keepers, and Tyr suggested empowering the proto-dragons to make them defenders of Azeroth, as they proved they were able to stand for the planet. Only &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, and forbid the other Keepers to proceed with that idea, but they decided to go against him. They reached out to the Pantheon and each of the titans blessed the proto-dragons with a portion of their vast power, channeled through the Keepers. They became majestic beings called &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and among them, Alexstrasza became the Aspect of Life and the Queen of the dragons while her red dragonflight was charged with the task of watching over all life on Azeroth, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. One of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that the titans created them from Galakrond, to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nWar of the Ancients.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight resided in a series of large caverns deep inside towering mountains, with hundreds of great gaps in every cliff leading to their realm. The caverns were large enough even for a leviathan like &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; to fly through. Alexstrasza's chambers were filled with plants and flowers that should have not been able to grow there, such as roses and orchids. Most of the peaks were high enough to be above the clouds and to have a permanent snow cap.\nWhen the Highborne opened the portal for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, all the dragonflights left the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. On the battlefield, Neltharion led the dragon forces, consuming the demons under their fiery breaths, but their strength was not enough. As the other Aspects began to despair, the Black Aspect suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the Legion. The Dragon Queen and the other Aspects had nothing but the utmost respect for wise Neltharion, and they accepted without hesitation his plan to give much of their own essence toward the creation of this object, which was called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion and his flight, however, had secretly refrained from imparting any of their own power. During the time of the Dragon Soul's empowerment, the area where the ritual took place was surrounded by a giant, impenetrable magical barrier as Neltharion didn't want anything or anyone to stop the ritual. This barrier was guarded from the inside by dragons from all flights.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The blacks joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion then scattered the hundreds of other assembled dragons before retreating from the field of battle, taking the Dragon Soul with him. Thus Neltharion became Deathwing the Destroyer, the Dragon Soul was renamed the \"Demon Soul\", and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt; begun.\nThe black dragonflight's actions left their former allies wounded and shocked, and Alexstrasza and the noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing's betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, most of all the blacks, and the reds were no exception. Some dragons call this time period the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt;, though others including mortals may know it by other names. Even though it was everyone against the black flight, easily outnumbering them, it was incredibly emotionally hard for the dragons because they had to fight their friends and loved ones, people they had known and grown up with. The black dragonflight was hunted down and nearly annihilated, all but slain because of Deathwing's mad plots.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. The trio later visited the Night Elven survivors to present the devastated race a gift. Alexstrasza produced a single enchanted acorn, taken from the Mother Tree &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, and placed it within the new &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The acorn, activated by the potent, magical waters, sprung to life as a colossal tree whose mighty roots grew from the well's waters, and its verdant canopy seemed to scrape the roof of the sky. The tree also received blessings from &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. It would safeguard the new Well of Eternity from discovery and come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA thousand years before modern times, the red dragons lent their aid to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a child of Alexstrasza, the reds fought the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters furiously and ultimately helped push them back to their city where they were sealed away from the world. The dragons suffered few casualties but the progeny of Alexstrasza, Caelestrasz, was believed lost, having charged deep into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; during the final push. After the war, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to the red wyrm &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; the bronze.\nUnbeknownst to his flight, Caelestrasz, along with Arygos and Merithra, was not dead, simply captured. The dark master of Ahn'Qiraj used the tortured dragons to power his new creations: &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing finally found a way to conquer his greatest rivals. While he couldn't wield the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; himself it could be placed in the hands of one that would further his agenda. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; received visions of a powerful artifact deep within the earth and with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s permission took his clan to search for their source. Zuluhed took the Demon Soul for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but while he sensed the disk had the power to raise mountains and evaporate oceans, it was unresponsive to his shamanistic powers. The device was passed down to his lieutenant: the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, whose magic the disk eagerly reciprocated. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; searched for weeks for the dragons, finally spotting a lone wounded red male. They followed the dragon back to the red flight's lair, a high mountain peak, where they came upon the Dragonqueen herself, roosting with three consorts. The Aspect immediately incinerated four orc warriors before Nekros invoked the dark powers of the disk and subdued her. The Demon Soul was used to enslave Alexstrasza and a large portion of her flight.\nFrom capture to escape, an eight year span, Alexstrasza was forced to create more dragons to service the Horde in the war, and she cried for the deaths of her children and the deaths they caused. Two of her consorts did not survive long, one perishing while trying to escape over the sea and the other dying of injuries inflicted by Deathwing, while her fourth and youngest avoided capture altogether. This left Alexstrasza with only her prime consort, Tyranastrasz, to produce dragons with for the orcs. She often tried to defy Nekros, but the act of breaking one or more eggs in her presence assured her good behavior. The red dragonflight, once one of the strongest and proudest flights of dragons ever seen, were reduced to being the Horde's war dogs. The Horde quickly learned how to utilize the great leviathans, and they were forced to wreak havoc throughout the lands of the Alliance, committing destructive acts such as setting the forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; ablaze, and the complete destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;third fleet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Those red dragons who were becoming too powerful to be properly controlled were slain on the spot by the Dragonmaw orcs. The Alliance responded to the dragons with dwarven &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, the two often meeting in the dogfights over Lordaeron and Khaz Modan. Throughout most of the Second War, and even a few years after its end, the settlements of the Alliance lived in constant fear of coming under attack by red dragons.\nOutraged, many of the red dragons who had avoided capture wanted to make war against all the lesser races but her youngest consort, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as the mage Krasus of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, sought a way to free his mate.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nDespite the Horde's defeat at the end of the Second War, the Dragonmaw Clan retained a firm grip on Grim Batol and Alexstrasza. Korialstrasz approached the other Aspects for assistance, but was continually rebuffed time after time. Using his guise of Krasus, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, he set a plan into motion. He sent his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; on a secret mission to Grim Batol.\nWhen Nekros believed the Alliance planned on invading, he had Alexstrasza and her eggs moved out of the mountain fortress and began a march towards &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt; where he believed the bulk of the Dragonmaw Clan was stationed. Little did he know he had been manipulated by Deathwing, who desired Alexstrasza's eggs out in the open to steal them more easily. When Deathwing appeared Nekros sent &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; to face him, but the old red did not last long against the dark aspect. Deathwing began stealing Alexstrasza's eggs only to be stalled by the sudden arrival of the other Aspects, who proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexstrasza swore an oath of friendship to Rhonin, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt;, and their respective races. With their queen returned to them, the remaining members of the red dragonflight came out of hiding and reassumed their ancient charge of defending the wild things of the world. One of their first actions was to station guardians outside their queen's former prison.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the red dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Many red dragons however, still remained slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. These members of the red flight were used by the orcs to vainly fight against the Scourge, led by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who were seeking control of the clan's functional &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Gate\"&gt;Demon Gate&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; also came across a red dragon being attacked by harpies in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon had in his possession the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Aszune\"&gt;Heart of Aszune&lt;/a&gt;, needed by the Warchief to access the lair of the Oracle.\nThe Sunwell.\nFollowing the Third War, which had ravaged the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and cost the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; their fabled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; took it upon himself to gather the remaining energy of the well and transform it into a living avatar in the form of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. When the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; tried to claim her power as his own, Korialstrasz intervened, only to be subjected to Dar'Khan's mind control. The blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; engaged Korialstrasz in battle while &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his allies managed to defeat the traitorous elf, free Korialstrasz, and safeguard the energy of the Sunwell.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFor ten thousand years, Deathwing's fellow Dragon Aspects had lived without the full measure of their power, and the sudden return of their strength was physically and mentally exhausting. Needing to recover from this and her traumatic ordeal under the Dragonmaw, Alexstrasza and her flight sequestered themselves away to heal, both physically and emotionally. As such, even as her consorts and children continued to have their impact on Azeroth, Alexstrasza's whereabouts were unknown to most, though &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; seemed to know where she resided at the time. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; asked her to bless the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, but the Dragonqueen refused.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight had a strong presence at Alexstrasza's old prison, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Their guardianship of the fortress could be seen, with legions of dragonspawn and the drake-champion &lt;a href=\"Axtroz\"&gt;Axtroz&lt;/a&gt; stationed outside at the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt;. Further down the mountain, the remains of the orcish caravan teamed with newly hatched red whelps. They were later targeted by a Horde adventurer sent by the black drake &lt;a href=\"Emberstrife\"&gt;Emberstrife&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; was secretly working against &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. He assisted &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their black dragonflight allies. Upon breaching &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, Vaelastrasz succumbed to Nefarian's sorcery and the &lt;a href=\"%3ARed%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;:Red Scepter Shard&lt;/a&gt; was taken from him. Vaelastrasz asked his allies to put him out of his misery and to retrieve his shard, so that the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; could be opened.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belnistrasz\"&gt;Belnistrasz&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; while investigating their presence. After being rescued, he asked the adventurers to assist him in shutting down the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s' operation there. In the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garek\"&gt;Garek&lt;/a&gt;, mortal servant of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, spied on the black dragonflight and searched for assistance in slaying the twin black drakes, &lt;a href=\"Blacklash\"&gt;Blacklash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hematus\"&gt;Hematus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Alexstrasza, &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, thought to have been lost during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, was found to be alive inside &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, along with the dragons &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; as slaves of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. The red dragon &lt;a href=\"Kandrostrasz\"&gt;Kandrostrasz&lt;/a&gt; came to Ahn'Qiraj after sensing his trapped brethren within, but he did not dare to enter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; from fear of falling under the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s control. During the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes managed to liberate Caelestrasz, and after they killed C'Thun, were sent by the red dragon to give the &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;:Eye of C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Battle of Grim Batol.\nOver a decade after Deathwing's defeat at the Battle of Grim Batol, the red dragonkin forces stationed outside the cursed fortress since the release of their queen, started falling ill, some even dying. A few went mad and had to be put down by their brothers and sisters. The red flight finally did as many others had done before them and abandoned the dark fortress of Grim Batol, unaware of the black dragon Sinestra deep within. Korialstrasz sensed something happening deep within the mountain and returned to Grim Batol to find the black consort in the midst of creating the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, thanks to Korialstrasz's allies, the sacrifice of the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, and the anger felt by &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; towards his \"mother\", &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; and her creation were defeated. The mountain was once again abandoned, unaware to anyone that Deathwing lurked still deeper within.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many members of the red dragonflight, led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her prime consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, could be found at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. They had to face the Scourge who began to besiege the surrounding &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s in an effort to raise new variations of &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Consequently, the red flight actively recruited heroes to aid &lt;a href=\"Ceristrasz\"&gt;Ceristrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vargastrasz\"&gt;Vargastrasz&lt;/a&gt; in arresting these invasions at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving awoken from madness, the Aspect of Magic, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, assessed that magic had run amok on Azeroth and that it had to be reined in, declaring the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; on all mortal spellcasters. He then began redirecting ley lines to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, with disastrous consequences, splintering the world's crust and opening up unstable rifts. The blue's increasingly militaristic methods were condemned by the red dragonflight, who vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups began actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign. When the blues dared attack &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the reds called upon the remaining dragonflights for assistance, creating the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Nexus War in full swing, the red dragonflight set up at &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Ledge\"&gt;Amber Ledge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, where they worked with the Kirin Tor to repel Malygos's forces. The red dragon &lt;a href=\"Surristrasz\"&gt;Surristrasz&lt;/a&gt; even allowed the mages to ride his &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s into battle. From there the red flight sent adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Transitus%20Shield\"&gt;Transitus Shield&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden camp deep inside the blue's ancient home of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;. On the island, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Keristrasza\"&gt;Keristrasza&lt;/a&gt; was incarcerated within one of the blue dragonflight's &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Arcane%20Prison\"&gt;augmented arcane prisons&lt;/a&gt;, as she refused to bow before the Aspect of Magic. After being released, she aided her rescuers by luring Malygos's consort, &lt;a href=\"Saragosa\"&gt;Saragosa&lt;/a&gt;, to her death. However, she was later captured by Malygos and taken into the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to serve as his unwilling consort, driving her into madness through torture and the use of magical runes. Another red dragon named &lt;a href=\"Belgaristrasz\"&gt;Belgaristrasz&lt;/a&gt; was also taken prisoner in the &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt;, he was later freed by the heroes and helped them to kill the agents of Malygos in the Nexus.\nAt the end of the conflict, Alexstrasza and the other Aspects saw no way to end the senseless violence other than destroying Malygos. In the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the Spellweaver was finally confronted in his realm where he was slain by the heroes and members of the Accord.\nAt some point, Korialstrasz discovered a clutch of &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; eggs within the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. The Red dragonflight asked the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to send adventurers to destroy them quickly. Not long after, all communication with the guardians in the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; ceased. The guards stationed at the portal were slain, and the mystic stones shattered. A black dragonflight war party, led by twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt; invaded the red sanctum killing all red dragonkin inside, except &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Guardian%20Xerestrasza\"&gt;Sanctum Guardian Xerestrasza&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, heroes were sent by Xerestrasza to kill Halion and the invaders.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; spread on the battlefield, a party of red dragons left &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, heading towards &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, the dragons breathed flames over the battlefield itself, cleansing it of the deadly plague, and destroyed the remaining catapults and forces loyal to Putress nearby. After completing their mission, they once again departed and returned to the temple some distance away.\nThe Nightmare.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasa provided desperately needed assistance to High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in her efforts to rescue &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;, as even her own consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; fell victim to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the &lt;a href=\"Unwaking\"&gt;Unwaking&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter their victory against the Nightmare, Alexstrasza, along with her sister &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, presided over Malfurion and Tyrande's marriage ceremony. Immediately after, the two Aspects blessed the new world tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; as they had done to Nordrassil ten thousand years before, a blessing which protected Teldrassil to its final day.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight once again allied with the other flights and the mortal races of Azeroth to confront the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; dragonflights, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s masters in the shadows.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, full-out warfare has erupted in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; between the black dragonflight and the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The Red dragonkin roosted at the wonderous &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; have come under attack by &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight drakes&lt;/a&gt;. The Black dragonkin roosted at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Forest\"&gt;Obsidian Forest&lt;/a&gt; were constantly under attack by the red flight led by &lt;a href=\"Velastrasza\"&gt;Velastrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tederastrasz\"&gt;Tederastrasz&lt;/a&gt;. The broodmother &lt;a href=\"Obsidia\"&gt;Obsidia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last mature and breeding black dragons, was targeted by the dragonspawn &lt;a href=\"Baleflame\"&gt;Baleflame&lt;/a&gt; who sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to slay her within &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Lair\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt;. Even the mighty Aspects themselves, Deathwing and Alexstrasza, become engaged in the battle over &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, as the Dragon Queen decided that the black dragonflight could not be saved and should be totally destroyed.\nOutside the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Lirastrasza\"&gt;Lirastrasza&lt;/a&gt; launched her own aggressive campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, while inside, the son of Alexstrasza &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificed himself during the battle against &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, giving the adventurers enough strength to finally vanquish the last consort of Deathwing.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acridostrasz\"&gt;Acridostrasz&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; in the red flight's infiltration of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, in order to save the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;Dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s captured for the experiments of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. In return for their help, Acridostrasz aided the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in stopping the black dragonflight and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from invading &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; to investigate why the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s activity there continued in spite of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. With the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, she managed to defeat the undead leader &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; and began to purge the Razorfen Downs with her flames.\nAt some point, the ambitious red dragon &lt;a href=\"Rheastrasza\"&gt;Rheastrasza&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; to research a way to purify the black dragonflight. She captured the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Nyxondra\"&gt;Nyxondra&lt;/a&gt;, and forced her to lay eggs for the experiments, in hopes of laying an uncorrupted black dragon egg. Eventually, Rheastrasza and &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Hieronymus%20Blam\"&gt;Dr. Hieronymus Blam&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in creating a purified black dragon egg but she was killed by Deathwing soon after, who was after the egg. However, the purified egg was hidden under the care of &lt;a href=\"Corastrasza\"&gt;Corastrasza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. Six months later, the egg was stolen by the assassins of &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the red dragonflight sent the red drake &lt;a href=\"Mostrasz\"&gt;Mostrasz&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to find it. The trail led them to &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; has hatched. As the only pure member of his dragonflight, Wrathion decided that it was his mission to make sure that all his corrupted brothers and sisters must be destroyed. He introduced himself to Mostrasz as his former prisoner, and ordered him to serve as a messenger to his flight, announcing that he was free from his father's corruption, that he intended to remain free, and that this warning was the first and the last.\nSome time after the Cataclysm, the red dragons convened upon Wyrmrest Temple to have their first meeting since the death of Malygos. Not particularly liked by many of the blues, Korialstrasz chose to stay behind to watch his newest clutch of eggs in the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. However, he discovered &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt;'s cultists casting dark spells on the eggs, and after confronting them, saw that they had mutated the hatchlings into deformed &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragons&lt;/a&gt;. When he touched a mutated egg, the infection passed on to him, and he learned that every flight's eggs, in each sanctum, were infected. In his last moments, Korialstrasz summoned every ounce of his power and exploded, utterly obliterating the sanctums with the thousands of corrupted eggs. While his death and apparent betrayal were a shock to the other dragonflights, Alexstrasza suffered the most. In sadness bordering on madness, she shattered the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; and fled to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for death. Later, Thrall had a vision where he saw the truth behind Korialstrasz's actions, and brought the news to Alexstrasza, who rejoined the fight against &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; with renewed purpose to not let her love's sacrifice be in vain.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing and his black and twilight dragons, aided by his Old God benefactors, laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, their flights, and the world shaman &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; agreed upon a course of action and fought to bring the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to bear against the Destroyer. All of them charged the artifact with their powers, and managed to destroy the Black Aspect once and for all before he could unleash a second cataclysm to destroy the world. However, the Aspects lost their immortality in the process and condemned their flight to no longer being able to reproduce. With all the dragonflights weakened, the Dragon Queen announced the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Mortals\"&gt;Age of Mortals&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of the Black Aspect, the red dragonflight attacked Ravenholdt Manor to kill Wrathion, but the latter managed to survive and killed Mostrasz himself. After the battle, the Black Prince announced that he would never be controlled, and that the red dragonflight had no idea what they unleashed when they had experimented on his egg.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; entered once again in the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt; a ritual to bring back &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; from the dead. As her previous attempt was not fully completed, she accompanied the adventurers and aided them personally to kill Blackthorn and Amnennar. After the battle, she took the lich's phylactery to the red dragonflight in order to find a way for its destruction.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to the regrown &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; to obtain information on &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;a great dragon skeleton&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Bolvar gave the Deathlord the choice of either sparing some dragons within or slaying them all. No matter their choice, the red dragons were aggressive to the Deathlord regardless. The whelps that resided within the regrown Sanctum were the very last red whelps there would ever be.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza tasked &lt;a href=\"Zallestrasza\"&gt;Zallestrasza&lt;/a&gt; with ensuring that the bones of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Vadekius\"&gt;Vadekius&lt;/a&gt;, who died in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; many centuries ago, could not be risen. The reds did not wish for a repeat of the horrible events at the Ruby Sanctum with the Ebon Blade. The death knight &lt;a href=\"Danir%20Emberlight\"&gt;Danir Emberlight&lt;/a&gt; attempted to raise Vadekius to be his mount, but he was fought off by an adventurer aiding Zallestrasza.\nFollowing the liberation of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; led an army of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonspawn\"&gt;Twilight dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, trying to corrupt or entice red dragons to join her cause.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, Alexstrasza and her flight felt the call to home and returned to the isles after ten thousand years. In the face of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening and the possibility of the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; being unleashed, Alexstrasza declared that they must reclaim their Aspect powers, and that their dragonflights must be made anew.\nThe Dragon Queen sent &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Selistra\"&gt;Majordomo Selistra&lt;/a&gt; to serve as her emissary to the arriving Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to the isles, with instructions to escort them to her at the &lt;a href=\"Life%20Pools\"&gt;Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Life Pools came under attack by Raszageth and her &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, and Alexstrasza ordered her flight to protect the eggs, before she flew off to personally confront Raszageth. As they clashed, she pleaded with Raszageth to see reason, to stop the fighting so they could have peace. However, Raszageth refused, pushed the blame for the war solely on the Aspects' shoulders, and wounded Alexstrasza, who found herself saved by Wrathion. An amused Raszageth decided to leave the pair, as she wanted Alexstrasza to watch as everything she cared for was destroyed before killing her.\nAfter being informed of the safety of the eggs by Selistra, Alexstrasza offered her gratitude to Wrathion, who was quick to recruit her flight's aid in claiming the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. But she refused and explained that her flight had to remain at the Life Pools to safeguard their future. The Black Prince questioned if it was the dragon's future or her flight that she sought to safeguard, and subsequently departed, determined to claim the citadel with only the aid of his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;. Concerned for Wrathion, she enlisted adventurers to aid him in her stead, while she focused on protecting the new generation of &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nMany members of the red flight still remain distrustful towards mortals, especially the orcs, citing they have brought only danger and death to the world. For the most part, it was the representatives of the flight near Grim Batol who acted strangely hostile to any outsiders.\nDescription.\nRed dragons once ruled as lords over all dragonkind. This nobility is reflected in every aspect of a red dragon, from its proud demeanor to its aura \u2014 one that inspires awe. It is as debilitating as the terrifying presence that other dragons possess, except that it overwhelms with a beatific aura.\nRed dragons exemplify the serenity of life and nature. Legends hold that the earth is renewed wherever a red dragon walks upon the earth or burns the soil with its flaming breath. Although they use fire to protect and punish, the flames always give way to new life.\nAge cycle.\nRed &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s are the youngest of red dragonkind. Scales resembling solid flame glisten on the small dragon's form. Although not great in size, she nevertheless has wicked claws, and her fangs are visible as she turns her head. Though clearly a predatory creature, the glint of wisdom and kindness shines in her eyes. These hatchlings are highly intelligent; unless newborn, they know enough about humanoid creatures to be friendly even when first encountered. They are suspicious of orcs, and avoid them if possible, due to the Horde's previous enslavement of the red flight. Those red whelps raised near Grim Batol are more aggressive due to the events that occurred there (and possibly for other reasons connected to the contents of the fortress).\nRed whelps flee combat if alone or clearly overwhelmed. If they are with a group, older whelps attack in order to give the younger children a chance to retreat; red dragons invariably put their own health and wellbeing second to that of a friend or loved one, even at this young age.\nRed whelps speak Common and Draconic.\nRed drakes are the adults of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and most are fully grown at this stage. Once friends to nearly every living creature, &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s are now much more suspicious, tending to seek only the company of their own kind. The capture of the Dragonqueen and the accompanying loss of a great number of their flight has left reds crippled, but not defeated. Although many reds feel they owe a debt of gratitude to the Alliance for its assistance in &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s rescue, others distrust all mortals, noting that even the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; once brought danger and death to the world. Generally, though, red dragons are friendly to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, and their other traditional friends and allies; for the most part, it is the representatives of the flight near &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; who are strangely hostile to any outsiders. Red drakes typically consider the various &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; races to be enemies, with the possible exception of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, whom they respect for their druidic abilities.\nThis dragon has a lithe frame; though large, the crimson drake is graceful and noble in form. The fiery horns atop the dragon's skull resemble a crown upon the head of a worthy king. Golden orbs scrutinize every motion, obviously judging whether one might be friend or foe.\nRed drakes are honorable and always fight on equitable terms if battling honorable or worthy opponents. For instance, they sacrifice their aerial advantage if their enemies meet them fairly on the ground. They quickly dispense with honor when facing those they consider dishonorable, however; such beings are to be expunged with every instinct and ability that red dragons possess. Red drakes use flame to entrap enemies and force them into difficult terrain, using their aerial advantage for greater mobility. They seek to destroy an opposing force's leadership first, ruining its command structure and hopefully setting the younger or less experienced combatants to flight. Like younger reds, drakes willingly put themselves at risk to protect a companion (or even more so, their eggs).\nRed drakes speak &lt;a href=\"Common\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;, and some speak other languages.\nRed dragons society.\nThe red flight was once charged with the protection of all living things on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In time, their vision became clouded. Humanoid races were in an uprising, and some red dragons insisted that they must make war upon them to protect the wilderness. Others believed that the mortal races could be allies to help in bettering the world. This led to a great schism within the red flight that has never been repaired. When their Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, went missing, the red dragons scattered in order to find her. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his black flight took this opportunity to attack the leaderless, scattered red flight. They fought back against the black flight and forced a detente, but doing so caused delays in looking for Alexstrasza. They soon found out that &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s held the Dragonqueen, and even were using the new generations of red dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, mortals helped free Alexstrasza, and the red flight resumed its ancient charge of defending Azeroth.\nCulture.\nThe term \"red dragon\" may refer to a member of the species regardless of age, or more specifically in place of \"mature\" to describe the adult phase of a red &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s lifecycle, between &lt;a href=\"Red%20drake\"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Red%20wyrm\"&gt;wyrm&lt;/a&gt;. They are 100-500 years old. Red dragons are associated with fire.\nCombat.\nRed dragons are honorable and fight on even terms if battling honorable or worthy opponents. They will sacrifice their aerial advantage if they are met fairly on the ground. The red dragon's wrath, however, dispenses with honor when facing those they consider dishonorable \u2014 any evil creatures, as well as orcs. Such beings are to be expunged with every instinct and ability that red dragons possess. Red dragons prefer to use flame to entrap enemies and force them to difficult terrain, using their aerial advantage for greater mobility. They prefer to destroy an opposing force's leadership first, ruining its power structure and hopefully setting the younger or less experienced combatants to flight.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; the red dragons were numerous and co-existed peacefully with the other dragonflights, working together to safeguard their world. But this age would not last forever.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the reds who had avoided capture by the orcs were initially bewildered to find their queen had gone missing. The flight scattered to search for her, becoming easy prey for the vicious Deathwing and his black dragonflight. Isolated, leaderless, and confused, the reds fought back as best they could. When the blacks had been sufficiently pushed back the reds resumed their search and found the orcs were responsible for Alexstrasza and the rest of the flight's disappearance and were using her offspring as pawns in the Second War.\nEventually, all but a few members of the red dragonflight were freed from the Dragonmaw Clan's control.\nGuardians were placed outside Grim Batol under the leadership of the wyrm &lt;a href=\"Garshilan\"&gt;Garshilan&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by the eager young dragon &lt;a href=\"Acridistrasz\"&gt;Acridistrasz&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20%28dragonspawn%29\"&gt;dragonspawn flametongue&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;a href=\"Baleflame\"&gt;Baleflame&lt;/a&gt;, and legions of red dragonspawn eager to guard the remnants of the red dragonflight. Explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; managed to speak with Acridistrasz and was told the reds were \"guarding a secret that living creatures are not meant to know.\"\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, red dragons were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where they, along with the blues, greens, and bronzes, guarded the World Tree from another attack by the remnants of the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. In addition red and green dragons were sent to &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Grove\"&gt;Sunwell Grove&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and safeguard the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "21803", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21803", "title": "Red dragonflight", "text": "The red dragonflight is a draconic &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; primarily led by the eponymous &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to uphold their creed to the world. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the Life-Binder, whom the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; charged with protecting life. The red dragonflight wishes to protect all life on Azeroth as their queen does, and does not hesitate to fight anyone who wishes to harm the world, notably the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The flight is made up not only of the red dragons, but also of their mortal followers and dragonkin as well; the majority of whom share scale colors with the flight.\nFollowing the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, they held a deep-seated rivalry with the corrupted &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, as they found their cruel ways profane against life. For centuries, the red dragonflight slowly recovered from its losses and continued to fulfill its duty of protecting the world. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza and the majority of her flight were enslaved by the Black Aspect with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, and were reduced to become living weapons for the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Queen and her flight were finally freed from slavery by the Alliance, and after taking revenge on their tormentors, they disappeared to recover after years of suffering.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, all the dragonflights founded the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s declaration of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, and had to eliminate the Aspect of Magic before he doomed Azeroth and all its magic users. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the return of Deathwing, the red dragonflight once again allied with the other flights and the mortal races of Azeroth to confront the black and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; dragonflights, and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;masters&lt;/a&gt; in the shadows. During the final battle, Alexstrasza and the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed their titanic powers to defeat their fallen brother, losing their immortality in the process and condemning their flight to no longer being able to reproduce. With all the dragonflights weakened, the Dragon Queen announced the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Mortals\"&gt;Age of Mortals&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years, the red dragonflight continued to help the mortal races against the enemies of Azeroth. When the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, Alexstrasza and her flight felt its call and returned to their home after ten thousand years. However, a new conflict began against their ancient enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, and Alexstrasza seeks to regain her powers to protect the flights from the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\n\"The red dragonflight, ruled by the Dragonqueen, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, is a noble and honorable group of creatures. They consider themselves the protectors of all life, and in many ways they are. More often than not, they are found protecting sacred areas and items, seeking to keep them from lesser beings who might be hurt by their energies. Their breath is a fearsome stream of fire, and they have been known to swallow enemies whole and slowly digest them over the course of a day. Their most hated enemies are the black dragons ruled by the great, dark leviathan, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nRed dragons have always concerned themselves with maintaining the harmony and prosperity of life, the task entrusted to them by the Creators. They consider themselves the custodians and defenders of life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but they will not hesitate to kill a creature if its actions endanger other lives. Red dragons understand the secrets of life, and in turn, those of death, like none others do and have been granted great power over both. They are capable of rejuvenating and draining life, as well as performing a form of necromancy, though only as a last resort, as they are not fond of doing so. The breath of red dragons burns but also rejuvenates, and whenever a red dragon walks or breathes upon the soil, the earth is renewed. Their domain is the fire that gives both life and death. A red dragon would never hurt a soul, unless they tried to hurt them first.\nThe red dragonflight is charged with the preservation and nurturing of all dragons, to the point that bringing &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; eggs into their &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Life Pools&lt;/a&gt; revitalized the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Oathstone\"&gt;Ruby Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reds are utterly loyal to their Aspect, Alexstrasza, who along with her consorts such as &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, are treated with great respect by the reds and the other flights. They are friendly to humans, elves, and their other traditional allies, and are typically the only dragons mortals are likely to encounter, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic allies of the greens. Like all dragons, they take their charges seriously and usually operate in secret, keeping tabs on important beings, organizations, and places, such as &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the red flight represents the aspect of life, their blood has healing properties. Red dragonkin are sometimes referred to as Crimson, Ruby, or Vermillion.\nNomenclature.\nMembers of the red dragonflight most often have names ending in \"strasz\" for males, or \"strasza\" for females.\nMembership.\nThe red dragonflight is primarily made up of, as the name implies, red dragonkin. These include the red dragons themselves, but also red-scaled variants of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nMortals also serve as part of the Red dragonflight, such as the high elf &lt;a href=\"Garek\"&gt;Garek&lt;/a&gt; who was a servant to the red dragon, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dahlia%20Suntouch\"&gt;Dahlia Suntouch&lt;/a&gt;, a high elf, served as the tender of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; until her death and resurrection as an undead by the Scourge.\nGuises.\nWhen taking humanoid form, most red dragons prefer to transform into &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; guises are also common.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nAccording to legends, before the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s departed Azeroth, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the red, held dominion over their brethren and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;, the titan patron of all life, gave a portion of her power to the red leviathan. Ever after, Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, and she would work to safeguard all living creatures within the world. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.\nIn truth, in Azeroth's ancient past, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza faced Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. After killing Galakrond, Alexstrasza and the others were approached by the other Keepers, and Tyr suggested empowering the proto-dragons to make them defenders of Azeroth, as they proved they were able to stand for the planet. Only &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, and forbid the other Keepers to proceed with that idea, but they decided to go against him. They reached out to the Pantheon and each of the titans blessed the proto-dragons with a portion of their vast power, channeled through the Keepers. They became majestic beings called &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and among them, Alexstrasza became the Aspect of Life and the Queen of the dragons while her red dragonflight was charged with the task of watching over all life on Azeroth, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. One of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that the titans created them from Galakrond, to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nWar of the Ancients.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight resided in a series of large caverns deep inside towering mountains, with hundreds of great gaps in every cliff leading to their realm. The caverns were large enough even for a leviathan like &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; to fly through. Alexstrasza's chambers were filled with plants and flowers that should have not been able to grow there, such as roses and orchids. Most of the peaks were high enough to be above the clouds and to have a permanent snow cap. The &lt;a href=\"Grotto%20of%20Shadow%20Rose\"&gt;Grotto of Shadow Rose&lt;/a&gt; was part of the lair.\nWhen the Highborne opened the portal for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, all the dragonflights left the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. On the battlefield, Neltharion led the dragon forces, consuming the demons under their fiery breaths, but their strength was not enough. As the other Aspects began to despair, the Black Aspect suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the Legion. The Dragon Queen and the other Aspects had nothing but the utmost respect for wise Neltharion, and they accepted without hesitation his plan to give much of their own essence toward the creation of this object, which was called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion and his flight, however, had secretly refrained from imparting any of their own power. During the time of the Dragon Soul's empowerment, the area where the ritual took place was surrounded by a giant, impenetrable magical barrier as Neltharion didn't want anything or anyone to stop the ritual. This barrier was guarded from the inside by dragons from all flights.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The blacks joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion then scattered the hundreds of other assembled dragons before retreating from the field of battle, taking the Dragon Soul with him. Thus Neltharion became Deathwing the Destroyer, the Dragon Soul was renamed the \"Demon Soul\", and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt; begun.\nThe black dragonflight's actions left their former allies wounded and shocked, and Alexstrasza and the noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing's betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, most of all the blacks, and the reds were no exception. Some dragons call this time period the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt;, though others including mortals may know it by other names. Even though it was everyone against the black flight, easily outnumbering them, it was incredibly emotionally hard for the dragons because they had to fight their friends and loved ones, people they had known and grown up with. The black dragonflight was hunted down and nearly annihilated, all but slain because of Deathwing's mad plots.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. The trio later visited the Night Elven survivors to present the devastated race a gift. Alexstrasza produced a single enchanted acorn, taken from the Mother Tree &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, and placed it within the new &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The acorn, activated by the potent, magical waters, sprung to life as a colossal tree whose mighty roots grew from the well's waters, and its verdant canopy seemed to scrape the roof of the sky. The tree also received blessings from &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. It would safeguard the new Well of Eternity from discovery and come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA thousand years before modern times, the red dragons lent their aid to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a child of Alexstrasza, the reds fought the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters furiously and ultimately helped push them back to their city where they were sealed away from the world. The dragons suffered few casualties but the progeny of Alexstrasza, Caelestrasz, was believed lost, having charged deep into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; during the final push. After the war, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to the red wyrm &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; the bronze.\nUnbeknownst to his flight, Caelestrasz, along with Arygos and Merithra, was not dead, simply captured. The dark master of Ahn'Qiraj used the tortured dragons to power his new creations: &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;Obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing finally found a way to conquer his greatest rivals. While he couldn't wield the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; himself it could be placed in the hands of one that would further his agenda. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; received visions of a powerful artifact deep within the earth and with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s permission took his clan to search for their source. Zuluhed took the Demon Soul for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but while he sensed the disk had the power to raise mountains and evaporate oceans, it was unresponsive to his shamanistic powers. The device was passed down to his lieutenant: the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, whose magic the disk eagerly reciprocated. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; searched for weeks for the dragons, finally spotting a lone wounded red male. They followed the dragon back to the red flight's lair, a high mountain peak, where they came upon the Dragonqueen herself, roosting with three consorts. The Aspect immediately incinerated four orc warriors before Nekros invoked the dark powers of the disk and subdued her. The Demon Soul was used to enslave Alexstrasza and a large portion of her flight.\nFrom capture to escape, an eight year span, Alexstrasza was forced to create more dragons to service the Horde in the war, and she cried for the deaths of her children and the deaths they caused. Two of her consorts did not survive long, one perishing while trying to escape over the sea and the other dying of injuries inflicted by Deathwing, while her fourth and youngest avoided capture altogether. This left Alexstrasza with only her prime consort, Tyranastrasz, to produce dragons with for the orcs. She often tried to defy Nekros, but the act of breaking one or more eggs in her presence assured her good behavior. The red dragonflight, once one of the strongest and proudest flights of dragons ever seen, were reduced to being the Horde's war dogs. The Horde quickly learned how to utilize the great leviathans, and they were forced to wreak havoc throughout the lands of the Alliance, committing destructive acts such as setting the forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; ablaze, and the complete destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;third fleet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Those red dragons who were becoming too powerful to be properly controlled were slain on the spot by the Dragonmaw orcs. The Alliance responded to the dragons with dwarven &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, the two often meeting in the dogfights over Lordaeron and Khaz Modan. Throughout most of the Second War, and even a few years after its end, the settlements of the Alliance lived in constant fear of coming under attack by red dragons.\nOutraged, many of the red dragons who had avoided capture wanted to make war against all the lesser races but her youngest consort, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as the mage Krasus of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, sought a way to free his mate.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nDespite the Horde's defeat at the end of the Second War, the Dragonmaw Clan retained a firm grip on Grim Batol and Alexstrasza. Korialstrasz approached the other Aspects for assistance, but was continually rebuffed time after time. Using his guise of Krasus, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, he set a plan into motion. He sent his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; on a secret mission to Grim Batol.\nWhen Nekros believed the Alliance planned on invading, he had Alexstrasza and her eggs moved out of the mountain fortress and began a march towards &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt; where he believed the bulk of the Dragonmaw Clan was stationed. Little did he know he had been manipulated by Deathwing, who desired Alexstrasza's eggs out in the open to steal them more easily. When Deathwing appeared Nekros sent &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; to face him, but the old red did not last long against the dark aspect. Deathwing began stealing Alexstrasza's eggs only to be stalled by the sudden arrival of the other Aspects, who proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexstrasza swore an oath of friendship to Rhonin, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt;, and their respective races. With their queen returned to them, the remaining members of the red dragonflight came out of hiding and reassumed their ancient charge of defending the wild things of the world. One of their first actions was to station guardians outside their queen's former prison.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the red dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Many red dragons however, still remained slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. These members of the red flight were used by the orcs to vainly fight against the Scourge, led by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27thuzad\"&gt;Kel'thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who were seeking control of the clan's functional &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Gate\"&gt;Demon Gate&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; also came across a red dragon being attacked by harpies in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon had in his possession the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Aszune\"&gt;Heart of Aszune&lt;/a&gt;, needed by the Warchief to access the lair of the Oracle.\nThe Sunwell.\nFollowing the Third War, which had ravaged the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and cost the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; their fabled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; took it upon himself to gather the remaining energy of the well and transform it into a living avatar in the form of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. When the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; tried to claim her power as his own, Korialstrasz intervened, only to be subjected to Dar'Khan's mind control. The blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; engaged Korialstrasz in battle while &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his allies managed to defeat the traitorous elf, free Korialstrasz, and safeguard the energy of the Sunwell.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFor ten thousand years, Deathwing's fellow Dragon Aspects had lived without the full measure of their power, and the sudden return of their strength was physically and mentally exhausting. Needing to recover from this and her traumatic ordeal under the Dragonmaw, Alexstrasza and her flight sequestered themselves away to heal, both physically and emotionally. As such, even as her consorts and children continued to have their impact on Azeroth, Alexstrasza's whereabouts were unknown to most, though &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; seemed to know where she resided at the time. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; asked her to bless the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, but the Dragonqueen refused.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight had a strong presence at Alexstrasza's old prison, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Their guardianship of the fortress could be seen, with legions of dragonspawn and the drake-champion &lt;a href=\"Axtroz\"&gt;Axtroz&lt;/a&gt; stationed outside at the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt;. Further down the mountain, the remains of the orcish caravan teamed with newly hatched red whelps. They were later targeted by a Horde adventurer sent by the black drake &lt;a href=\"Emberstrife\"&gt;Emberstrife&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; was secretly working against &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. He assisted &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their black dragonflight allies. Upon breaching &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, Vaelastrasz succumbed to Nefarian's sorcery and the &lt;a href=\"%3ARed%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;:Red Scepter Shard&lt;/a&gt; was taken from him. Vaelastrasz asked his allies to put him out of his misery and to retrieve his shard, so that the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; could be opened.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belnistrasz\"&gt;Belnistrasz&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; while investigating their presence. After being rescued, he asked the adventurers to assist him in shutting down the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s' operation there. In the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garek\"&gt;Garek&lt;/a&gt;, mortal servant of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, spied on the black dragonflight and searched for assistance in slaying the twin black drakes, &lt;a href=\"Blacklash\"&gt;Blacklash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hematus\"&gt;Hematus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Alexstrasza, &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, thought to have been lost during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, was found to be alive inside &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, along with the dragons &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; as slaves of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. The red dragon &lt;a href=\"Kandrostrasz\"&gt;Kandrostrasz&lt;/a&gt; came to Ahn'Qiraj after sensing his trapped brethren within, but he did not dare to enter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; from fear of falling under the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s control. During the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes managed to liberate Caelestrasz, and after they killed C'Thun, were sent by the red dragon to give the &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;:Eye of C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Battle of Grim Batol.\nOver a decade after Deathwing's defeat at the Battle of Grim Batol, the red dragonkin forces stationed outside the cursed fortress since the release of their queen, started falling ill, some even dying. A few went mad and had to be put down by their brothers and sisters. The red flight finally did as many others had done before them and abandoned the dark fortress of Grim Batol, unaware of the black dragon Sinestra deep within. Korialstrasz sensed something happening deep within the mountain and returned to Grim Batol to find the black consort in the midst of creating the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, thanks to Korialstrasz's allies, the sacrifice of the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, and the anger felt by &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; towards his \"mother\", &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; and her creation were defeated. The mountain was once again abandoned, unaware to anyone that Deathwing lurked still deeper within.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many members of the red dragonflight, led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and her prime consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, could be found at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. They had to face the Scourge who began to besiege the surrounding &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s in an effort to raise new variations of &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Consequently, the red flight actively recruited heroes to aid &lt;a href=\"Ceristrasz\"&gt;Ceristrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vargastrasz\"&gt;Vargastrasz&lt;/a&gt; in arresting these invasions at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving awoken from madness, the Aspect of Magic, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, assessed that magic had run amok on Azeroth and that it had to be reined in, declaring the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; on all mortal spellcasters. He then began redirecting ley lines to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, with disastrous consequences, splintering the world's crust and opening up unstable rifts. The blue's increasingly militaristic methods were condemned by the red dragonflight, who vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups began actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign. When the blues dared attack &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the reds called upon the remaining dragonflights for assistance, creating the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Nexus War in full swing, the red dragonflight set up at &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Ledge\"&gt;Amber Ledge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, where they worked with the Kirin Tor to repel Malygos's forces. The red dragon &lt;a href=\"Surristrasz\"&gt;Surristrasz&lt;/a&gt; even allowed the mages to ride his &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s into battle. From there the red flight sent adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Transitus%20Shield\"&gt;Transitus Shield&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden camp deep inside the blue's ancient home of &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;. On the island, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Keristrasza\"&gt;Keristrasza&lt;/a&gt; was incarcerated within one of the blue dragonflight's &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Arcane%20Prison\"&gt;augmented arcane prisons&lt;/a&gt;, as she refused to bow before the Aspect of Magic. After being released, she aided her rescuers by luring Malygos's consort, &lt;a href=\"Saragosa\"&gt;Saragosa&lt;/a&gt;, to her death. However, she was later captured by Malygos and taken into the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to serve as his unwilling consort, driving her into madness through torture and the use of magical runes. Another red dragon named &lt;a href=\"Belgaristrasz\"&gt;Belgaristrasz&lt;/a&gt; was also taken prisoner in the &lt;a href=\"Oculus\"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt;, he was later freed by the heroes and helped them to kill the agents of Malygos in the Nexus.\nAt the end of the conflict, Alexstrasza and the other Aspects saw no way to end the senseless violence other than destroying Malygos. In the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the Spellweaver was finally confronted in his realm where he was slain by the heroes and members of the Accord.\nAt some point, Korialstrasz discovered a clutch of &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; eggs within the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. The Red dragonflight asked the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to send adventurers to destroy them quickly. Not long after, all communication with the guardians in the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; ceased. The guards stationed at the portal were slain, and the mystic stones shattered. A black dragonflight war party, led by twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt; invaded the red sanctum killing all red dragonkin inside, except &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Guardian%20Xerestrasza\"&gt;Sanctum Guardian Xerestrasza&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, heroes were sent by Xerestrasza to kill Halion and the invaders.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; spread on the battlefield, a party of red dragons left &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, heading towards &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, the dragons breathed flames over the battlefield itself, cleansing it of the deadly plague, and destroyed the remaining catapults and forces loyal to Putress nearby. After completing their mission, they once again departed and returned to the temple some distance away.\nThe Nightmare.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasa provided desperately needed assistance to High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in her efforts to rescue &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;, as even her own consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; fell victim to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the &lt;a href=\"Unwaking\"&gt;Unwaking&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter their victory against the Nightmare, Alexstrasza, along with her sister &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, presided over Malfurion and Tyrande's marriage ceremony. Immediately after, the two Aspects blessed the new world tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; as they had done to Nordrassil ten thousand years before, a blessing which protected Teldrassil to its final day.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the return of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragonflight once again allied with the other flights and the mortal races of Azeroth to confront the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight&lt;/a&gt; dragonflights, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s masters in the shadows.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, full-out warfare has erupted in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; between the black dragonflight and the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The Red dragonkin roosted at the wonderous &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; have come under attack by &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight drakes&lt;/a&gt;. The Black dragonkin roosted at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Forest\"&gt;Obsidian Forest&lt;/a&gt; were constantly under attack by the red flight led by &lt;a href=\"Velastrasza\"&gt;Velastrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tederastrasz\"&gt;Tederastrasz&lt;/a&gt;. The broodmother &lt;a href=\"Obsidia\"&gt;Obsidia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last mature and breeding black dragons, was targeted by the dragonspawn &lt;a href=\"Baleflame\"&gt;Baleflame&lt;/a&gt; who sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to slay her within &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Lair\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt;. Even the mighty Aspects themselves, Deathwing and Alexstrasza, become engaged in the battle over &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, as the Dragon Queen decided that the black dragonflight could not be saved and should be totally destroyed.\nOutside the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Lirastrasza\"&gt;Lirastrasza&lt;/a&gt; launched her own aggressive campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, while inside, the son of Alexstrasza &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificed himself during the battle against &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, giving the adventurers enough strength to finally vanquish the last consort of Deathwing.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acridostrasz\"&gt;Acridostrasz&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; in the red flight's infiltration of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, in order to save the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;Dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s captured for the experiments of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. In return for their help, Acridostrasz aided the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in stopping the black dragonflight and the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from invading &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; to investigate why the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s activity there continued in spite of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. With the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, she managed to defeat the undead leader &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; and began to purge the Razorfen Downs with her flames.\nAt some point, the ambitious red dragon &lt;a href=\"Rheastrasza\"&gt;Rheastrasza&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; to research a way to purify the black dragonflight. She captured the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Nyxondra\"&gt;Nyxondra&lt;/a&gt;, and forced her to lay eggs for the experiments, in hopes of laying an uncorrupted black dragon egg. Eventually, Rheastrasza and &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Hieronymus%20Blam\"&gt;Dr. Hieronymus Blam&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in creating a purified black dragon egg but she was killed by Deathwing soon after, who was after the egg. However, the purified egg was hidden under the care of &lt;a href=\"Corastrasza\"&gt;Corastrasza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. Six months later, the egg was stolen by the assassins of &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the red dragonflight sent the red drake &lt;a href=\"Mostrasz\"&gt;Mostrasz&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to find it. The trail led them to &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; has hatched. As the only pure member of his dragonflight, Wrathion decided that it was his mission to make sure that all his corrupted brothers and sisters must be destroyed. He introduced himself to Mostrasz as his former prisoner, and ordered him to serve as a messenger to his flight, announcing that he was free from his father's corruption, that he intended to remain free, and that this warning was the first and the last.\nSome time after the Cataclysm, the red dragons convened upon Wyrmrest Temple to have their first meeting since the death of Malygos. Not particularly liked by many of the blues, Korialstrasz chose to stay behind to watch his newest clutch of eggs in the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. However, he discovered &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt;'s cultists casting dark spells on the eggs, and after confronting them, saw that they had mutated the hatchlings into deformed &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragons&lt;/a&gt;. When he touched a mutated egg, the infection passed on to him, and he learned that every flight's eggs, in each sanctum, were infected. In his last moments, Korialstrasz summoned every ounce of his power and exploded, utterly obliterating the sanctums with the thousands of corrupted eggs. While his death and apparent betrayal were a shock to the other dragonflights, Alexstrasza suffered the most. In sadness bordering on madness, she shattered the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; and fled to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for death. Later, Thrall had a vision where he saw the truth behind Korialstrasz's actions, and brought the news to Alexstrasza, who rejoined the fight against &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; with renewed purpose to not let her love's sacrifice be in vain.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing and his black and twilight dragons, aided by his Old God benefactors, laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, their flights, and the world shaman &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; agreed upon a course of action and fought to bring the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to bear against the Destroyer. All of them charged the artifact with their powers, and managed to destroy the Black Aspect once and for all before he could unleash a second cataclysm to destroy the world. However, the Aspects lost their immortality in the process and condemned their flight to no longer being able to reproduce. With all the dragonflights weakened, the Dragon Queen announced the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Mortals\"&gt;Age of Mortals&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of the Black Aspect, the red dragonflight attacked Ravenholdt Manor to kill Wrathion, but the latter managed to survive and killed Mostrasz himself. After the battle, the Black Prince announced that he would never be controlled, and that the red dragonflight had no idea what they unleashed when they had experimented on his egg.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; entered once again in the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt; a ritual to bring back &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; from the dead. As her previous attempt was not fully completed, she accompanied the adventurers and aided them personally to kill Blackthorn and Amnennar. After the battle, she took the lich's phylactery to the red dragonflight in order to find a way for its destruction.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to the regrown &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; to obtain information on &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;a great dragon skeleton&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Bolvar gave the Deathlord the choice of either sparing some dragons within or slaying them all. No matter their choice, the red dragons were aggressive to the Deathlord regardless. The whelps that resided within the regrown Sanctum were the very last red whelps there would ever be.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza tasked &lt;a href=\"Zallestrasza\"&gt;Zallestrasza&lt;/a&gt; with ensuring that the bones of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Vadekius\"&gt;Vadekius&lt;/a&gt;, who died in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; many centuries ago, could not be risen. The reds did not wish for a repeat of the horrible events at the Ruby Sanctum with the Ebon Blade. The death knight &lt;a href=\"Danir%20Emberlight\"&gt;Danir Emberlight&lt;/a&gt; attempted to raise Vadekius to be his mount, but he was fought off by an adventurer aiding Zallestrasza.\nFollowing the liberation of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; led an army of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonspawn\"&gt;Twilight dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, trying to corrupt or entice red dragons to join her cause.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, Alexstrasza and her flight felt the call to home and returned to the isles after ten thousand years. In the face of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening and the possibility of the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; being unleashed, Alexstrasza declared that they must reclaim their Aspect powers, and that their dragonflights must be made anew.\nThe Dragon Queen sent &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Selistra\"&gt;Majordomo Selistra&lt;/a&gt; to serve as her emissary to the arriving Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to the isles, with instructions to escort them to her at the &lt;a href=\"Life%20Pools\"&gt;Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Life Pools came under attack by Raszageth and her &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, and Alexstrasza ordered her flight to protect the eggs, before she flew off to personally confront Raszageth. As they clashed, she pleaded with Raszageth to see reason, to stop the fighting so they could have peace. However, Raszageth refused, pushed the blame for the war solely on the Aspects' shoulders, and wounded Alexstrasza, who found herself saved by Wrathion. An amused Raszageth decided to leave the pair, as she wanted Alexstrasza to watch as everything she cared for was destroyed before killing her.\nAfter being informed of the safety of the eggs by Selistra, Alexstrasza offered her gratitude to Wrathion, who was quick to recruit her flight's aid in claiming the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. But she refused and explained that her flight had to remain at the Life Pools to safeguard their future. The Black Prince questioned if it was the dragon's future or her flight that she sought to safeguard, and subsequently departed, determined to claim the citadel with only the aid of his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;. Concerned for Wrathion, she enlisted adventurers to aid him in her stead, while she focused on protecting the new generation of &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;dragonkind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Molok ordered the disease created after the ogres discovered legends about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and they began experimenting with ways to induce a similar affliction among the orcs. Red pox is a highly contagious, wasting disease that kills many who are afflicted. The respected shaman &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; learned from the elements that this was not a natural disease, but a weapon by the ogres. With so many orcs sick, the shaman of the clans resorted to asking the elements for aid against Goria. Even after Goria's destruction, the disease would never truly go away, returning in plagues every few generations.\nCenturies later, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; used his magic to spread the worst outbreak in orcish history, killing hundreds in a matter of months. Many victims were infected during a &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20festival\"&gt;Kosh'harg festival&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prevent the virulent plague from spreading to new victims, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; urged &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; and the other infected orcs to remain in Nagrand. They constructed a new village, led by Garad before the red pox consumed him. After he died, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; cared for them and named the village &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in his honor.\nThe pox's main symptoms were red pustules welling up on the skin, seeping a watery red fluid, and also the vomiting of blood. The disease was debilitating and affected many remaining \"brown orcs.\" Those who suffered heavily perished within a matter of weeks.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; arrived at an internment village he found many, including &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom&lt;/a&gt;, affected by this disease. Nagrand had by that time become the home of the sick and weakened, but remained the most vibrant place on the otherwise dying world of Draenor (although it was not completely free of the corruption having suffered from long droughts). The &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; chieftain sneered at them for their \"weakness\" and made his way back to the battle.\nThe red pox would later be modified by the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and melded with their &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies. They released the modified disease on &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to fight its &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; defenders. The fel plague was loaded into crude bombs and lobbed at Shattrath. After the explosions, the mixture turned into a red mist. When its vapors reached them, the draenei immediately began choking. The draenei that survived the exposure of the mist were cut off from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and later transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt; draenei. The most well-known survivors are &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIt would appear that the red pox is part of the reason for the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; and Nagrand escaping corruption; the other clans were likely to have given the afflicted a wide berth, thus they were never exposed to warlock magic. It should be noted that according to \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Rise of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" tribes living in Nagrand had not completely escaped corruption and that Nagrand itself suffered effects of the corruption but not nearly to the extent seen everywhere else on the planet.\nThe red pox might have made the orcs who caught it immune from the effects of fel magic, as well as the land. Though not clearly stated, &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, and most Mag'har appearing in-game were probably also afflicted by the disease. The red pox has apparently been cured by the time of \"\"."}

It is one of three bosses that can spawn after clearing most of the trash in the area.\nStrategy.\nSplit up in two camps. Pulling him out from his room into the room leading to his, the MT was tanking Shadikith with his back against the wall to avoid being knocked back. The rangedps and healers stood with their backs against another wall at the opposite side of the room with the 2nd tank standing by them ready to taunt Shadikith away from the healers and rangedps and moving him back to the MT who then taunted Shadikith back to himself. Besides this it is a very easy tank and spank fight. Just keeping the MT topped off to prevent \"unlucky\" situations when he uses his silence ability. \nAlternative Strategy.\nPull the boss to a recently cleared large room. A hunter with misdirection is very valuable here and can pull the boss to the beginning of the instance if there is no suitable room in which to fight the boss. Do not attempt to kite this boss any significant distance to a raid, as it is extremely fast, however, attacking the boss then vanishing is a viable means of pulling the boss to the rest of the raid.\nA tank and an offtank should stand in opposite corners of the room, with all casters in the center and melee dps following the boss and attempting to stay in front of it with their backs to walls. Because the boss charges the member of the raid who is farthest away at the time, this will always be a tank, and each tank is in healing range at all times. The offtank should attempt to gain some level of threat immediately, in case the boss has just wiped the aggro from the main tank. This happens 1-2 times per fight, and in each case, it appears that the boss has wiped aggro from everyone immediately before charging, as he does not attempt to attack healers or dps leaders. If a sufficiently large room is chosen, casters will never be silenced by the AoE silence effect, so healing is never interrupted. Additionally, the only people affected by the AoE knockback will be any melee dps who have not managed to get to the boss's front side and place their backs to a wall. Melee dps should not attempt to chase the boss unless it switches aggro from the main tank to the offtank, as it will usually return to the main tank immediately after charging."}

The Shado-Pan are in a timeless struggle with the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. As Pandaria has no standing army, it falls to them to defend the land, so other pandaren can go about their peaceful lives. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Lorewalkers&lt;/a&gt;, the Shado-Pan have little time for conversations not directly related to the defense of the pandaren.\nHopeful recruits who wish to join the Shado-Pan must undergo a trial named the Trial of the Red Blossoms every seven seasons when the trees of the monastery turn red. The trial consists of three challenges, which are simple, but also deadly. The Shado-Pan are allied with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the arduous joining process, it is possible to retire from the Shado-Pan.\nHistory.\nThe Shado-Pan order, originally consisting of one-hundred warriors was founded by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 years ago under a charter, just before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; occurred. He knew that the dark energy of the sha - the physical embodiment of negative emotions like &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;hatred&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;doubt&lt;/a&gt; - represented a great threat to the pandaren if allowed to fester beneath the land. He tasked the greatest warriors of Pandaria with the sacred duty to restrain and control the sha, and to defeat it wherever it darkens the hearts of their people. And so it was that mere hours after Emperor Shaohao bested his own anger, hatred, and violence, the first of the Shado-Pan took their knee and spoke an oath to the Last Emperor. The same words have been spoken to the Lord of the Shado-Pan by every Shado-Pan initiate who has passed the Trial of the Red Blossoms ever since.\nMists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the Shado-Pan, bore witness to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; arriving within the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and urged both sides not to bring their wars or even to give into their darkest penchants within Pandaria. This order was ignored, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s recruited &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;denizens&lt;/a&gt; to their side and led them into battle, which ultimately unleashed the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; upon the land. While the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; gained control of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt;, and under her command the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; began to swarm the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; and even attack the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. As a result that Shado-Pan were not only caught off-guard by the mantid's attack but had to endure a yaungol invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven as the Shado-Pan accepted the aid of Horde and Alliance forces to push back these, they couldn't help but notice the lack of reinforcements and word from the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. An investigation by &lt;a href=\"Ban%20Bearheart\"&gt;Ban Bearheart&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Lord Taran Zhu and the Shado-Pan of the monastery had fallen prey to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. After expelling the Sha from the Monastery, it fled into the Townlong Steppes and the Shado-Pan gave chase to it. While in the region the Shado-Pan would clash with the invading mantid and discover that the Sha had provoked Yaungol tribes into fighting with one another. The Shado-Pan tracked down and destroyed the Sha of Hatred in spite of several setbacks. With the direst threat gone, Taran Zhu would depart from the region but the Shado-Pan would remain and recruit adventurers into combating the invading mantid, combating the yaungol (both alive and the restless spirits) and even the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; in the northern region.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, the Shado-Pan launched an &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; upon the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; in order to put an end to the mogu-Zandalari threat.\nVol'jin: Shadows of the Horde.\nThe Shado-Pan monks took care of the wounded &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; after being brought to the monastery by &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the Shado-Pan conducted campaigns against the invading &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and ultimately defended the monastery against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Shado-Pan sent several warriors to to aid in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, despite their small numbers. They found a fitting adversary in the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, whose deadly dance made use of winds similar to those which lighten the steps of the Shado-Pan themselves.\nLegion.\nThe Shado-Pan defend the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt; from an attack by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Taoshi joins the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, Taran Zhu joins the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and Yalia Sagewhisper joins the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral monks including &lt;a href=\"Tau%20Li\"&gt;Tau Li&lt;/a&gt; arrived to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; to teach the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; the ways of the monk. &lt;a href=\"Ji-Sun\"&gt;Ji-Sun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Young%20Su\"&gt;Young Su&lt;/a&gt; also arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; to train the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Warport%20Rastari\"&gt;Warport Rastari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; the Shado-Pan infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Kao-Tien\"&gt;Kao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; mogu that were aiding the Zandalari uprising led by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from its prison, the Shado-Pan worked together with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; to protect the Vale of Eternal Blossoms from invaders.\nOrganization.\nThe Lord of the Shado-Pan is the leader of the order, currently &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; (and before him, his father). The rest of the order is divided into three \"disciplines\", each headed by a Master, who reports directly to the Lord. Shado-Pan-in-training are acolytes, who wear white scarves, while the main forces wear red scarves.\nWhen a pandaren becomes fully Shado-Pan, the monk travels with one of the order's master artisans deep below the earth into the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai&lt;/a&gt; mountains and marks out a little piece of the mountain's bones. The artisan then carves it into the monk's likeness, leaving it connected to the bone. When the monk dies, the statue breaks free. All such statues are gathered and stored in the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; so that all may remember those who came before.\nOmnia.\nThe Omnia discipline is led by Master &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt;. They are charged with maintaining the wisdom, knowledge, and sacred traditions of the order. Classes known to be in this discipline include &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Omnia%20Mage\"&gt;Omnia Mage&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; holding open a portal between the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Dao\"&gt;Shan'ze Dao&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Omnia%20Priest\"&gt;Omnia Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and Mages can also be found assisting adventurers seeking to gain reputation with the Shado-Pan. Frost and Fire mages have been witnessed among the ranks of the Omnia, along with Holy and/or Discipline priests. The discipline also contains &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTheir scholars have accumulated centuries of practical expertise in combatting the dark powers of the sha without succumbing to their influence. According to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and given that the sha originated from the essence of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the underlying principles of their techniques could prove effective in resisting the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlackguard.\nThe Blackguard discipline is led by Master &lt;a href=\"Wan%20Snowdrift\"&gt;Wan Snowdrift&lt;/a&gt;. The warriors of the Shado-pan must answer to the Blackguard master, and the master's blade tests the blade of each and every Shado-Pan, including the ones guarding their walls, such as the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. Classes known to be in this discipline include &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWu Kao.\nThe Wu Kao discipline is led by Master &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Nurong&lt;/a&gt;. They are the order's scouts, hunters, spies, and assassins. They bring death from the shadows and teach monsters to fear the night. Classes known to be in this discipline include &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTrial of the Red Blossoms.\nNot just anyone can be a Shado-pan. Every seven seasons, the sacred trees of Shado-Pan Monastery grow blossoms of a fiery red: the sign to begin the trials for those wishing to join the order, a gauntlet of pain and rigor that kills most who submit to it. Twelve candidates are chosen, but only a maximum of six can pass all the trials. At least three months beforehand, each applicant is selected by Shado-pan agents from across Pandaria as a worthy candidate, often teenagers but some as young as 11 years old, and given a ring. Skillfully carved from a white tiger's fang with the order's snarling tiger symbol inlaid with silver across the top, the rings guarantee safe entrance through the front gates. The initiates must enter alone and are told to bring no weapons or armor, as it would not help them (and if necessary, to wear some warmer clothes).\nAs the initiates stand on the Bridge of Initiation, the Master of the Omnia explains that the trial consists of three tests: the Test of Resolve (which they themselves will preside over), the Test of Strength by the Blackguard Master, and the Test of Spirit by the Wu Kao Master. While each is a traditional trial, each Master has the right to forgo tradition to conduct their Trial as they see fit. The Omnia master will also point out that each one is deadly for those that don't pass, and gives the candidates one last chance to change their minds about going through with the trial; while there is no dishonor with walking away at this point, neither will they ever be allowed to return. Once the ones that quit are escorted away, the master will officially begin the Trial of the Red Blossoms.\nThe initiates must get to a small, tiger-shaped iron brazier on a rocky shelf at the other side of the lake, which the Bridge of Initiation hangs over, and retrieve a coin buried under the hot coals to return to the Omnia master in the grove. To continue, each initiate must get a coin, and there are only six. They are given vague advice about \"swimming quickly\" just before the collapsible bridge dumps them into the lake. Here is where listening to the advice of \"no armor, no weapons\" pays off; those that do not strip off their heavy gear in time drown, not to mention the ones that can't swim at all. It should also be noted that it doesn't matter if the season is in the middle of winter and the lake partially frozen over -- a test is a test.\nOn the other side, six chains are provided to climb the twenty feet up to the brazier. Depending on how fast their reflexes are, digging out the white-hot coin will at least give them a blistered palm. They can then run back around the lake to the master, hand over the coin and are motioned to wait at the side.\nThe initiates that pass are led to a training dojo by the Omnia master, who leaves them there for the Blackguard master. At the very center of the arena sit three massive bronze bells; ancient, sacred artifacts marked with words of power, crafted with magic and metallurgy to withstand the depredations of time, and each tuned to sound one perfect note. As part of their magic, they will not ring properly unless lifted and struck hard. Each bell hides a different type of death: the death that steals, the death that hides and the death that saves. The master will wait in the grove until they hear all three bells and then return. The master will then uncover the death that steals, leave, and lock the doors.\n\"The death that steals\" is represented by venom, such as from the fangs of a &lt;a href=\"Bamboo%20Python\"&gt;Bamboo Python&lt;/a&gt;: it sneaks into the body through tiny little doors and leaves with your soul, like a thief. \"The death that hides\" can be represented by a stealthy hunter, like a &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;. \"The death that saves\" are weapons, so that the initiates can kill the animals. Part of the test is not just surviving it, but using your head to figure out the clues and discover which bell hides the weapons, instead of having to fight both animals at the same time. It also forces the initiates - who were all competitors in the previous trial - to work together or die.\nIt is unknown how a traditional Test of Spirit is conducted, as when the mists vanished from around Pandaria, mantid assassins from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to smuggle a sha-infested tiger into the trial, in the hopes that untrained initiates would cause the sha to fully manifest and be killed by it. It could then go on to hide in the monastery and continue killing initiates and raise no suspicions because initiates die at every trial anyway. Three surviving initiates defeated this sha, but were told by the Wu Kao master that the sha have marked them and now know everything about them. Even at that very moment, they could feel fear as they had never known before. Every encounter in the future would become more difficult and more terrifying; while they could be trained in how to destroy the sha and taught how to arm themselves against their fear, it was guaranteed that it would never go away. For their test, they were asked if they would still join the Shado-pan, willfully choosing to face the sha again for the rest of their lives, even knowing what senior students did not, and only veteran Shado-pan dared to face. The three agreed to join.\nAs for the blistered palms received from the white-hot coin, these heal into scars shaped like the face of the tiger minted on the coin - a permanent mark of the initiate's resolve.\nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"The shadowy protectors of Pandaria's temples, the Shado-Pan are wrought with mystery.\"\nQuests.\nMost of the quests in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; reward reputation with the Shado-Pan, including all of the dailies at the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt; at level 90.\nCompleting non-daily Shado-Pan quests in Kun-Lai Summit and Townlong Steppes will net roughly 5000/6000 reputation. To raise reputations beyond that level, one needs first to reach with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; to unlock Shado-Pan dailies.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can get to merely from regular quests thanks to their racial reputation bonus, provided they turn in the one-time drop from the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;Sha of Anger&lt;/a&gt;.\nKun-Lai Summit storyline.\n\"The Shado-Pan\" storyline of &lt;a href=\"Slum%20It%20in%20the%20Summit\"&gt;Slum It in the Summit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; awards Shado-Pan reputation.\nTownlong Steppes storyline.\nNearly all of the main storyline quests in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; (all parts of &lt;a href=\"One%20Steppe%20Forward%2C%20Two%20Steppes%20Back\"&gt;One Steppe Forward, Two Steppes Back&lt;/a&gt; except \"Mistlurkers in the Sumprushes\") award reputation with the Shado-Pan.\nFinale.\nAt reputation, a short quest chain opens up at the Shado-Pan Garrison:\nCompanions.\nWhen heading out on a pack of dailies, the player is offered to take one of the nine companions. Each of the three major daily packs has up to three companions available to choose from: one is available immediately, and the other two are unlocked after defeating them in a Challenger's Ring quest at and reputation, respectively.\nEvery companion also has a &lt;a href=\"generic%20name\"&gt;generic name&lt;/a&gt;, which is displayed instead of their personal name when a player with that companion is seen by other players.\nOne option you can use, if you have not done/finished the Shado-Pan dailies for the day, is to take up one of the dailies so you can choose a companion and use them during a challenge."}

Lord &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; leads the planning of the attack from a cave underneath the &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Conqueror's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. The main way of gaining reputation with the assault is killing &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.

Bosses award reputation \"once\" each week. So, if a player kills a boss in &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; mode, then subsequently kills it in normal or heroic mode during the same week, the player's character gains reputation only for the first kill.\n&lt;a href=\"Trash%20mob\"&gt;Trash mob&lt;/a&gt;s award reputation up to 2,999/3,000 . They can be farmed by killing all of the trash before &lt;a href=\"Jin%27rokh%20the%20Breaker%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Jin'rokh the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, then all members of the raid exit the instance via the instance line and let the raid leader reset the instance. Starting from 0/3,000, four or five runs will cap reputation gained in this manner.\nOutside of the raid, there are several one-time quests that award a little reputation. Additionally, the once-weekly quest &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Champions of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; will award 300 reputation. There are &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault%20Insignia\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault Insignia&lt;/a&gt; worth 100 reputation possibly found inside the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Trove\"&gt;Arcane Trove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Bounty\"&gt;Sunreaver Bounty&lt;/a&gt; goody bags awarded for completing boss-killing daily quests on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.

Former Valor QMs such as &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Oxheart\"&gt;Commander Oxheart&lt;/a&gt; now only exchange rewards for Justice Points. Rewards that previously required Honored and Revered reputation are available at Friendly reputation. Shoulder gear that was available at Exalted still requires Exalted, and the neck items are still available at Neutral.\nNote: Patch 5.4 was released without including the Shado-Pan Assault faction on the Character Reputation Pane. The only way to determine reputation status with the Shado-Pan Assault is to visit a Shado-Pan quartermaster, and see which items are available on the dialog.\nNotes.\nAlong with Taran Zhu, several of the Shado-pan forces previously seen during the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes%20storyline\"&gt;Townlong Steppes storyline&lt;/a&gt; also make appearances, including &lt;a href=\"Lao-Chin%20the%20Iron%20Belly\"&gt;Lao-Chin the Iron Belly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Hawkmaster Nurong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;.

Tired of being wingless and tempted by the words of , Iskar turned his back on &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak%20storyline\"&gt;Spires of Arak storyline&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Shadow Council. Iskar now has his wings, illusionary powers, and a cult of corrupted arakkoa at his thrall. \nThe fight alternates between fighting Iskar himself and the arakkoa adds he summons and focuses around utilizing &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; to dispel the illusions that Iskar places on the raid, passing it between players to dispel harmful debuffs and helping to stop the adds. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"After Iskar's efforts to resurrect and return to power ended in frustration, he was approached by with an offer and a promise to break the ancient curse of . No longer flightless, elevated from the shadows yet still a master of illusion and deception, Iskar's hour of vengeance is at hand.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"If something seemed suspicious about Shadow-Seer Iskar as you quested through the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, you weren\u2019t mistaken. This was a fun encounter for the group to brainstorm, beginning with the premise of illusions and an artifact that let a single player see through those illusions, and weaving that concept through multiple abilities and interactions.\"\nOverview.\nShadow-Lord Iskar weaves illusions that deceive the raid, but the nearby &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; provides the key to seeing through the twisted arakkoa's deception. Players may pass the Eye around among raid members to counter specific attacks of Iskar and his minions. Periodically, Iskar takes to the skies and channels powerful beams of fel energy, as his minions swoop down to attack on the ground.\nStrategy.\nThe fight requires 2 tanks to switch for Iskar's chakram attack, in addition to one being the designated holder of the Eye of Anzu during the add phase. Save &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; for the third and final add phase. Before the fight, it is highly recommended that players download the \"Iskar Assist\" mod through Curse as it will make passing the Eye to other players far easier. Holding the eye causes a debuff that hurts the one holding it and stacks. Have a healer and a tank, or 2 healers, constantly toss it between them to keep stacks low while still performing the abilities the Eye grants them.\nIskar begins the fight alone until 75% HP. Pull the boss back to the middle of the room and have ranged back towards the door. He will target 3 players (a ranged, a melee, and his current tank) with a Fel Chakram that will cause AOE damage on contact. Make 3 markers to the right side of the room, spaced out so the targeted players can run there and get hit without damaging anyone else. Ranged players will sometimes be targeted by Fel Incineration, a green laser which leaves permanent fire in its wake. Run to the left side of the room while avoiding the laser. Lastly, Iskar will cast Phantasmal Winds on several raid members, causing them to be pushed towards the cliff and eventually fall to their death if not dispelled. It can only be removed by throwing the Eye of Anzu at an affected player. Once a player is dispelled, he must throw the Eye at others who are affected by the winds until everyone is dispelled, at which point it should be thrown back to the designated holders. \nAt 75%, Iskar flies off the platform and leaves you to fight a Corrupted Talonpriest and several Illusionary Outcasts. The raid should be split into the melee and ranged groups so they can soak Iskar's Focus Blast together. The outcasts can be quickly cleaved down, but the Talonpriest takes priority. It will cast Phantasmal Felbomb, a magic-effect debuff, and several normal fel bombs on several players. Only a healer holding the Eye can see the Phantasmal Fel Bomb and dispelling the Phantasmal Fel Bomb will immediately get rid of all other bombs. A healer must be ready to dispel the player with Phantasmal Fel Bomb, dispel it, throw it to someone else to let the harmful stacks fall off, then throw it back to the healer so he can be ready to dispel it once again. You should be able to focus down the Talonpriest before Iskar comes back down. Iskar repeats his abilities he had in phase 1. \nAt 50%, Iskar takes off again and the same priest and outcasts attack, but along with one Shadowfel Warden, a corrupted &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20guardian\"&gt;Apexis guardian&lt;/a&gt;. This phase is where the fight gets more intense. In addition to the healer dispelling the fel bombs, a tank who has the adds must interrupt the warden's shadowfel lightning to stop it from killing the dps. The tank can only do this if he/she has the Eye and does a melee spell interrupt while the warden is casting. The raid can either throw the Eye to who needs it, watching the dbm timer for ability times, or constantly toss the Eye back and forth between the healer and tank so whoever needs it immediately has it. The second method is arguably faster but takes more precise timing. Kill the warden, then the priest. Always finish off adds before going back to dps'ing Iskar. \nFinally, at 25% Iskar will take flight one last time and puts one last add into the mix: a Fel raven. The raven hits tanks hard so decide beforehand which will take the arakkoa, and who will be taking the raven and warden. The kill order is 'raven &gt; warden &gt; priest &gt; outcasts.' Pop cooldowns and bring down the fel raven first. The tank fighting the raven will be infected with Phantasmal Corruption, causing significant stacking fire damage to him/her and the raid. Having the tank of the raven the sameone taking the warden allows them to use the Eye for both purposes. Similar to Phantasmal Winds, the debuff will be dispelled if the tank is holding the Eye, which makes good timing on throwing the Eye between the healer and tank essential. This is yet another reason the strategy of constantly throwing the Eye back and forth during the add phases like a game of \"hot potato\" between tank and healer is a popular strategy. It is unlikely the raid will be able to finish off all adds before Iskar comes back down, but at least the raven should be down and the warden almost dead. If not, managing the adds' debuffs while also saving people from Phantasmal Winds may prove too much to handle and wipe the raid. Once adds are all dead, Iskar will use his normal abilities until death. Unless the raid hits the enrage timer, if they clear the third add phase, they have effectively won the fight.\nLoot.\n is looted by &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafter\"&gt;Jewelcrafter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVideos.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMAhKmSCe6I8\"&gt;Heroic Shadow-Lord Iskar - Boss Voice - Mage&lt;/a&gt;"}

He led his fellow &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents&lt;/a&gt;. He later accepted an offer by Gul'dan to regain his flight using demonic magic in exchange for servitude to the Shadow Council. Iskar claims that he was born into the lowest caste in arakkoa society, although this is a lie; he was actually a priest of the Adherents before his fall.\nHistory.\nLife in Skyreach.\nAdherent Iskar was a sun-sage of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;. When he was young, he was paired as a clutch-brother to &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;Adherent Viryx&lt;/a&gt;, to watch and learn from her as she learned from and watched him. He excelled greatly at the scholarly arts, yet was never the most promising of sages. He did however have a strong faith in Rukhmar and the High Sage, as did all Adherents. He was always hunched and small for his age, and didn't have many other allies other than Viryx, who was his greatest friend.\nViryx was very promising and highly regarded by the upper class of Skyreach. She managed to get away with being late or disobeying orders, and due to the connection between her and Iskar, Iskar was punished also, usually worse. Iskar resented this and wished Viryx would stop breaking so many rules and see things from his perspective, yet he was still good friends with her as she was always stood by his side and protected him. One day Viryx was late to the dawn-ritual, and thus she and Iskar were punished to clear out &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; dens below Skyreach. During their clearing out of the nests, Iskar attempted to convince her to return to Skyreach as they would soon be late. Viryx however refused, and they flew towards Veil Akraz in pursuit of more ravagers. Iskar tried to convince her to turn back as they were getting near to the homes of the Outcasts, when Viryx noticed a &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;mysterious Adherent&lt;/a&gt; that was walking among the Outcasts. Iskar waited as Viryx went to investigate. He was later escorted back to Skyreach by bladetalons who had followed them.\nIn Skyreach he was tortured with &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar%27s%20Tail\"&gt;Rukhmar's Tail&lt;/a&gt; as punishment. After which, &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Zelkyr\"&gt;High Sage Zelkyr&lt;/a&gt; instructed him to spy on Viryx for him. Iskar agreed, despite feeling that it was wrong. He followed Viryx in secrecy, and watched as she studied deep into tomes in the Great Archive. When she left, he checked the tomes she was reading. Using a technique an elder Adherent taught him, he managed to find the page she was reading, which was on &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis in itself was no cause for alarm. Yet for the next two days, he watched her constantly. She never did return to the Great Archive, but did spend many hours alone in her roost. Afraid that he might appear suspicious, he did not spy on her during those hours. Her secrecy was concerning to him. He wondered if her reclusive nature was a sign of the curse. \nDuring his meeting with High Sage Zelkyr to report on Viryx, he chose to lie to him and state that Viryx was more studious than ever. After this, he flew to confront Viryx and discover what she was hiding. He told her of how the High Sage asked him to watch her, and that he lied to the High Sage. Viryx then told him of how all texts on Terokk were exactly the same. Iskar tried to explain it as historical accuracy, but Viryx was convinced it was a fabrication. After Viryx responded harshly to him, he left. \nHe later went to the exiling of Adherent Ikiss, where he noticed that Viryx was missing. He guessed that she went to Veil Akraz, and he flew after her. After finding her there consorting with the Outcasts, they returned to her roost, where Viryx showed him the scroll that she had retrieved that proved the origin of the curse and the true history of Terokk. Iskar then realized that everything he had known was a lie. A cold anger grew within him. All his life he had followed with blind faith, accepting punishments and torture, all to stay in Rukhmar's eyes, without realizing that the cause of the curse had nothing to do with staying in Rukhmar's favor. Iskar told Viryx that they had to seek out more information, that they should hide the scroll. Viryx insisted to his surprise that they needed to destroy it. Iskar tried to explain to her that they couldn't hide the truth; that it would lead to a new world for the arakkoa. Viryx took the scroll from him, claiming that keeping Skyreach as it was was worth the hiding of the truth. She then burnt the scroll. Immediately after two bladetalons broke in, along with High Sage Zelkyr, who explained that he had been watching both of them, wanting to see what they would do with the information. After both were captured, Iskar was locked in a heatless and lightless cage, awaiting exile. When he was allowed to see, he noticed that the person who would strip him of his wings was Viryx. He simply stared at her with anger. The High Sage gave Viryx a choice, Iskar or Skyreach. Viryx made her choice, and cut off Iskar's wings. He was then banished to Sethekk Hollow. He later rose through the ranks of the Outcasts and became their leader.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIskar first appeared in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Aruuna\"&gt;Aruuna&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a draenei woman named &lt;a href=\"Raksi\"&gt;Raksi&lt;/a&gt;. He informed a nearby &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; that the draenei had found an &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; artifact in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Aruuna%20Crystal%20Mine\"&gt;Aruuna Crystal Mine&lt;/a&gt;, and the Adherents have attacked Aruuna to claim it. When the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Prism\"&gt;Ancient Prism&lt;/a&gt; was located, Iskar dropped his disguise and had it destroyed so that the Skyreach arakkoa wouldn't use it. He took the adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Refuge\"&gt;Terokkar Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, where he asked them to free his fellow Outcasts from the Adherents' wrath in &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shadar\"&gt;Veil Shadar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIskar later appeared at &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Terokk\"&gt;Veil Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, deep in the woods of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked with &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt;. He sent Outcasts to find the Adherents at the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Expedition\"&gt;Apexis Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, and asked the adventurers to bring back the remaining Talonpriests in order to bring Terokk back.\nAlthough Iskar wanted to bring &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; back physically, Reshad was concerned that Terokk would lead the arakkoa further into darkness and did not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. Instead, Terokk imbued an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with his power after a battle in order to face off against . Afterward, Iskar expressed anger that arakkoa magic was used by an outsider.\nIskar was later seen in &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, helping to lead adventurers in to take down his former friend Viryx.\nAfter the Adherents of Rukhmar fell and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; was founded, Iskar disappeared, unable to accept a balance between light and shadow. When scouts were sent to find him, he murdered them.\nFury of Hellfire.\nIskar accepted an offer from to travel to Tanaan and assisted the in exchange for a cure to the Curse of Sethe. He allied himself with the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; gathering there, who had been left masterless after the death of their god, and several power hungry high arakkoa also dissatisfied with the Order of the Awakened. Taking the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kra%27nak\"&gt;Ruins of Kra'nak&lt;/a&gt; as a base, he began searching for the &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. When he found it, Gul'dan fulfilled his promise and restored Iskar's wings. The newly elevated Shadow Lord Iskar was then tasked with raising an army of felsworn arakkoa like himself to serve the Shadow Council. Later, the Order of the Awakened and Reshad caught up with him and discovered his betrayal of their people. He was eventually found and killed in along with his army of traitorous arakkoa.\nQuotes.\nThe Talon King's power belongs to the children of Skettis.\nReshad should never have shared it with an outsider..."}
