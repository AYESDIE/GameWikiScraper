Your continued aid, however, is something that I and the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; could use...\nNotes.\nThe silos are the blue-glowing towers near the edges of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;Ruins of Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.

It was launched on December 31, 1996, with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBattle.net was the first online gaming service that was incorporated directly into the games, in contrast to external interfaces that were used by other online gaming services at the time. This feature, along with the ease of account creations and the absence of member fees, caused Battle.net to become a popular choice among gamers and quickly became a major selling point for \"Diablo\" and subsequent games. Since the successful launch of Battle.net, many companies have published online gaming services mimicking Blizzard's service and its user interface.\nOn March 20, 2009, Blizzard officially unveiled the revamped &lt;a href=\"%23Battle.net%202.0\"&gt;Battle.net 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. It was later revealed further in detail of the Battle.net revamped features at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202009\"&gt;BlizzCon 2009&lt;/a&gt; which supported \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20II\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The original Battle.net was then renamed to &lt;a href=\"%23Battle.net%20Classic\"&gt;Battle.net Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2013, Blizzard released an open beta for the &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20desktop%20app\"&gt;Battle.net desktop app&lt;/a&gt;. The desktop application was later renamed to Blizzard App in March 2017, as part of a rebranding effort to retire the Battle.net name; however, Blizzard later reversed this in August 2017, and opted to use the merged name Blizzard Battle.net. The app currently supports &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Shop\"&gt;storefront actions&lt;/a&gt;, social interactions, and matchmaking for all of Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"%23Games%20by%20Battle.net%20version\"&gt;current games&lt;/a&gt;, as well as various ' games and ' from its corporate &lt;a href=\"Activision%20Blizzard\"&gt;sibling&lt;/a&gt; .\nIn September 2017, Blizzard released a &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20mobile%20app\"&gt;Battle.net application&lt;/a&gt; for Android and iOS. The app includes the ability to chat with and add friends in addition to seeing what games they are currently playing.\nHistory.\nBattle.net Classic.\nWhen the service initially launched with \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" on December 31, 1996, Battle.net offered only a few basic services like chatting and game listings. Players could connect to the service, talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of \"Diablo\". Besides user account data, no game data was stored on the Battle.net servers. When a player was connected to a game, they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game. No data was sent through the Battle.net servers. While this made the service quick and easy to use, it quickly led to widespread cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally. However, since there was an option to create private games, many players ended up playing with people they knew.\nWith the release of \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20franchise\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1998, the usage of the Battle.net service increased significantly. The \"StarCraft\" Battle.net beta went live on January 5, 1998. Features such as ladder ranking and game filters were added to the service. Battle.net grew even larger after the release of the expansion pack \"\", with tens of thousands of players logged on at any given time (even in the present day). \"StarCraft\" Battle.net was especially successful in South Korea, where the number of players logged on was often many times that of the United States. The website received a redesign and a fresh new logo on 10 February 1999 which made its mark as the \"Battle.net Classic\" for future iterations.\n\"StarCraft\" also brought a new scheme known as s. Under \"Diablo\", Battle.net would allow any client to connect to the service. With \"StarCraft\", only those players with a valid and unique CD key \u2013 a generated 13-digit number distributed with each boxed game \u2013 were allowed onto the service. Only one person could connect to Battle.net using a specific CD key at a time. CD keys could also be muted (unable to chat in channels or whisper), voided (restricted to \"The Void\" channel), jailed (both muted and voided) or banned from Battle.net entirely. Every Blizzard game since \"StarCraft\" has used the new copy protection system to connect to Battle.net. \"StarCraft: Brood War\" used as its CD key whatever CD-key was found on the original StarCraft on that computer, and was thus only installable if the original was already installed. With the release of the Gateway system in Brood War (selectable regional server clusters), two players could play at the same time, as long as they are on different gateways. Given how the gateways are expectedly separate from each other, each with their own games list and user accounts that are not shared across the other gateways, it is still maintained that they cannot play in the same game nor chat with each other, etc.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in 2000 to much fanfare. The main highlight of \"Diablo II\" as it relates to Battle.net was that the game used the client-server model. The game was no longer simulated on each player's computer but instead was run on Blizzard's server. This also meant that all of the character data for the game was stored on the Battle.net servers. The game also has an open character feature on Battle.net which stored the player's character on the client. This allowed players to play characters locally or on a LAN, and then use those same characters on Battle.net. However, any open games played on Battle.net were not protected from cheating by other players since they could have modified their characters locally. \"Diablo II\" also had a unique feature that would show the players in the Battle.net chat room as avatars who looked like their characters did in the game. It also used a different Battle.net interface than previous games, where previously there were mainly only color differences. There was also expanded ladder support including a \"Hardcore\" ladder which listed players whose characters would be removed permanently if they died in-game. Again, with \"Diablo II\" usage of Battle.net increased steadily, climbing even higher with the release of the expansion pack \"\" in 2001.\n' was released in 2002 and its expansion pack, ', was released in 2003. The release of these two games brought with them a number of new features to the online service. The most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of Anonymous Matchmaking. This feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press a button and automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill (based on ranking) and also wanted to play a game. This allowed for people to get into games quickly and easily. It also reduced win-trading, where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder. The matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called \"Arranged Teams\". In an arranged team game, you could make a team with one or more friends, which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank. However, a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated 'fair' matchups, called 'Abusing', simply by someone losing the Arranged Team Games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally (who wants to gain wins easily) won't find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players. Automated tournaments were added in the expansion, where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day. In addition to the new game styles, a slew of other features was added including selectable chatroom icons unlocked based on the player's number of wins, a friends list, and clan support.\nBattle.net 2.0.\nThe \"Battle.net\" service was revamped in 2009 and officially unveiled on March 20, 2009. It was further elaborated at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202009\"&gt;BlizzCon 2009&lt;/a&gt;. Battle.net 2.0 contains three unique sections; the first allows players to connect all Battle.net accounts, \"World of Warcraft\" characters and friends list together and integrate them into a unified single Battle.net account. Players can also unlock achievements in-game which would, in turn, unlock avatars and decals which would be shown on the player's profile, the decals can also be seen in-game on the player's units.\nThe second section consists of making Battle.net into a competitive platform for players which involves a new improved matchmaking system, simplifying the process of players organizing games. The ladder system has also been revamped; the system classifies players into certain leagues according to their level of competitiveness. Players would then compete against others who have a similar skill level of their own. There is also a special practice league to practice and hone skills, where game speed is reduced and maps are designed to create a slower pace of the game. The party system works similar to that of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" where players with friends would join together and enter games as a party.\nThe final section involves a new chat system similar to Instant Messaging across games. Players may communicate with friends across games, servers, and characters. Another new element is the use of an online marketplace which allows player or map makers to create and sell their maps online through Battle.net, players can also browse and search through maps online and rank them by player ratings as well as download both free and paid maps. This is however not implemented yet.\n\"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" initially did not support Battle.net, having separate accounts from Battle.net once until the revamp of Battle.net on March 20, 2009, which forced players to merge their \"World of Warcraft\" accounts with the new Battle.net accounts. The features of Battle.net utilized in \"World of Warcraft\" include allowing players to engage in cross-realm, cross-faction and cross-game chat, which allows players to talk with their friends on their &lt;a href=\"Real%20ID\"&gt;Real ID&lt;/a&gt; friends list, from other factions, other servers as well as other games such as \"StarCraft II\" and \"Diablo III\". \"World of Warcraft\" players were mailed an in-game &lt;a href=\"Unhatched%20Mr.%20Chilly\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; on October 15, 2009, if they had merged their account. On November 11, 2009, Blizzard made Battle.net a mandatory feature for \"World of Warcraft\" players.\n\"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20II\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" was the first game to natively support the new revamped Battle.net online interface. It was split into three installments: the base game with the subtitle ', expansion pack ', stand-alone expansion pack ' and downloadable content mission packs '. The new Battle.net was planned with a marketplace for \"StarCraft II\" which would allow players to download both free and paid maps, but this feature has not yet been implemented. Instead, regular and custom maps are available for everyone and sorted by a popularity system based on total playtime. The new interface includes a chat service which is similar to that of Instant Messengers which allows players to interact across different games. Initially not having been shipped with regular, channel-based chat rooms, this was later added in a patch after both community and gaming media noted the lack of the feature.\nOn May 5, 2010, Blizzard revealed that Battle.net 2.0 would be integrated with social networking site Facebook, \"\"linking the world's premier online gaming platform with the world's most popular social platform\".\"\nOn December 4, 2010, (a few days before ' was released) it was announced that the \"World of Warcraft\" community sites (previously at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com\"&gt;worldofwarcraft.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wow-europe.com\"&gt;wow-europe.com&lt;/a&gt;) would now be hosted on Battle.net. Near the launch for ', the community sites were moved back to their previous domains from Battle.net which was most likely due to their transitioning decision from the &lt;a href=\"%23Rebranding\"&gt;Battle.net brand&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn January 7, 2014, Blizzard updated the parental controls to a new default setting that will prevent in-game purchases for accounts that have Parental Controls turned on. This change is to ensure that Parental Controls users will have more control over real-money purchases in Blizzard games.\nBattle.net desktop app.\nIn August 2013, Blizzard released an open beta for the Battle.net Launcher. The launcher is a desktop application which allows players to purchase, install and patch their games, and provides access to the friends list and messaging. It also provides access to some account management and game services. Blizzard launches its own cross-game voice chat service in October 2016. Blizzard Voice is integrated into the Battle.net application.\nIn February 2017, Blizzard introduced the ability to obtain Blizzard &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Balance\"&gt;storefront credit&lt;/a&gt; by trading in \"\"&lt;a href=\"WoW%20Token\"&gt;WoW Token&lt;/a&gt;s\"\" from \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", bought through the use of in-game gold and initially used as a means of trading credits between players of \"World of Warcraft\". These credits could be used to purchase other Blizzard games or content, such as card packs for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" or loot boxes for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20franchise\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe PC version of ', developed by and published by corporate &lt;a href=\"Activision%20Blizzard\"&gt;sibling&lt;/a&gt; of Blizzard, , was exclusively sold and launched through the Battle.net on its Windows release on October 24, 2017, as well as used to support the game's matchmaking capabilities, making it the first non-Blizzard game supported by the launcher. Blizzard affirmed that players can use gold farming in \"World of Warcraft\" to generate credit towards their Blizzard account that they can use towards purchase of \"Destiny 2\". Blizzard said that they are also \"potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future Activision games\" to be supported by the Battle.net, with the PC version of ' that was announced on May 16, 2018 to be exclusively available on the desktop app. Blizzard said it does not plan to extend similar support to other third-parties, fearing it would weaken their quality control with the product. \"\" was announced on May 30, 2019 and the PC edition will be available on the desktop app.\nRebranding.\nIn late 2016, Blizzard announced plans to rebrand Battle.net. According to CEO &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt;, the company found themselves in a position where they had two competing brands - Blizzard and Battle.net - creating confusion for players of where to find information about their games, and wanted to consolidate the branding. Their first step was a plan to retire the \"Battle.net\" name in favor of calling service \"Blizzard Tech\", announced on September 21, 2016, and renaming the client as the \"Blizzard App\" by March 24, 2017. However, following this change, Blizzard realized that the \"Battle.net\" brand had too much legacy behind it to let it go since dropping the brand created additional confusion for users. This further became an issue when Blizzard sought to have \"Destiny 2\" use the service, as they wanted to be clear that the game was not developed by Blizzard but used the Battle.net framework, but the \"Blizzard App\" branding would not provide that clarity. In August 2017, Blizzard stepped back from the full rebranding, and announced that going forward, they would call the service and application \"Blizzard Battle.net\", which Morhaime said was the best way they had found to combine both brands and minimize consumer confusion. On December 14, 2018, the Battle.net Account Control website has been updated to the new Blizzard brand and is no longer on the Battle.net domain.\nOn 31 March 2021, the rebrand was reverted back to just \"Battle.net\". The new brand marks a new era of global gaming and social connectivity throughout the platform allowing friends from across the world to chat without the need to switch regions and includes functionality, with \"Overwatch\" being the first to receive the cross-play capabilities.\nSteam.\n\"Overwatch 2\" was announced to be the first game to be available on the platform, releasing on 10 August 2023 but connecting would still require a Battle.net account to access."}

However, the app cannot be used in conjunction with the physical device; one or the other can be used, but not both.\nThe functionality of the authenticator was merged into the &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20mobile%20app\"&gt;Battle.net mobile app&lt;/a&gt; on 10 April 2023, marking this app as obsolete and will soon be removed from all app stores.\nLogging into World of Warcraft.\nLaunching \"World of Warcraft\" without the &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20desktop%20app\"&gt;Battle.net desktop app&lt;/a&gt; will prompt the user to enter in the authenticator code (after signing in) while the desktop app automatically logs the user into WoW, bypassing the authentication requirement.\nDisconnecting from \"World of Warcraft\" and reentering the credentials instead of restarting WoW from the desktop app will still prompt the user for the code.\nUnsupported devices.\nIt was possible to install and use the mobile authenticator on many other devices which are not officially supported by Blizzard. Most mobile phones are capable of running the basic java authenticator application. The information on installing the authenticator on unsupported devices can be found &lt;a href=\"http%3A//info.scusting.com/wow_authenticator_unsupported_device.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, Blizzard officially supported the authenticator for and but was later discontinued and no longer updated.\nEnd of official J2ME support.\nThe J2ME (Java) version of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator is only available for download until December 13, 2011. Since the date, already downloaded versions would still work but no new downloads are possible. The versions for Android, Windows Phone 7 and iPhone were not affected and were still available for download.\nSpecification.\nThe initialization of an authenticator is done via an RSA encrypted request to the Blizzard initialization servers including a one-time pad key for encryption of the response. The server generates an 160-bit key which is later used for code generation and a serial number is connected to that key. Both things are stored on the server and are also sent back to the client (encrypted with the one-time pad key from the request).\nThe code generation is done via encrypting the current time (milliseconds since 1970/01/01 0:00 UTC divided by 30,000) with HMAC-SHA1 using the key from the initialization. From the result are some bytes selected and displayed as the current authenticator code.\nSecurity vulnerability.\nBecause of a weak one-time pad key generation algorithm on the client side, an attacker who is able to capture the encrypted initialization response between server and client device can fully compromise the security of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator. The reason is, that the one-time pad key used for encryption of the server response only depends deterministic from the current time on the client device. Normally that time shouldn't differ too much from the common time. So an attacker only needs to guess some time values, calculate the corresponding one time pad keys, use them for decryption of the captured server response and check, whether one of the results make sense (because of the known format of the included serial number, it is easy to say, whether a result makes sense or not). If he finds such a result, it is very likely that he guessed the correct one-time pad key and now knows the authenticator ID and the secret code calculation key from the decrypted response.\nTo prevent this attack even if there is no real randomness (e. g. hardware random generator) is available on the client device, there should be used aside from the current time also some kind of user-generated randomness (pressing random buttons on the device, ...) for creating the one time pad key used for encryption of the initialization data.\nDesktop ports.\nIt is possible to reimplement the specification to run the authenticator also directly on the computer. It is difficult to say, whether this is less secure or not in comparison to running it on a real mobile device from an application which is directly supported by Blizzard. An attacker could read out the necessarily stored secret code calculation key from the computer via a virus and so breaks the security of such a computer authenticator. But with a virus on the victim's computer, the attacker could also read the typed authenticator code when the victim is logging into the game, interrupting the connection of the victim and using the current authenticator code by itself for immediate game login (possibly with a bot) while preventing further game logins of the victim via a virus.\nList of desktop ports with public source code availability:\nIt is also possible to run Blizzard's implementation within a mobile phone emulator on the desktop.\nAn &lt;a href=\"https%3A//authenticator.me/\"&gt;online version&lt;/a&gt; also exists and has been publicly available since November 2011. The source code of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/krtek4/php-bma\"&gt;PHP implementation&lt;/a&gt; are published, but this is not the case for the website. This kind of online application is less secure than a desktop port, but, as an advantage, one can retrieve their code from anywhere.\nRewards.\nAttaching an Authenticator and &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20Phone%20Notifications\"&gt;Phone Notifications&lt;/a&gt; to the Blizzard account, the account will receive the following benefits:\nRemoving the authenticator and or the Phone Notifications afterwards will remove the pet, the extra backpack slots and reduce the Battle.net Balance load up back to $110."}

However, the reactions to this new feature by the European and American communities were mixed, with many players bemoaning the increasing number of pay-to-use features and expressing concern that real advantages in the game might become available for money at some point.\nAs a result of the Americans getting the pets cheaper than the Europeans due to the conversion rate between dollars and euros ($10 per pet against \u20ac10 per pet), many Europeans took advantage of the fact that pets from the American pet shop could be purchased for European realms, which led to Blizzard making the pet stores regional.\nIt is separate from the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Gear%20Store\"&gt;Blizzard Gear Store&lt;/a&gt; which sells physical items and apparel for its franchises.

On 23 March 2017, version 1.8.0 was released that included Blizzard's plan to transition from the Battle.net brand to a new name of this application which is Blizzard Desktop app. On 14 August 2017, Blizzard reversed the removal of the \"Battle.net\" moniker.\nThe desktop app has the feature for Voice Chat, Channel (or group) Chat and even Streaming Games to Facebook. The open beta for the application started on October 5, 2017 and release of 1.9.1 on October 19, 2017, introduced new features such as Player Profiles and Avatars, to appear offline, the Social Tab and Groups, gifting, and the shop update.\nOn November 1, 2019, a new beta was pushed that completely refreshes the look for the desktop app, including going back to the \"Battle.net\" brand.

While this does not mean much against most mobs, it does mean that you only need 2 thrown lances against scouts, vs 3.\nFor those trying to solo this quest, two notes: First, dismounting a horse (voluntarily or otherwise) does not disengage you from combat. The riders will continue to beat your head in. However, mounting a horse DOES disengage you from combat. Any mobs currently engaging you will disengage, &lt;a href=\"evade\"&gt;evade&lt;/a&gt;, and return to their previous locations.\nSecond, the areas to the east and west of the encampment are relatively scout-free. Less interference from scouts means more stacks of defense buff on you, means you're more likely to survive.\nTo save repairing costs (if you fail and die), you could unequip all of your stuff except the lance before mounting up (the damage done is fixed and does not scale with your equipment). Using the &lt;a href=\"gear%20manager\"&gt;gear manager&lt;/a&gt; or an addon will help."}

Using a Battle Standard causes it to be placed at the player's location; Battle Standards are stationary and cannot be moved once they have been placed. Battle Standards will despawn after a set duration, or if the player moves too far from the Standard, or dies.\nThere are several types of Battle Standard, with varying effects, range, duration and cooldown. Each is obtainable by different means. Each Battle Standard is available in a different form depending on the character's faction.\nPvP Battle Standards.\nPvP Battle Standards increase the maximum health of all party members within 45 yards by 15%. They have a duration of 2 minutes, a cooldown of 10 minutes, and can only be used in PvP &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. PvP Standards can also be targeted and destroyed by enemy attacks, and have 1500 health. \nThese items are PvP rewards, and can be purchased for from your faction's Officer Accessories Quartermaster.\nAlterac Valley.\nAnother type of battle standard that can only be used in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; Battleground are the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; Battle Standard (Alliance) and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; Battle Standard (Horde). These battle standards also differ from regular battle standards in that they increase the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; (dealt) by 10% and have a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; of 15 minutes. They are similar in that they work on party members within 45 yards, last for a maximum of 2 minutes, and have 1500 health. \nThese item are PvP rewards, and can be purchased for from your Frostwolf or Stormpike Supply Officer.\nAshran.\nThese Battle Standards are only usable in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, and must be purchased using &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Fragment\"&gt;Artifact Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s gathered in the zone. They work by increasing allies' &lt;a href=\"Versatility\"&gt;Versatility&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese items can be purchased for from &lt;a href=\"Dazzerian\"&gt;Dazzerian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crafticus%20Mindbender\"&gt;Crafticus Mindbender&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuild Battle Standards.\nGuild Battle Standards increase the experience, honor and reputation gained by guild members with 100 yards of the Battle Standard by 5/10/15%. All Guild Battle Standards have a duration of 15 minutes, a 10-minute cooldown and a shared cooldown of 2 minutes. Unlike PvP Battle Standards, Guild Battle Standards cannot be attacked or destroyed by enemies.\nGuild Battle Standards are &lt;a href=\"guild%20rewards\"&gt;guild rewards&lt;/a&gt;, available from &lt;a href=\"guild%20vendor\"&gt;guild vendor&lt;/a&gt;s for gold. Each Standard only becomes available once the guild has earned the corresponding &lt;a href=\"guild%20achievement\"&gt;guild achievement&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "78117", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=78117", "title": "Currency", "text": "Currency is any item accumulated and used to make purchases. &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; is the definitive example of currency. \nLore.\nGold sovereigns were a type of currency in the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nIn &lt;a href=\"WoW\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt;, there are various types of currency; money, of course, but also &lt;a href=\"honor%20system\"&gt;honor system&lt;/a&gt; currencies and &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; currencies.\nCurrency tab.\nThese can be represented by an inventory &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that must be carried, but money has long been tracked as a numeric value only, not represented in inventory, and as of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, many currencies are now tracked in the &lt;a href=\"Currency%20tab\"&gt;Currency tab&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"character%20window\"&gt;character window&lt;/a&gt; and have no inventory item. (When the patch was applied, these inventory items were converted and were removed from inventories.) (References to a Token tab of the character window appear to refer to a beta implementation.) \nThese virtual items with no inventory representation show up as icons in the currency page and on price lists for items they can purchase.\nMain bag currency display.\nTraditionally, and by default, the amount of money a character has is displayed in the margin below the main &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt; in the main bag window when the main bag is opened. This is convenient for purchases, since the main bag will open automatically when a vendor is accessed. With &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, this line can be set on the Currency tab to display a different currency other than money by selecting tracking for that currency on the Currency tab, however addons for bags may stop additional tracked currencies from showing up. Tracking can also be set back to track money.\nMoney.\nAll money is stored on the server as a 32 bit integer amount of copper. The WoW client &lt;a href=\"UI\"&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt; calculates the amount of gold, silver, and copper for presentation to the player. \nMoney conversion:\nMoney can be transferred or given away. Since non-item currencies do not have a binding property, technically none of them are bound, but the game provides no mechanism for transferring non-item currencies other than money. Several interfaces facilitate the transfer of money among characters, including a section of the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window, a section of the &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; interface, the &lt;a href=\"C.O.D.\"&gt;C.O.D.&lt;/a&gt; section of the mail interface, and various parts of the &lt;a href=\"auction\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt; interface. \nNon-item currencies, including money, cannot be destroyed, they can only be accumulated and spent, or transferred (money only) as related above. \nPoints as currencies.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, most items once used as currency was converted to an updated point system. The original honor points and arena points were also removed.\nBetween &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, these points were tracked on the Currency tab of the character window. Prior to 3.0.2 these points were tracked on the PvP tab of the character window.\nItems tracked as currencies.\nThese items disappear immediately after they are obtained and are instead tracked in the Currency tab of the character window.\nItems No longer tracked as currencies.\nMost of these currencies were once tracked as currency, but have been removed in Patch 4.0.1 or later.\nItems used as currencies.\nThese items are represented in the character's inventory by an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. Most, but not all, are also &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor tokens.\nA sub-set of the above, these are items in inventory that can be exchanged for particular pieces of armor. Unlike some other varieties of \"currency items\", these are invariably &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;. They are typically obtained as raid rewards. Most represent particular items (IE chest, feet, helm, etc), and most are keyed to 3-4 particular classes. See &lt;a href=\"Armor%20token\"&gt;Armor token&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nAmbiguities.\nThere is a gray area of whether some items are currency or quest items. The discussion page has various comments about this, and incidentally has a comprehensive list of the current consensus on Wowpedia of which are \"currency\".\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; there were only three items (five if you count gold and silver, vice copper alone) given non-inventory status. After the patch, anything listed on the Currency tab is officially \"currency\".\nTo distinguish, a quest item is turned in for other items using a quest mechanic. There is usually only one place to turn in the quest items to exchange them for other items. There is often a limited selection of items available in exchange. Currency is used at a vendor that does not incorporate a quest mechanic. There is usually more than one vendor who will accept a form of currency. The selection available for purchase is broader. \nPlayer perception is an important part of this. Items that are conceptually \"currency\" tend to be treated as \"currency\", items that are not conceptually \"currency\" tend to be treated as quest items."}

The Curse originated from the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and slowly spread through the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, turning them from metal and stone to flesh beings.\nHistory.\nDuring the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the titans of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; were unable to kill the Old Gods without completely destroying the planet, thus they were neutralized and contained within prisons. The &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s left behind beings called &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s as jailers of the Old Gods' prisons. Thereafter, the keepers created machines to produce new titan-forged, one of those was the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;.\nA long time after, the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; sensed a great disturbance in the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s that were in charge of guarding his prison. This disturbance was caused by the death of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and Yogg-Saron used this chance to weaken his jailers. By corrupting the Forge of Wills, tainting it with a curse known as the \"Curse of Flesh\", any titan-forged being created by it would transform into a mortal being of skin and flesh, in order to \"facilitate assimilation\". The curse would even spread to the previous generation of titan-forged.\nYogg-Saron then proceeded to corrupt the keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, tricking him to create an army with the Forge of Wills and attack his former allies. He realized his mistake too late, as he noticed the dark affliction on his army. After Loken's betrayal, many titan-forged were exiled. Around 15,000 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;'s metallic skin became brittle and weak. Over their millenia of imprisonment, the afflicted vrykul continued to degenerate into fleshy beings later known as humans. Many other titan-forged - &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s - would suffer a similar fate. However, Yogg-Saron's plan had unintended consequences; it gave rise to mortal qualities of necessity, such as courage, resolve, and heroism.\nThe keepers attempted to cure the curse and extirpate the symbiotic infection unsuccessfully, recording the history of the curse and their experimentation on the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, while telling how the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt; suffered the effects of the curse. Keeper &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; lost faith when he discovered the titans of the Pantheon had vanished and Azeroth had been infested by the &lt;a href=\"Void%20lord\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;'s Old Gods, and he secluded himself from society. Keeper &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and his companion &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; spent too much time thinking on how to cure the curse, becoming obsessed with it, until eventually entering a long period of hibernation. Unable to cure the Curse of Flesh, &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s and later the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; would be afflicted by it.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gearmaster%20Mechazod\"&gt;Gearmaster Mechazod&lt;/a&gt; began curing &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of the curse of flesh and transforming them into mindless mechagnomes until he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; attempted a similar plan using his &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt; device, but failed."}

Look for the \"runs away in fear\" emote around 20% health. The trick is to place CoR rank 1 (lower mana cost) just before then, leaving a more useful Curse on for the majority of the fight.\nIn raid encounters you can increase melee DPS by 6-12% for a nominal increase in damage on the &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt;. Use this Curse on any boss who does not use abilities modified by &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt; (ie &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; or Enrage).\nCurse of Recklessness also nullifies &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;. This means that a Warlock can easily CC by casting fear on a mob, and then casting CoR just before it gets out of range. This allows time for a pet to take aggro or your party to finish it off. If the mob gets back to you before the original fear would have run out you can cast another curse, canceling CoR and the mob will start running again.\nThis curse can also be useful against casters, as their attack power is not used."}
{"id": "449487", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=449487", "title": "Curse of Sethe", "text": "The Curse of Sethe is an ancient curse that causes &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; to become wretched and flightless and which cuts them off from the light of their sun goddess, &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. It was created by the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt; during his final moments after the great battle between him, Rukhmar and the raven god , who then became the first to contract the curse after devouring Sethe. To this day, the pools of &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt; are still contaminated with Sethe's blood and curse, and any arakkoa who comes in contact with its water becomes afflicted. The &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; throw heretics and criminals into the fetid pools as a punishment, and over time these cursed &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;outcasts&lt;/a&gt; have formed a society of their own.\nSymptoms.\nThe curse cripples arakkoa with visions of darkness and intense pain, searing the flesh and tearing at the mind. The mind reels, the body writhes, and the wings wither. Most arakkoa die or go insane. Only the strongest can resist. Any arakkoa afflicted by the curse permanently lose their ability to fly and become forever cut off from &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;'s light.\nThe affliction is hereditary and affects the entire lineage, meaning that the offspring of a cursed arakkoa will also be cursed. At the time of the war against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, many arakkoa had been born with it.\nThe Curse of Sethe has been shown to be reversible by the power of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt; regained his wings upon drinking &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;demon blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nThe Curse of Sethe is older than the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; race itself. It was created by the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt; during his final moments after the great battle between him and &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, just before he was devoured by . Only a small trickle of Sethe's blood managed to escape the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spire\"&gt;Broken Spire&lt;/a&gt; where he fell, trickling down to blight the valley below, which would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, however, Anzu felt Sethe's hatred coursing through him. His back twisted, his wings became weak and his mind was wracked with painful visions. The raven god had contained Sethe's curse by taking it upon himself. Anzu would grapple with the curse for some time before retreating to the shadows. Rukhmar, terrified of the curse, would never land in &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt; again, and thus created the arakkoa in hopes that they would one day bask in the wind and sun as she had.\nIn culture.\nAt an unknown point in time, the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling sect of the arakkoan capital &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, began the practice of using the curse as a punishment. Those found guilty of breaking the law, dabbling in &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt;, or worshipping gods other than Rukhmar are hurled from the spires and into the cursed pools of Sethekk Hollow, where their wings shrivel and their bodies contort. This practice has existed for generations.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, a beloved king who was betrayed and cast into the pools by the Adherents, returned from exile he was broken and flightless. Rumors of his cursed state swept like wildfire through the arakkoa, giving rise to superstitious charms and cures. &lt;a href=\"Dreamcatcher\"&gt;Dreamcatcher&lt;/a&gt;s endure as one of the most clung-to icons of safety, for the arakkoa believe the curse will entangle itself in the dreamcatcher and fade in the morning sunlight. It was also held that holding a dreamcatcher in front of oneself would make it act as a net to capture the curse.\nThe Adherents claimed not that the waters of Sethekk Hollow was the source of the affliction, but that the curse was the result of falling from Rukhmar's grace \u2014 the result of disobedience, among other things, and that it was something brought about by one's own weakness, not by an outside force. The Adherents believed that even being in the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; could expose one to the curse, and that it could have lingering effects on the mind of an arakkoa even after a sun-priest had performed purification rites on them. It was believed that lethargy, tardiness and questioning the orders of elders were the first warning signs that the affliction was present. Adventurers can also uncover &lt;a href=\"Decree%20Scrolls\"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;, which, among other things, includes reminders to be vigilant for signs of the curse amongst neighbors and friends.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcast&lt;/a&gt; has experimented in weaponizing the affliction against the Adherents, as there is nothing that they fear more than the power of the curse. His previous attempts to bottle the pooled blood have failed. It breaks down and dissipates when it is taken away from Sethe's bones, but he has high hopes for the congealed form of Sethe's blood.\nSpeculation.\nDue to the similarities between the two, the \"sun sickness\" described in the &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Journal\"&gt;Unmarked Journal&lt;/a&gt; may be connected to the Curse of Sethe."}

This event sparked the beginning of the rise of the pandaren monks and subsequent &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;Pandaren Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the rebellion, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; warned the first pandaren &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s that, although they were free, they had inherited the responsibility to protect Pandaria from the evil minds that wished to claim it. Every one hundred years, the mantid would swarm the land. All that stood in their way were the brave souls who would fight atop the Serpent's Spine. The monks who remained in Kun-Lai dedicated themselves to preparing for this threat. And every one hundred years, pandaren monks lined the top of the Serpent's Spine to face the overwhelming waves of mantid and risk their lives to protect their land. Xuen would always allow one mistweaver to carry Kang's staff &lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt; into this centennial battle, and many lives were saved by those who carried this staff. although many of its bearers also died in service to Pandaria. But their sacrifices were not in vain as the wall stood.\nYears after the rebellion, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; the lands of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, taking Kun-Lai and the Jade Forest. The only real fighting force of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt; was an order of monks, charged by the pandaren emperor to patrol Serpent's Spine and stand against the mantid swarm. Though the monks raced from the Serpent's Spine to defend their lands against the trolls, they quickly found themselves outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the Zandalari's &lt;a href=\"pterrorwing\"&gt;pterrorwing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMany years later, the role of protectors of Pandaria and the Serpent's Wall fell to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; breached the wall, but the newly-arrived &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces assisted the pandaren in fending off the mantid.\nRecently, the mantid and the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; have laid siege to the wall, in an effort to break through to launch an assault on the lands east of the wall. The mantid have managed to damage the wall at the border with the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; and started to unleash their deadly assault upon the land, mainly at &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt;. The yaungol have made it past the &lt;a href=\"Ox%20Gate\"&gt;Ox Gate&lt;/a&gt; and have started to settle in Kun-Lai Summit.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, the recently formed &lt;a href=\"Dusklight%20Bridge\"&gt;Dusklight Bridge&lt;/a&gt; allowed the mantid to move into action, avoiding the &lt;a href=\"Widening%20Deep\"&gt;Widening Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was brought here by &lt;a href=\"Messenger%20Fishtail\"&gt;Messenger Fishtail&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Min\"&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;. He escorted the pandaren girl to a guard tower where &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to meet them. However, her uncle and the tower's guards weren't there. Suddenly, a group of mantid ambushed them, and Min helped her climb down the wall.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20the%20Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Assault in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zara%27thik\"&gt;Zara'thik&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Serpent's Wall main gate.\nArchitecture.\nThe wall runs from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;'s southern coast in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, bordering the western &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and ends in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are few notable settlements upon the wall:"}

Shortly after the Third War, when Illidan requested the aid of the naga, a group of naga led by Lady Vashj answered his call. Ever since, Vashj has displayed a fierce dedication to Illidan.\nNow the naga witch carefully monitors Coilfang's operations from her seat of power within Serpentshrine Cavern. Far more at home here among the waters of the reservoir than locked within the cold stone walls of Black Temple, Vashj maintains a close eye on her minions and personally oversees the draining of Zangarmarsh.\nWhether her loyalties belong to Illidan alone, however, remains to be seen.\nGeography.\nThere is no required boss order in this zone, as there are several paths from the zone-in to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;.

Their damage is fairly weak, so tanks can tank 2 without much trouble, it is possible to have a Paladin tank multiple groups of these monsters at once, however it is wise to have additional tanks ready to taunt the Tidewalker Warriors if / when they drop aggro due to Righteous Defense being on a 15 second cooldown.\nFathom-Lord Karathress encounter.\nThese are the adds during the encounter.\nNPCs related to Leotheras the Blind.\nThis is the trash in the room with leading from Karathress.

Several times a year, Blizzard employees around the world gather to celebrate the two-, five-, ten-, fifteen-, twenty-, and twenty-five-year milestones of their friends and colleagues with a ceremony where each recipient is honored with their service award.\nTwo years of service are rewarded with a special Blizzard Stein; five years of service are rewarded with a sword; ten-year veterans receive a shield; fifteen years of service is recognized with a special ring, available in both male and female versions (both look fantastic). Twenty years of service unlocks an amazing helm, which is presented at our annual holiday party. The twenty-five-year reward has yet to be revealed. The type of sword given to five-year recipients is different each year. We now present a gallery of the service awards that we\u2019ve handed out over the years in recognition of the hard work, great resolve, and unwavering dedication that has helped make Blizzard the company it is today.\nAwards.\nThe photos up to year 2011 were photographed by \"Thomas L.

Both the High Warlord and the Warchief himself were disgusted by this, and to make sure the forsaken won't be up to any tricks, Garrosh dispensed Cromush to \"guard\" Sylvanas. Cromush took this charge without question, though appeared to be far more tolerant of the Forsaken than some &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;other orcs in the Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a long hiatus, Cromush returned to aid the Horde war effort during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. \nBiography.\nCataclysm.\nHigh Warlord Cromush accompanied Lady Sylvanas and her forces through &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;The Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt;. From the latter, he directed the adventurers to kill worgen druids. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cities%20in%20Dust\"&gt;victory over the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, he fought against &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; and his allies when they betrayed Sylvanas, making Godfrey and his ilk escape to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In a moment of panic, Cromush hastily urged the Val'kyr to \"fix\" Sylvanas, which they did, even though it cost them their lives in the process.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; later finds Cromush within Shadowfang Keep, and together with the player they work to defeat Godfrey. Belmont smoothly attributes the effectiveness of the plague the Forsaken forces had been using to clear the keep as little more than a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; repellent; an excuse Cromush takes with a pinch of salt. Godfrey is later able to incapacitate Cromush via poison, leaving Belmont and the player to continue ahead and take revenge.\nCromush was later relocated to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, eager to put the Forsaken war machine to good use. After the demise of &lt;a href=\"Kingslayer%20Orkus\"&gt;Kingslayer Orkus&lt;/a&gt;, Cromush honors his actions for the betterment of a Horde-controlled Lordaeron, and learns of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Clan\"&gt;Stormpike Clan&lt;/a&gt;'s intentions towards it. He asks for the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation, and is shocked when &lt;a href=\"General%20Drek%27Thar\"&gt;General Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; completely rejects the notion of aiding the Forsaken.\nOutraged, Cromush resolves to defeat the Stormpike without the assistance of the Frostwolves. With the help of the player and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Melisara\"&gt;Melisara&lt;/a&gt;, Cromush goes about bringing the destruction of the Stormpike Clan in Hillsbrad, and is able to bring about an aptly named \"Stormpike apocalypse\", shattering their presence in Hillsbrad.\nCromush reveals that Warchief Hellscream will learn of Drek'Thar's supposed \"treason\", though nothing ever came of it.\nCromush accepts the call to arms sent out by the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and comes to their aid in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' forces.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s of Hillsbrad, Cromush led the defense against the demons. After they were repelled, he wanted to deal with the Alliance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nCromush is aboard \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, he assisted the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with establishing an outpost &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later commanded the Horde forces throughout &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, he was certain that the Alliance could never take &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; and would likely get themselves killed by &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s, but he preferred to see to their deaths personally. The &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Vol%27dun\"&gt;Faction Assault on Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; caught him off guard, as he never expected the Alliance to push into the region. He also personally calls for the destruction of the gunship &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Zuldazar\"&gt;assaulting Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. After the Alliance flank Horde forces and push into &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Assault on Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Cromush calls Horde adventurers to defend the hold and cut off the Alliance retreat.\nDragonflight.\nA few years after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Cromush participated in Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. There, he stated he felt out of place, and that he'd rather be leading the orcs in attendance into battle rather than partying.\nHe later warmed up to the event, admitting that it does feel good to reunite with other orcs. During the festival, it was also shown that Cromush is a part of the Blackrock clan, as he sat at the clan table alongside &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt;, and his chieftain &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's likely that the Alliance will fall victim to the blood trolls, but I want to ensure their demise.

He was a champion of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and servant of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and was entrusted the protection of the Black Temple by the Lady. His superior abilities allowed him to surround himself with deadly cold, and his spines and needles could inflict horrific wounds. He was killed during the assault on the Temple by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe fight is a &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;, requiring high &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; on the whole raid and well-equipped healers.\nOverview.\nHigh Warlord Naj'entus periodically skewers players with his Impaling Spines, stunning them until freed by allies. Over the course of the encounter, Naj'entus casts Tidal Shield, becoming immune to damage and restoring health over time until a player hurls a Spine back at him to pierce the bubble.\nPreparation.\nThere is a pair of &lt;a href=\"Aqueous%20Lord\"&gt;Aqueous Lord&lt;/a&gt;s before this boss. They pull together (but separately from the boss) and are not part of the encounter.\nRaid composition:\nAll raid members take 8,500 frost damage every 60 seconds, making 8,501 HP buffed the absolute minimum requirement, but in practice 10,000 HP buffed are needed, to give the healers a little slack.\nClasses that are likely candidates for combat rezzes (all Shamans and all healers) should have at least 8500 HP unbuffed. Frost resistance gear and are not a reliable means to increase survivability. Everybody should have health potions and healthstones, and don't hesitate to use them.\nAfter a standard pull, the melee group sets up close to the boss, and all ranged classes distribute over a large area, with each raid member 6 yards apart from everyone else to avoid the frost AoE from Needle Spine. The melee group should split in 2-3 subgroups to minimize AoE damage.\nRogues need to keep a full stack of &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; up on the boss to reduce its self-healing effect while the Tidal Shield is up. Other &lt;a href=\"reduced%20healing\"&gt;reduced healing&lt;/a&gt; abilities also work, but do not last that long after last application and often wear off a few seconds after the Tidal Shield is up.\nImpaling Spine.\nEvery 20 seconds, Naj'entus shoots a large coral cone at a random raid member. The spine paralyzes and damages its target until it is removed by another player by looting the target. This needs to be done very quickly. It is possible to carry up to five spines in the inventory.\nLooted spines disappear when releasing (after a death) or when the encounter is reset.\nTidal Shield.\nEvery 60 seconds (the first time 60 seconds after the pull), Naj'entus casts a Tidal Shield (instead of throwing an impaling spine). He stops throwing needle spines for 10 seconds after casting the shield, but continues to melee. The shield can be broken by throwing an impaling spine looted earlier at it.\nSpines have a maximum range of 25 yards.\nSince the shield deals 8500 frost damage to the entire raid, everybody must be at top health before the spine is thrown. Most Boss Mod type UI enhancements have an indicator window showing people with less than 8500 health when the shield is up.\nDealing with the Impaling Spines and the Tidal Shield requires good synchronisation. It's a common practise to have one player announce the Impaling Spine targets, and to call for the throwing of a spine when the whole raid is healed. It's a good idea to have one of the raid healers do the calling for the spine throw (because he can call for the spine when the last heal is nearly finished).\nIn some situations it may be necessary to sacrifice a few raid members because Naj'entus heals himself, so waiting a long time for the raid to heal up is not a good option.\nMacros.\nThis is a quick method to throw a spine from the inventory:\n /use Naj'entus spine\nIt's also a good idea to announce the facts of being hit by and having looted a spine:\n /say &lt;name&gt; got spined!\nand\n /say &lt;name&gt; looted a spine!"}

They are the most direct conduits the mortal races have to the divine.\nMany priests who become high divinists call themselves high priests. However, they may not take titles at all, allowing their power to speak for itself.\nWhile they are divine analogues to archmagi, unlike their &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, all high divinists do not belong to a single organization like the Kirin Tor. Rather, each faith usually maintains its own cadre of high divinists. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; boast high priestesses of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and great &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s become high priests of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Other races also become high divinists, of course, and the entities that command their reverence and the powers they wield are much darker. &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; high &lt;a href=\"priestess%20of%20the%20tides\"&gt;priestesses of the tides&lt;/a&gt; are frightening and powerful creatures of corrupt magnificence, and frothing &lt;a href=\"Atal%E2%80%99ai\"&gt;Atal\u2019ai&lt;/a&gt; high divinists spill hot blood in the name of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn adventuring parties, high divinists continue to serve in the same roles they filled before. Their spellcasting ability remains powerful and important, but their unique abilities add something new to the party\u2019s combined efforts."}

The high elves were once a significant force on the continent, but in recent times their numbers have been dramatically reduced: approximately 90% of their population was slaughtered during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, 90% of the surviving high elves changed their name to \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" or sin'dorei (children of the blood in &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;) in remembrance of their fallen brethren, and no longer consider themselves high elves.\nThe high elves as a whole were relatively secluded from the younger races for several millennia, though both the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; saw relations established with them: with &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Kingdom of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The high elves' reluctant allegiance to the latter proved short-lived, as the high elven king &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; quickly grew apathetic to the plight of his allies, and officially seceded his nation. Subsequently, the high elven kingdom was brought to the brink of annihilation when &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; launched the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and decimated the high elves. Rallied by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, second-in-command of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves rejoined with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, and renamed themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;\"blood elves\"&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of their perished brethren. The blood elves then sought to unite and restore their people to the glory they enjoyed at the height of high elf civilization, and have retaken much of their land from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, a few high elves did not rename themselves blood elves. High elves and blood elves are physiologically the same race, and the difference between high and blood elves is only political. When Quel'Thalas left the Alliance, some high elves chose to remain with their allies over their kingdom, and to this day still support the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Some high elves were exiled&lt;/a&gt; from Quel'Thalas after the Third War. Other high elf remnants have chosen to rejoin the Alliance in recent years, arriving to a cold reception. Modern high elves are a rare sight, and are commonly mistaken for blood elves. In consequence, there are very few high elves left on Azeroth today. High elves did not gather in any significant numbers and are a very small group of individuals. Indeed, modern high elves cannot even truly be said to have a culture\u2014only a past filled with glory and regret.\nAs a people, the high elves are all but extinct: the remnants \"of the remnants\" of a fallen race. Though without any official leader, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; leads one of the few organized high elf collaborations, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, as its self-styled Ranger General. &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of the remnants of Alleria's ranger cadre found in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, serves as the high elven representative at the restored &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; in modern &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nExile of the Highborne.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; adopted &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;, they outlawed the practice of arcane magic. The use of its dangerous powers was punishable by death. However, many Highborne loyalists of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; survived the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and grew restless. They suffered from magical withdrawal, and 7,300 years before the invasion of the Horde through the Dark Portal, they spoke against &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of this movement, declared the druids cowards for refusing to wield the arcane. Malfurion and the druids warned the Highborne that any use of magic would be punished. Yet, in an attempt to protest the druid's law, Dath'Remar and his followers unleashed a terrible magical storm upon &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe druids could not bring themselves to put so many of their kin to death, so they decided to exile the reckless Highborne from their lands. Sunstrider and his followers boarded a number of specially crafted ships and set sail upon the seas. By now the Highborne were glad to be rid of their conservative cousins and free to practice the arcane with impunity. None knew what lay beyond the Maelstrom, but they eventually found the Eastern Kingdoms and formed their own magical realm. They abandoned the concepts of Elune and nocturnal activity, embracing the sun instead. They would soon become known as the high elves.\nRise of Quel'Thalas.\nSunstrider led the high elven fleets across the world for many long years. Their goal was to find places of considerable ley power for them to build their new homeland. After landing on the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; continent, they moved inland and formed a settlement in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. After a few years, however, many were driven insane. The belief at the time was that something evil slept beneath the Glades, so the high elves abandoned the region and moved northwards. They wandered the land for years.\nAround this time, they had become completely severed from the life-giving energy of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. This meant that they were vulnerable to the elements and had not received immortality from Nozdormu and the World Tree. They had shrunk in height and their skin had become a peach hue similar to most &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The high elves soon discovered primitive &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, but associated little with them. The &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, under the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, posed a greater threat to their society. The elves soon grew to hate the forest trolls and they fought each other whenever they met. When the high elves went to war with the Amani trolls, the elves could not understand how the trolls' weapon enchantments were more powerful than their own. The elves then stole ancient knowledge from troll spellcasters, including the famous &lt;a href=\"Zanza\"&gt;Zanza&lt;/a&gt;, and used stolen idols to craft their own versions of the troll enchantments.\nAfter many more years, the high elves discovered a land in the northern forests which suited them, and founded the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, they would learn that Quel'Thalas was founded on a sacred and ancient troll city. The trolls began to attack the elven settlements en masse in retaliation. Although the Amani outnumbered them ten to one, the elves utilized magic to its fullest effect and defeated the trolls.\nSome elves, wary of the kaldorei's warnings, created a protective barrier around Quel'Thalas which allowed them to continue their magic without attracting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s attention. To do this, they employed a series of monolithic &lt;a href=\"Runestones\"&gt;Runestones&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, Quel'Thalas became a shining monument to high elven prowess. It was crafted in the same style as the halls of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of integrated &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and a brighter color scheme. Although they did not worship it, a great respect was maintained for nature. The high elves were careful to interweave their cities and architecture with their natural surroundings, creating a truly beautiful and tranquil land.\nTo sate their hunger for great magical power, the high elves created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. It became the source of their power as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; had been in Kalimdor, although the Sunwell was much weaker, and the elves were forewarned of the dangers. As the high elves became more powerful, they cast an enchantment on the forests that bathed Quel'Thalas in eternal springtime, in defiance of the kingdom's location on the extreme north of the continent. From that point on, all high elves had access to the Sunwell's powers from anywhere on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the high elves came to regard the Sunwell's waters as holy. Magic became part of their genes centuries before, but the Sunwell's unique energies became part of them acutely.\nTroll Wars.\nFor nearly four thousand years, the high elves remained relatively at peace. But while the elves established their nation, the Amani plotted their next assault. 2,800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; began. With aid from the Zandalari, small Amani warbands began attacking Quel'Thalas' borders while hiding their true numbers in order to test the high elves' strength. After several successful skirmishes, they launched an all-out campaign to wipe out the elves. The elves were hopelessly outnumbered and quickly lost ground while their casualties climbed. To help defend Quel'Thalas, the elves founded the order of &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest of whom was &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuffering loss after loss, the high elf king &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; sent ambassadors to Strom to ask for support from the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes that there were humans who could become useful in combat if given magical training. The elven ambassadors told Thoradin that the troll armies were vast and would move to attack Arathor once they had destroyed Quel'Thalas. After some further negotiations, Thoradin and Anasterian reached an agreement, and elven magi traveled to Strom to teach exactly &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;one hundred humans&lt;/a&gt; the ways of magic in exchange for the humans' military aid.\nOnce the elves had finished tutoring the human magi, many months later, Arathor began its offensive into the Amani's southern flank on the outskirts of Quel'Thalas. In coordination, the high elves launched a counterattack on the trolls' front lines from the north. Thoradin's army later began a slow retreat back to Alterac. Weeks of brutal fighting ensued as the Amani chased the humans toward the mountains, while the elves marched out of Quel'Thalas to harry the Amani's rear flank. Even though the Arathi were outnumbered, neither side gave ground. The high elves soon caught up and smashed into the Amani's rearguard. When the humans and elves were confident that they had worn down the Amani ranks, they unleashed their secret weapon. The one hundred human magi emerged from the fortress and, alongside the elven sorcerers, did something unprecedented. Instead of attacking individually, they pooled their power and unleashed a single devastating spell, creating a massive column of fire that tore down from the sky and engulfed the Amani army. The magical flames prevented the trolls from &lt;a href=\"Troll%23Troll%20regeneration\"&gt;regenerating&lt;/a&gt; their wounds and burned loa and troll alike from the inside out. Without their leader, the surviving trolls broke ranks and fled north. The human and elven armies ran them down and killed everyone they could find. The Troll Wars thus ended with the humans and elves triumphant.\nFor Quel'Thalas and Arathor, the Troll Wars marked the beginning of a prosperous new era. For months after the war's end, celebrations filled the streets of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. In gratitude, the high elves made a pledge of undying loyalty and friendship to Arathor and to Thoradin's bloodline. Humans and high elves went on to nurture peaceful relations for over two thousand years. With the absence of trolls in the northlands, the elves focused on rebuilding Quel'Thalas.\nNew world diplomacy.\nDespite the enmity that led to their exile, the high elves still kept some contacts with their faraway brethren. &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; fought alongside the kaldorei &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; collaborated with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; several thousand years before current times.\nA group of high elf &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s helped build &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s original defenses.\nOver 3,000 years ago the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Council of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, which had long ago sworn to forestall any full return by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, met with the most powerful Magocrat lords of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and formed the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, whose quest was to hunt those &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s who had already arrived, and to prevent others from entering &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne hundred years before the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of high elves left Quel'Thalas and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nPeace in Quel'Thalas continued for almost three thousand years until the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; came through a portal from the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, they allied with the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, turning their sights on the north.\nWhen the humans proposed an Alliance of their seven nations, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s also agreed to join the coalition. The Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; also contacted the high elven nation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. As a descendant of the famed king &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar was able to make use of an ancient oath sworn to the ancient king by the high elves in times past, during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the high elves proved reluctant, not viewing the Horde as a serious threat. &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; only subsequently sent a small, token, fleet to aid the Alliance. Some high elves, however, disobeyed the king's orders, choosing instead to join in the fight against the orcs, and answering Lothar's call to war. Chief among these was the renowned &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who led a handful of her kin south with her. Though disappointed with the generally poor response from Quel'Thalas, Lothar nonetheless welcomed those elves who arrived, particularly Windrunner and her skilled rangers.\nHowever, the orcs' northern campaign, in which the trolls were meant to take back their ancestral homes from the high elves, managed to burn down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, slaughtering many high elves in the process, and corrupting the Runestone at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. This enraged &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, which promptly pledged its full support to the war. The elves provided many &lt;a href=\"Archer%23High%20elven%20archer\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; to the conflict, and even craftsmen for the &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mills&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance. The Horde eventually splintered under &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;internal political pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance charged southwards to crush it. The Second War was won, but in its aftermath, relations between the humans and the elves began to sour. The elves, who had been reluctant members of the Alliance in the first place, retained little interest or investment in its affairs, such as upkeeping the internment camps and defending &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but that was as much from their fascination with all &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; as from any desire to help humans. Despite this, Alleria Windrunner and her rangers accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, to avenge Quel'Thalas and keep it safe from future attacks.\nFollowing the war, some high elves blamed the humans' poor leadership for the burning of their forests. King Terenas of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; reminded them that nothing of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; would have remained if not for the hundreds of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s that gave their lives to defend it, but nevertheless, the high elves largely abandoned the Alliance and retreated to their kingdom.\nThird War.\nAlthough the high elves retreated from the Alliance, a number of them remained in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and were loyal to the Alliance through the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, as most contemporary &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and high elven mages bowed to the sovereignty of Dalaran and the Kirin Tor at this time, with Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider among them. Despite the high elves' official departure from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, some elves still remain true to their former &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; allies. Some high elves were also &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin pupil of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The altruistic priests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; refused to abandon their roles as healers and agreed to remain in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; despite the edicts from their reclusive masters in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. The high elven priests use their &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-given powers to heal the wounded and bolster the spirits of Lordaeron's fighting elite. These high elven priests joined with Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in investigating the plague with the goal of healing the land of its strange curse.\nAt the time, the high elves had remained at peace since the Second War, with even their ever-present Amani enemies having grown less bold. Yet while the elves were safe within their enchanted kingdom from the woes befalling Lordaeron, they were also secluded and left unprepared for what was to come. Following the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the recently corrupted Arthas Menethil turned his sight on Quel'Thalas, as told by his master the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Their goal was to revive a human man named &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who could summon the demon-lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. To do this, they required a source of considerable ley magic and chose the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors of Arthas's patricide were beginning to spread, but the elves did not connect this to the plagued grain epidemic, and only shortly after did the undead Scourge arrive at Quel'Thalas. The high elves faced the Scourge in battle regardless. The high elven army, led by the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, made counterattacks every time the scourge advanced. Despite their tactics and magic, the elves were pushed back from the outer, to inner elf gates. During the invasion, Arthas raised the fallen members of Sylvanas's army either as incorporeal &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; or as intact bodies. These fallen high elves would become known as &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt;, prowling the lands as either &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;blood mages&lt;/a&gt; for the Scourge. Finally, Arthas and his army, as well as new &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, including Sylvanas, advanced on Silvermoon and crushed the defenders. Anasterian himself was killed along with his &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ruling council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunwell was used to resurrect Kel'Thuzad and fouled with evil in the process. Only about ten percent of the entire race survived the genocide. Several defenders were raised into &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s while some deceased magisters were raised into &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;s and left at the defiled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them were lucky enough to be away from Quel'Thalas at the time (housed in Dalaran or had traveled to Kalimdor with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;), but the majority of those who survived only did so by defending themselves or hiding. Soon, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, with the second greatest concentration of high elves, was destroyed as well. Dalaran's defeat was swift and complete, and most of the high elves there died under Archimonde's attacks. Other elves died afterward from bandits that came to sift through the wreckage. The death knight's brutal conquest of the elven kingdom resulted in the utter destruction of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, the defiling of much of the high elven forests, and the total slaughter of around 90% of the high elven race.\nAmong the survivors, some &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Priest%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;high elf priests&lt;/a&gt; who survived the genocide joined the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Alliance\"&gt;Kalimdor alliance&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSplintering of the elves.\nThe surviving elves were somewhat scattered, until &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, son of the deceased Anasterian, began to organize them by reclaiming every elf he could find and joining with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, who had done the same in Quel'Thalas. Under Kael's leadership, they took the name &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, to remember the death of their king and brethren. About 90% of all surviving high elves became blood elves.\nThe blood elves fought to reclaim a &lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;small portion&lt;/a&gt; of Silvermoon, but most of the city and their land, in general, was haunted and overrun by lingering undead, while their buildings remained in ruins and vengeful &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls began striking out again. Around 15% of the newly-named sin'dorei, led by Kael'thas himself, started traveling throughout the land in order to find more surviving elves and to find a source of magic to replace the Sunwell. The elves were suffering from great withdrawals after being cut off the Sunwell because of its destruction. Due to the unreasonable orders of the Alliance leader &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, Kael's people were forced to ally themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; and fled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. They soon joined &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; there, and he, in turn, taught them how to sate their hunger for magic by feeding on alternative sources (having himself suffered the same withdrawal for thousands of years). Kael's blood elves began to hunt and use demons in order to steal their powers, although Kael's alliance with Illidan (and worse, his new reliance on fel magic) was kept a secret from most of his brethren back home.\nMost of the remaining \"high\" elves had chosen to remain with the Alliance following the Second War and did not return to their kingdom following the Third. When Grand Magister &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to teach them Kael's magic siphoning ways, some elves were disgusted by the practice. Unable to lead a divided nation, Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; exiled the dissenters from the kingdom, the exiles finding residence in Quel'Lithien.\nA few high elves rejoined the Alliance in recent years, but the Alliance as a whole remains somewhat suspicious of high elves to this day, as their secession after Second War left bitter memories. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who became part of the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, saw it as their duty to warn their new allies against the high elves. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s part in bringing about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; figured heavily in the night elves' retelling of high elf history.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves were in a state of diaspora. Most resided in human cities like &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Others live in seclusion in the wild forests, often in hunting lodges such as &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Lodge\"&gt;Farstrider Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. Several high elves have also integrated into &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep within the Hinterlands, the high elves of the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; used their outpost as a center of communication, while their ambassadors were working to establish diplomatic relationships with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance, with whom they shared their knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark trolls&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the area in the southern Hinterlands. At some point they made an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, much to the ire of their common enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls. &lt;a href=\"Otho%20Moji%27ko\"&gt;Otho Moji'ko&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Tribe\"&gt;Revantusk Tribe&lt;/a&gt; instructed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to slaughter as many Highvale elves as possible, while &lt;a href=\"Oran%20Snakewrithe\"&gt;Oran Snakewrithe&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the same adventurers to burn documents that recorded the Highvale elves' communications with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt; and other information. However, their actions were unsuccessful, as the Highvale elves still retained the documents, which also included deaths, births, and seasons.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora Skycaller&lt;/a&gt;, originally found in &lt;a href=\"Northpass%20Tower\"&gt;Northpass Tower&lt;/a&gt; helped the Alliance adventurers to recreate the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;:Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt;. Later she moved to below &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; as the tower became a battlefield. Later, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers to ransack the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in order to recover the &lt;a href=\"%3AQuel%27Thalas%20Registry\"&gt;:Quel'Thalas Registry&lt;/a&gt;, which contained his true identity before he became &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nA small unit of high elven rangers under the command of Ranger Captain &lt;a href=\"Fellari%20Swiftarrow\"&gt;Fellari Swiftarrow&lt;/a&gt; fought together with the zealous &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; against the undead for a while, though they were lost in battle. A large statue in honor of the capable elven leader was erected in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral high elves became &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Strand%20Assassin\"&gt;assassins&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt;, while some joined the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWith the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;dark portal&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;'s high elven ranger cadre were reconnected with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After learning of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Quel'Thalas and their brethren's allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, many of them chose to remain in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. High elves are currently stationed at &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and they have also taken up refuge in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nSometime before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Ranger Lord &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; high elves, and High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora Skycaller&lt;/a&gt; were approached by the Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. Though initially under the impression that Lor'themar had come to apologize on behalf of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, Hawkspear is taken aback to learn of the Prince's demise. He asked who would take the crown, and Lor'themar replied that none remained with a right to it.\nLor'themar referenced the slightly better state of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and offered the quel'dorei aid and supplies. Renthar, however, angrily declined his assistance -- and revealed that Lor'themar had banished the quel'dorei of the lodge from Quel'Thalas, as he could not afford to lead a people divided. In addition, Hawkspear spoke of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agents who had ransacked the lodge and killed several rangers, in the name of the Banshee Queen's champion, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. He stated that by rights he should send Lor'themar's head to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, though ordered him to leave instead.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves took the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; back with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, and the high elves were allowed to share the Sunwell. Captain &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance Expedition rangers represents the high elves at the well itself. A number of high elves have been permitted to make pilgrimages to the restored fount of power.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, the blood elves began seeking representation in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed themselves &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; in the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and instead sought to help bridge the gaps between the two factions, they started by reaching out to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; for magical support against &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the elven population of Dalaran underwent something of a split: the portion of the elves who converted to the blood elven philosophy took up the name \"the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;\", named for their leader, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the only non-human on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; at the time who ensured the Horde a sanctuary within the city. Conversely, the high elven members who opposed the notion of allowing the sin'dorei back into the Kirin Tor's ranks formed the Silver Covenant as a precaution against possible treachery from the Sunreavers. Consequently, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; became the base of operations of the Covenant, and later of the Alliance in Dalaran. However, their leader &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; held no political sway within the city, thus the blood elves were officially readmitted as members of the Kirin Tor.\nAs the Silver Covenant wasn't delighted having the Horde in Dalaran, with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; leading the charge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, many high elves aligned themselves with the Alliance, and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; during the Alliance's war against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Some of their members joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; as battle mages, now stationed at &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Vas%20the%20Unstable\"&gt;Vas the Unstable&lt;/a&gt; as their representative. They later represented the Alliance from the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Pavilion\"&gt;Silver Covenant Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile some high elf communities, like the one at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, have managed to maintain their stocks of &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s, their exile from Silvermoon has made these animals much harder to come by. Fortunately, the Silver Covenant seem to have won the trust of the companions of their ancient ancestors: the &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s. The intelligent creatures have apparently decided that the high elves are worthy of a partnership, serving as mounts and &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt; conveyance from their outposts.\nVereesa and her husband &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; were later present at the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, along with their half-elf sons.\nCataclysm.\nSince the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s no longer have a presence in the Alliance cities, having likely returned to Dalaran. With the removal of the portals in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, class trainers, mostly high elven, have taken their place.\nAt some point, a group of young &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; moved into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Highvale\"&gt;Highvale&lt;/a&gt; high elves. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; offensive throughout the continent, Quel'Danil lodge came under attack. With the help of adventurers, the &lt;a href=\"Highvale\"&gt;Highvale&lt;/a&gt; high elves and the draenei settlers were able to repel the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Invader\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt;. The Highvale documents were also retrieved from the chaos by Alliance adventurers and safely delivered to &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Traska\"&gt;Anchorite Traska&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elves at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Hive%20of%20Scum%20and%20Villainy\"&gt;taken a turn for the worse&lt;/a&gt;, after Ranger Lord Hawkspear discovered a source of seductive energy that mysteriously turned the elves at the lodge into &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Quel'Danil Lodge elves have fared considerably better, having &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge%20%28quest%29\"&gt;solidified relations&lt;/a&gt; with the draenei and the Wildhammer dwarves.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;Word of a new threat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; has prompted &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to co-operate, against the wishes of Silvermoon's &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent-Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. Vereesa brought with her an entourage of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;. While this event may have showcased the cooperation between high and blood elves, their future reunification appears to remain elusive.\nA retelling of elven history concerning the &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;:Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; could be undertaken in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, addressing the intertwining plights of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, their fallen quel'dorei descendants, and the recent venture of a blood elf &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; regiment, all of whom met their end on the icy shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Lake Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt;. Their stories were told through three lingering spirits: the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Spirit\"&gt;Kaldorei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Spirit\"&gt;Quel'dorei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sin%27dorei%20Spirit\"&gt;Sin'dorei Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nA number of high elves of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; was present during the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; escaped from Theramore, Vereesa led her soldiers to the western part of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter Jaina Proudmoore discovered that &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; steal the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; by using Dalaran portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina mobilized the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces, and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge&lt;/a&gt; the Horde from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;; after &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; refused to order his people to leave peacefully, Jaina chose to incarcerate him and the other blood elves. Various high-ranking high elves were slain by Horde agents who sought to free the imprisoned Sunreavers and their leader, including &lt;a href=\"Sorin%20Magehand\"&gt;Sorin Magehand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Rathaella\"&gt;Arcanist Rathaella&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mage-Commander%20Zuros\"&gt;Mage-Commander Zuros&lt;/a&gt;. During the chaos, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; noted that, \"It unsettles me to have to fight directly with the high elves of the Silver Covenant...but I never tire of slaying Alliance.\" The Sunreavers that surrendered were imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, while those who resisted were put to the sword, thereby leaving the high elves the sole elven population living freely in the city.\nShortly afterward, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, comprising of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; high elves and Kirin Tor war mages, was formed by Jaina Proudmoore, intending to seize &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Isle\"&gt;Thunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; and prevent the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; from claiming powerful artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa Windrunner led the Silver Covenant to &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, pledging their aid to the new leader of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; following their inauguration.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa led a group of Silver Covenant war mages to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their attempt to reclaim the city from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. A formal, if tense, truce was later made between the Alliance troops and the Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. In time, the combined elven army fought its way to the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself, where the kaldorei, sin'dorei, quel'dorei and shal'dorei rebels were confronted and defeated by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome high elves were also present in the ranks of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Shieldbearer\"&gt;Silver Hand Shieldbearer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;ren'dorei&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt; their new base of operations, and pledged their loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf%20Wayfarer\"&gt;High Elf Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;s have traveled to the broken world in order to better study the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, some high elves could be seen during the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Frostfencer%20Seraphi\"&gt;Frostfencer Seraphi&lt;/a&gt;, to either be helped by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s or to engage the Horde.\nA few &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Shield-Mage\"&gt;high elf forces&lt;/a&gt; participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yvera%20Dawnwing\"&gt;Yvera Dawnwing&lt;/a&gt; helped teleport Alliance forces from Boralus to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa and Alleria Windrunner were both present along with high elven ballistae.\nAppearance.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", the high elves resemble blood elves appearance-wise, as biologically and physiologically they are the same race. Lore-wise, it is not uncommon for high elves to be mistaken for blood elves. &lt;a href=\"Taela%20Everstride\"&gt;Taela Everstride&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; even says, somewhat bemusedly, \"No, don't feel bad. I get that a lot... I'm a high elf, not a blood elf. Don't worry, I won't suck the magic out of you.\" Other than greeting voices, both high and blood elves appear to share similar voice emotes in-game, particularly during combat. Before \"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\", in-game high and blood elves used modified night elf models.\nElves do have several characteristics in common. All groups have unusually acute senses and are able to see clearly even in low-light conditions with their keen sight. As a general rule, elves are also slim, athletic, and graceful. They are taller than most &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. On average, high elven women are 5'9\" tall while high elven men usually stand around 6'3\" in height, with males typically having slender, muscular, and athletic bodies. Like all elves, high elves are considered highly attractive by the standards of most mortal races. They typically have fairly long hair, and generally do not grow their facial hair to gigantic proportions until old age. They also possess long pointy ears, and while night elves have long, slanted ears while high elves' ears are shorter and tend to point upwards. Furthermore, their pointed ears have been greeted with admiration or mockery by other races. Their hearing is so sharp that they can pick up the sound of a butterfly landing on a nearby flower. Humans and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; often make fun of high elf ears by comparing them to those of &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;swine&lt;/a&gt;, or\u2014worst of all\u2014&lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOne similarity between various elves only came about recently: since the night elves sacrificed their immortality and much of their power at the end of the Third War, all elves are now mortal and have comparable lifespans that can extend as long as several thousand years.\nHigh elves typically have light-colored eyes that vary from light grey to blue to green, and occasionally brown, and grey. In ', the \"Ranger Scouting\" upgrade for the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Elven Ranger&lt;/a&gt; shows an eye with a green pupil. In ', high elven eyes were depicted as white and pupil-less, both in-game and in official artwork.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and all high elves had purple eyes. But it was a bug and was reverted for &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.2\"&gt;patch 9.0.2&lt;/a&gt;. In the process of tracking the bug down, it was decided to give purple eyes to playable &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, but these were a different set of eyes than the ones removed.\nPopulation.\nSurviving high elves comprise a mere 1% of the original high elven population, with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; accounting for the remaining 9% of it. Since Kael'thas took 15% of the blood elves to Outland (i.e. 1.35% of the original high elf population), and since Kael'thas' army numbered at least 2,000 it follows that the total high elf population is currently at least 1,481 (and at least ~148,000 prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn relation to the playable races, Blizzard has stated that the high elves have a considerably smaller population than even the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Exiles\"&gt;Gnomeregan Exiles&lt;/a&gt;. High elves are a rare sight even in &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; lands, and are considered a fallen, all-but-extinct race. With the destruction of both Theramore and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien\"&gt;Quel'Lithien&lt;/a&gt;, the bulk of the remaining high elf population appears to be bound to the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, high elves seldom give birth and very rarely give birth to twins.\nCulture.\nHigh elven society in Quel'Thalas was highly regimented, and it was difficult for individuals to move beyond their caste.\nOnce, Quel'Thalas used to host bright, pompous ceremonies with mock battles and pageantry. However, in the wake of the various tragedies suffered by their race, the high elves who renamed themselves blood elves have become embittered and now view such excessive displays as distasteful. One high elven celebration was the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance\"&gt;Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, which commemorated the anniversary of the final battle of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh elven architecture is of the same illustrious and elegant design as it was when Dath'Remar Sunstrider founded Quel'Thalas. It involves pendulous creations of wondrous curves and columns, their designs involving natural, floral, flowing, and animal motifs. Their fountains seem to defy physical boundaries, creating or warping water in impossible ways.\nLike &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, high elves can be far more patient than humans and are able to remain alert and ready to act even after hours of waiting. However, younger ones do dislike waiting as much as humans, and although most outgrow their tendencies toward impatience early on, some retain the trait for the rest of their lives. The latter generally ended up living away from Quel'Thalas or taking on tasks that let them travel extensively.\nHigh elves have sensitive taste buds and dislike the taste of heartier &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; food. However, during his time in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; noted that he appreciated the heartiness of human food and that while elven food is delicious and attractively presented, it sometimes leaves one hungry for a more substantial meal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; mocked the quel'dorei for having a tendency to exaggerate, saying that \"the elves are very fond of putting paper manes on cats and calling them lions\".\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf%20Wayfarer\"&gt;High Elf Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, the study of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; is as frowned upon in high elf society as it is among the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost young high elves have a \"I wanna be a &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt;\" phase which they outgrow by the time they're taken as apprentices, at which point they enter the \"I'm going to be a &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt;\" phase instead.\nHigh elven children would play a game called \"Captive\" - each turn a child would be tied up by the others. The one who would release himself in the least amount of time won.\nLanguage.\nHigh elves speak &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, the language of their ancient race. They originally spoke &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, leading to some overlap and linguistic similarities between the two languages, but with time their language evolved into the modern one. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, their elder tongue had been almost forgotten.\nSeveral of the common quel'dorei sayings spoken in-game have been translated by the Warcraft Encyclopedia's entry on Thalassian, and can be &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Thalassian\"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat and technology.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Wizard%27s%20Almanac\"&gt;The Old Wizard's Almanac&lt;/a&gt;, the magic of the high elves is extremely powerful, as high elves possess a magical acumen that rivals that of any - even the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of the greatest heroes in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; were the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;high elf priests&lt;/a&gt;. High elves are proficient in &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven%20Swordsman\"&gt;swordsmanship&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, they used &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;guard towers&lt;/a&gt; for defense, and seemingly developed the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20golem\"&gt;Arcane golem&lt;/a&gt;s, as they were created during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, though the quel'dorei had never been seen to make use of them prior to their conversion to sin'dorei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;elven destroyers&lt;/a&gt; were powerful warships from the fleets of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Crewed with highly-skilled elven seafarers, these swift-sailing vessels were prepared to engage the enemy wherever they might be found. Elven destroyers constituted a critical part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; naval defense force as they could unleash their firepower upon dreaded aerial forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nMounts and companions.\nThe high elves had a special affinity with &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;s before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The dragonhawks would often serve as flying mounts for the elves, though after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; they seem to have developed a preference for &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s instead.\nSome high elves ride a &lt;a href=\"Elven%20horse\"&gt;special breed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. According to the elves, generations of breeding have created an animal far superior to its mundane cousins. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; are shown riding horned &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei%20Steed\"&gt;Quel'dorei Steed&lt;/a&gt;s, which also appeared on the sails of the &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;Thalassian warships&lt;/a&gt; and on the shields of the &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, indicating a proximity with the animal. They descended from a fine line of horses that once grazed near the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeliefs and practices.\nWhile high elves revere the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, they don't see it as a god.\nFounded centuries ago in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; spread its faith through the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, while its philosophy and sacred teachings also managed to spread through the high elf society.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; also uses the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; on its &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s (a golden phoenix on a blue background), but given their architecture is simply recolored from existing blood elf designs, it is unclear what, if any, meaning this has to them.\nMagical addiction.\nLike blood elves, high elves can use arcane magic. Whether or not they are spellcasters, all high elves suffer acute pangs of withdrawal in the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energies. Some have realized the cause of their distress; others have not. A crucial difference between high elves and blood elves is that no high elves have decided to feed their hunger for arcane magic by draining that magic from alternative sources (during the time when the Sunwell was useless). Without the Sunwell, a high elf might still succumb to that addiction and become one of the blood elves.\nOn several occasions after the Sunwell's defilement, Kael'thas publicly asserted that his people would die unless they found a new source of magic. Technically the prince was mistaken. According to Azeroth's top priests and medics, the only high elves to perish due to magical withdrawal have been the very old, the very young, and elves who were already in poor health. Such a low rate of attrition might be considered an argument in favor of simply forgoing magic and suffering through the consequences. Indeed, a few high elves are said to have succeeded in taking this route through sheer willpower: they survived the process, however unpleasant. Apparently, certain magical artifacts also ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal and might, if sufficiently powerful, be able to suppress them altogether. This is not to say, however, that withdrawal from magic would leave the high elves unharmed. On the contrary, permanent mental or physical damage is possible.\nThe high elves in &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Vessel\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; containing raw, magical energy to resist the lure of demonic magic. The high elves at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; found an item of magical energy and succumbed to their addiction, becoming &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the reigniting of the Sunwell, the pangs of their magic addiction are being eased and more high elves are no longer tempted to succumb to it.\nRelations.\nDiplomacy with the Alliance.\nHumans and high elves have a long history. They fought the overwhelming &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; together in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the monstrous &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and horrifying nightmares of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The high elven nation's conduct at the end of the Second War led to bitterness and resentment toward the elves, but humans are also amongst the few races to accept the high elves into their cities; they can currently be seen occupying the human city of Stormwind, and Theramore before its &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt;, where many high elves once joined the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore military&lt;/a&gt;. Of the human kingdoms, the high elves have the closest relationship with the magocrats of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, as elves have been allies and productive members of the Kirin Tor for over 2,000 years. The high elf prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; even served on its ruling council, and it was not uncommon for high elf mages to study, serve, and even live in Dalaran in addition to Quel'Thalas. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; spent much of his life in Dalaran as a high elf, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was married to its leader. Dalaran serves as a home for the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the most prominent group of modern high elves.\nThe high elves were, at best, reluctant members of the original human-centric Alliance of Lordaeron, and their partnership was a cold and distant one. The high elven &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt; were particularly unenthusiastic allies, caring little for the world outside Quel'Thalas and only agreeing to join the Alliance because of a pact made long ago to the line of &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;; and even so, the high elves seceded soon after that pact was fulfilled. After officially departing from the Alliance, the high elves shut themselves off in their enchanted kingdom, and the few who remained with the Alliance did so against the orders of their reclusive masters in Silvermoon.\nAlthough no high elves were present in the ritual which created &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Umbric&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, there are those among the quel'dorei who interact with the ren'dorei. They can be seen both in &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, walking side by side. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;-infused high elf, being able to alternate between the two different forms, and possibly acting as a link between the two groups within the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is implied that the high elves had a positive relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves planned to send their children to seek refuge with the dwarves in the Hinterlands even though the elves had already left the Alliance.\nAlthough physically and culturally disparate, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s share the elves' natural affinity to magic, and it is known that gnomes and high elves worked together in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; before its fall, particularly within the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt seems that the high elves and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; have developed a bond, as there are draenei present at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight elves.\nThe high elves and the night elves collaborated at least once in the millennia between the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and the modern age. &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; of the neutral &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; notably fought during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; alongside high elves, and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; met &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; two or three thousand years ago.\nHigh elves have traditionally gotten along quite poorly with &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; due to their complicated and turbulent past. As the night elves hold disdain for the arcane-using blood elves, so they hold disdain for their high elf cousins. This argument is questioned, though, by the fact that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; had no problem whatsoever working with the blood elves and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; when she hunted &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas seemed to feel honored by the night elves' presence. This one instance of smooth cooperation between the races might be an exception caused by each party's need for survival in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the high elves' banishment from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, some of them chose to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and the night elves were among their greatest critics. While the traditional allies of the Alliance treated the high elves to a cold reception and suspicion due to their secession after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves took it upon themselves to warn the Alliance (which they, too, were now a part of) against the high elves.\nHowever, since \"\" relations may be thawing. The presence of night elves in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; settlements suggests this, and high elves are even allowed inside Darnassus. &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Dulial\"&gt;Arcanist Dulial&lt;/a&gt; has a permanent residence there, and a night elf, &lt;a href=\"Moonbell\"&gt;Moonbell&lt;/a&gt;, has been accepted in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; with her husband and &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; sons; suggesting improved &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;- high elf relations. Vereesa and her quel'dorei elves also shared a camp with Tyrande and her kaldorei with no significant tension during the events of Suramar, and Alleria Windrunner also teleported to &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt; when seeking to recruit the void elves.\nDiplomacy with the Horde.\nApart from the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, with whom the Highborne had had some ancient historical contact, high elves loathe the majority of the Horde's races, having fought against &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; in recent wars.\nBlood elves.\nWhile high elves and blood elves are physiologically the same race, high elves generally do not get along with their blood elf brethren. This is owed in part to differing allegiances, as most modern high elves remained loyal to the Alliance following the Second War, disobeying royal edicts from their reclusive masters to return home. The blood elves are primarily loyal to their own, and remained in Quel'Thalas, later forming an alliance with the Horde. Other high elves are exiles, having been banished from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; after the return of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The practice of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;draining arcane magic&lt;/a&gt; was considered immoral by these elves, who opposed its use. Unwilling to lead a nation divided, the newly-named regent of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, chose to exile the dissenters.\nKael'thas's teachings caused some moral contention between the two peoples. By embracing them, the blood elves prioritized their survival, health, and well-being; they believed this strength was needed to see Quel'Thalas restored, as the kingdom had remained a wasteland while the elves were weakened by their addiction. By refusing, the high elves prioritized their pride and personal ethics, even to their own detriment; they believe this was the moral choice. This schism, exacerbated by the faction war, would at times divide entire families, such as &lt;a href=\"Talithar%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Talithar Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Vyrin%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Vyrin Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;, with Talithar mentioning how he chose his well-being and Vyrin her integrity, although they still cared deeply for each other, with Talithar ending his life and destroying a Horde warship out of conflicted feelings for Vyrin.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt; of Prince Kael'thas and the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar has taken steps to re-establish cordial relations between the blood and high elves. However, these efforts have had mixed results. &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tae%27thelan%20Bloodwatcher\"&gt;Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher&lt;/a&gt; have also expressed an interest in mending relations between the children of Silvermoon, though to what extent appears to vary depending on the individual. The high elves, or at least Alleria's high elves, have been granted a representative at the Sunwell in the form of &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt;. While he does not consider himself a blood elf, he seems to have little quarrel with the sin'dorei, whom he calls the \"children of Silvermoon\".\nThe feud between high elves and blood elves is most visible in the conflict between the elven factions of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;. The tensions later reignited after the destruction of Theramore at the hands of a mana bomb created by the Sunreaver &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;, which cost the lives of the high elves that had settled in the port city, and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, Vereesa's husband. As such, the Silver Covenant aided the Kirin Tor and the Alliance in purging the Sunreavers from Dalaran, enforcing &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s orders.\nFel magic played no apparent role in the elves' splintering; in fact, its use was hidden from most of the \"blood\" elves. Glowing green eyes is the high elven body's natural reaction to spending time around fel magic, which was used in the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;' rebuilding efforts in lieu of the destroyed Sunwell's power. Like the orcs, any high elf who spends enough time around fel magic will acquire glowing green eyes.\nOther races.\nThe high elves have some history with the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom prefer to transform into elves when assuming a mortal form. It was the red dragons who gifted &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; to the high elves, as &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; personally handed it to &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;. Her consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; maintained an interest in the elves' affairs, arriving only narrowly too late to save the Sunwell from Arthas.\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nThe ancient origin of the high elves is a legacy of tragedy and conflict, a series of events that has profoundly affected the development of the quel'dorei. The high elves are a stark contrast to their nocturnal cousins, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; (or kaldorei). Forsaking the night, the high elves are the descendants of the very elves who served &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in the time of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The kaldorei regard the high elven penchant for using arcane magic as careless, akin to a foolish child playing with fire. The schism that separates the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; elves and the night elves is rather ancient, one so ancient that no amount of diplomacy or offerings of peace can soothe the scars of history. The high elves, however, have had generations separating them from the night elves, and no longer care for the past. Problems between the two races are usually clashes of personality, as neither tries overly hard to interact. The arrogance of the high elves led to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately to the downfall of the golden age of elven civilization. Through the reckless use of arcane magic, the high elves allowed darkness to seep into the world and corrupt &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They use the genetic phenomenon that modern elves face as a testament to their views.\nSome bands of high elven survivors fled south to the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and to the forests of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Those who stay one step ahead of the trolls survive; those who do not are dead (and probably eaten by the cannibalistic trolls). Scourge patrols, hunting the elven refugees, also stalk through the land.\nHistory.\nThe high elves only helped out on a small level in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. After the humans were defeated and fled north through &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves sent emissaries to meet with the high elves and humans to discuss the threat of the Horde.\nPopulation.\nNon-canonical sources state that the high elven population just a few years prior was approximately 24,810 and the &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elven&lt;/a&gt; population was approximately 9,550, not including Theramore, Dalaran, and several less significant cities. Stormwind (pop. 200,000) alone has the most, with a total of 20,000 high elves, and 8,000 half-elves.\nAppearance.\nHigh elves stand slightly taller than humans do. A high elf is usually a little over 6 feet in height and weighs between 100 to 175 pounds, depending on gender. The elves are slim, with sharp symmetrical features, often an exaggeration of perfect beauty. The high elves are uniformly fair in complexion, with white to flaxen-colored hair. Their eyes are incredibly intense in color, seeming to glow with an inner light. While many high elves have blue or green eyes, violet and red are not unheard of. The structure of high elven eyes (based on artwork) shows that they are generally like humans with a pupil and iris surrounded by \"white\" but tend to be able to see much farther than humans are capable. The &lt;a href=\"life%20span\"&gt;life span&lt;/a&gt; of high elves is several hundred years. They reach adulthood at 110 years, a \"venerable\" age at roughly 350 years, and most dying of old age at approximately 363 years. A few may reach \"venerable\" age at roughly 350 years with a maximum lifespan between 354 and 390 years, and even fewer may live as long as two thousand years. Most high elves (especially those of the Alliance) do not wear red or black for fear of being mistaken as blood elves. They have shorter ears and much smaller, lighter bodies than &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. As well, their ears usually point upwards whereas those of the night elves do not.\nBlood elves have glowing green eyes and their hair and skin are much paler or otherwise unnaturally colored, due to the absorption of fel energies during the period the Sunwell was lost. They are considered separate due to cultural differences more so than because of physical ones.\nCulture.\nThe destruction of the Sunwell has forced the high elves into decline, causing them to doubt the future of their once-proud race and drawing animosity toward them from other races who feel that the high elves have betrayed the Alliance. Most of the high elves have placed themselves under a self-imposed exile, ashamed of the damage that they have wrought upon the world of Lordaeron with their abuse of arcane magic.\nWhile humans still accept the high elves because of the aid that both races provided each other during the most recent attacks of the Burning Legion, reinforcing the same bond that they had in both the Troll Wars and the Second War, many of the other races will only deal with the high elves if absolutely necessary. This is especially true after the acts of Kael'thas Sunstrider. The night elves, in particular, do not care for the company of high elves (as they have personal memories of the war that spawned them) and in some cases can be openly hostile toward their sun-blessed brethren. The passing of time may heal these wounds, but the use of arcane magic will always draw a rift between these two breeds of elf.\nHigh elves in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; copy the humans' style of long-sleeved tunics, billowy trousers, and leather boots. Many High elves avoid wearing red clothing, as to dissociate themselves from &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. They have also set aside a day of mourning for high elves to remember the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with their human friends.\nSome high elves turned to the path of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; after their glorious home of Quel'Thalas was destroyed in the Third War. The new breed of warlock seeks to control the powers that ravaged their homeland and use them for vengeance.\nNames.\nThe past is a burden to the high elves, yet they maintain naming rituals that are millennia old. Many of the names of elven priests and heroes have become the names used for elves in modern times. The high elves share a connection with the sun that is quite prevalent in their choice of family names.\nFaith.\nHigh elves were once strong worshipers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, but this has died down as many have rejected it in favor of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;. Although after the invasion of the Scourge and the break off from the blood elves, many have looked to the Light, they do so loosely and are much less devout than &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. High elven &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s are common. The high elves have made significant contributions to this evolving religion, which originated from &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; cults. Even a few high elves have become paladins, without the help of magic like the blood elves. High elves have also developed advanced &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer ships&lt;/a&gt;, and used them in the Second War. High elves who embrace the path of religion take on the mantle of the Holy Light, sharing in the same faith as dwarves and humans. While this philosophy does not penetrate deeply into high elven society, those who do follow the path of the Holy Light are much more approachable than most.\nMagic.\nMagical addiction.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful drug to the high elves, and it can be a lure to a dark and perilous path. Yet too many wield it as if they were doing no harm, and few but the oldest and most sage can recall the true reasons why the use of such magic is a dangerous and potentially damning practice. Regardless of the risks, some high elves press onwards to revel in the euphoria and power that the use of magic brings them. The high elves are a tragic example of a race in decline. Their centuries of arcane practice have led them into an ever-tightening downward spiral. Now there are few true Quel'dorei left. Most have gone with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to become the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so have allied with the sworn enemies of elvenkind, the naga. Now the scant remaining Quel'dorei are typically those who have embraced the Light and seen past the powers of arcane magic and darkness. Distrusted by almost all of the races, the remaining high elves are pariahs in an age when there is little left for them but a life of mistrust and woe.\nAll high elves, regardless of class, status, or upbringing are addicted to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and all have some small proficiency in it. Unlike blood elves who succumb to it, high elves actively fight their addiction and are required to meditate for at least an hour every day to maintain personal control. The high elves are not proud of this addiction and take pains to keep it a secret. Their exposure to the night elves has caused them to develop a great interest in &lt;a href=\"moon%20well\"&gt;moon well&lt;/a&gt;s, which they seek to find an alternative solution to their addiction. Even the presence of a hidden moon well 50 feet away is enough to replenish their mystical energies and makes meditation unnecessary. Some have found a way to block the symptoms of withdrawal by the use of &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Ring\"&gt;Sunwell Ring&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRPG relations.\nHigh elves are often prejudiced towards &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, though this is starting to change as their presence is becoming more common.\nThe path by which &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; has chosen to lead the avenging blood elves is one the high elves view with utter disgust and resentment. They strive for a disassociation with the blood elves, such as by hiding their magical addictions and avoiding wearing black and red.\nIt would not quite be correct to say that the high elves rejoined the Alliance. To many high elves, they never left. Nevertheless, they are often aloof and distant from their allies. They keep to themselves and enjoy wandering forests alone or in small groups. They also maintain the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, an outpost in the Hinterlands that pursues their diplomatic interests and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Plaguelands near the gateway to the ruined &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe years of conflict between the night elves and the high elves number so many that they make the Alliance and Horde conflict look like children arguing over a toy. When the high elves lost their immortality, they eventually forgot their brethren as generations lived and died, creating legends of histories. The night elves remembered the damage the &lt;a href=\"highborne\"&gt;highborne&lt;/a&gt; brought to the world, and view their descendants as time bombs. When the high elves encountered the night elves, they realized the legends were true and began to resent the fact that the night elves had access to so much power that they refused to use \u2014 not to mention the whole matter of exile. Many plot to retake the magically imbued forests for themselves, regardless of the fact that both races belong to the Alliance. Auberdine was one of the few night elf settlements that would tolerate a high elf's presence.\n230 years before the First War, the dwarven race split into three factions. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt; desired to open up trade with the high elves, considered taboo at the time and would serve as one of the catalysts for their war. When it ended, the clan became close allies to the high elves. The two races were united through a mutual appreciation for nature and other cultural similarities. With the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; nearby the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Keep\"&gt;keep of Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, it can be assumed that the high elves have maintained their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;gryphon riding dwarves&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Wildhammer share the high elves respect for the wilds and nature, and carry a long history of good relations and trust.\nThe high elves of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; are perhaps the most isolated. Having left mostly before the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, they have formed a significant community in the city. They spend a great deal of time hunting the few &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Theramore's high elves also have another interest in the continent. They have discussed privately the creation of their own realm on Kalimdor. The northern forests, full of moonwells and lush greenery are most attractive, but their control by the night elves is overly frustrating. High elven expeditions, claiming to be tracking undead, often search for suitable sites. Their exposure to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; has caused them to develop a great interest in &lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s, which they seek to find an alternative solution to their addiction. Even the presence of a hidden Moonwell 50 feet away is enough to replenish their mystical energies and makes meditation unnecessary."}

{"id": "15073", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15073", "title": "Highborne", "text": "The Highborne (or quel'dorei, meaning \"children of noble birth\" in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;), were the upper class and a sect of the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt; composed of the favored servitors of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The Highborne were largely responsible for the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and most of those Highborne who had allied with the demons and survived the war were turned into &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Those that allied with the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; before the last battle of the war found themselves exiled from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually became the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough to this day there are surviving Highborne, they are not treated as nobility by modern night elf society, and in practical terms the caste ceased to exist over ten millennia ago. One notable exception are the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;, a holdout group against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the War of the Ancients. They were able to defend &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; (now known as &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;) but in doing so became isolated from the rest of night elven society throughout the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Vigil\"&gt;Long Vigil&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Shen'dralar under leadership of archmage &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; negotiated successfully to rejoin their kaldorei brethren in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, there is little physical difference between the Highborne and the rest of the kaldorei (save perhaps the Highborne being slightly pastier), but they consider themselves different enough.\nBackground and history.\nBefore the Sundering.\nThe Highborne were the upper classes of the ancient &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; civilization, at first a nameless caste made up of night elves who had unusual intelligence, strength, skills, or wealth and thus found favor with the ruling monarch. Their vast arrogance and greed, garish and multicolored clothing, and decadent habits did not endear them to other night elves. In fact, these powerful families became convinced that they were superior to the rest of their race, and so they began to call themselves the Highborne. As a member of the same caste, the queen &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; approved of the term and made it official. Plumbing the depths of the great &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; for knowledge they discovered primitive magic; and as time passed, they distanced themselves from the lower castes and began using their rank to selfishly guard their magical power, restricting access to the magical Well of Eternity to only themselves.\nThe access of arcane magic to the ruling caste began to split the kaldorei was hereditary; families that belonged to the highest caste frequently arranged marriages so as to maximize the magical ability of their offspring. This selective breeding, combined with frequent access to the Well of Eternity, resulted in night elves with progressively stronger magical abilities and a greater understanding of how to use those skills.\nA kaldorei without Highborne blood \u2014 such as &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 \"could\" master arcane power if he so wished (and had access to it). In fact, the mastering of the arcane arts was common among the populace, resulting in organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the official military sorcerers.\nAt some point, the Highborne fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Suramar%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Suramar Pass&lt;/a&gt; and lost.\nThe Highborne of the Kaldorei Empire maintained friendly relations with their &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; neighbors, who gifted them with an empty chest kept in their capital at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, which provided them with all the arcane magic their people would ever need, according to the pandaren, which was exactly nothing.\nWar of the Ancients.\nOver time, the ever-more reckless use of magic by the Highborne and their queen led to their slow corruption and addiction to the power it granted, and the ripples sent into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; attracted the dread forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The unlimited magical power offered by the demon lords seduced the queen and many of her servitors, and they agreed to grant the Legion entrance to Azeroth. Finally, giving themselves over to magic\u2019s inevitable corruption, the Highborne fell to darkness and began to worship the Dark Titan, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, as their god. Some, led by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, gave themselves wholly over to the service of the Legion and were transformed by fel magic into the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo cement their dark pact, the ecstatic Highborne opened a great, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity which would allow the armies of the Legion access to the world, followed by Sargeras himself. In the cataclysmic &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; that followed millions died as the demons swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor and laid siege to the lesser night elves\u2019 sleeping cities, leaving only ash and sorrow in their wake. Though the brave kaldorei warriors rallied from the heinous betrayal of their rulers and rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion\u2019s onslaught. The Legion was finally foiled by the efforts of the night elf &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who in his battle with Queen Azshara collapsed the Well of Eternity, killing many Highborne and condemning those who survived to the sea floor where they were transformed into the serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter the storm.\nYet many Highborne did not meet their fate at the bottom of the sea. Some had betrayed their queen at the last minute, having realized the horrors she would unleash upon the world. These defectors had fled the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the Well, and were thereby spared when the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; tore &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; apart. Others remained hidden away in far-flung strongholds such as &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThose who had joined with the rest of their shattered peoples fled the rising waters of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, eventually arriving at the base of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where they helped to rebuild the night elven civilization in the newly reshaped world. They were not entirely welcome: the night elves, now led by Malfurion, reviled Queen Azshara's former servants and were doubtful of their loyalty. Still, without the Well to supply their magic, the Highborne were considered little threat and were permitted to rejoin night elven society.\nHowever, many felt the pangs of their magical addiction and were tempted to use the power of a new Well of Eternity created by Illidan Stormrage, who from then on would be termed \"the Betrayer\" for his terrible crime. Though the use of arcane magic was forbidden on pain of death, the Highborne foolishly attempted to convince the kaldorei race of the power of magic by unleashing a magical storm upon &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Their desperate gambit failed, and the Highborne were exiled; the night elves mercifully refusing to execute any more of their brethren. This happened 7,300 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt; and around that time, the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; Highborne led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; began feeding on demonic energies.\nThe high elves of Quel'Thalas.\nThese exiled Highborne, now known as the high elves, took their punishment in stride, and led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; (\"He who walks the day\") set sail across the ocean in hopes of finding a new land to call their own. After a long and perilous journey, the Highborne arrived in the land known today as &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and there established their kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; (\"high kingdom\" or \"high home\") and crowned Dath'Remar their king. There, they slowly changed in form, diminishing in size and losing their original purple skin coloration. They abandoned the worship of the moon, adopting instead the sun, and became the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. From a vial of water from the original Well, they created a new one, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, to serve as their source of magic. They remembered the mistakes of the past and used &lt;a href=\"Runestones\"&gt;Runestones&lt;/a&gt; to shield their use of the arcane from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, taking care to practice the magic granted to them by their Sunwell with more care than their ancestors. Nevertheless, after their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and the source of their power \u2014 was destroyed by the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group of high elves embraced their Highborne ancestry and resumed for the third time their reckless use of magic. &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; renamed these people \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\", partly in reference to their Highborne lineage, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; with Illidan to find a way to fuel their magical addiction. Those who did not travel with him remained behind and began to rebuild their shattered capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nShandaral Highborne.\nAs Quel'Thalas flourished, other Highborne communities across the world struggled to survive. One such community dwelled in the city of &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt;, a repository of arcane relics and artifacts, which now found itself isolated in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the Great Sundering. For centuries these Highborne scoured the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;forest of Moonsong&lt;/a&gt; for a means to sustain themselves. During this time the Highborne would witness the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; using spells to crystallize living things and draw power from them. Recognizing it as means to end their suffering forever the Highborne attempted to interact with the dragons but were met with indifference or hostility. 6,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; a group of Highborne sorcerers infiltrated the lair of the dragonflight, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, and succeeding in learning the dragons' techniques. However, greed drove them to steal powerful relics stored within the Nexus and they thus triggered the wards in place and ensnared the dragon's ire. When the dragons confronted them in the forest the elves attempted to crystallize part of the area and draw magic from the crystals to fight the dragons off, but the spell was much more powerful than anticipated and transformed the entire region as well as twisting the elves' spirits.\nThe Highborne's descendants millennia later would continue to fight over the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Shandaral\"&gt;Ruins of Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; itself would make its new headquarters, with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; high elves of &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; clashing with the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; blood elves.\nShen'dralar and negotiations.\nSeveral ghosts of dead Highborne still populate many of the night elven ruins left after the Great Sundering in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Apparition\"&gt;Highborne Apparition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Lichling\"&gt;Highborne Lichling&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Highborne still exist in their original forms. One such group, known as the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;, live in secrecy within their city of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 known as &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; to outsiders. Those Highborne who live elsewhere in the world \u2014 such as &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tarsis%20Kir-Moldir\"&gt;Archmage Tarsis Kir-Moldir&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are few in number; the majority having long since become high elves, blood elves, naga, or satyrs.\nAlthough the two communities largely avoided each other, the other night elves of Kalimdor appeared to be somewhat aware of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;'s situation, with &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; members apparently monitoring the city shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Dath'Remar and his Highborne and the Shen'dralar seemed to have been at least vaguely aware of each other; &lt;a href=\"Verinias\"&gt;Verinias&lt;/a&gt; was aware that Dath'Remar and his followers left Kalimdor, and intended to join them after he believed the Shen'dralar fell to corruption. &lt;a href=\"Telmius%20Dreamseeker\"&gt;Telmius Dreamseeker&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas also managed to find and reach their ancient city in Feralas after Silvermoon was destroyed by the Scourge, only to be killed by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt;, who, unlike his fellow Highborne &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt;, openly objected to one of the high elves intruding upon his domain. The high elf priestess &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora Skycaller&lt;/a&gt; helped Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s reforge the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Crystal of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt;, and their blood elf kin in Silvermoon also occasionally sent groups to Highborne settlements in Kalimdor, such as &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Ruins of Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Year 25, Dire Maul was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the majority of the Shen'dralar elves were killed, forcing the survivors out of Dire Maul to the forests of Feralas.\nRecently, citing \"change on the wind\" the remaining Highborne have been drawn out of hiding, appearing in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; after sending representatives to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, to rejoin kaldorei society and the world at large, claiming that there will soon be a time when \"the kaldorei require the knowledge and skill\" the Highborne have to offer, despite the reservations of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Stillbough\"&gt;certain Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; who initially told Mordent that he and his kind were unwelcome at Teldrassil.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world%20event\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt; that heralded the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the major Alliance leaders gathered at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the recent changes to the world. Tyrande states that even in Darnassus the night elves have noticed the earth is at odds with something, and that perhaps these troubling events were \"what have brought forth the Highborne from Shen'dralar.\"\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the successful negotiations between &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; (likely aided by the research from &lt;a href=\"Daros%27%20Journal\"&gt;Daros' Journal&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; Highborne have rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and has started to train them back into the way of magic and arcane. The Highborne were given a green, secluded area next to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; to dwell in.\nMany of the Highborne have returned and are now residing within most of Alliance cities, mainly &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, and the neutral city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. This shows that the Highborne have been recently re-accepted back into the Alliance as many act as trainers for the Alliance, offering their services or giving out quests, though the Highborne refuse to teach non-night elven magi, stating: \"My apologies, mage, but the arcane secrets of the Highborne will forever remain secrets to you.\" The Highborne also state that, \"The &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of today pales in comparison to that of millennia past. Still, we Highborne know much of the arcane\", possibly implying their strength has waned over the ages.\nThe negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; have likewise been a success as there are Highborne showing up within Dalaran, and the Highborne have even begun to interact with the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, with Mordent Evenshade observed speaking with the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; mage and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; trainers &lt;a href=\"Myriam%20Spellwaker\"&gt;Myriam Spellwaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitus%20Darkwalker\"&gt;Vitus Darkwalker&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daros%20Moonlance\"&gt;Daros Moonlance&lt;/a&gt; can be seen conversing with Archaeology trainer &lt;a href=\"Hammon%20the%20Jaded\"&gt;Hammon the Jaded&lt;/a&gt;, and at the &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Craftsmen's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aladrel%20Whitespire\"&gt;Aladrel Whitespire&lt;/a&gt; is talking to &lt;a href=\"Taladan\"&gt;Taladan&lt;/a&gt;, the city's &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; trainer. It is also mentioned that the art of &lt;a href=\"arcane%20reforging\"&gt;arcane reforging&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the customizing of armor and weapons, was \"originally a magic brought to the citizens of Azeroth by the Highborne\", and is among the ancient spellcraft that have returned with the Highborne, though the Highborne themselves for some reason no longer provide such services, instead directing interested persons to the &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHowever, many night elves still regard the Highborne with wariness and suspicion, as can be evidenced from Sentinel dialogue when asked for &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Trainer\"&gt;Mage Trainer&lt;/a&gt; locations in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhyanda\"&gt;Rhyanda&lt;/a&gt; stating that many still held their order responsible for the actions of the forebears, and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; openly declaring that she would have been duty-bound to slay them had it not been for Tyrande's recent mercy. At least one night elven &lt;a href=\"priestess\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; and scholar, &lt;a href=\"Vestia%20Moonspear\"&gt;Vestia Moonspear&lt;/a&gt;, decided to study under the Highborne and become a mage, claiming the chance to learn from them was preferable to \"strict ignorance\" and in turn teaching other night elves what she learned at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Estulan\"&gt;Tower of Estulan&lt;/a&gt;, only to be alienated from many of her friends who could not understand her decision.\nDespite this, the Highborne have continued to provide considerable assistance since to the kaldorei, such as the Highborne mage &lt;a href=\"Estulan\"&gt;Estulan&lt;/a&gt; warning &lt;a href=\"Silvia\"&gt;Silvia&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to use the &lt;a href=\"Gordok\"&gt;Gordok&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the remnants of Eldre'Thalas within Dire Maul, and &lt;a href=\"Telaron%20Windflight\"&gt;Telaron Windflight&lt;/a&gt; in turn believing that taking &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; would help the night elves reclaim all of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; for their people. &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Amberwind\"&gt;Lorekeeper Amberwind&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Investigator\"&gt;apprentices&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for \"overseeing the Alliance investigation\" of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s ruins in an effort to uncover arcane knowledge amidst the remnants of the night elven empire's capital. &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Delaris\"&gt;Arcanist Delaris&lt;/a&gt; aids the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Circle\"&gt;Emerald Circle&lt;/a&gt; of southern &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; in battling the &lt;a href=\"Jadefire\"&gt;Jadefire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and cleansing the area of corruption, noting that the forest's demonic presence could be considered the fault of her kind but seeking to make amends. Further south in Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valdurian\"&gt;Arcanist Valdurian&lt;/a&gt; settles in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and helps to settle and bind enraged Highborne spirits lingering in the vicinity as well as to gather information for his personal uses before sending adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Fallowmere\"&gt;Lord Fallowmere&lt;/a&gt;, while his apparent student &lt;a href=\"Neophyte%20Starcrest\"&gt;Neophyte Starcrest&lt;/a&gt; requests the collection of ancient relics in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldre%27thar\"&gt;Ruins of Eldre'thar&lt;/a&gt;, a forgotten Highborne city, for study. Groups of night elf magi are also deployed to help stop the ongoing Horde advance in the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Battlescar%20Valley\"&gt;Battlescar Valley&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with limited success.\nBecause the expulsion of their Highborne ancestors from night elf society after the War of the Ancients was due to their use of arcane magic, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were outraged to hear that the kaldorei had welcomed the Highborne back and were tolerating the practice of arcane magic again. After witnessing the \"rookie\" mistakes made by the new kaldorei magi, however, the blood elves are anxiously awaiting whatever mess the kaldorei are going to put themselves in. What's more, some sin'dorei have been able to exploit the kaldorei's inexperience in order to rout Alliance forces, as seen in the \"&lt;a href=\"Amberwind%27s%20Journal%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Amberwind's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" quest series in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Andorel%20Sunsworn\"&gt;Andorel Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; finds the idea of night elves trying to reclaim their magical heritage \"amusing but for the terrible potential they should discover anything of value here\" and states that the night elves lost Azshara ten thousand years ago, also mocking the usage of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Construct\"&gt;arcane constructs&lt;/a&gt; by the kaldorei magi as \"delightfully inexperienced\" and \"amateur\" before hijacking them and noting that his people, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;Highborne of the Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, had outlawed them 1,500 years ago.\nEfforts by the &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Lorekeeper\"&gt;Lorekeepers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt; to summon backup from Darnassus are likewise sabotaged by Sunsworn, who derided their use of \"laughably primitive magics\" and compromised the kaldorei's summoning stone to instead teleport \"a crack team of commandos\" behind Alliance lines. Despite the apparent inexperience of at least the new kaldorei magi, however, reactions from other blood elves in Azshara are more ambiguous, with &lt;a href=\"Malynea%20Skyreaver\"&gt;Malynea Skyreaver&lt;/a&gt; scorning the idea that the night elves could achieve any competence in scouting out magical sites and experimenting with the arcane arts, but nevertheless expressing some degree of concern at the Highborne's unexpected return, and elsewhere praising the Highborne magi who defended &lt;a href=\"Mennar%20Academy\"&gt;Mennar Academy&lt;/a&gt; as \"heroes\" whose selfless actions might have saved their entire world.\n&lt;a href=\"Levia%20Dreamwaker\"&gt;Levia Dreamwaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elendri%20Goldenbrow\"&gt;Elendri Goldenbrow&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf and blood elf respectively, both attempt to reclaim some of their long-lost ancient history in the former Highborne royal city of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, by seeking out \"objects of significance\", and noting that so much of their history was lost during the Sundering.\nWolfheart.\nIn the forest near &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; forcibly intercedes and stops a group of twenty assembled Highborne mages who, without the knowledge or consent of Mordent Evenshade, are attempting to perform a collective spell to test their powers, asserting that such actions went against everything they had agreed upon, despite &lt;a href=\"Var%27dyn%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Var'dyn Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;'s arguing that the Highborne's powers would \"stagnate\" if not used in a sufficient manner and that Malfurion himself had promised that the Highborne would rejoin night elf society while maintaining their own identities, yet instead they were ostracized still. Malfurion responds that there is every intention of their rejoining the kaldorei, but Var'dyn's teacher Mordent understood that such things could not occur overnight and would play out over time, and tells Var'dyn to have patience.\nWhen a murdered Highborne, &lt;a href=\"Thera%27brin\"&gt;Thera'brin&lt;/a&gt;, is discovered on the outskirts of Darnassus, Malfurion and Tyrande move to stop further bloodshed and unrest by appointing one of the night elves' most cunning and skilled agents to find the killer: the renowned warden &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. According to Mordent Evenshade, due to the profound changes Azeroth had gone through, what the Highborne did over the millennia no longer applied, and they rejoined the night elves in desperation due to their faltering ranks failing to replenish and their severe lack of children being born over the last generation. While many of the Highborne seem to retain an air of superiority and some sense of arrogance, viewing most of the non-magi night elven population with contempt (though even Var'dyn respected those wielding immense power, such as Malfurion and Tyrande, even while barely acknowledging &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; after seeing him in Darnassus), Archmage &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; refuses to betray Malfurion and Tyrande and vows to honor his word even as the Archdruid and High Priestess honored theirs.\nHowever, as their casualties mysteriously mount, Mordent Evenshade and the remaining Highborne are captured and entrapped by Maiev, who reveal that it was she who had been assassinating their kin; when Var'dyn attempts to use his potent Highborne magic against the Watcher, he is quickly killed by Maiev's bonds. Maiev believed that Darnassus had betrayed her, and deemed Malfurion guilty of the same arrogance that consumed his twin, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, by believing that he knew what was best for the night elf people. In addition, she felt Malfurion had condemned their people by not having &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; properly blessed, thus denying them their immortality, and further despised him for forgiving the Highborne and bringing their \"evil\" back into night elf society.\nWith the aid and sacrifice of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eadrik\"&gt;Eadrik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev's brother, while trying to uncover the truth of what was truly transpiring, manages to survive Maiev's assassins, and after locating and freeing Malfurion, the two confront her and her Watchers, with Maiev fleeing from the scene after an intense struggle between the siblings and Malfurion eventually releasing Mordent and the other surviving Highborne.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Highborne magi apparently opened a portal directly to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; managed to persuade &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to sanction a mission to the ancient land in an attempt to recover their immortality. A &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20Mage\"&gt;Darnassus Mage&lt;/a&gt; briefly appeared in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; to teleport the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; to Darnassus. With the night elves keeping the Bell in Darnassus for safekeeping and study, several Highborne mages later &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; themselves to &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, asking for reinforcements from the Alliance and reporting a stealth attack on the night elven capital. &lt;a href=\"Thaumaturge%20Moonspire\"&gt;Thaumaturge Moonspire&lt;/a&gt; was a night elf mage of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; who fought Horde adventurers at &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Magister%20Xintar\"&gt;Magister Xintar&lt;/a&gt;, a mage specializing in portal magic, accompanied &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter throughout &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; as they sought something which they believed might restore the kaldorei's immortality, only to have his powers sundered by a &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; trap, and later decides to visit the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; as well as joining other night elves in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSeveral kaldorei magi appear as recruitable Garrison followers in Lunarfall, including &lt;a href=\"Nordaerin%20Silverbeam\"&gt;Nordaerin Silverbeam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danaeris%20Amberstar\"&gt;Danaeris Amberstar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mysandra%20Swiftarc\"&gt;Mysandra Swiftarc&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the night elf magi known as &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Magus\"&gt;Kirin Tor Magus&lt;/a&gt; work as Alliance portal-keepers at &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; and other settlements on Draenor.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, some of its members being the Highborne.\nWhile the Shen'dralar as a whole did not seem to actively participate in the Broken Isles despite its ties to their ancient civilization, at least one of them, &lt;a href=\"Tarelvir\"&gt;Tarelvir&lt;/a&gt;, left Darnassus to join the reformed &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; alongside the greatest magi of all of Azeroth's different races, and the group seemed to have maintained their ties with the Kirin Tor. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aranhir%20Starsinger\"&gt;Archmage Aranhir Starsinger&lt;/a&gt;, although away on Kirin Tor business, has apparently become the owner of the &lt;a href=\"Simply%20Enchanting\"&gt;Simply Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; shop in Dalaran, and is a friend of the high elf &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%20Nalthanis\"&gt;Enchanter Nalthanis&lt;/a&gt;.\nA female night elf, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Nielthende\"&gt;Archmage Nielthende&lt;/a&gt;, affiliated with the Kirin Tor, expressed interest in &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley energy&lt;/a&gt; strewn throughout the region and asked adventurers from either faction to hop on a &lt;a href=\"mana%20saber\"&gt;mana saber&lt;/a&gt; to absorb any lingering energy present, while two other night elf magi, &lt;a href=\"Kallistia%20Starlance\"&gt;Kallistia Starlance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olothil%20Starlance\"&gt;Olothil Starlance&lt;/a&gt;, went to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; from Dalaran in a reconnaissance mission seeking the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of their long-deceased parents after being separated from them since the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf mage &lt;a href=\"Elandris%20Bladesong\"&gt;Elandris Bladesong&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=\"Bladesong%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Bladesong's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkful\"&gt;Darkful&lt;/a&gt; was part of a group of adventurers found in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, there was a time &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s people, presumably the Highborne night elves, had the potential to rival the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nElegy.\nTarelvir seemed to have returned to Darnassus after the defeat of the Burning Legion, rejoining &lt;a href=\"Dyrhara\"&gt;Dyrhara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maelir\"&gt;Maelir&lt;/a&gt; next to the Temple of the Moon, where the three warmly greeted the dwarven guests of Darnassus and where Dyrhara transported the three surviving members of the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; expedition to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; with messages from Malfurion to Tyrande and Anduin. It is mentioned that the Highborne's presence in night elven society has allowed the kaldorei to expedite travel for small groups, sparing them lengthy sea voyages, as well as quickly conveying information to allies in potential times of war.\nAfter learning of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s command, Malfurion authorized some of the Highborne magi, including &lt;a href=\"Sarvonis\"&gt;Sarvonis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ralara\"&gt;Ralara&lt;/a&gt;, to assist Commander &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; in fending off the assault. The Highborne were immediately met with unexpected cheers from their brethren, and they quickly transported more reinforcements, in the form of a dozen druids, to their aid as well. The Highborne magi on Delaryn's command burned all the bridges over the &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to slow the enemy advance, and were said to have helped immeasurably in the early stages, destroying many of the Horde siege engines. They were then targeted and killed by Sylvanas and her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, preventing them from helping the night elf defenders melt the frozen river later in the conflict. A single &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20Mage%20%28War%20of%20the%20Thorns%29\"&gt;Darnassian mage&lt;/a&gt; was later seen accompanying Delaryn in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vale\"&gt;Twilight Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside the Temple, around the same time, Maelir helped transport &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; from Stormwind to Darnassus, telling the Gilnean queen that it was his honor to assist with the evacuation of her remaining people from the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;, which was successfully completed within several hours. The Highborne and Stormwind's magi managed to evacuate hundreds of worgen and night elven civilians from the capital as the war overtook all of Ashenvale and reached &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, despite being unable to transport many more in time. As Teldrassil was being &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; by the Horde, Tarelvir and &lt;a href=\"Aladrel%20Whitespire\"&gt;Aladrel Whitespire&lt;/a&gt; could be seen caught in the chaos of the devastation, but could be saved by adventurers, while Maelir and Dyrhara were seen together maintaining one of the last portals to Stormwind moments before the World Tree's destruction, through which &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; emerged to rescue his wife and an orphaned kaldorei baby. While many of the Highborne were presumably killed on Teldrassil, several night elf magi later joined the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for the Horde's attack.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; both took an interest in the &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt; and fought against each other there, with the Alliance ranks including &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt;. Some time around the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, with several kaldorei vessels out of commission and undergoing repairs, the Moontear family of kaldorei magi offer their services helping Alliance players reach the major cities, with &lt;a href=\"Perrin%20Moontear\"&gt;Perrin Moontear&lt;/a&gt; portaling adventurers to Darkshore, and &lt;a href=\"Niana%20Moontear\"&gt;Niana Moontear&lt;/a&gt; transporting players to Stormwind.\nIn Darkshore, Horde agents on the orders of Sylvanas attempted to raise several of the fallen night elf magi, including Sarvonis and Ralara, as well as defeating &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Golras\"&gt;Lieutenant Golras&lt;/a&gt;. Mordent Evenshade later joined the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, helping Maiev by opening up a flight path network in the battlefield, and teleporting away from the area after his &lt;a href=\"Leyfeather%20Hippogryph\"&gt;Leyfeather Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the Horde.\nVarious night elf magi are seen actively contributing to the Alliance war effort in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Squallshaper%20Auran\"&gt;Squallshaper Auran&lt;/a&gt; in Boralus and &lt;a href=\"Valrisa%20Windcoil\"&gt;Valrisa Windcoil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, as well as part of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Arcanist\"&gt;7th Legion Arcanists&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; throughout Kul Tiras and Zandalar. Some of the &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Mage\"&gt;Nar'thalas magi&lt;/a&gt; also appear in Stormwind, apparently affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance, opening a permanent portal to the &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Palace\"&gt;Crumbled Palace&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Wrathion's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne lost most of the ancient knowledge they accumulated over millennia in their library when they were forced to flee &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; after the Horde's attack, though what little remained was nevertheless useful for his own extensive research against the Void.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Magus\"&gt;Highborne ghosts&lt;/a&gt; were encountered in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, apparently bound there by the power of Queen Azshara.\nAfter the Fourth War, &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Mykos\"&gt;Lorekeeper Mykos&lt;/a&gt; removed the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt; seal from the book &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20and%20How%20to%20Swing%20It\"&gt;The Light and How to Swing It&lt;/a&gt; and gave it to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, so that all their paladins could read it. A kaldorei mage at &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; later provided a portal for Tyrande Whisperwind to quickly travel from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightborne.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; are the Highborne elves who splintered off from the reign of Queen Azshara during the War of the Ancients, and eventually from the rest of the world as well by erecting a dome around &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne of Suramar were transformed into the nightborne by the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. They rejoined the world during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; joined the demons and closed the dome. This association resulted in a &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that ended the reign of Elisande and the shaldorei's ties to the Legion, liberating Suramar once again.\nThe nightborne, led by &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, who chafed at Tyrande's mistrust and suspicion towards her long-secluded people despite their shared ancestry and further disillusioned at the Alliance's perceived seclusion and stagnation, joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, which their people later joined, some of the nightborne magi still refer to themselves as having Highborne heritage."}

Archmage Vargoth's Retreat is high atop a spire in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be entered save by the reward from this achievement.\nTips and strategies.\nIf you're actively farming for this achievement, consider teaming up with other players, or creating a public channel where you can share locations. Some common channels used for this goal are:\nSimply type /join bookclub (one word) to join such a channel. Be sure to set the channel color to something that's very noticeable or you may miss it when there's a book spotted! Since the books have a 3-4 hour spawn time, you should be able to get frequent updates on real or dud books with more players using the channel. If you see others in General or Trade asking about the books, invite them to join this channel.\nAs a courtesy to others in the bookclub channel, make an announcement if you spot a book, whether real or fake. Real ones will allow others to come to your location, while fake ones will help them update their timers. Make sure to give the location, as well as whether the book is real or not (for example, \"Violet Gate REAL book now up!\" or \"Violet Gate fake book spawned 11:00am server time\"). Optionally, make an announcement for real books in the General channel (such as \"School of Arcane Magic book in Violet Gate portal room up NOW for the next couple of minutes\").\nConsider installing this add-on:\nOn completion.\nWhen you complete this achievement, you will immediately receive the following mail from &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. It will have &lt;a href=\"The%20Schools%20of%20Arcane%20Magic%20-%20Mastery\"&gt;The Schools of Arcane Magic - Mastery&lt;/a&gt; attached."}

Each group believed that its way of manipulating the world was superior. Mages have history on their side, with 10,000 or more years of practice, and clear proof of their power (both good and evil). Tinkers have the arrogance of the new kid on the block, showing how they can give the common man the power to fly through the skies or go under the sea, while previously only stuck-up mages were able to do those things.\nNot surprisingly, few enterprising &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s pick up a wrench and see what they can do with it. The time, energy, and money it takes to make wondrous items compounded with the time, energy and money it takes to make technological items makes imbuing technological items with magic highly impractical. Some do it, of course, and are considered eccentric and spendthrifts.\nThe techno mages rose as an answer to this problem. Instead of treating their inventions as mere items, they tended to view the objects as extensions of themselves, using their will to enhance the item temporarily. As they commonly do this in battle, some consider them valuable &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Others consider them insane. Views of the techno mages are mixed, as tinkers and mages see the class as a perversion of the purity of their own respective paths. Yet no one can deny the power these people wield.\nTechno mages are wild-eyed folk, always looking for a shortcut to get what they want. Techno mages are solitary by design (though some gather together at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Arcane%20Contraption\"&gt;House of the Arcane Contraption&lt;/a&gt;), as there are few of them and many are put off by their odd pursuit of both technology and magic. They are, however, mind-hungry and have a keen interest to talk to mages or tinkers to see if they can learn new things. And if the tinker or mage is then interested in following the path of the techno mage, even better! They are used to derision, but often too caught up in their latest invention to really care. The life of the techno mage is not for the weak. Most techno mages come from a background of the mage path, although some &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s have joined the ranks.\nThe techno mage has little patience when it comes to battle. They will go in, hit the enemy with all they have, and have it done with. The techno mage knows how to connect with their technological weapons, channeling their magic through them. Their gun does not shoot bullets, but fireballs or dire rats. The techno mage can, by touch, place any spell they have prepared into a technological weapon. The weapon\u2019s next attack does not consume ammunition or fuel (if applicable). Instead, the weapon attacks with the spell. Note that characters firing (or otherwise employing) a weapon so enhanced do not need to target creatures; one could fire a long rifle containing a frost nova at a spot on the ground, for instance. Wherever the weapon strikes, the spell occurs. If the attack misses, depending on the spell involved, the attack might be wasted or the spell effect might scatter, as a splash weapon. If the techno mage uses this ability on a melee weapon, the weapon can deliver the spell with a physical attack. Note that this ability is not necessarily aggressive. It can cure serious wounds and teleport just as easily as starfall.\nIf a techno mage has made it this far, they has likely endured many mishaps, both technological and magical. The result of these trials is that they are more likely to be able to withstand damage from some form of energy.\nAs the techno mage becomes more and more in tune with their inventions, they can feel them as if they were sentient beings. They can almost communicate with them, telling ammunition and even grenades where to go. When a device breaks, usually from a malfunction, most consider it lost forever, or, at least until a skilled tinker has a good, long, expensive look at it. The techno mage can touch a device and coax it into one last use, putting some of their energy into it to keep it together. A skilled techno mage can truly feel the machines they touch. They can put their consciousness into a machine, &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; or suit of &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt; and command it to move as if they were inside it. They control the device completely. They are often able to force a device to do things of which it is otherwise incapable, since their mind controls it directly. While controlling a device in this manner, the techno mage\u2019s body is in a trance-like state, and they are unaware of their surroundings."}

{"id": "127763", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127763", "title": "Technology", "text": "The term technology in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;, as in reality, is used to refer to modern or less traditional inventions, thus excluding older achievements such as architectural engineering or metalworking.\nTechnology can most commonly be observed as machines and devices created by the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, however, the different &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had less interactions with each other until a few decades ago, making it hard to tell whether a certain invention is only a few years or thousands of years old. Among their most common pieces of technology are &lt;a href=\"Gun\"&gt;firearms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steam%20tank\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; or oil-powered engines, &lt;a href=\"clockwork\"&gt;clockwork&lt;/a&gt; devices, &lt;a href=\"rocket\"&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, and the like.\nTrends in globalization in recent years probably benefited both the propagation of earlier technology and the invention of new devices, still their use is preferred mainly by the three peoples mentioned earlier. Other races such as the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; may avoid most contact with modern technology due to living in close relationship with nature, while others simply have no need of it thanks to their magical abilities, as was the case of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven more recently, contact with species alien to Azeroth and the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;ancient facilities&lt;/a&gt; in remote places of this planet revealed technologies far beyond even the capabilities of gnomes and goblins. Such are the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20ship\"&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt; capable of leaving a planet and travel across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; at unimaginable speeds), the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;machines&lt;/a&gt; that have created intelligent living beings out of stone and metal in ancient times or the use of &lt;a href=\"Arkonite\"&gt;crystals&lt;/a&gt; to gather &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy and power appliances.\nSupporters of modern technology remind us that, although historians would not always acknowledge it, the advances in science played no small role in winning the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. According to them, past &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;misdeeds&lt;/a&gt; of magic wielders outweigh the occasional accidents produced by new inventions.\nOver the years since the Third War, Azeroth saw various advances in technology. Not only the traditional goblin and gnomish technology expanded, but various other nations have had their advances. Notably, during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh and his &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; saw various new machineries and weapons that supported his units and the war due to the &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt;. After his defeat in his compound, the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh escaped to an alternate version of in the past and brought many new ideas to the orc clans that he united. With their new warfare methods and tools, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; was born. Over the years, various &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; facilities and wondrous technology on Azeroth were discovered and explored by explorers and adventurers.\nWith the re-emergence of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagon mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, new types of inventions were presented into the world and to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nWhat is technology? In simplest terms, it is science applied to practical use. Thus, by this definition, a simple can opener is a technological device. A more accurate description is that technology is the system by which an entire society provides for the wants and needs of its population. Technology tends to improve as the demand for it increases. A society might go decades or even centuries without a major advancement before some bright inventor comes up with something that alters the fundamental way things are done. For example, wagon wheels help move heavy loads from place to place, while wheels of stone grind meal into flour. Put notches in a wheel, connect them together, and you have gears that can drive even more complicated devices. All too frequently, war is the primary driver of technological advancements.\nTechnology is an art worth talking about! Historians may not always acknowledge the fact, but those who fought on the battlefield understand that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; could not have turned out as it did in the absence of technology. How were troops moved quickly across great distances? What blasted &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s alike from the skies? How were the enemy &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;s demolished? Technology relies upon ingenuity, know-how, craft, physical materials \u2014 and perhaps not a little disregard for one's safety. (Sudden explosions, unfortunately, are a hazard of the trade.) &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; messed up the world; technology will take it to grand, new heights."}

They see this new science as inherently destructive, and believe that left unchecked, technology will eventually lay waste to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The actions of certain groups, such as the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, are clear evidence of this. While some use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; or other means to halt the use of destructive technology, a chosen few use its own power against it. These techslayers study and learn what they can about technology, then use that knowledge to keep it in check.\nTechslayers are often misunderstood. They do not hate science, only science used for evil purposes. Techslayers are adept at the use of technology, but they use their abilities to build, nurture, and protect - and, of course, stamp out destructive tech wherever they find it.\nThe techslayer knows how to strike at constructs for maximum efficiency, to get around the defenses provided by armor, and to penetrate a construct\u2019s inherent defenses. A skilled techslayer understands technological devices so well that he can shut them down with a single well-placed blow, the device cannot be reactivated until this damage is repaired. A higly skilled techslayer has achieved the pinnacle of his abilities, and is adept at destroying technological devices and constructs of all sorts.\nTechslayers in the world.\nAll techslayers have first-hand experience with the destructive power of science. Perhaps they've seen a forest torn asunder by mechanical cutters, or been the victim of an avalanche caused by explosive mining techniques. Regardless of the reason, this event created a lasting impression - technology, like fire, must be properly harnessed lest it get out of control.\nTechslayers often come from backgrounds that take them close to nature. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, for example, sometimes take up the techslayer's path. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; employs far more techslayers than the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, primarily because technology has achieved a lower level of acceptance within the Horde's ranks.\nOne of the techslayer's primary motivations is to eliminate the chaos created by rampant, uncontrolled science."}

He builds energy, channeling Tectonic Upheaval whenever he reaches 100.

Shards of Tectus share Tectus' abilities but individually do less damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Tectus\"&gt;Mote of Tectus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen shattered, the remnants of each Shard of Tectus will form four Motes of Tectus. Motes of Tectus do not need to be shattered. Players are victorious over Tectus after they have killed all of the Motes of Tectus.\n&lt;a href=\"Night-Twisted%20Pale\"&gt;Night-Twisted Pale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Tectus is fully formed, Night-Twisted Pale will attempt to enter the fight, empowering Tectus and attacking players.\nStrategy.\nNormal / Heroic.\nOverview.\nThe Tectus encounter is broadly delineated into four pseudo-phases with difficulty peaking during the middle of the encounter. Tectus is an unconventional boss in that he does not die when his health reaches zero unless he is currently channeling Tectonic Upheaval. If he is not channeling Tectonic Upheaval when his health reaches zero, he will continue to fight until he begins Tectonic Upheaval and then will instantly die. When he dies, he will split into two Shards of Tectus, which each have the same set of abilities as Tectus himself but with less health and somewhat reduced damage. These shards, similarly, can only be killed during their own Tectonic Upheavals, and on death will split into four Motes of Tectus. Motes of Tectus can be killed outright at any time but otherwise have the same abilities as Tectus and the Shards of Tectus. As with the Shards, the Motes individually do less damage than the Shards or Tectus, but collectively can do far more damage than the original boss.\nPhase 1: The Living Mountain.\nDuring the initial phase of the encounter, Tectus is whole. Ranged DPS and healers will need to remain stacked as much as possible to control the placement of Earthen Pillar. When Tectus casts Earthen Pillar, all ranged DPS and healers should move in unison to a new stack point outside the radius of Earthen Pillar's effect. By convention, most raids move clockwise around the encounter area.\nPeriodically, Tectus will target a random ranged DPS or healer with Crystalline Barrage. Crystalline Barrage chases the targeted player with a red mist that deals considerable damage and must be avoided. The targeted player should run away from the group in the direction opposite from the way the raid is moving to manage Earthen Pillar. For example, if the raid is moving clockwise to manage Earthen Pillar, the player targeted by Crystalline Barrage should run counter-clockwise around the edge of the encounter area until the effect ends to leave the red mist safely out of the way of where the ranged group will need to stand next. Because this will likely take the targeted player out of the range of healing, the targeted player should be careful to use defensive cooldowns and self-healing abilities as needed.\nMelee DPS need to be careful to remain in range of healers while simultaneously shifting oppsite of the ranged group to ensure they are not hit by Crystalline Barrage.\nThere are no tank swaps in this encounter; during phase 1 one tank will hold and position the boss in the center of the encounter area while the other tank will pick up the adds that periodically appear on the edges of the encounter area. The adds spawn in completely random locations, making careful attention and targeting macros especially important. The Night-Twisted Earthwarpers must be faced away from both melee DPS and the other tank to avoid unnecessary damage. Gift of Earth can be interrupted with a stun effect, but if this is not possible should be intercepted by the add tank prior to reaching the boss. A damage reduction cooldown to reduce the damage of Gift of Earth is essential. Night-Twisted Berserkers will periodically drop all threat due to Raving Assault and may need to be taunted back by the add tank when they do so. All DPS should focus on cleaving the adds down while attacking the boss when there are adds up.\nTectus will also periodically use Fracture, which will do damage and interrupt casting of of any player that is hit by it, and all members of the raid should be careful to avoid this effect as much as possible.\nThe raid leader will assign a ranged DPS or healer as a mobile stack point, and all ranged DPS and healers should follow this person throughout the encounter except when they must leave the group to manage Crystalline Barrage. The significant raid damage of Tectonic Upheaval will likely require the use of a raid healing cooldown such &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; or a damage reduction cooldown such as &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20Aura\"&gt;Devotion Aura&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of Phase 1, Tectus will begin channeling Tectonic Upheaval. If DPS was sufficient, he will die immediately when he begins the channel, although he may also be defeated during the channel though the raid will sustain significant raid damage. If the raid does not defeat him during the first tectonic upheaval, the phase will begin again with Tectus at reduced health, but this is generally an indication that the raid does not have sufficient DPS to complete the encounter.\nPhase 2: Shards of the Mountain.\nAfter Phase 1 ends, the two Shards of Tectus will spawn. Other adds will no longer spawn and the tanks should each select a different Shard to tank. The tanks should remain stacked with the bosses to facillitate cleaving and ensure neither Shard gains much Accretion. One Shard should be designated the primary kill target and DPS should focus on that Shard while cleaving the other.\nPhase 2 is functionally very similar to Phase 1 except there are no new adds but all of Tectus's abilities will be multiplied. Both Shards will use Earthen Pillar, necessitating the ranged DPS/healer group move twice. Both Shards will use Crystalline Barrage, meaning that two ranged DPS or healers will need to kite the mist away from the group. Both Shards will use Fracture, meaning that all members of the raid will need to dodge these more frequently.\nBecause the speed the Shards gain energy is inversely proportional to their remaining health, one Shard will enter Tectonic Upheaval before the other. The first Shard to enter Tectonic Upheaval (which thus will be the primary kill target) should be defeated during its Tectonic Upheaval, which will spur the transition to phase 3.\nPhase 3: Motes of the Mountain.\nPhase 3 begins when the first Shard falls and spawns four Motes of Tectus. One tank will need to pick up all four motes while the other holds the remaining Shard. If this is too much for the Mote tank, the Shard tank can also tank one of the Motes and the Mote tank can tank the other three. It is absolutely imperative that the Motes die as quickly as possible because all of Tectus's abilities (Earthen Pillar, Fracture, Crystalline Barrage) will now be cast five times, making phase 3 extremely hectic due to constant moving and difficulty healing. It is important that &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; or similar abilities be used at this point to facilitate this. Due to the likelihood that there will be multiple Tectonic Upheavals both from the remaining Shard and the Motes during this period, healers should use take turns using raid cooldowns such as &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20Aura\"&gt;Devotion Aura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt; as needed.\nUnlike the Shards and Tectus himself, the Motes of Tectus may be killed outright and should be be brought down with AoE abilities. Tanks will need to be careful to use their defensive cooldowns whenever needed as poor placement of Earthen Pillars by errant DPS or healers result in line-of-sight issues preventing healing and the constant movement of the raid may create range issues as well. When the Motes have fallen, the raid can breathe a sigh of relief that the most difficult part of the encounter has passed and steadily finish off the remaining Shard, triggering phase 4.\nPhase 4: Even the Mountain Falls.\nPhase 4 is significantly easier than Phase 3 although it is more difficult than Phases 2 and 1. With the first wave of Motes defeated, only the four Motes from the second Shard remain, and these can be more easily defeated without the additional effects of the second shard. Once all four Motes are defeated, the encounter ends.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, she and her husband, &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt;, led the centaur to settle on the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Teera continued leading the centaur after Maruuk's death and famously forged a pact with &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The Maruuk consider her to be their most sacred ancestor, and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt; claim direct descent from her. Her weapon was the bow &lt;a href=\"%3ASarantuya%20the%20Ever-True\"&gt;:Sarantuya the Ever-True&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Teera's husband &lt;a href=\"Maruuk\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; earned a name for himself by slaughtering the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. He returned to his clan to heal his wounds, but the other clans, who feared Maruuk's strength, spread rumors that his injuries made him too weak to lead and sent assassins to kill him in his sleep. Teera defended her partner by taking up her bow, &lt;a href=\"Sarantuya%20the%20Ever-True\"&gt;Sarantuya&lt;/a&gt;, and killing both the assassins and the clan leaders who'd sent them the same night. At dawn, she exposed their treachery against Maruuk.\nHer actions were considered just, but she subsequently rejected the clans. She and Maruuk set out across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in search of a new home. Many centaur were inspired by their honor and followed them, forming a new clan. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; guided the centaur through the wind until, after months of wandering, they arrived in what is now the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. There, Ohn'ahra revealed herself and let the centaur know that this would be their new home. Upon seeing this, Maruuk was at peace and died from his wounds. The grief-stricken Teera took up leadership of the clan and named them \"&lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of their fallen hero.\nPact with the dragons.\nTeera led the centaur to solidify themselves as a strong force in the plains and protected them by killing any creature that threatened their villages. This soon led to a large-scale confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;. Teera knocked Merithra out of the sky with a powerful blow and battled her across the plains, reshaping the landscape in the process, but they were both evenly matched and neither could defeat the other. When they were both exhausted, hostile &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s took the opportunity to attack. Teera and Merithra realized that both of their peoples would be doomed if they continued to fight, so they allied against their common enemy and destroyed them. Teera and Merithra's friendship ended the enmity between dragons and centaur and proved that it would only be beneficial if they laid down arms against each other. They met upon the hill of &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; and made a pact of respect: the green flight and the Maruuk promised to stay out of each other's way but come to the aid of the other when their livelihoods were threatened. The &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt; was created to serve as a symbol of their oath. Some claim that Teera herself built the Horn, while the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Deritetsin%20the%20Carver\"&gt;Deritetsin the Carver&lt;/a&gt; claims that it was he who built it.\nLegacy.\nUpon her death, Teera was buried with her bow next to Maruuk in the largest of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Kurgans\"&gt;Eternal Kurgans&lt;/a&gt;. The Maruuk faltered when Teera died, but her first daughter, &lt;a href=\"Tsegzaya\"&gt;Tsegzaya&lt;/a&gt;, stepped up to lead them. &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt; claim unbroken descent from the matriarch and are sometimes called the \"daughters and sons of Teera\". The clan's &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra\"&gt;Khanam Matra&lt;/a&gt;s can all trace their bloodlines back to Teera. When a Khanam Matra dies, a successor is chosen from her daughters and granddaughters, ensuring the continuation of the bloodline and of Teera's legacy.\nMillennia after Teera's death, the centaur and the green dragons\u2014fresh from their victory over the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;\u2014renewed the oath that had been made between Teera and Merithra. &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; offered drops of her own blood, proof of her direct descent from the matriarch, as a ceremonial gift. Merithra commented that she still remembered Teera well and that Sarest was very much like her.\nAround the same time, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ukhel\"&gt;Clan Ukhel&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Eternal Kurgans, and &lt;a href=\"Tombcaller%20Arban\"&gt;Tombcaller Arban&lt;/a&gt; exhumed Teera and Maruuk's weapons from their graves so that their spirits could be raised into undeath. During the &lt;a href=\"Nokhud%20Offensive\"&gt;Nokhud Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Monkh\"&gt;Gravelord Monkh&lt;/a&gt; summoned the two ancestors and tried to take control of them to make them fight on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt failed, as Teera and Maruuk reacted with rage at the sight of necromancy in their sacred ground and killed Monkh. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s then defeated the two centaur's spirits, returning them to their rest. The heroes retrieved their weapons, &lt;a href=\"Sarantuya%20the%20Ever-True\"&gt;Sarantuya&lt;/a&gt; and Maruuk's spear &lt;a href=\"Batubar%20the%20Relentless\"&gt;Batubar&lt;/a&gt;, and laid them to rest in the kurgan in &lt;a href=\"Teerakai\"&gt;Teerakai&lt;/a&gt;, where they could be protected more easily. Teera's spirit briefly appeared, commented that she was pleased to see Clan Teerai still thriving, and thanked the heroes for saving her from having to fight against her own people."}

If it was Anasterian's, it could have been obtained when &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge\"&gt;The Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; to get to &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunwell\"&gt;The Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;; Anasterian was killed during this war. However, the &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; population of Silvermoon was considered &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elf&lt;/a&gt; at the time, so Anasterian could never be the Blood King. More likely, this dagger belonged to Kael'thas, who decreed himself and his subjects &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in memorial to those that fell to the Scourge. Before he became The Lich King, Arthas was a rival with Kael'thas for &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and the armies of the two clashed in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as Arthas went to &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;; Arthas probably would have obtained the dagger then. This, however, raises issues of its own, as Kael'thas &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider%23Crowned.3F\"&gt;may never have been crowned officially&lt;/a&gt;."}
