With the deaths of Shadra and Yazma, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; assumed that they had been disbanded, unaware that in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt; had rallied them to her cause. &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Those&lt;/a&gt; who were exiled from the Zandalari due to being sympathetic to Yazma's coup with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; were warmly welcomed into the organization.\nThey attempted to assassinate Talanji with poison during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting but were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, and the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;. After Talanji returned to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, another assassination attempt was made by one of their war parties in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Heart of the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. After being overwhelmed by Talanji, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; Zekhan, Bwonsamdi, &lt;a href=\"Mah%27ral\"&gt;Mah'ral&lt;/a&gt;, and royal guards, they impaled themselves on their enemies blades to prevent capture and interrogation. Upon receiving word of this second assassination attempt, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid Talanji, joining the fight against the Widow's Bite.\nThe Widow's Bite also took to using propaganda to turn the public against Talanji, and killed those who remained loyal to the Queen like &lt;a href=\"Seshi\"&gt;Seshi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bezime\"&gt;Bezime&lt;/a&gt;.\nApari and her followers agreed to aid &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; on their mission to kill the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, Bwonsamdi. In order to weaken the protections around Bwonsamdi's shrines, Nathanos was forced to hand over something precious and irreplaceable to the witch. Thus, after a moment, he handed his officer's badge given to him by Sylvanas when they were among the living and warned Apari that if she failed to destroy the loa's shrines as promised, then the consequences would be severe.\nWidow's Bite agents within Dazar'alor openly attacked &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; when they arrived in the city to inform Talanji that they &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; about the Widow's Bite alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;. They, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Rastari\"&gt;Rastari&lt;/a&gt; and Rokhan, were able to deal with the attackers and revealed to Talanji the connection between their enemies.\nThe Widow's Bite and the Banshee loyalists fought side by side and clashed with the Zandalari Empire in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, where they were discovered attempting to sacrifice children in order to weaken one of Bwonsamdi's shrines. Thanks to the courage of Zekhan, the children were saved, and due to their smaller amount of numbers, the Widow's Bite and their ally fell back. In light of their alliance, Sira revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lelyias\"&gt;Lelyias&lt;/a&gt; was a skilled healer who could help Apari with her leg injuries, however, she refused. This vexed Sira who noted that the Widow's Bite were loyal to Apari, that they would fall apart without her leaving the loyalists with no reinforcements, and more importantly, to Sira, was they needed the witch to survive until the loa Bwonsamdi was killed.\nAfter successfully weakening several of his shrines, Nathanos and Apari gave the order for their forces to strike at the loa's &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the battle against the loa, &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, the Widow's Bite lieutenant, outraged and disgusted with Apari's actions in harming children, had decided to defect to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately aiding them by revealing the traps Nathanos had set up. With the traps disabled, the Horde was in full force for the subsequent conflict that killed Apari. As Sira predicted, the death of their leader caused the Widow's Bite to fall apart. Many of the survivors fled the battlefield by jumping into the marsh and sea, unaware that &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; were prepared to deal with this possibility of retreat. Following this collapse, Sira was captured and taken prisoner, and while Nathanos successfully escaped, he was filled with the knowledge that they had failed with Bwonsamdi's survival.\nWith Apari's death and Tayo's defection, the organization seems to have disbanded with no central leader to guide them."}

Unwholesome rites, sigils, and the shedding of one's mortal shell are all a small part of what graven ones seek. Eventually, they become masters over undeath. The graven ones' necromantic abilities make them natural allies of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, though many are &lt;a href=\"Independent\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;. The graven one must show that they have an affinity for death by spending at least one night buried in a graveyard during a new moon. The graven one concentrates on the creation, control, and conjuration of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Unlike a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, who preys upon the living for life energy, the graven one seeks to create undead in a perfect state to serve them as faithful and undying servants. \nA bone scythe is created when a person first becomes a graven one, this weapon is an extension of the graven one's connection with death. As the graven one gains power, their power manifests through the weapon as well. The graven one can summon the bone scythe into their hand. Only the graven one or their awakened minion can wield the weapon. The graven one gains the ability to awaken a minion from the bones of a dead &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. They must steal the bones from the actual grave of a buried &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;. The creation is a loyal &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20warrior\"&gt;skeletal warrior&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20mage\"&gt;skeletal mage&lt;/a&gt; that follows the graven one's verbal commands. The undead creation shares in the power of its master and becomes more powerful as the graven one advances in ability. The graven one can have only one minion at any time. If the minion is destroyed, the graven one can build another of the same or lower level of power. The graven one can summon a full set of plate armor made from interlocking bone and shadow. This suit provides them with all the benefits of a suit of full plate without any of the disadvantages. A highly skilled graven one becomes one of the undead. They no longer age or need to sleep (though they must spend time meditating to regain spells)."}

One way is as part of the usual &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; color system for items (gray, white, green, blue, purple, orange, red) or difficulty for mobs (gray, green, yellow, orange, red) and tradeskill recipes (gray, green, yellow, orange).\nGray Items.\nGray items are often referred to as &lt;a href=\"Vendor%20Trash\"&gt;Vendor Trash&lt;/a&gt;. These are items that generally have no good use compared to other items you could get that are of higher quality.\nGray items, despite their uselessness, can sometimes sell for a good amount to a vendor.\nSome gray items have also recently been given uses at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; for ticket turn-ins (these items have since been upgraded to &lt;a href=\"white\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; status in recognition of their enhanced role).\nGray Mobs.\nGray mobs are of a level much lower than yours. These mobs do not give experience. Once a mob is grey to you, it is normally quite easy to kill. There are some exceptions though.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s cannot gain &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s from Gray mobs.\nAlso, if, when the mob in question is targeted, and the plate at the top of the screen indicates its name with a yellow name on a gray background, it might be said to be gray. This means that someone else will be credited when that mob is killed.\nGray Levels (PvP).\nIn PvP, when someone's level is gray to you, you cannot gain any &lt;a href=\"Honor\"&gt;Honor&lt;/a&gt; points from them. So, in other words, it is not worth your time to kill them.\nGray Recipes.\nIn your &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; window, a recipe shown in gray will never give you a &lt;a href=\"skillup\"&gt;skillup&lt;/a&gt; when used. These recipes are considered \"easy\".\nGray Nodes.\nFor gathering-type professions (&lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, also rogue &lt;a href=\"lockpicking\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt;), a gray node (skinnable corpse, etc.) will not give you a skillup when used.\nGray Quests.\nIn your &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; window, a quest shown in gray is intended to be completed at a much lower level than your current level. You will receive little, if any, experience for completing gray quests."}

He was the father of High General &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, and once, a paladin and general of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAbbendis was originally one of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Abbendis was serving at Alexandros' side during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; at Blackrock Mountain.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a faction had started growing in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, largely led by Abbendis. This faction was intolerant of what they deemed as the \"lesser races\".\nDuring the war itself, Abbendis learned about the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;. He helped rally the remnants of the Silver Hand to try and retake &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, sealing an alliance with the human communities of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately founding the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. During a Scourge assault on &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, however, Abbendis was mortally wounded by the undead while saving his daughter &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt; and died in her arms. Brigitte eventually took his former rank of High General.\nIn the RPG.\nHe was a tall man in his 40s, dark of skin with wild, white hair. His madness was evident in his face, but his followers merely saw it as utmost dedication to his cause.\nThird War.\nHigh General Abbendis and his youthful charges were in the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Capital City of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, when it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the Third War. Priests and paladins fought as the Scourge attacked the city, but Abbendis fled with &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt; as Lordaeron fell around them. It is believed, that the wounds both men received in battle, or perhaps just the shock of seeing their whole purpose destroyed, turned them mad; since that day both Abbendis and Isillien have been quite insane.\nAbbendis and Isillien wandered the area as the Scourge defiled the land, destroying what &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; they could, gathering what warriors would join them. They had but one concern: eradication of all that had destroyed Lordaeron. They were joined by young &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, one of Isillien\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, who adored his tutor and his general. He offered his family\u2019s keep and land, untouched by the undead, for their base of operations. The elder Abbendis and Isillien felt that although they had a good base, they really needed to attack the Scourge where they were the thickest: in the Eastern Plaguelands. Isillien took on the title of Grand Inquisitor, while the elder Abbendis led the majority of the forces to Tyr's Hand in the east to strike at Stratholme. As they established their bases and took in many more warriors, they destroyed any undead they found.\nFormation of the Scarlet Crusade.\nTogether, the elder Abbendis and his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt; founded the Scarlet Crusade to fight back against the undead they saw as having corrupted Arthas and destroyed their order.\nAbbendis was the official head of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. He considered himself the arm of the Crusade while Isillien was the heart. Abbendis guided the military attacks of the Crusade from Tyr\u2019s Hand in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, communicating frequently with Isillien, who guides the priests in the Crusade in their new roles as inquisitors, based in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbbendis acted as the leader of the warriors and guided the eradication of undead in the Eastern Plaguelands. Abbendis, like most of the Crusaders, was driven insane by the intense fighting. He believed that the Light has blessed him so that he could retake &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and rout the Scourge. No one really knows what happened to the High General to make his hatred of the undead so virulent. Some (very quietly) speculate that he and the Grand Inquisitor were captured and tortured by the Scourge, but no stories have ever been verified. Asking the High General exactly why he hates the undead brands the inquirer as maddened by the plague. He is of the opinion that one must hate the undead and remove them from Lordaeron, else the humans will never regain their foothold on their homeland again. He feels his actions follow the Light, that he is doing good for his race and his home. He deeply admires his partner, the Grand Inquisitor, and is very proud of the organization they have built together.\nHigh General Abbendis's daughter is the young Brigitte Abbendis, who is the current High General. As an older man, he sought to destroy all undead. He passed that goal onto his daughter before he died at undead hands."}

Rakeesh was originally the son of &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, but was kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; in a revenge scheme ages ago and broken by the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Inquisition\"&gt;Demonic Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; to serve the Legion.\nDuring the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Rakeesh was tasked by Kil'jaeden with launching an assault on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Exodar\"&gt;The Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" and destroy the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; to prevent it from unlocking &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;.

As a child, he attended &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement to the eredar about &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He was off to the side with his mother, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Nuuri\"&gt;Nuuri&lt;/a&gt;.\n13,000 years ago, when &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; was leading his people away from &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, he asked &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; to bring his family. Unfortunately for Velen, Talgath instead went to Kil'jaeden. On that day, both Velen's son and his mate were taken from him. It is unknown what fate befell &lt;a href=\"Nuuri\"&gt;Nuuri&lt;/a&gt;, but their son was submitted to the mental and physical torture of the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Inquisition\"&gt;Demonic Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;. He became a &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; named \"Rakeesh\", meaning \"butcher\" in &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;, and served the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, unbeknownst to &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; who likely thought him deceased.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Rakeesh is High General and was ordered by Kil'jaeden himself to launch an assault on the home of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; people, leading to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the attack was the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; who dwelled within the core of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Exodar\"&gt;The Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", for he was the last of &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;'s line and as such he was capable of deciphering &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, which represented a major threat to the Legion's plans.\nCaught by surprise, the draenei of the \"Exodar\" were quickly overwhelmed by Rakeesh and his &lt;a href=\"Rakeeshi\"&gt;Rakeeshi&lt;/a&gt; forces, who seized much of the city early on. Rakeesh himself made his way to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Seat of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; and began directing the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' efforts to wipe out any remaining resistance. Before long, however, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; arrived with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;order champions&lt;/a&gt; in tow. With their aid, and that of the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei began to retake the city from the Rakeeshi, closing the Legion's portals and rescuing lost draenei. Upon finding out about Light's Heart, Velen moved to &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;'s aid, who was being held and beaten by Rakeesh.\nAs Velen arrived, Rakeesh killed the naaru by summoning in a &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Annihilator\"&gt;Fel Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, crushing the holy being upon arrival. A battle ensued between Rakeesh, Velen, and the Prophet's allies, until Velen realized who the man'ari really was. Frantic, Velen attempted to stop his allies from harming Rakeesh\u2014who he now recognized as his son\u2014but it was too late. Rakeesh died, in his father's arms, much to the Prophet's sorrow.\nSpeculation.\nGiven Velen's reaction to Rakeesh's death, it is likely that he has died permanently, due to being extremely close to the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-portal to Argus and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; with fel energies spewing right above his head."}

He reported the situation in Lordaeron and the growing number of undead, before agreeing to participate in Doan's experiment, and together, they succeeded in purifying what would later become the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Lord Commander Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; informed them of the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' suspension of the Silver Hand, Fairbanks followed Alexandros Mograine to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to ask &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to forge the mighty blade, despite his reluctance to trust the dwarves.\nLater, Fairbanks was tricked and led along with the Highlord by Mograine's son &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; where legions of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; awaited them. Fairbanks was the first to fall, but did not die - he was trapped and hidden under the corpses of the undead. He bore silent witness to Renault's betrayal of his father, hearing Mograine's anguished cries as the Ashbringer was plunged through his heart and fouling the blade.\nHe managed to survive and returned to Hearthglen where he told the story to anyone who would listen. Those who believed him broke away from the Crusade to found the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Fairbanks was executed by the remaining crusaders for his &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; as well as possibly showing symptoms of the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. His body was discarded in a secret chamber of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery%23The%20Cathedral\"&gt;Scarlet Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile dreaming, &lt;a href=\"Darion\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt; spoke with Fairbanks who gave him advice and the courage to continue the fight. Before the dream ended, he confessed his fate, before telling him to meet &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe undead Fairbanks could be found in a secret chamber in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and could be killed but no quest originally required that. It is accessible by using a torch on the wall in the right prayer room behind the altar in the Cathedral.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; instance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Fairbank is present in the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the other members of the Silver Hand, the two paladins &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, the priest &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, and the mage &lt;a href=\"Doan\"&gt;Doan&lt;/a&gt;, wearing the same tabard of Lordaeron as the other members of Mograine's circle of trusted friends. Unlike the comic, High General Abbendis is not present but is replaced by his daughter, while &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; is present although it is not the case in the comic.\nDeath and legacy.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Fairbanks was killed by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Dominic\"&gt;Dominic&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh Inquisitor Fairbanks' undead body can be found in the secret room of the Scarlet Monastery, lying on the ground lifeless. Which confirms that he was eliminated by the heroes sent by &lt;a href=\"Dominic\"&gt;Dominic&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore his execution by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, Fairbanks managed to give one last testimony on &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s last fight with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; against the Scourge and his &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal. This testimony was later written in the &lt;a href=\"Libram%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Libram of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to know the truth about the death of Highlord Mograine.\nWith the Corrupted Ashbringer.\n\"The following section was retconned by the comic and no longer refers to the current lore.\"\nEntering the monastery with the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; from the original version of Naxxramas equipped will trigger an &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer/Scarlet%20Monastery%20Event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, whereby High Inquisitor Fairbanks is redeemed by the Highlord's ghost, freeing his spirit. Talking to him initiates an extensive dialogue, which describes the history of the Ashbringer, and how to find the Highlord's other son in Outland, who can forge the blade anew.\nDespite popular belief, Fairbanks does not actually give a quest to create a new Ashbringer, or cleanse the Corrupted Ashbringer, or any quests for that matter.\nRelatives.\nHe is possibly related to &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Gerald Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Officer%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Officer Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;."}

The players now fight both at full health. They use the same abilities as before. Whitemane also gets a new ability:\nTactics.\nThe Durand and Whitemane encounter plays out much like the original version of the encounter with Mograine and Whitemane. However, it is not necessary to clear the room before engaging the boss, as the trash is not linked with Durand. However, players should kill the resurrecting fallen scarlets off in the east wing, to Durand's right.\nDurand is first and is straightforward by himself. Try to spread out so that Dashing Strike does not hit the entire party. On his death, Whitemane will run out from her room in the back and should be focused on the tank. She has exactly as much health as Durand does. Dispel the Power Word: Shield casts. Any class with an interrupt must interrupt her Mass Resurrection spell. 100 yards extends outside the cathedral, so any mobs killed inside the cathedral proper will join the fight at full health! 100 yards also includes the big pile of scarlets in the east wing, to the right of Durand and Whitemane's, and this will very quickly cause a wipe.\nWhen she drops below 50% health, she will put all enemies to sleep and resurrect Durand. Durand will then heal Whitemane and himself back to full health. Whitemane will continue to cast Mass Resurrection, so keep interrupting her! All told, to complete the encounter, the party will have to deal roughly four times Durand's total health to Durand and Whitemane."}

Much like the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, it is a position that is trying to coordinate the actions of all the races in the Alliance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; died and the High King title is now associated with his son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nRole.\nThe role is not about faction-wide political control, but something related to military control similar to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s former position as Supreme Allied Commander. The High King only has control over the forces given to him, and leaders who don't like his calls can choose not to commit their forces. Even so, it proved to be hereditary, as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; became the second High King after the death of his father &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;. This is rather odd, given the position is mainly military, and as such, was granted to Anduin before he was even an adult.\nDespite criticism of a \"Blue Warchief\" replacing the idea of a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zarhym\"&gt;Zarhym&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Community%20Manager\"&gt;Community Manager&lt;/a&gt; at that time, said that the position of High King thematically fits the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, because \"the Alliance formed an allegiance around &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nKnown High Kings.\nVarian Wrynn.\nTrials of the High King.\nThe \"Trials of the High King\" was planned to be an epic questline in \"\". King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; would be given tasks similar to the involving each of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races; each task pertaining to some important aspect of leadership to each racial leader. After accomplishing the task, Varian gains each Alliance racial leader's respect and is declared that race's High King. This was to allow Alliance players acting as his squire to learn more about him and his growth as a leader.\nVarian Wrynn's first trial happened in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1.0\"&gt;Patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt;. However, the development of Varian's character happens across the entire patch cycle and beyond - it doesn't all happen in one event or one scenario. His trials are many. Although only two trials were implemented, the Trials of the High King showed how Varian banded the Alliance together and ultimately led them to victory during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrial of Patience: A Little Patience.\nThe Horde have holed up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, and is ready to charge in to root them out. It is up to and a group of adventurers to lure the Horde troops out of the temple and kill .\nBy displaying patience, Varian was able to lure out the Horde army from the Temple of the Red Crane and decimate them with the Alliance's hidden traps. The victory resulted in the annihilation of the Horde army and its commander with minimal to no casualties for the Alliance. This victory has impressed Tyrande Whisperwind who then pledges the night elves' support to Varian's command.\nTrial of Loyalty: Blood in the Snow.\nOne day, King Varian's had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;dwarven capital&lt;/a&gt; by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But what the King did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; declined to offer aid in Ironforge's defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the Dark Irons would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, then Ironforge will fall under siege. Only &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons will prove their loyalty to the Council, Ironforge, and the Alliance in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nWhen they arrived at &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that their enemies were using an unnatural storm to prevent their forces from advancing on them. At Varian's request, Moira will lead her personal guard against the enemy troll village once the king's champions have stopped the magical storm protecting Shimmer Ridge. After rescuing the surviving mountaineers and slaying the elemental that the trolls were satiating with blood sacrifices to elicit the unnatural storm, the king\u2019s champions regrouped with Moira\u2019s Forgeguard and together their forces slew the Zandalari leader, and captured the Frostmane village.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Varian commended Moira and the Dark Irons on their victory, even stating that the Bronzebeards and Wildhammers will regret not having been there to share in her glory. Moira however, humbly stated that her intention was to protect and impress, not to shame; to which Varian acknowledged that she accomplished just that. Both returned to Ironforge to announce her victory to the Council.\nOn their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. And so it was a human king who helped to unite the dwarven clans so long divided. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAs tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; exploded in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Varian served as a mediator for the first time, tempering the cold tactics of war with an eye toward creating a lasting peace. This culminated in the invasion of Orgrimmar with the help of a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Varian's success solidified his position as high king, the commander of all Alliance forces.\nThe resolve of the High King of the Alliance was tested by the actions of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, but Varian refrained from killing the former warchief after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the orc to stand trial for his crimes.\nAnduin Wrynn.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the citizens of Stormwind and the Alliance lost their leader, High King Varian Wrynn. Anduin lost his father and some of his innocence as he was entrusted with the command of the Alliance's armies amidst a violent war, a task he felt woefully unprepared for. Time and again, Anduin has used diplomacy to end the conflict, inspiring even his warrior father to lay down arms in pursuit of peace. But diplomacy has its limits, and some villains can't be reasoned with. As the escalating war with the Horde threatens everything Anduin holds dear, he now guides his armies to seek new allies. His ultimate goal is to put an end to the bloodshed he so abhors... even if it means getting his hands dirty.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" focuses on &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his role of High King of the Alliance. With the discovery of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; threatening to shift the balance of power in Azeroth, King Anduin has refocused the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to preventing the powerful mineral from falling into the wrong hands and promoting diplomacy in order to prevent future wars fueled by Azerite. Anduin attempted to reconcile the humans of Stormwind with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by initiating the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; event in order to promote unity. However, the Gathering ended in tragedy, and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; has used the failed reunion to further alienate the Forsaken from their human counterparts.\nIn response to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance united under High King Anduin to retaliate against the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The two conflicts have reignited the war between the Alliance and Horde, as they &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the Azerite proliferating from their dying world.\nSpeculation.\nIt is surmised that King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; was the High King of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, or served in a role similar to it following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas was described as the \"patron of the Alliance\" and \"formed a &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;council of delegates&lt;/a&gt; from each of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;seven kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; under his rule.\" During the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, he outranked &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who served as his lieutenants, and engineered the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas went on to become the instigator of many of the Alliance's policies and military campaigns during the Invasion of Draenor up to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. However, Terenas was never officially addressed as High King, nor has he ever referred to himself using the title."}

{"id": "70939", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=70939", "title": "High King Maulgar", "text": "High King Maulgar is the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, ruling from within &lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Gruul's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. His council consists of &lt;a href=\"Kiggler%20the%20Crazed\"&gt;Kiggler the Crazed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blindeye%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Blindeye the Seer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olm%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Olm the Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Krosh%20Firehand\"&gt;Krosh Firehand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nOutland.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bladespire\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; clan was once among the weakest &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, lacking the numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt; or the physical strength of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt;. The birth of Maulgar changed their fate forever. Maulgar was stronger and hardier than any other ogre of his age, and his prowess in battle swiftly drew the attention of the previous high king. The king demanded a demonstration of Maulgar's might, and Maulgar granted it, snapping the king\u2019s neck where he stood. This action shifted the balance of power from the Boulderfist to the Bladespire, and drew the attention of mighty &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nFanatically loyal to the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, Maulgar now serves as Gruul\u2019s right hand and the guardian of the gronn lord\u2019s lair. Maulgar surrounds himself with only the most powerful of his clan and leads these elite few into battle, commanding them to augment his tremendous fighting abilities with their potent &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. With such powerful allies at his side and the rest of the Bladespire clan at his command, Maulgar has become the most dangerous ogre in all of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nHigh King Maulgar oversees the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Arena\"&gt;Blade's Edge Arena&lt;/a&gt; and encourages players to kill one another. It is not explained how he survived the events of \"The Burning Crusade\". His model was also changed from that of an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt; to a simple ogre.\nCouncil abilities.\nKrosh Firehand (Mage).\nKrosh has a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; which reduces magic damage taken by 75%. A mage must &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; this to remove the Spell Shield from Krosh and protect himself from Krosh's fireballs and must also maintain aggro with modest DPS. The only exception to this maintained aggro is that it is a common strategy for Warlocks who are &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslaving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Olm%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Olm's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Fel%20Stalker\"&gt;Wild Fel Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s to place them on Krosh to have them disposed of. The mage (and the entire raid for that matter) should be running a threat meter (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/wiki/Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;) and you'll find that it doesn't take that much dps to maintain aggro even with dps-impaired gear. This is an important detail for mana management so the mage need not be casting full-time until such time as the raid focuses on Krosh to down him.\nAll mages taking on the task should have high health and study the &lt;a href=\"Krosh%20Firehand\"&gt;Krosh Firehand&lt;/a&gt; page, which contains detailed mage tank strategies.\nThe mage tanking Krosh should have upwards of 12,000 HP when buffed, a good amount of spell hit, and a decent mana pool. The tanking mage should gear for stamina until he reaches a minimum of 10500 health unbuffed (13k is better). Spell Hit is critical and the mage should be near the full +16% &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;spell hit&lt;/a&gt; (202 rating) to minimize the chance of having Spellsteal resisted. With 5 points in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Focus\"&gt;Arcane Focus&lt;/a&gt; talent you would need just +6% spell hit (75 rating) from gear. Mana should not be disregarded, as repeated Spellstealing is costly (20% of your base mana). Spell Damage and Crit are good too but are lower priority, as again, it doesn't take that much dps to maintain aggro.\nImportant Notes:\nOlm the Summoner (Warlock).\nHe should be tanked by his own &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;Felhound&lt;/a&gt;s via &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslave Demon&lt;/a&gt;. Olm will place a stacking debuff on the Wild Fel Stalker that must be removed by the pet, which is an ability that is not auto cast but on a short cooldown. The Felhounds also come with taunt. The Summoner can be tanked with 2 Felhounds or 1 Felhound and a tank. Additional Felhounds must be &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt;ed or enslaved by remaining warlocks. They are not stunnable. A good way to dispose of an excess felhound is to put it on Krosh and then taunt, this will pull aggro from Krosh where Krosh will quickly dispatch the felhounds with a couple of Greater Fireballs and his blast wave AoE. This saves the tanking mage from a couple of hits too.\nIf two tanks are available to tank Olm, having them tank is also viable. A warlock is still need to &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt; the Felhounds. The benefit of this strategy is that it is a bit less chaotic and not prone to spell resists that can happen with a warlock tanking Olm.\nNOTE: Due to the new mechanics on how mobs target feared players, Olm will follow tanks affected by &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Death Coil (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; since his aggro table no longer resets. This can make holding him in position difficult. If Olm is being tanked by players, try setting up a taunt rotation to keep him in place.\nALERT: As of patch 2.1.2, he can now death coil the felhounds. Unsure if this is a bug or not.\nKiggler the Crazed (Shaman).\nTypically attacks with ranged lightning bolts and Arcane Shocks and may be tanked by any ranged DPS class. The Lightning Bolts are nature based and the arcane shocks are arcane based but both do relatively little damage. One healer is typically enough to handle the damage. He will sometimes Hex (&lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;) his primary target, so you must have either 2 ranged tanks or a &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20form\"&gt;Moonkin form&lt;/a&gt; druid, which are immune to polymorph. Kiggler also has a point-blank area-effect attack (similar to &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt;) which deals damage, lowers all targets' &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;, and knocking all targets back. Moving him away from the Krosh-tank is important to keep him from knocking the Krosh-tank into Krosh's Blast Wave. Nature resistance is helpful but not necessary. Not stunnable. Shaman's &lt;a href=\"Grounding%20Totem\"&gt;Grounding Totem&lt;/a&gt; can absorb the Lightning Bolts as well.\nAn alternate strategy is to tank him with a feral druid, as they are also immune to the polymorph. A feral druid meleeing him will definitely take more damage than a ranged tank, but it is a fairly simple strategy, and more comfortable for many guilds than moonkin tanking. If they are comfortable with their aggro on him, the feral druid can also back out to range and just sit there eating the lightning bolts for a while before returning to melee him to build more threat. This strategy is simpler for most guilds, but requires an additional melee and more healing, both of which are often subbed out after Maulgar for a more ranged DPS heavy Gruul group.\nIt is also possible to just have a tree druid attack Kiggler long enough to build a bit of threat and then go to tree form to avoid the poly and heal tank him. A good bit of hot spamming to keep himself up and some hots on other people with salvation canceled is usually more than enough to hold aggro on him. When he does the deaggro, drop tree form, nuke him a few times, then go back to what you were doing. When the raid goes to kill Kiggler, just have one of the other tanks that is now free pick him up as actual damage on Kiggler should hopefully out what the healer has built up since his aggro wipe.\nBlindeye the Seer (Priest).\nThe healer of the group, he has a small heal with which he heals himself for approximately 5% of his maximum health and a very powerful 10-second cast &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; which heals him to full. Before he casts Prayer of Mending he will always himself first and can't be interrupted when the shield is up. As soon as he shields, DPS must break down the shield before they can interrupt his Prayer of Mending. He is vulnerable to Curse of Tongues and Mind Numbing Poison which can aid players in the interrupt process of his dangerous heals. A tank druid can easily range pull him with immediate aggro using &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire%20%28Feral%29\"&gt;Faerie Fire (Feral)&lt;/a&gt; if no Misdirections are available.\nAlternatively, there are eight ways to interrupt Blindeye's &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; while the shield remains up:\nNote that Blindeye is immune to a rogue's &lt;a href=\"Kidney%20Shot\"&gt;Kidney Shot&lt;/a&gt; while the shield is up. &lt;a href=\"Kidney%20Shot\"&gt;Kidney Shot&lt;/a&gt; can, however, be used to stun him before he pops his shield, potentially delaying his use of the shield.\nHe is typically tanked by a DPS warrior (In DPS gear, as avoidance causes rage starvation when fighting Blindeye) or feral druid.\nStrategy.\nOnce the initial trash (3) are killed, the raid has 1 hour to do attempts on the King and his council. The 1 hour timer is based on when the first patrolling trash mob first aggroes.\nThe key to get into this fight is the pull. Everyone needs to stand in the correct position to minimize the impact of the area-effect abilities. The typical kill order is Priest, Warlock, Mage, Shaman, and finally Maulgar. Priest and Warlock can both be focus-fired by melee and ranged together, so they go down quickly. Shaman and Mage are ranged-only DPS and die more slowly. Due to many of the ogres having anti-melee damage (fire nova, AoE knock-back, Maulgar whirlwind), ranged DPS is more of an asset than melee DPS for this specific fight.\nHaving a mod such as &lt;a href=\"RLAssistFU\"&gt;RLAssistFU&lt;/a&gt; or the entire raid on Teamspeak / Ventrilo will synchronize the pull as much as possible to reduce the impact of certain mobs running the wrong way.\nThe pull.\nJust as a general way of making this pull a lot easier is to have 5 hunters, all with Aimed shots all Misdirect with synchronized shots so as to have each tank immediately start out with a good 2k+ threat. Makes pulling much much easier, especially when ventrilo or some other voice communication is being used.\nThe mage tanking Krosh Firehand should place himself completely to the right and move straight forward. Just in front of Krosh Firehand there's a slight graphical \"clip\" (i.e., a place where the graphics texture pieces do not align well) and that is where you should stand before the pull takes place. Be sure not to move too close to the \"clip\" or you will aggro the room. A good reference point can be used just before the clip, there is a portion of the wall to your right that makes a \"corner\" (with a little steam vent) that is a safe reference point to stay at when preparing for the pull. When High King Maulgar gets aggroed you shoot any instant-spell you have (fire blast, PoM pyro) at Krosh Firehand and Spellsteal his shield immediately afterwards. Positioning Krosh is easy. When you aggro him, he will run to you until he is right next to you, then he will stay at that point and fireball you. Make sure that you position him in the far right corner so the raid does not have to worry about the flame wave ability. This is easily done by running to the corner after a Fire Blast and just waiting until he gets to you and then blinking to get out of the range of the flame wave.\nHigh King Maulgar is best tanked by the gate leading to Gruul, on the far left; this gives the least chance of a knockback or fear into him. He remains in this position at all times during the fight. It is recommended to use a spare hunter with misdirection on the main tank to ensure his aggro is as sticky as possible straight from the start.\nKiggler the Crazed can be tanked by a combination of two hunters or two warlocks who are siphon life/drain tanking him. Alternatively he can be tanked by a Moonkin druid because of the immunity to polymorph. Nature resistance should be a priority to the class(es) tanking him to avoid large damage spikes. Stay at max range to avoid the Arcane Blast. A good position for him is down the entrance corridor - be careful not to get knocked back through the instance portal. Tanking him here gains a 30 yard sphere of safety inside the main cave, where space is limited.\nBlindeye the Seer should be pulled and tanked in a safe place in the room. Pre-determining where he should go can be tricky, due to the difficult nature of positioning the rest of the adds. All DPS are on him doing damage, he should be dead as soon as possible.\nOlm the Summoner, the tanks and the warlocks run straight to him, but beware of the Blast Wave of &lt;a href=\"Krosh%20Firehand\"&gt;Krosh Firehand&lt;/a&gt;. He should be tanked in the back of the room. Since he has no AoE, he can be tanked next to Blindeye the Seer, so your dps can switch fast and easy.\nIf there are enough Hunters available, a misdirection pull on the Olm, Maulgar and Krosh can make the beginning of this fight a much more stable affair.\nKilling the 4 adds.\nIt is important that you have enough damage to make &lt;a href=\"Blindeye%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Blindeye the Seer&lt;/a&gt;'s shield disappear. Have someone giving information when the shield is up and then just burst his shield down. Once the shield is down, his healing ability can be interrupted by any physical damage. Alternatively you can use Silence, Silencing Shot, Improved Kick, Improved Shield Bash or Improved Counterspell to interrupt him even with the shield up. Optimally you should only have to deal with two or three shields while damaging him down, then all the melee should go to &lt;a href=\"Olm%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Olm the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; while all ranged DPS concentrates on &lt;a href=\"Krosh%20Firehand\"&gt;Krosh Firehand&lt;/a&gt;. While you walk to those two encounters, make sure to avoid Krosh Firehand's Blast Wave. Stay calm, be cautious, and bring those two adds down. Once Olm the Summoner is down, Krosh Firehand should follow right after. Finally everyone DPSs &lt;a href=\"Kiggler%20the%20Crazed\"&gt;Kiggler the Crazed&lt;/a&gt; down.\nNotes:\nDefeating High King Maulgar.\nAfter all 4 adds are down, ensure your healers have enough mana. All free healers should recover some mana before entering the fight against High King Maulgar. Same goes for caster-DPS. High King Maulgar hits very hard (about 12k on cloth), so its advised to keep available attack power debuffs up all the time (&lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Roar\"&gt;Demoralizing Roar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;). Meleers don't enter the fight right away, they have to wait until High King Maulgar does his first Whirlwind. When the Whirlwind vanishes you can enter the fight for about 25\u201335 seconds, then you should move away to prevent his Whirlwind from hitting you!\nAt 50% High King Maulgar enters Phase 2. He becomes big and red and drops his hammer reducing his melee damage by a good amount so that the OTs can survive a few seconds without heal after a taunt. In this phase he will charge random party members. He will also cast Intimidating Shout on the main tank which will incapacitate him for 4 seconds and fear everyone around him. To deal with intimidating shout, have a second tank taunt Maulgar after all the other adds are down (the MT should immediately taunt him back) and then run out of range of the fear and wait. When Maulgar Intimidating Shouts the melee, his aggro will switch to the off tank until Intimidating Shout breaks. Once Intimidating Shout breaks, the off tank can intervene the MT to get Maulgar back in position. It's also possible for the MT to \"stance-dance\" through the fear. The first fear usually come about 5 seconds into phase 2. After that, Maulgar fears approximately every 15 seconds. (As of 2.3.1, Maulgar no longer switches targets upon fearing. He does however still maintain some degree of 'Mob ADD,' just not as regards Intimidating Shout. When he charges a random party member, there is some sort of aggro reduction on the top tank. A two tank strategy is therefore still advisable.)\nHis whirlwinds can be dangerous in this phase if he begins one while the main tank is feared or right after a charge so keeping tabs on the whirlwinds and spreading out are very important. If you have 20 or more people still up once the 4 adds are dead, you should have no trouble getting Maulgar down. Be prepared and spread out for Phase 2."}

WH12-B4NG starts examining the four and after getting to Magni, he recognizes him as the Speaker and asks if he is looking for the &lt;a href=\"Seeker\"&gt;Seeker&lt;/a&gt;s. Magni says yes and WH12-B4NG starts releasing them one by one. However, getting to the last one, they discover that it had fallen to void corruption. Obeying its programming, WH12-B4NG initiates protocol. Waves of titan constructs attack the four but are fortunately defeated. When all is calm again, Betild realizes that WH12-B4NG and the vault will soon run out of power, leaving no one to look after the seekers. However, Magni realizes why he was sent here. It was only a matter of time before the vault fell. Not wanting the seekers to be lost forever, Azeroth requested that Magni bring the High Priest here to look after them. The Conclave agrees to this request.\nBack at Netherlight Temple, the High Priest climbs on top of one of them and makes it his own."}

Later, he came to greet in person &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; who had just teleported to Ironforge and asked him for more information. The latter replied that he had to be careful because of the spies, and both of them left in private to discuss the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, Rohan accepted the proposal to join the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; as its priest representative, but expressed his doubts about recruiting the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krank%20Axeljink\"&gt;Krank Axeljink&lt;/a&gt;, considering that the latter placed too much faith in technology than in wisdom. On the way to &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt;, he told Meryl that &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had recently discovered the base of &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary staff of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, but that he had lost it again in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; where the Twilight's Hammer cultists were currently located, which greatly interested the undead mage. After they convinced the inventor to join them, Rohan announced to Meryl that he would accompany the gnome to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and that they would meet there for the first meeting of the council.\nDays later, Rohan and Krank arrived in Theramore where they were greeted by Jaina Proudmoore and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. While awaiting the arrival of the last members of the council, Rohan and the others were invited to come in and hear the story of what the Council of Tirisfal once was, and why they were all summoned here. However, before they could all be present, Cho'gall sent elementals to attack Theramore and prevent the creation of the new &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. When Krank proposed to use his device to draw power from the other council members into one person, obviously him in this situation, Rohan agreed to try the experiment, which led to the death of the engineer in an explosion, to the great regret of the priest who tried to save him in vain. During the fight against the elements, Rohan used his sacred powers to protect and heal his allies. Following their victory, he attended the first meeting of the new council and approved that Med'an become the new Guardian, if the latter really wanted it.\nFollowing the council's decision, Rohan followed some members into a &lt;a href=\"Plane%23Pocket%20dimensions\"&gt;pocket dimension&lt;/a&gt; out of time and space accessed by a ritual of Jaina Proudmoore. There, he participated in the ritual to grant his holy powers to Med'an, allowing him to be ready to face Cho'gall in Ahn'Qiraj. During the fight against the leader of the Twilight's Hammer, he granted more of his holy powers to the new Guardian, but was attacked along with the others by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, they eventually managed to stop him together.\nHe was lastly seen at the funeral of Aegwynn, in the graveyard west of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Rohan met &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt; after the latter bumped into the gnome mages &lt;a href=\"Dink\"&gt;Dink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bink\"&gt;Bink&lt;/a&gt;, the High Priest healed the young man and greeted him kindly, exchanging a few pleasantries with the Prince of Stormwind, before telling him he was welcome in the temple whenever he wanted.\nAfter the first earthquakes stopped, Rohan traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt; where he helped healing the injured inhabitants. When Anduin Wrynn and &lt;a href=\"Aerin\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt; came to help, Rohan was not surprised because he knew he would come, he then asked the young priest to take care of the lightly injured while he took care of the most seriously injured. Together they healed and rescued the survivors, however, another wave of earthquake occurred and the High Priest used his power to protect everyone from the disaster and the crippling attack of fear. He later joined the crowd around the &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;, as the building was buried in snow along with those who had taken shelter there. He ordered silence to all who were present, and took charge of the rescue operation, thus allowing the survivors to be saved and evacuated. When Aerin and another dwarf were buried beneath the distillery which had just collapsed underground, Rohan tried to stop Anduin who was trying in vain to save his already dead friend. He then took the exhausted prince back to Ironforge.\nTwo days after the disaster, Rohan met Anduin in the Hall of Mysteries and supported the young priest with kind words, hoping that his heart bruised by sadness could heal with time. After this, he was present at the ritual in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, where he told Anduin that the chamber was not full of crystal but of diamonds. With the others, he witnessed Magni's \"death\" because of the ritual, and began to cast healing spells to save his king. But he eventually stopped and put a hand on the diamond arm, letting out a tear knowing it was too late. Later he appeared at the ceremonial for Magni, thanking those who came and offering refreshments to everyone.\nSeveral weeks after the incident, while he was talking with Anduin, Rohan was summoned urgently at the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; had returned to Ironforge, and had claimed her father's throne as legitimate heiress. The situation being completely legal, as he explained to Anduin that Magni had never disowned his daughter hoping that she would return one day, the High Priest had no choice but to accept the new queen and respond positively to her requests. When he learned that the city's &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s were sick, and that the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; was currently blocked, he pretended that it was nothing serious, and privately announced to Anduin that Moira was taking control of the city by blocking any exit attempt for the dwarves but also for the Prince of Stormwind. When the first conflicts between the dwarves of Ironforge and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarves\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; began, the High Priest prevented Anduin from intervening and took charge of putting an end to the conflicts with a prayer that emanated a sense of calm, he then began to treat the many injured.\nA few days later, he encountered Anduin again in the Hall of Mysteries after the latter managed to escape Moira and the guards who had imprisoned him. Although the priest did not like Moira's methods, despite being the rightful queen of the kingdom, he approved of the young prince's decision to stop &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; from assassinating her. When a Dark Iron guard came for Rohan and his priests to tend to injuries from a conflict in the Deeprun Tram, he agreed to come after making sure Anduin was not discovered and heard the conversion.\nWhen Anduin managed to stop his father from killing Moira, Rohan intervened on the prince's behalf, announcing that despite the situation, she remained the princess and future queen of the kingdom, and that killing her would lead to a civil war.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, High Priest Rohan continued to form new generations of priests. When the latter were ready to continue their training, Rohan received letters from high figures of the various clergy in Azeroth summoning his disciples to meet them, notably &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Surgeon%20Gashweld\"&gt;Chief Surgeon Gashweld&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but also &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. He therefore encouraged his apprentices to hurry to join them.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, High Priest Rohan still continued to form new generations of priests in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he received a letter from the priestess &lt;a href=\"Patrice%20Lancaster\"&gt;Patrice Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; asking to receive his apprentices in the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, in order to send them on missions for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.

Each priest was a powerful champion of the Primal Gods, or &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, but despite their best efforts, they fell under the sway of Hakkar and were forced to channel power into the blood god. Ultimately, Thekal and the other priests were slain by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who entered the city, and killed Hakkar.\nAbilities.\nPhase One: Thekal's Council.\nThe encounter begins as a council fight. High Priest Thekal is joined by &lt;a href=\"Zealot%20Lor%27Khan\"&gt;Zealot Lor'Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zealot%20Zath\"&gt;Zealot Zath&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two &lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Tiger\"&gt;Zulian Tiger&lt;/a&gt; adds. In order to progress to phase two, all three council members must be killed within 10 seconds of each other. Otherwise, defeated members are resurrected with full health.\nZealot Lor'Khan.\nLevel 62 Healer with 90,650 health.\nZealot Zath.\nLevel 62 Rogue with 113,295 health.\nPhase Two: Aspect of Shirvallah.\nUpon successfully defeating the council, High Priest Thekal resurrects with full health and transforms into the Aspect of Shirvallah, permanently increasing his attack speed by 100% and gaining new abilities. Additionally, Thekal summons two Zulian Guardians upon transforming and once every minute after.\nZulian Guardian.\nLevel 60 with 6,104 health.\nStrategy.\nThis fight is another two-phase affair. Phase 1 has three tanks grabbing the Priest and the Zealots. The offtanks take the Zealots about halfway to each corner of the lower area. The Priest is tanked just south of his hut. Lor'Khan needs to be far enough away from the others so he cannot heal them. Alternatively Lor'Khan can be mana drained by priests/locks and a hunter. Once he's at 0 mana a hunter can keep him down alone. Zath can be closer to Thekal, but again needs to be away from Lor'Khan.\nNote: Zealot Lor'Khan has been confirmed that she's susceptible to chain rogue stuns - not sure if this also works for Zealot Zath.\nAlso Note: Zealot Zath can both Gouge and Blind, so you need either two tanks to keep him controlled or a mage to stay second on the aggro list ready to blink to the tank upon gouge/blind. If you're really unlucky, he'll gouge one tank, blind the other, and go for the healer. Be on your toes.\nAll 3 can be disarmed in phase one, so be sure to do this whenever the cooldown is over.\nOnce the MT has enough aggro on Thekal, everyone attacks until 20%. They then switch to Zath, and take him to 15%. Finally, Lor'Khan is taken to 10%. Rogues need to kick and mages need to silence to avoid him healing, and making this a longer fight, and a potential wipe.\nBy this time, Thekal and Zath will be at around 10% as well. Then all that is needed is to kill all three in quick succession. It is recommended that most of the DPS kills Lor'Khan, and a few of the ranged start to kill Zath. As Lor'Khan gets lower, more of the DPS can move on to Thekal and Zath, but the Rogues must stay until Lor'Khan dies, since a Heal at any point will mean everyone has to either get back on Lor'Khan, or run out and start again. Once Lor'Khan dies, the Rogues and other melee can move on to Thekal, whilst the ranged finish off Zath.\nAn alternate strategy is to simply split into three groups and try to keep the DPS even all the way down, but this can be easily ruined by a single heal from Lor'Khan. By having Thekal and Zath at 15-10%, the Tanks can simply stand there and take a beating, getting healed, until Lor'Khan is ready to be killed. This strategy is more forgiving of lag, mistakes, and mistimed kicks/silences.\nAnother finishing off strategy is once you have them down around 10 percent health bring all 3 together and AOE as much as possible. This is an easy way to kill them all at the same time. From the time of the first death, you have about 10 seconds before they start resurrecting.\nSome more info! As Zealot Lor'Khan can be stunned it really helps the healers out on conserving mana. You assign one healer for the tank with Lor'Khan. 2 healers on Zealot Zath's tank, and 3 healers on Thekal's tank. This worked for us and we didn't go out of mana by the time we pulled em all together and AoE'd em down when they were all low percent. The rogues chain stunning Lor'Khan is also good for kicking to interrupt the heals she can cast. In any case she does get a heal off during the AoEing, just have all single target DPS focus on her.\nDuring phase 2 We pulled Thekal to the right side near where we tanked Zealot Lor'Khan and had the rest of the raid on the other side where Zealot Zath is tanked. We then have 2 mages polying the tigers as they come in. All extra melee DPS is tasked with breaking a poly of one of the tigers (hibernate and cheap shot work on these tigers also) and DPSing down these tigers down one at a time. Meanwhile, all ranged DPS focus on Thekal and you'll have two tanks for Thekal. Once Thekal does his AoE punch he'll lose aggro on the main tank. That's where the 2nd tank intercepts and brings him to his tanking spot. The old tank then takes his place for intercept *away* from the punch standing toward the middle.\nNote: It's a good idea to keep the tank in between the majority of the raid and the boss or else the punch will hit them as well.\nAlternate Phase 2 Strategy: Since the AoE stomp is nearly unavoidable, it can help to have the whole raid run up into the small alcove where Thekal and his guards started before the encounter. The MT and melee fight Thekal against one wall while the OT, healers, and ranged DPS stand against the other. When he unleashes the AoE attack, the walls allow everyone to quickly recover and prevents the raid from being scattered about on the battlefield. Everyone's close proximity also allows for extremely quick disposal of tiger adds.\nA variation on the above which we've found to work well is to AoE the three down from 10% in the small alcove in front of the cage, then tanking Thekal in the niche to the left facing the cage, and having the ranged in the cage. Ranged takes tigers, melee's behind Thekal, the tank doesn't go anywhere if there's a knockback, ranged can get out of LoS to bandage, and, if there's a random charge, an offtank in the cage's mouth can deal with it straight away.\nQuotes.\nPhase 2:\nDeath:\nReset:\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\", Thekal serves as the champion of Shirvallah's Tigers, a proud and righteous team of troll &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and appears as . His flavor text reads: \"\"\u2026and then I beat him with 1 Health!\"\""}

After Bloodvenom ends, Venoxis enters a state of Venom Withdrawal and then returns to stage one.\nStrategy.\nA large portion of the damage in this battle can be avoided. This fight requires concentration and thought to positioning of players and the boss.\nPhase 1.\nVenoxis should be positioned so that melee players can place themselves behind the boss without taking damage from the maze walls or other damaging elements.\nRanged players should go to differnet parts of the maze and maximise the distance between themselves and the tank/melee players in order to minimize travelling time when breaking the link.\nAny player affected by Toxic Link should stop casting and move away from the connected player as soon as possible.\nWhispers of Hethiss can and should be inturrupted for every cast, this may require 2 people to rotate inturrupts.\nPhase 2.\nPool of Acrid Tears will spawn around the area, the tank should be aware of any near the boss so that he can be moved to prevent damage being taken from then.\nWhen Venoxis begins casting Breath of Hethiss the tank and any players within 15 yards of the boss must ensure that they are behind him before the cast finishes.\nAt the end of Phase 2 Venoxis will head back to where he started, players should head to a 'dead end' part of the maze to allow the maximum movement area for Bloodvenom.\nPhase 3.\nWhen Venoxis summons the tendrils for Bloodvenom, players must be kite these and avoid other party members as the tendrils deal AoE damage to anyone in range. There will be one tendril summoned for each party member who is alive. A sound strategy is to stand still and wait for the tendrils to appear before running; exiting the maze before the tendrils appear will cause one to appear at the entrance and moving before the tendrils are summoned can cause a tendril to follow a player that is already running from one, both of which can cause unnecessary damage. Abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; can prevent the damage being taken in an emergency.\nPlayers must be careful not to touch the walls of the maze, as doing so will cause roughly 50k nature damage per second. Keep this in mind if you plan to jump over the maze edges as the effect is slightly larger than the graphic.\nWhen Venoxis gets weakend from Venom Withdrawl, burn him with everything you've got. After this debuff dissipates phase 1 will start again.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Sent to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, she was turned by the blood god and had to be slain at the Zandalari's behest.\nAbilities.\nIf the High Priestess Arlokk is not killed before encountering &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, like other high priests around the Zul'gurub will grant Hakkar special abilities if they are still alive and that will make the fight near impossible. High Priestess Arlokk special power is:\nBackstory.\nIn order to quell &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; sent a contingent of Zandalari High Priests into the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Each priest was a powerful champion of the Primal Gods, or &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, but despite their best efforts, they fell under the sway of Hakkar and were forced to channel power into the blood god. Ultimately, Arlokk and the other priests were slain by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who entered the city, and killed Hakkar.\nSetup.\nTwo tanks in the 'pens' (places with straw and fence), a druid and shaman facing them with their backs to the wall on side of the room with the gong, MT in the middle of the room, ready to gain aggro on Arlokk, and the rest of the raid with their backs to the wall with the big shield on it.\nEncounter.\nHigh Priestess Arlokk is spawned by hitting the &lt;a href=\"Gong%20of%20Bethekk\"&gt;gong&lt;/a&gt; in her room. She spawns near the entrance to the room in priest form using and standard melee attack. She can also Gouge while in humanoid form, so you'll want an offtank near the back of the room ready to taunt and bring her back. Have your tank get her to the back of the room near the rest of the group and start the DPS as soon the tank calls it. You want to end the fight quickly so you're healers don't run out of mana or get killed by her opener. \nImmediately upon engaging her, multiple level 60 (non-elite) panthers spawn from cages on each side of the room, about one every 5 seconds. Do NOT bother killing the panthers, as they will respawn indefinitely. The panther spawns are stealthed and will path out around the fence towards the back of the room with the big shield on the wall and the rest of the raid. Your tanks in the pens will have to gain aggro on the panthers and hold them for the duration of the fight. Have both the tanks in the pens use Bloodrage as the fight begins and stand at the inside or end of the fence ready to smack the first panther that comes by them. \nLet the 'pen' tanks keep getting panthers from his cage until they can start spamming Demoralizing shouts. Once they do this, they can stop attacking and just stand there, spamming Demoralizing Shout, which will aggro any panthers spawning in the cage and the others they are holding. Panther spawns hit for about 30ish on plate, which isn't much but with 20+ panthers attacking it can add up. To neutralize a lot of the damage, have the shaman near that tank be in his group and have him lay Stoneskin totem. The druid can lay some HoTs and whatever else they want to do to keep the 'pen' tanks up, but make sure they conserve mana for the most part because the fight can be long. \nHigh Priestess Arlokk has the ability to 'mark' someone, which looks like a large V over their head. This is usually a person with a high amount of aggro and can sometimes be the 'pen' tank or their healers (if that is the case, have a healer from the back come up and take the spot of the marked healer since the marked healer might die). This mark attracts panthers to the marked person \"if\" they are in LOS (line of sight) of the panthers. To make sure you don't pull ALL the panthers off the 'pen' tanks, run to the very back of the room with the rest of the raid and pray you haven't already aggroed them. If you did, have all your mages and warlocks AoE the panthers until they are dead. This will make the panthers respawn from the cages so the tanks can reaggro them. After one minute she stealths. She does not attack while stealthed, but she has a powerful opener that can easily 2-shot clothies and usually targets those healing the OTs.\nAlliance: Holy Paladins can be placed as Healers for the Pen Tanks. We use a Druid and Paladin set-up. Paladin \"bubbles\" remove the mark effect. As such, if the paladin receives the mark, Divine Shield will remove it. If the druid receives the mark, Blessing of Protection will remove it.\nBe wary, when she unstealths she WILL 2shot the druid. We have taken to using a bear form druid or 4th tank if available to stand next to the druid during the stealthed phase to prevent her from ganking the healer.\nAnother Alliance Strategy: This strategy revolves entirely around a Paladin and a healer (or two) to keep him/her alive. The little-used spell \"Blessing of Sacrifice\" transfers 55 damage taken per hit after mitigation to the Paladin. Because the panthers deal countless tiny hits (about 55-60 on cloth) the Paladin will be taking the damage of the panthers. The spell has no cooldown, so if multiple people are marked the Paladin can take damage for all of them. The beautiful simplicity of the strategy is that Paladins are quite durable and healers can keep Heal-over-times on this Paladin constantly, more easily than targeting multiple people for heals. Should the situation turn ugly, and in case of the Paladin's impending death, Divine Shield will NOT cancel the effect. Instead, the Paladin stops taking 55 damage and instead is hit for \"0\". This frees up all AoE casters to turn the Priestess into a fine red mist when she unstealths.\nStrategy.\nStrategy 1.\nSetup: This requires 3 warriors, preferably with 1h and shield unless geared out. The MT will be on Arlokk while the two OT's will be at the panther cages. The rest of the raid group will begin the battle with their backs to the wall opposite of the gong (door side).\nCombat: This is a fairly simple fight if executed as dictated. \nHave a non-tank member ring the gong to initiate the fight. Arlokk will spawn immediately, which will require the MT to begin the aggro process. Once the tank has Arlokk on lock-down, the entire raid (except the Off-tanks) must focus on DPSing down Arlokk. \nDuring the battle, panthers will spawn in great numbers. Arlokk will also place a 'mark' on a raid member, who will become the main target of the panthers. When a player is marked, he/she should run to the other side of the room from the gong, where he/she can't be seen by most panthers. \nThe job of the off-tanks is to drop demoralizing shout and any other aggro-grabber to strip the panthers off the marked member. To that end, the off tanks should drink rage potions and use Bloodrage when the gong is hit so they can get aggro from the panthers as quickly as possible. They can then spam Demoralizing Shout. This process will continue until Arlokk vanishes. \nOnce Arlokk is gone, kill all the panthers which are aggroed on the casters, but leave the panthers which are fighting the OTs alone. This is very important. If you kill the panthers which are on the OTs, new ones will spawn quickly and at first go for the casters and the Marked One. SO DO NOT KILL THE PANTHERS ATTACKING THE OFF-TANKS! The panthers have an upper limit to their number at which they stop spawning, and you want to have them all to fight the OTs. Since the panthers do so little damage to tanks, the OTs can be healed by an off-healer each. It is, however, advisable to have an additional healer paying attention to the OTs and their off-healers, just in case. \nWhen Arlokk reappears, she will be in panther form and activate a red aura, which indicates her double-cleave. AVOID THE CLEAVES! The rogues should not be anywhere near her when she is in panther form and able to cleave. Continue going full-out DPS on Arlokk, and continue to have the OT's taunt the panthers. By the end of the 2nd vanish, she should be well below 50%. By that time, the panthers should all be aggroed on the OTs, so the casters can really all stand around and twiddle their thumbs until she is back. Even the marking should not aggro any panthers on the casters now. \nWhen she reappears, again watch for the cleave. Continue DPSing Arlokk until she is dead, then nuke the panthers. Most guilds can do this in about 3-4 vanishes. Better guilds will kill her before the 2nd vanish. The key to this is constant, heavy DPS while she is out, and leaving the panthers on the OTs alone. It is tempting to nuke the panthers which are attacking the OTs, but this will only make your job a lot more difficult since the OTs need to reaggro the respawns. The off-tanks should have a healer assigned to each of them.\nStrategy 2.\nSetup: The whole raid assembles at the gong, only the main tank keeps to the middle of the room to grab Arlokk when the gong has been sounded. after grabbing the aggro, the whole raid focuses on dps on Arlokk, the panthers are being feared by Warlocks and Priests with their ApE fearing abilities. No offtanks are needed here.\nOnce Arlokk vanishes, the mages Frost Nova the panthers and the whole raid goes AoE against them. The panthers die rather fast (at least in our raids, they are non-elite mobs). The main tank just stays in the middle of the room during the slaying of the panthers. Once Arlokk is visible again, and the main tank regained aggro, again the whole raid focuses on her to dps her down, fearing/ignoring the spawning panthers.\nMain Points:\n- keep dps on Arlokk as long as she is visible\n- mass fear the panthers during the dps stages\n- aoe kill panthers once Arlokk vanishes\n- the main tank needs to keep Arlokk out of the group because of her cleave attack.\nWe manage to kill Arlokk before she vanishes a 2nd time with this strategy.\nStrategy 3.\nThe MT rings the gong to summon Arlokk and immediately gets her attention. The MT and DPS open up on her once the MT has sufficient aggro and ignores the panthers. The 3 mages by the gong have to be careful to keep their mana levels high enough to maintain their Frost Nova rotation.\nThe OTs grab the attention of the panthers however they want and hold aggro without killing them.\nWhen Arlokk marks a target, they run to one of the OTs so the OT can strip the panthers off them.\nOnce all the panthers have spawned the OTs drag them to the gong, preferably into a corner at the back.\nWhen the panthers are in the recess with the gong, the mages begin alternating their frost novas. When the panthers are all frozen in place the secondary OT is free to DPS Arlokk with the rest of the raid. Every 8 seconds the next mage in the rotation runs into the gong area and fires off his frost nova to renew the root. The primary OT needs to stay with the mages and keep the panthers in the back. Because Frost Nova only has an 8 second duration with a 25 second cooldown the OT will have to make sure the panthers don't get out of the bottleneck. With 3 mages there will be a minimum of 1 second every rotation that the panthers aren't frozen unless one of the mages has at least a single point in Improved Frost Nova. If the mages have enough frost specialization to have a fully covered rotations (or there happen to be four of them), the OT should still stay by the mages just in case the panthers break early.\nNote: My bad on the 15 seconds...I don't play a mage and there was some confusion on that point...fixed now though.\nThe 8 second rotation is important! Frost Nova has a 25 second cooldown normally and an 8 second effect. This means that with three mages alternating frost novas every 8 seconds you will have the OT tanking the panthers that just broke out of the root, one mage with 1 second left on the timer, one mage with 9 seconds left on his cooldown, and one mage with 17 seconds left on his cooldown. I suggest that each mage make a /y macro, and hit it whenever their frost nova cooldown reaches 19 seconds. This gives the next mage in the rotation 2 seconds to finish casting whatever and get into position.\nIf any of the panthers resist the frost nova or break early, it is the job of the primary OT to keep them off the mages and out of the raid proper. When the next mage in the rotation is ready to Frost Nova the OT will keep the panther in place while the nova is fired.\nOnce Arlokk is dead, the panthers can be AOEd.\nStrategy 4: Easy Mode (Hellfire).\nThis boss has always been infamous. Recently those I raid with have discovered easy mode...using a warlock to hellfire. It's the simplest and most successful strategy I've seen. Simply have a warlock hellfire the entire time right in the middle. Put a big X on him with the new icon system and have everyone stand on him. The warlock can single handedly kill the adds with only occasional assistance from other AoEs. They simply hellfire the entire time, the healers just need to keep a couple Heal-Over-Times on the warlock.\nThe rest is easy, DPS the boss when she appears.\nStrategy 5 - safer, for less well-equipped Guilds.\nWhat isn't mentioned in any of the above guides is that if you kill a Panther, it respawns, with more health. Our strat is geared around NOT killing any of the panthers. "}

During this phase Jeklik will occasionally summon packs of bats to attack the raid. Phase one ends when she reaches 50% health.\nPhase Two: Priest form.\nAt 50% health, Jeklik reverts to her Priest Form, losing her Bat Form abilities but granting her Priest abilities. At 35% health, Jeklik calls Bat Riders to toss liquid fire onto the ground.\nGurubashi Bat Rider\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nIt's a good idea to pull her to the small hill (which is just to your right as you enter her area). If she's there, you get good advance warning before a bat wave comes in. You should have as few as possible people in melee range (ideally only the MT and OT), one sacrifice guy (e.g. a hunter) between her and the raid, and the raid at maximum casting range away from her. Everybody close to her will take AoE damage, so rogues will have to withdraw and bandage from time to time.\nYou will want to apply very high DPS in order to get her to 50% health as soon as possible. Your mages should save mana for AoEing the bat waves. They come once a minute, starting a minute after she is engaged in battle. It is important to kill these bats as quickly as possible or they will eventually swarm the raid.\nIf your mages' mana is very limited, it is possible to keep the mages out of the main combat; place them between the place where she initially stands and the raid, and let them kill the bat waves, and rest between waves. This tactic should not be used while learning the encounter, because it takes away DPS from her and adds complication. It's only advisable for experienced raids where the mages are played by alts or newbies.\nShe will at times charge the closest person in an 8 to 40ish yard range dealing AoE 1k damage and a 5 sec silence. \nKeep a hunter at a shorter distance to her than the rest of the main party, but off to the side and just toss a HoT on him after charges. She also has a fear ability if you cannot maintain control on her.\nWhen her health gets below 50%, she shapeshifts and Phase 2 starts. This should happen before the fourth bat wave (within less than 4 minutes after the pull), else the raid doesn't put out enough DPS. Two bat waves is actually \"normal\", and one is possible if the raid has MC equipment.\nPhase 2.\nAt 50% she goes into caster form. Don't bother keeping her mana drained - you can interrupt/kick/pummel/counterspell her healing. Although you may receive an \"immune\" message, that is an immunity to silence effects, not the counterspell itself. Her heal does require mana, but we have seen her heal with only 125 mana. Having at least 1 person running a boss mod (e.g. CT_Raidassist) helps, as you'll get a warning message anytime she starts to cast a spell. If she manages to get off even a single heal, you'll most likely wipe as she heals for about 20-30%. (~50k hp)\nAs of patch 1.12 she now does a Chain &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; in her human form that can wipe a raid if not counterspelled quickly. That means not only to keep an eye out and counterspell for her great heal, you must also be able to counterspell the chain mind flay.\nShe will eventually start to summon bats that drop bombs on your raid. These bombs hurt and will deal some significant DPS as long as you stay within the fire that results. You can avoid this by having the tank steadily move Jeklik around in a circle. This works because the bombs take 2 seconds to hit the ground after they're dropped, therefore not allowing the bats to aim. As long as the DPS continues, she will fall shortly after.\nIt is a good idea to have Paladins (if you have any) use Devotion aura until the bats with the bombs come, then the Paladins should change to Fire Resistance aura. Shamans should use FR totems in this phase.\nAlternative.\nPosition the MT and melee on the left side of Jeklik's ledge, 30 yards from the wall (in the grass near that tree). The rest of the raid group will group together at max distance another 30 yards from where the MT is. It's best to choose a spot where you can see the MT (and Jeklik) and Jeklik's ledge (where the bats come from) in view at the same time. To start the fight, the MT should go up to the ledge, shoot Jeklik, and then run to the tanking spot. The boss will follow quickly and allow the MT to get his aggro/sunders in quickly. The group should have at least 3 people with a short cooldown interrupt (and a rotation for it), at least 4 AoE, and at least 4 healers. All warriors and rogues should save enough rage/energy to use their interrupt at any time (on heals or on mind flay).\nThe key to the first phase is getting out of the first phase as quickly as possible. When there are no bats, dps the boss hard. When bats do spawn, they need to be gathered tightly together, Frost Nova'ed, and then AoEd down quickly. To make this easier, we have used a triangle formation. 3 people are specifically placed in a triangle, with the tip facing the boss (8 or so toons apart). Healers line up along the back row and everyone else just has to know where that triangle is. When the bats come, EVERYONE who isn't meleeing the boss goes into the triangle to ensure that no bats wander away from the Frost Nova. It also helps to have an armored class (Plate/Mail) get the initial aggro. Once they are Frost Nova'ed, the AoE starts and people can then go back to their spots and the DPS. 1 spawn of bats is ideal, 2 is the goal, 3 is doable, anything more is probably a sign of the strategy not working or of needing more DPS. \nIf you can get the boss to 78-82% health when the first bat wave comes, you are in good shape to only have 2 waves. If you can get the boss to 66-70% health when the first bat wave comes, you are in good shape to only have 1 wave (and will probably have her beaten in 2 minutes or so). The raid caller should watch the boss' health carefully and tell everyone to go all out if the boss can be brought to phase 2 before the next bat wave.\nAt 50%, Jeklik will yell something and turn into a priest form and will not do much for about 10 seconds after this. Everyone should spread out (don't be within 5 yards of any other player) and use up any actions that require being stationary (evocation, FD &amp; drink, rapid fire, etc). After that 10 seconds, Jeklik will periodically try to cast a greater heal (which must be interrupted immediately with kick, shield bash, Counter Spell, etc) and bats will throw fire bombs with increasing frequency. The MT needs to start moving her around in a small oval and the melee needs to be right on top of the MT, to avoid bombs. Everyone else should avoid the bombs and the fires as best as they can. In this phase, if you can stay out of the fires, prevent the greater heals, and maintain high dps, she will fall."}

After the Zandalari pledged to aid the Gurubashi in reaching their former greatness, the Gurubashi began attacking Stranglethorn where Kilnara was personally responsible for sending panthers to attack &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Camp\"&gt;Rebel Camp&lt;/a&gt;. She also sent the panther &lt;a href=\"Mauti\"&gt;Mauti&lt;/a&gt; to attack the hunters at &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Nesingwary's Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilnara seems to spend most of her time cherishing the memory of her sister and becomes enraged when adventurers interrupt her mourning.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When High Priestess Arlokk was killed, the panther loa Bethekk chose her sister, Kilnara, as her new mortal champion. Supporting the recent pact between the Gurubashi and Zandalar tribes, Kilnara has unleashed her savage panther minions on the region's unsuspecting denizens.\"\nAttacks and abilities.\nStage Two: The True Might of Bethekk.\nAt 50% remaining life, High Priestess Kilnara transforms into the Avatar of Bethekk and awakens any remaining sleeping panthers.\nStrategy.\nThis is a two-phase fight: Above 50% Kilnara is a troll, below 50% she is a panther.\nHigh Priestess Kilnara will do relatively light tank damage while in her Troll phase. Her main sources of damage are two interruptable abilities, Shadowbolt and Tears of Blood. If you can only interrupt one, interrupt Tears of Blood if you have any melee (AoE pulse damage). Range should stand out of range of the damage. She will periodically cast Wave of Agony, turning towards someone before unleashing the cast. This cannot be interrupted but can be avoided (large purple wave moving across the floor). Party should be spread out in an arc or ring around her to minimize Wave of Agony damage. At 50% she shifts into a Panther phase doing much increased physical damage, which stacks rapidly over time, as well as unleashing several non-avoidable party-wide damage abilities, including a \"Cave In\" effect on the room. \nSurrounding Kilnara are panther pens each containing four panthers. You must kill these panthers before Kilnara enters Phase 2, as any panthers left alive will come to her aid. The fight is basically not healable if the panthers are up in phase 2. The tank can go around waking up an entire pen and they can be aoe'd down, or if the damage is too heavy you can wake them up one-by-one, but pay attention to the boss health and don't let her hit phase 2 with any panthers up.\nOnce she hits 50% health, blow all DPS cooldowns and try to get her down as fast as possible. Tank and healer should try to save mitigation cooldowns for later in phase 2 because her damage increases over time. Healers should try to be at or near full mana at the 50% mark. Ranged should continue to try to stay at least 20 yards away from the boss, although there is no reason to stay spread out from each other at this point, so group up to maximize aoe heal efficiency. This fight is a dps/healer check (one successful attempt ending with all of the party at ~15% health had 12k HPS overall).\nAn alternate strategy with a well geared Demonology lock is too ignore the panthers until phase 2. This way all panthers wake up and will attack(usually the healer, Threat reduction/HoP is useful). The AoE should be able to kill all the cats within seconds making a much faster kill than the traditional strategy.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This phase lasts approximately one minute.\nHigh Priestess Mar'li\nSpawn of Mar'li\nWitherbark Speaker\nPhase Two: Shadra Form.\nMar'li transforms into a powerful spider, gaining a unique set of abilities while transformed. After approximately one minute she will revert to her Priest form.\nStrategy.\nFor this fight, you need two tanks. To start the fight, have a priest &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; the Speaker and make the Speaker attack Mar'li. At this point four spiders will spawn that need to be AoE'ed down right away. Once the spiders are down, and the Speaker gets pwned by Mar'li, the tank will pick up aggro and all ranged classes should cluster up outside of her AoE range. So set up like this:\n xx\n xx r\n xx OT r BOSS MT\n xx r\n xx\nx = Ranged / Healers\nMT = tank #1 (&lt;a href=\"Main%20tank\"&gt;Main tank&lt;/a&gt;)\nOT = tank #2 (&lt;a href=\"Off%20tank\"&gt;Off tank&lt;/a&gt;)\nr = Rogues\nOnce the tank gets aggro, all melee apart from the OT begin attacking. Periodically, she will shapeshift into a spider form. When she does this, she'll web all the melee around her and wipe their aggro. She'll then charge the ranged group where the other tank will be waiting to pick up aggro and pull her back to the MT position. The OT is now the main tank, and the MT heads back to the ranged group to pick up the next charge. Be sure the ranged stay clustered up, otherwise it will be difficult for the tank to pick her up right away.\nPeriodically, a spider will spawn. If the spider is not immediately killed it will grow larger and more powerful and will wipe the raid. Just call it out and have your ranged deal with them right away, they drop quickly.\nWhen in caster form, Mar'li will attempt to life drain someone. Be sure to immediately counter this with an interrupt ability such as &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. It is sometimes hard to see if she is life draining or not, so pay attention. Do not let her heal herself; it is a significant amount. There is some debate about the usefulness of mana drain. Some claim that it will not prevent her from casting her life drain, but direct experience from others contradicts this.

The dps can either down this quickly and wait for it to respawn (takes about 30 seconds), or have someone kite it around the battle area until the Boss gets to phase two, either option is viable.\nThe phoenix will morph into an egg if it takes enough damage. While in egg form, it regenerates health unless consistently damaged. The phoenix can be neutralized by simply allowing it to remain in egg form, dotting the egg or inflicting some damage on it so it never reaches 100%.\nIn phase two (Repentance), all of the dps needs to keep as much distance from the tank as possible while they kite the Heart of Darkness. A single Soul Fragment reaching the Heart of Darkness will bring the party down by roughly 70k hp. The tank needs to make sure that he is slowly turning and kite in a circle as well. If you get too far from the boss--you will take fall damage when he pulls you back in for phase three.\nAlso, the second phase includes random fire circles all over the ground that you have to avoid.\nIn Hearthstone.\nBarim appears as that can be encountered in the adventure in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Viryx showed much potential to become one of the greatest sages of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, however, her curiosity and rebellious nature proved a great obstacle for that fate. So much that she had usually gotten herself and Iskar into trouble. Although Viryx was always the one responsible for the clutch-brothers' troubles, &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Zelkyr\"&gt;High Sage Zelkyr&lt;/a&gt; had favored her too much to actually give her any real punishment, while her clutch-brother received the brunt of the High Sage's wrath. One afternoon, as they were pursuing a &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;, Viryx and Iskar had stumbled themselves near an &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcast&lt;/a&gt; village. Here they witnessed an Adherent conversing with one of the Outcasts. Despite Iskar's pleas to return to Skyreach, Viryx followed the Adherent, hiding above the trees. The Adherent asked the old Outcast, &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt;, for a scroll. Viryx tried to get closer when the branch she was perched on snapped. Viryx locked eyes with the Adherent for a moment and then he took off. Viryx pursued him and managed to slam him to the ground. The Adherent, revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Ikiss\"&gt;Ikiss&lt;/a&gt;, quickly rose back to his feet and created a ball of flame at his talons, accusing Viryx as a spy of the High Sage. Not long after, four bladetalons were closing in on him, and in panic, pinned Viryx to the ground, telling her that everything she knew of the Talon King, &lt;a href=\"Terokk%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, is a lie. The bladetalons incapacitated him, and Iskar landed beside Viryx, helping her to get up.\nThe clutch-brothers were taken by the bladetalons to the High Sage, where they were given their punishments. He had Viryx locked in her home for 3 days, while her clutch brother was to be whipped with fire for 3 days by the High Sage himself. When she was released, Viryx was anxious to find out more of Ikiss's cryptic words. For two days, she isolated herself from all the others, promising that she would not involve her clutch brother in this. She researched everything she could about Terokk, delving into the forbidden archives of the Adherents of Rukhmar. Unbeknownst to her, Iskar had been spying on her, as ordered by Zelkyr, worrying that she was falling to the Curse of the Outcasts. Iskar had met with Zelkyr after two days and reported his findings. However, he lied about Viryx possibly being cursed. At first, he felt happy that he was able to buy Viryx more time, but he soon realized just how dangerous his actions were. Fearing for Viryx and himself, Iskar flew to Viryx's roost, and demanded an answer for the last two days she was isolating herself.\nIskar told her everything: the High Sage's orders, his spying of her, the Curse of the Outcasts, and his lying to the High Sage. After everything she had heared, she believed that Iskar deserved to know. She told him about what Ikiss had told her and what she's learned so far of Terokk. Finally, she told him about her plans to talk to the Outcast, Reshad, and find out the truth about Terokk. Iskar pleaded with her to forget all of this, but she became so annoyed and betrayed by him that she spoke out against him. Iskar angrily replied that, for once, she should think about the consequences of her actions. About how much they affect others. She retorts, saying that she didn't ask for him to lie for her. They eyed each other for a moment, and seeing the pain in Iskar's eyes, Viryx regretted about what she said, but before she could apologize, Iskar stormed out of her roost.\nOn the day of Ikiss's exile, all the arakkoa gathered at the highest spire to witness his banishment. This was the perfect opportunity for Viryx to travel to the Outcast village, and find out about the truth. Once she entered Reshad's hut, she spoke the words Ikiss said to make Reshad appear. She did so, and Reshad had appeared, surprised that the Adherents' spy had returned. She drew her bone dagger and placed it under Reshad's throat, demanding that he had over the scroll Ikiss was looking for. To her surprise, Reshad had also drawn his dagger, and poised it to her chest. Reshad demanded that she leave or else they will both die. Looking for a way to make him surrender the scroll, she found his &lt;a href=\"Percy\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; fledgeling, and grabbed it, threatening to squeeze the bird to death. In desperation, Reshad gave in and surrendered the scroll to her. Unknown to her, Iskar had been following her, and he pleaded with her to come home. They left the village as soon as possible.\nIn her roost, Viryx and Iskar stared intently, fearing its contents. After a while, Viryx opened the scroll, and they read the truth of Terokk's reign and fall, and the truth of Outcasts' curse. Viryx realized just how much this would change life in Skyreach. She envisioned herself living with the vile and accursed outcasts atop the Spires of Arak. She despised the thought. After a moment of silence, Viryx told Iskar that they should burn the scroll. Iskar was surprised by this and told her not to. She proceeded otherwise, and took the scroll. Iskar tugged at the scroll, and they fought over it. Although Iskar fought hard, Viryx was the stronger of the two, and she threw him of his balance, and burned the scroll. Not long after, a kaliri perched outside Viryx's home screeched. High Sage Zelkyr and some bladetalons flew to her roost and entered, witnessing the aftermath of the fight. Zelkyr had the bladetalons drag Iskar away, while he talked to Viryx. He told her that he knew about everything. Her research on Terokk, Iskar's lying, her plans to go to the outcast village. He had his kaliri spy on them. Viryx questioned him that if he knew everything, why didn't he punish them sooner? Zelkyr told her that he was waiting to see how they would react to the truth, and they reacted just how he knew they would. However, he realized something over the course of these events. He always thought that Viryx would learn her mistakes across her life, when in fact, she must be thought realize these mistakes. Zelkyr ordered the bladetalons to bind Viryx, and had her head covered with a sack.\nZelkyr later had her imprisoned in the most secluded, coldest, and the darkest chamber of Skyreach, where she remained there for what seemed like an eternity. When she was released she was brought to the High Sage's balcony, where she was allowed to bask in the light of the sun. Then, Zelkyr appeared and gave her a scythe. Zelkyr ordered Iskar to be brought forth. Here, Zelkyr gave Viryx a choice: exile her clutch-brother and bask in Rukhmar's glory forever, or join her clutch-brother and the rest of the outcasts below.\nIskar stared at her in anger and hatred. He knew what was to come, and he faced without fear. Finally, Viryx made her choice. Viryx shredded off Iskar's wings and she pushed him off the cliff, and into the Sethekk Pools.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nViryx was the one behind the re-creation of the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and the purging of the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was ultimately slain on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;garrison commanders&lt;/a&gt;."}

Lens Flare will create a large patch of fire under one of the party members. Positioning is important because if the party stacks too close to the center of the arena, it will be much harder to dodge Lens Flare, but if they stack too far apart or close to the edge, it will be harder to save players from being dropped. Viryx should be tanked close to the entrance to keep a good distance between the cliff and the melee. \nViryx will also summon Shield Constructs which spawn at the entrance to the arena. They must be killed quickly and their shield ability interrupted. If the party is going for &lt;a href=\"Monomania\"&gt;Monomania&lt;/a&gt;, the constructs can be safely cc'd by anything that affects mechanical targets.

Despite this, it does not hold any legal authority to compel gnomes to listen to the High Tinker; meaning it serves as a figurehead and representative chosen to speak for the gnomes by virtue of respect. After the departure of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; four hundred years ago, gnomes moved away from monarchy, choosing instead to elect one of their own to the office of High Tinker.\nThe current High Tinker is &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, who has held the office for several decades. After the irradiation of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque led his people from &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, until he led &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces in . From there, the High Tinker continued to lead his people from the surface of Gnomeregan in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, working on steadily reclaiming the subterranean capital. Following the reunion of the gnomish and &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagonian&lt;/a&gt; people, Mekkatorque was declared formally as King of the gnomes, taking the place of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; as a true monarch over the gnomes; though he continues to also hold the title of High Tinker in tandem with his monarchical status.\nElection policies.\nWhile it is unknown how long each term lasts, it appears that one can be elected an unlimited amount of times. Gelbin Mekkatorque, current High Tinker of the gnomes, who was described as having taken the position at a young age, has held the office for several decades; having already been leading the gnomes during the splintering of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. While it is unknown how long a gnome lives exactly, Gelbin holds the appearance of an elderly gnome through his art and in-game depictions. Gelbin is noted to have held the position for a long time due to the faith that his people have in him; though such pressures occasionally led him to question whether or not he should resign to allow another High Tinker to be elected.\nWhen Gelbin was elected High Tinker of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; was infuriated because he thought he should have the position instead, but he kept his feelings secret. Sicco ultimately betrayed Gelbin and the gnomes in time of need during the Trogg invasion, intending to blame the irradiation of Gnomeregan on Mekkatorque; though it did not go as expected.\nIn the RPG.\nThe High Tinker is the highest political office in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, and of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. These men and women hold grand titles (for example \"King of the Gnomes\") but only hold their power for set terms of office, after which they return to the workforce. The ruler holds the seat of the High Tinker. \nMekkatorque's former chief advisor, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, planned on not only becoming \"High Tinker\" but also being the first true \"King of Gnomeregan\" in over four hundred years. He currently controls the halls and &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnomes\"&gt;leper gnomes&lt;/a&gt; of the irradiated city."}

After being given a new physical form, Nikolon was a deeply empathic &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; who found himself unable to let go of his emotions and chose to join the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, rather than endure the pain of ascension. However, after experiencing the horrors of &lt;a href=\"the%20Maw\"&gt;the Maw&lt;/a&gt;, he led many Forsworn back to Bastion and aided in the reuniting of the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nJoining the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nNikolon is initially seen during the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20storyline\"&gt;Bastion storyline&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, where he is among the numerous &lt;a href=\"Vulnerable%20Aspirant\"&gt;Vulnerable Aspirant&lt;/a&gt;s falling prey to their doubts or not wanting or let go of their memories or emotions. &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; apparently speaks to him about joining the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, but the Maw Walker interrupts their conversation. Nikolon's walk back to the Hand of Purity, &lt;a href=\"Eridia\"&gt;Eridia&lt;/a&gt;, is slowed as he expresses his sorrow at the aspirants' languishing in doubt and despair. Eridia asks for the Maw Walker's help in removing Nikolon's doubts. Nikolon initially agrees gladly, but during the ritual, he is shocked at the sheer agony that the cleansing causes, realizing that it is this process that grinds down the aspirant's will, until there is nothing left but despair. Despite destroying the &lt;a href=\"memory\"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; that manifest from his despair, Nikolon's doubts overwhelm him and he becomes sure that the path must be abandoned, leaving the temple to join the Forsworn.\n&lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Chains of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; encounters Nikolon once again in &lt;a href=\"the%20Maw\"&gt;the Maw&lt;/a&gt;. While storming the &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Undying%20Army\"&gt;Undying Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;, Nikolon appears to beg the Maw Walker's aid. It turns out that the Forsworn were unaware of the true extent of the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer's&lt;/a&gt; depravity and were about to be forcibly corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to join the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker and Baroness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; managed to free all the imprisoned kyrian, who fly towards the Zerekriss, intent on returning to Bastion and submitting themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;'s judgment.\nAfter being rescued, Nikolon and the Forsworn regretted their alliance with the Maw and agreed to reunify with the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in hopes for a new path to be made. After Adrestes would become the Paragon of Devotion, with &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt; serving as his Hand, Nikolon spent a moment with &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; taking the opportunity to apologize to Nikolon for recruiting him to the Forsworn. Nikolon told him that he had already lost faith in the Archon by the time Uther showed him \"the truth\", but Uther insisted that Nikolon had suffered because of his actions and that he wouldn't let it happen again. After completing their tasks, Nikolon, Uther, and the Maw Walker helped defend Adrestes from a Mawsworn attack while he used the anima to change the path of the temple and turn it into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Devotion\"&gt;Temple of Devotion&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nI remember you there when I fell, Maw Walker.\nIt is not your fault, nor Uther's fault, nor even Eridia's fault. In fact, it was not my fault, either.\nOne path cannot suffice for eternity. Too often do beings act in specific ways because it is tradition--or how it has always been done--instead of investigating the reason why their predecessors started functioning this way to begin with.\nI acted how I thought was just. Imagine my horror as I saw the truth, witnessed my fellows twisted into Mawsworn. You helped me save everybody we could, but when we arrived here it seemed nothing had yet changed.\nThank you for all you, and your friends, have done. The work is hardly over, but I will help all I can as a disciple of Devotion.\nI will devote all that I am to aid the forsworn and kyrian to find true unity once more."}

After killing Fangcaller Sraka and retrieving Nisha's attack plans, the vulpera and the adventurer escape to the &lt;a href=\"Vulpera%20Hideaway\"&gt;Vulpera Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; using Nisha's &lt;a href=\"Nisha%27s%20Wagon\"&gt;wagon&lt;/a&gt;, with the hero lobbing explosives to hold off the sethrak.\nAt the hideaway, the adventurer reunites with their companion &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt;, and the two eventually leave with &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; to search for &lt;a href=\"Warguard%20Rakera\"&gt;Warguard Rakera&lt;/a&gt;. After finding Rakera, the group continues to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt;, where they once again encounter Kiro and Nisha. Nisha states that she and Kiro are headed to the Faithless empire to put her plan into action.\nWhile the adventurer, Kaja, and Rakera ally with the sethrak &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt;, Nisha, Kiro, Meerah, and other vulpera continue to the Faithless' stronghold in the north to take the fight directly to the sethrak out of &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Vorrik's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Nisha and Kiro work to rescue vulpera slaves while Meerah organizes caravans to carry them to safety. Some time later, the adventurer and Vorrik join up with them, and the hero aids Nisha in freeing and arming vulpera slaves in the &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Crater of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;. Nisha and the freed slaves then aid Vorrik in assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Skycallers%27%20Spire\"&gt;Skycallers' Spire&lt;/a&gt; and she ultimately helps Vorrik and the champion kill the Faithless ruler &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Emperor Korthek&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterward, Nisha can be found along with Kiro and Meerah back at the Vulpera Hideaway, no longer wearing her helmet and weapons. She thanks the adventurer for everything they've done and encourages them to enjoy a moment of rest.\nTides of Vengeance.\nNisha\u2014now known as the \"Fury of the Vulpera\"\u2014is present in &lt;a href=\"Bonetrail%20Gulch\"&gt;Bonetrail Gulch&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, where she sends Horde adventurers to battle &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces attacking vulpera caravans.\nShe was present in &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation.\nJoining the Horde.\nThe vulpera eventually decided to join the Horde in order to explore the world beyond Vol'dun. Nisha and Meerah accompanied Kiro as he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, but Baine was forced to decline giving them membership as troubles facing the Horde's current allies had stretched the faction's resources thin. The vulpera decided to offer their help, with Kiro sending Nisha to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; in order to defend the southern coast against an invasion from the &lt;a href=\"Nazeshi\"&gt;Nazeshi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Dreadpearl%20Shallows\"&gt;Dreadpearl Shallows&lt;/a&gt;, Nisha sent the Horde adventurer to disrupt the Nazeshi's operations and bring down the barrier protecting their leader, &lt;a href=\"Tidecaller%20Nezara\"&gt;Tidecaller Nezara&lt;/a&gt;, after which the two of them worked together to kill Nezara and her &lt;a href=\"Nazeshi%20Tidebreaker\"&gt;tidebreaker bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;, thus containing the threat to the coast. Once all three vulpera completed their tasks and returned to Orgrimmar, Baine realized that he had been wrong to dismiss them so quickly and offered them a place in the Horde, which they gladly accepted. As a member of the Horde, Nisha can subsequently be found standing in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; next to Kiro, Meerah, and &lt;a href=\"Nilsa\"&gt;Nilsa&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nJoining the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Nisha is seen with &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorak\"&gt;Jorak&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Forkriver%20Crossing\"&gt;Forkriver Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. She can also be found participating in Fight Night in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Hoard\"&gt;Dragon's Hoard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nDialogue.\nIf the player kills her opponents at &lt;a href=\"Skycallers%27%20Spire\"&gt;Skycallers' Spire&lt;/a&gt;:\nGossip.\nIf a player kills the Faithless mobs Nisha is fighting at the Skycallers' Spire:\n&lt;Nisha looks around, eyeing everybody she sees up and down.&gt;\nYou think any of these big guys will spar with me?

Nithogg believed that one day he would be more powerful than even the keepers, and refused to be their subject. Instead, he took up roost in the mountain Nastrondir, where he raises his brood and terrorizes the nearby lands whenever the mood strikes him.\"\nOverview.\nOver the course of the encounter, Nithogg uses his powerful breath attack and a muscular tail!

The encounter is an &lt;a href=\"Add%20fight\"&gt;Add fight&lt;/a&gt; which requires dealing with the boss, his adds and the turrets on the train. \nAdventure Guide.\n\"With a zeal for flame and explosives, Nitrogg was a natural fit in the mechanized and weaponized army that Garrosh's plans brought to , and he has risen quickly through the Iron Horde. He oversees the artillery on the Grimrail, and is eager to break through the defenses around Shattrath and conquer the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; within.\"\nOverview.\nAt 60% health, Nitrogg Thundertower retreats to his Assault Cannon at the far end of the train car.

Thundertower hits the tank hard and throws mortars at random party members. Move away from where he throws the mortars. \nPhase 2 begins as Thundertower rides to the front of the train cart, blasts away the walls and begins sending Grom'kar Gunners, Grom'kar Grenadiers, and Grom'kar Boomers at the party. His turret will shoot Suppressing Fire at a random party member, the shots will hurt both the target and those around him/her. Getting behind the various boxes and pillars will block the shots. The turret's health is too high to destroy normally, so the party must loot the dead Boomers, take their mortars, and use the turrets on the side of the train to destroy Thundertower's turret. Use the dead Grenadier's grenades to kill the adds faster and keep the pressure off the tank. \nPhase 3 begins after Thundertower's turret is destroyed by the party's mortars. Thundertower will attack the party once again, this time with more adds spawning. Use your cooldowns and the grenades to finish off the boss.\nTrivia.\nNitrogg is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Nakauchi\"&gt;Paul Nakauchi&lt;/a&gt;."}

Two tanks are required. \nThe Black Ox will periodically use headbutt, knocking the current tank back quite a ways and wiping threat. The second tank should immediately pick up the boss and swap back when he headbutts again. The Oxen Fortitude debuff should not come into play unless the battle drags on. If it does, the healers should be ready for a harder time as the fight progresses due to the increase in health and damage. Niuzao's Massive Quake will deal a large amount of raid-wide damage. There is no way to avoid this and must be healed through. Niuzao will start off charge by running to the middle of the arena, casting for about 3 seconds, and then start rushing around the perimeter of the arena. Avoid the middle of the arena when Niuzao is casting, then stack in the middle. The boss will not hit the raid since he only moves about the perimeter during Charge. "}

Initially facing severe tragedy, she eventually finds the strength to help save Ardenweald from the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; invasion. \nHistory.\nArdenweald storyline.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; begin attacking Heartwood Grove and possessing the fae, Niya manages to resist until an adventurer comes to her aid. She joins the adventurer and Te'zan in battling the possessed forces, attempting to retrieve the anima-rich Heart of the Grove back from the Drust. When they find Wagonmaster Derawyn dying from her wounds, Niya wishes to use the &lt;a href=\"Animacone%20%28Recovering%20the%20Animacones%29\"&gt;animacone&lt;/a&gt;s they found to revive her, but Derawyn refuses, claiming the anima must be used for the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s and would be wasted on her, allowing herself to die.\nNiya then joins the adventurer in slaying the possessed &lt;a href=\"Droman%20Krelnor\"&gt;Droman Krelnor&lt;/a&gt;, but is unsuccessful in saving the Heart of the Grove from turning to ash from the Drust's magic. She begins to weep, knowing that without the Heart's anima, many wildseeds will wither and die. Shell-shocked by the sheer amount of death surrounding her, she is unable to return to &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; without resting for a while. Te'zan volunteers to stay with her until she is okay, asking for her to recount light-hearted stories of her deceased friends to help her through her trauma, which she does.\nAfter taking some time to recover, Niya is asked by &lt;a href=\"Dreamweaver\"&gt;Dreamweaver&lt;/a&gt; to help escort the &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;nightmare-plagued wildseed&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Hibernal%20Hollow\"&gt;Hibernal Hollow&lt;/a&gt; to help it find peace and grow. Dreamweaver lends Niya his harp to play and soothe the wildseed's nightmares. Niya and the adventurer are briefly halted by &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; who are battling the Drust. The adventurer helps in the battle while Niya keeps the wildseed calm. As the battle ends, Ara'lon and his platoon help escort the wildseed. Ara'lon and Niya share their respective tales of tragedy, Ara'lon revealing that he only joined the Wild Hunt recently when &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;his grove&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;spirits under his charge&lt;/a&gt; had to be sacrificed for Adenweald. Both lament that the sacrifices they've made were necessary to ease the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s burden.\nSeeking to take back the anima stolen by the Possessed gathered at Tirna Noch, Ara'lon and Niya travel with the adventurer to battle the Drust forces there. As they fight their way through, they find that the stolen anima has been housed within the Heart of Tirna Noch. While Niya suggests using the anima to revive their dead groves, Ara'lon claims that their groves are truly dead and the Heart must be used to help save the living. After being flown back by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Moonberry\"&gt;Lady Moonberry&lt;/a&gt;, Niya fights in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Hibernal%20Hollow\"&gt;Battle for Hibernal Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, granting speed buffs to players. She follows &lt;a href=\"Droman%20Aliothe\"&gt;Droman Aliothe&lt;/a&gt;'s procession as they bring the dying wildseed directly to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;.

During the reenactment of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Niya played the roll of &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;, initially forgetting her lines.

She resides at &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Kyrestia is wholeheartedly dedicated to the laws of Bastion and is very resistant to change, reacting to evidence that the Path of Ascension may be flawed with indignant anger.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20storyline\"&gt;Bastion storyline&lt;/a&gt;, the Archon and her servants are slow to acknowledge the true threat of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. When her former champion &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; personally leads the Forsworn on an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, Kyrestia finally begins to consider change in Bastion. During the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;, she loses her sacred &lt;a href=\"Sigil\"&gt;Sigil&lt;/a&gt; and is finally willing to unite both the Kyrian Covenant and the Forsworn to create a new Sigil, and to forge a new destiny for Bastion.\nBiography.\nAccording to her brother, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, Kyrestia was \"the first to be borne aloft by wings of duty and service\". Like her fellow &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, Kyrestia was forged by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in their realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20of%20Duty\"&gt;Prototype of Duty&lt;/a&gt; is an incomplete prototype of her.\nKyrestia has ruled Bastion for countless ages and overseen the transforming of the virtuous and valorous into Ascended. Her process critically involved mortal souls to purge themselves of their memories, storing them away, so that they could perform their tasks with objectivity and neutrality. However, this process has long had flaws, as aspirants had to give up their good memories as well as their bad ones. Once upon a time, it was rare that an aspirant would find this process so difficult that they abandoned her path and rejected her. They would become &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, wandering the outer reaches of Bastion, lamenting their failure.\nWhen the Paragon of Loyalty &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; learned from her student &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s memories that an &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; wielding the power of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; was running rampant on a &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;mortal world&lt;/a&gt;, she tried to convince Kyrestia that the path of purging new kyrian of their memories was flawed. Kyrestia interrupted Devos, telling her that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; depended on the kyrian carrying out their charge and that she had to abandon her rebellious course. In response, Devos took matters into her own hands by turning Uther into an Ascended and later convincing him to cast Arthas' soul into the Maw.\nSince then, Devos has been secretly rallying the Forsworn into an army. As the Shadowlands were struck with severe drought caused by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;'s incapacitation, many kyrian, both aspirant and ascended, found themselves without their tasks and contemplated and questioned their decisions. They began to feel that they were giving up their identities arbitrarily, and slowly more and more began to reject the Archon's ways. When they lost their way they would be sent to the Temple of Loyalty, and right into the hands of Devos. Many Forsworn would go further to become &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll this culminated in the Forsworn launching an offensive against Bastion shortly after the arrival of mortal Maw Walkers in the Shadowlands. This initial offensive proved to be part of a strategy created in tandem with the Houses of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;Rituals&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeded to launch a surprise attack against the Temple of Courage as the kyrian were distracted by grappling with the Forsworn.\nSome time later, when Devos and the Forsworn attacked the Spires of Ascension, Kyrestia led the defense while a group of mortal Maw Walkers came to lend their aid. The mortals cut through the Forsworn's forces, eventually arriving in time to prevent Devos from destroying the Archon and, with some small help from her, managed to destroy the corrupted Paragon instead.\nKyrestia was not ultimately enraged at Devos' betrayal, but rather mournful. After seeing that mortals had been the ones to save her and her realm from destruction, she admitted that the path she designed may indeed have been flawed and that once the crisis with the Jailer was ended, there would be much for the kyrian to discuss.\nChains of Domination.\nDuring a discussion between Kyrestia and the remaining Paragons on how to counter the threat of the ever-growing Maw, the Ascended &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt; arrived to tell the Archon that the mortal king &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sought an audience with her. Once the outsider stood in front of her at &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Archon's Rise&lt;/a&gt;, however, Kyrestia realized that Anduin was under the control of the Jailer and demanded that the latter release Anduin from his grasp. In response, the Jailer's voice spoke through his vessel to proclaim that \"He is bound to me, just as you once sought to bind your own brother\". Anduin then used his sword &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt; to stun the Paragons before leaping at Kyrestia and stabbing her through the chest to extract her sigil, a magical key\u2014one of several desired by the Jailer. He subsequently returned to the Maw to deliver the key to his master. The Archon survived the attack.\nApperance.\nKyrestia is an extremely tall kyrian, taller than the average kyrian, she has blue skin, white eyes, braided electric blue hair, and bluish-white wings. She dresses in fine white and gold sacred robes and wears a pointed golden helmet that symbolizes her position as Archon.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They are a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic beings that serve as soul guides whose discipline and duty compels them to safeguard &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s from the mortal realm as they pass into the Shadowlands. They are messengers, couriers, and some of the purest souls in the realm of death. They are the forebears of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;spirit healers&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nBackground.\n\"Those who have lived a life of service are drawn to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to assumed the highest duty of all \u2014 carrying the souls to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst Bastion's gleaming spires and sweeping vistas await challenges to test the mettle of the steadfast kyrians.\"\nThe souls sent to Bastion by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; are ones that have been deemed noble enough and who felt a calling to some form of service in life. The noble kyrian shepherd the souls of the dead to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; so that they can be judged by the impassive Arbiter before being sent to their final destinations.\nKyrian Aspirants.\n\"The origins of our Aspirants are diverse. but they are united in singular purpose here in Bastion: to prove worthy and Ascend so other souls may be carried by their wings.\"\nFresh souls who arrive in Bastion are given new physical forms, for which they become wingless Kyrian Aspirants. They spend eons of training, meditating, and reflecting on themselves through combat and other means to shed their burdens. &lt;a href=\"Anima\"&gt;Anima&lt;/a&gt;-fueled automatons called &lt;a href=\"Centurion\"&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt;s are responsible for drilling Aspirants in meditative combat, but originally all kyrians trained fighting against the fauna of Bastion. As kyrian shed the burdens of their past lives, &lt;a href=\"Memory\"&gt;physical manifestations&lt;/a&gt; of their tormented thoughts are expelled from their bodies. The kyrian must strike these manifestations down in order to cleanse themselves and reach ascendance.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Crucible\"&gt;Aspirant's Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, Aspirants go through a final rite in the Chamber of First Reflection that lets others know they are ready to begin the Five Rites. This initial rite is called the First Cleansing.\nAspirants venture through five temples and learn their virtues: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Courage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Humility\"&gt;Humility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eonian%20Archives\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; (now Devotion) in that order. This journey known as the Five Rites may encompass eons. When aspirants are ready, they will ascend. Kyrestia awaits aspirants at the end of this long road, for it is she who grants aspirants the gift of flight and charges kyrian with their most sacred task. Aspirants shed their memories at the Temple of Purity, the justification for this being that they must ferry souls without judgment. The memories of other worlds and all kyrians are kept within the &lt;a href=\"Eonian%20Archives\"&gt;Eonian Archives&lt;/a&gt;, another name for the Temple of Wisdom, where the former are processed upon arrival into Bastion but the memories of kyrians are collected in the &lt;a href=\"Mnemonic%20Locus\"&gt;Mnemonic Locus&lt;/a&gt;, to be observed within the &lt;a href=\"Walk%20of%20Recollection\"&gt;Walk of Recollection&lt;/a&gt;. The memories of the Archon, Paragons, and Hands are seemingly only viewed in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Vault of the Archon&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple of Humility is a center of instruction on the duties of kyrians. The final step for an aspirant to ascend is to travel to the living world and ferry their first soul. The opening of these portals is done at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Elation\"&gt;Court of Elation&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Exaltion%20Rise\"&gt;Exaltion Rise&lt;/a&gt;, through a ritual that requires lighting four censers of Discipline, Service, Spirit, and Faith.\nAscended.\n\"It is our Ascended [sic] arms that carry the dead from their mortal forms. Our mission is one to service -- carrying souls to Oribos and placing them before the Arbiter.\"\nThe Aspirants who surpass their trials join a higher calling beside &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt;, first among the kyrian, earning their wings and joining the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Ascended\"&gt;Ascended&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, they become ready for an eternity of service as a spirit healer, or one of a couple of other paths. Ascension is done through the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, originally created with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Ardenweald\"&gt;Vessel of Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; within an &lt;a href=\"animacone\"&gt;animacone&lt;/a&gt; through the self-sacrifice of a fae. The new Crest of Ascension was made by &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; using a new vessel, but also the heart of &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; that contains the power of fleshcrafting of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Seal%20of%20Contrition\"&gt;The Seal of Contrition&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; artifact created by &lt;a href=\"Mindscorched%20Alwin\"&gt;Mindscorched Alwin&lt;/a&gt; that purged sins from souls quickly but didn't produce much anima. New Ascended will now contain not only their traditional power of all five temples and the vessel of Ardenweald, but also strength from Maldraxxus and purity from Revendreth. These wings are not impervious however, and other beings such as &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi%20necromancer\"&gt;necromancers from Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; can use their magic to corrode their wings.\nWatchers.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;s are true kyrian called Watchers whose role is to eternally evaluate souls. If the Watchers deem the soul ready, they will call forth a kyrian Bearer to come and bring their soul to the Shadowlands. If they aren't ready, the Watchers return them to life.\nThe Watchers linger at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; and greet mortal souls into the Shadowlands, and are able to weigh that soul by peering into its existence and judge whether it is their time. This burdens the Watcher with that soul's memories, and thus see and know things that weigh heavy in their mind; this role is only for the strong of heart who can endure with the &lt;a href=\"Purpose\"&gt;Purpose&lt;/a&gt; in mind at all times. The Kyrian will know souls, and their deeds, with a gaze of compassion. If the soul is tethered by a sufficiently powerful force, the Watcher nudges the soul back into the mortal plane or the soul is given over to the force that claims it; this includes returning &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; souls to their &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt;, allowing souls to be taken by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, and more. It is the Watcher's gaze that determines when a mortal's existence is fated to end.\nThe Watchers belong to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt;.\nBearers.\nThe Bearers perform the vital task of bearing souls across the Veil to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. They see countless worlds beyond the Shadowlands and encounter beings of all shapes and sizes that will be carried to Oribos to serve the &lt;a href=\"Purpose\"&gt;Purpose&lt;/a&gt;. The Bearers belong to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollectors.\nCollectors are the Ascended who alongside the &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt;s maintain the realm and contribute to all of Bastion's great works. They are responsible for the collection and ordering of anima in Bastion. There are many Collectors, but no two are the same. A Collector may take the form of a &lt;a href=\"Forgelite\"&gt;Forgelite&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; Forgelite Prime &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps a scholar. They craft armor, furnishings, carve statues, build fantastic works of architecture, and write our many stories and songs. They weave masterful works from anima itself. They are great craftsmen and musicians. A Collector will, over the course of their eternity, dedicate themselves to honing their skill and perfecting the arts of their choice. Only they know how to utilize the &lt;a href=\"Anima%20Condenser\"&gt;Anima Condenser&lt;/a&gt;, the key of the centurions. Collectors are based in the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Collectors\"&gt;Terrace of the Collectors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;Eternal Forge&lt;/a&gt;. The Collectors belong to the &lt;a href=\"Eonian%20Archives\"&gt;Temple of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nParagons and Hands.\nEach of the five temples is presided over by a Paragon. These ancient beings demonstrate the ultimate expression of their respective virtue and are responsible for the care and training of all aspirants that enter their domain. Each is bolstered by their chosen Hand, selected for their excellence in service to their temple.\nParagons can choose to personally train aspirants if they wish. However, such hands-on work is considered beneath their station and at best, a highly unusual action.\nForsworn.\n\"Determination is the key to inspiring others to follow. Faithless are those who quit the field when the way ahead becomes darkest.\"\nRarely, an Aspirant will fail to complete a rite of passage and darken into one of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, who wander the plains of Bastion to lament and can spread doubt like a disease if left unchecked. Aspirants who fall into doubt, are unwilling to part with their memories, or fail to meet the Archon's standards otherwise and cannot achieve ascension change and have their skin and hair darken from bright azure blue to darker purple. Normally, the Aspirant is able to return to their purified state, but if they cannot, they are exiled from Bastion and the Arbiter judges them again.\nMany of the ascended who once served Bastion have become Forsworn and have wholly turned against all that the kyrian stand for.\nWhile kyrian aspirants had to wait patiently during the anima drought for their overdue ascension, the Forsworn have been unafraid to grant their faithful wings.\nMawsworn.\nEven the most sinful souls, who had failed to find redemption in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; and are cast into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for eternity, or were sent there directly by the Arbiter, are transformed into Maw-corrupted kyrian after pledging their allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; or been forcibly corrupted by the Maw and &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, thus joining the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEons ago &lt;a href=\"Agthia\"&gt;Agthia&lt;/a&gt;, Paragon of Courage led the kyrian to save all of Bastion and the Shadowlands from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;'s attempted invasion of the Shadowlands. Similarly, eons ago the first Paragon of Humility &lt;a href=\"Mercia\"&gt;Mercia&lt;/a&gt; fell after an invasion of &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s so great that they were forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and Mercia sacrificed herself.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; gazed into the Shadowlands, he was inspired by the kyrian to create the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent upheaval.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; was put into a slumber, souls begin to plunge into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and an upheaval begins to doom the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Scores of aspiring kyrian find themselves unable to continue their journey to ascension. Their numbers are now dwindling, and their duty to ferry souls to eternity is in jeopardy.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and the shattering of the veil between the Shadowlands and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; kyrian entered Azeroth and took king &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; and other leaders of Azeroth to the Maw. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; are emboldened and are made new minions of &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt; by a message brought by &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Soulbearer\"&gt;Mawsworn Soulbearer&lt;/a&gt;s raise undead bosses in Icecrown.\nA schism is torn in the ranks of the kyrian by The Jailer's schemes. &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; fell into rebellion after being overwhelmed by doubt from &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s troubling past, she listened to the Jailer's words and is aided in her rebellion by the darkest powers of the Shadowlands. She has the goal of the destruction of the Archon and for the Forsworn to forge a new path for Bastion.\nThe Mawsworn hold Forsworn &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Forsworn\"&gt;captive&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Perdition%20Hold\"&gt;Perdition Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the Maw, transforming them against their will. Normal kyrian are drowned in by &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; until they break and join the Mawsworn's ranks."}

Players learn the functions of their new base of operations in &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, make a quick run to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for some souls, and became soulbinds with the aspirant &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing Our Eternal Charge, in addition to continuing the main campaign, Adrestes also sends players back to Oribos in &lt;a href=\"The%20Highlord%20Calls\"&gt;The Highlord Calls&lt;/a&gt;, starting the Torghast storyline.\nTrial of Ascension.\nAt Renown 5:\nPlayers are asked to aid Kleia in her final trial on the path to ascension, where they witnessed the last moments of a life, before escorting them to the Shadowlands. Kleia became an Ascended, as well as the Maw Walker's second soulbind, but a Forsworn attack on Elysian Hold led by Uther interrupted the ceremony and damaged the Crest of Ascension.\nThe Paragon of Loyalty, Devos, was as the leader of the Forsworn, and the champion helped repel her final assault and defeat her once and for all within the Spires of Ascension.\nPhaestus, Genesis of Aeons.\nAt Renown 7:\nWithout the Crest of Ascension, no new kyrian Ascended can be created. Players traveled to the Eternal Forge with Mikanikos, Forgelite Prime of Bastion, to recover the legendary hammer Phaestus and build the Crest anew.\nHowever, the great forge was under Forsworn control, and in repelling the threat the adventurer helped Mikanikos finish Bron, a modified goliath that proved instrumental in pushing the enemy back to the Temple of Loyalty. With the hammer in hand, the Maw Walker successfully rebuilt the Crest of Ascension.\nRighteous Retribution.\nAt Renown 10:\nAlexandros Mograine of Maldraxxus visited Elysian Hold with an offer to join forces in order to take out the depraved Margrave Gharmal who led the surprise attack on the Temple of Courage.\nThe Maw Walker and Xandria met Alexandros aboard the Zerekriss necropolis, then staged a large-scale assault on the Margrave's forces in the House of Constructs to draw him out. After defeating him, Xandria carved out the fleshshaper's heart. The Crest of Ascension was infused with the heart's essence, greatly increasing its power.\nThe Seal of Contrition.\nAt Renown 12:\nSpurred on by the success in Maldraxxus, the Maw Walker, Kleia, and Pelagos traveled to Revendreth to seek further empowerments for the Crest of Ascension. The Curator knew of a potential target in the Seal of Contrition and had the player obtain its whereabouts from the Countess. She sent players to the Ember Ward where Alwin, the former holder, escorted the Maw Walker to the Seal's current holder, Duke Vielle. Players killed the Duke, recovered the Seal, and brought it back to Elysian Hold to insert into the Crest.\nA Vessel of Ardenweald.\nAt Renown 16:\nIn search of a vessel to contain the power of the Crest, the adventurer and Pelagos traveled to Ardenweald to request aid from the Winter Queen. The faerie Willowblossom volunteered to aid the party in their journey of preparing a vessel to hold Ardenweald's power.\nAfter saving the worm Grubby from spriggan tricksters and obtaining the necessary ingredients for the ritual, the Maw Walker realized that Willowblossom would become the vessel, giving her life in the process. Her sacrifice was not in vain, as by placing the Vessel in the Crest of Ascension it became fully empowered and protected from future attack.\nClosing In.\nAt Renown 19:\n&lt;a href=\"Kyrian\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt; scouts tracked &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;, the new leader of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Humility\"&gt;Temple of Humility&lt;/a&gt;. Players and &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt; intervened, saving kyrian from being overtaken by pride and using the Paragon of Humility's legendary blade, Compassion, to push back the Forsworn occupation.\nAs players arrived at Lysonia and Chyrus's location, Helya opened a portal allowing Lysonia and &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; to escape into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Players and Kleia pursued her, ultimately facing a powerful &lt;a href=\"manifestation\"&gt;manifestation&lt;/a&gt; of Lysonia's pride after she betrayed Uther in a dark ritual. Players escorted Uther out of the Maw and then parted ways to prepare for the final assault on Lysonia.\nThe Bell Tolls.\nAt Renown 21:\nWith the final assault on the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; citadel in the &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Temple of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; at hand, you called the Paragons to form a plan and rallied the kyrian to action. The combined might of the Archon's forces assaulted the Temple from all sides, until Lysonia revealed that she had drawn the kyrian away from &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Archon vulnerable.\nYou rushed back to the hold to defend the Archon, where Lysonia unleashed the full extent of her Maw power. Uther arrived to aid in defeating his former master, turning the tide of the battle until the Archon could deal the final blow.\nUther was granted clemency for his efforts, and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Temple of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Thenios\"&gt;Thenios&lt;/a&gt; to delve further into his unique ailment."}

To prevent the Orcs from launching any more surprise attacks upon the citizens of Grand Hamlet, the Humans began their search for the Orcs' hidden encampment located somewhere within the boggy marshlands of the swamp.\nInitial sightings of the Orcish forces revealed that the Orcs were employing a new type of unit called a &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;. This magical user was capable of harnessing dark &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magicks&lt;/a&gt; to raise the fallen corpses of his brethren into &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead\"&gt;undead warriors&lt;/a&gt; to fight on behalf of the Orcish armies. Fortunately, however, the Human forces brought along with them a company of &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s to aid in their mission. The clerics provided valuable healing assistance and support to the Human &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s fighting against the Orcs. After several hours of scouting and clashes with the Orcs, the Humans stumbled upon the Orcish outpost of Kyross and proceeded to raze it to the ground, along with the wicked &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned%23First_War\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; where the Orcish Necrolytes practiced their unholy and twisted &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magicks&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuide.\nThis missions introduces you to:\nJust like the last mission, you will need to build and expand a base to include a Barracks and (if you want the additional support) a Lumber Mill for the ranged Archers and a Church for Clerics. Since Clerics have to be manually selected for Healing, a good ratio is one Cleric for every 4 attack units on the field.\nStart with the Gold Mine to the south of the base. Send your Peasants there and begin training more Peasants. There is a fair bit of walking between the mine and the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; , so you will want several Peasants trained to ensure a good supply of gold (Without resources, it will be difficult to keep up with. Keep a couple Peasants harvesting lumber, since you will need plenty for Archers and &lt;a href=\"Farm%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Farms&lt;/a&gt;. If your mine runs out of gold, there are addition Gold Mines to the west and to the north, just around the creek. Neither one is guarded, but you should bring along an escort of Footmen, Archers and a Cleric while placing them in the line of fire (Peasants have a higher priority rating, meaning enemy units will always target them before anything else when chance allows).\nWith a strong economy, get your Barracks going and train Footmen to replace units you have lost, then get a Lumber Mill for Archers and (at least) one Church so you produce Clerics, have them heal combat damage and keep your units alive. When you have raised a large army or at least 15 troops, send them to the middle to the map and try to use a unit to lure enemies to your forces (If you try to rush in with everything you have, the enemy will cut your forces to pieces, even if you outnumber them). If everything works out well, they will bring enemies to your ambush where your superior range can engage and defeat them as they approach. When no more enemy units show up, advance closer to the base and use another lure. After a couple times, you should be close enough to move your forces to the enemy base and start working on their production. If you have Footmen, bring them as well; they do a LOT more damage to buildings than your Archers can. \nTo keep the enemy from building replacement units while you destroy their base, take out the Barracks, first. This will go a long way to keeping your guys alive. Next, destroy the Temple (for the same reason). Send a couple units around the base perimeter to look for Peons while you concentrate your efforts on the Town Hall. Once destroyed, the enemy AI goes into a panic mode. This has the following effect.\nOnce every enemy building is destroyed and every enemy unit is dead, the mission ends in victory.\nThere are no specific units for these waves; it is a matter of what random units are trained at the &lt;a href=\"Barracks_%28WC1_Orc%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple_%28WC1_Orc%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and what is available when they meet up at a rally point. The base has two rally points; southwest of the base (Used over 90% of the time) and northeast. On occasion, they will train extra units and will send more than one wave at a time from different directions.\nThe Easy Way.\nThe sooner you can get this map done, the less larger number of waves you will have to deal with. Send your peasants to the Gold Mine south of the base and get to training. Once you have trained two more, get a Farm going, then resume training as resources and food allows. You will (eventually) want around 10: 6-7 for gold and 3-4 on lumber. Eventually, once you have enough farms for 25-30 units, move a couple Peasants over to gold; keep enough lumber coming in for Archers.\nSend your archers to scout around the creek, but avoid the northwest corner of the map: That is where the enemy base is located. Also watch for Gold Mines near that base; they are guarded by Grunts and Spearmen. The first attack (A single unit, likely a Grunt or Spearman) will come from either direction. Arrange your token force to max. out your damage potential and minimize how much you will take in return; you need to keep these units alive for as long as you can. The next several waves of two units will (usually) include a Necrolyte, which is not a heavy threat to your forces, but can still inflict damage if given the chance to.\nOnce your barracks is up, produce another Footman or two, but push to get the &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Lumber Mill&lt;/a&gt; up so you can start training Archers. If you are starting to hover resources, construct a second Barracks and use it to pump out additional combat units. Cover both the north and west ends of the base until you have a nice row or Archers. Research (at least) the first arrow upgrade to help greatly improve the Archer's biggest problem: lack of Damage per second. If you feel your resources allow for it, you can build a &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Church&lt;/a&gt;, research &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; and starting producing Clerics, but this mission can be won without them (especially with the initial investment of over 2000 resources just to get things started that could be spent elsewhere).\nThe best way for handling the enemy forces is already stated above. With a dozen archers (minimum) and a few Footmen to help destroy buildings, position your forces just outside their base and use an Archer to lure the enemy forces into your ambush. With their considerable combat acquisition range, it should not be much trouble to bring them to your setup. Expect to take some losses, but with your Archer's range advantage, you should have little trouble taking them out.\nBefore the enemy has a chance to pump out replacements, bring your Archers and Footmen to the base, engage whatever straggler forces remain, then take out the Barracks., followed by the Temple and then the Town Hall. If you can afford to, leave Footmen on each spot where a building was destroyed to prevent surviving Peons from spawning a construction site at their position. Clear out the remaining Peons hanging around (There are no more than 4 near the base) while your forces finish off the Lumber Mill and Farms."}
