He continued to sell his questionable goods outside of Shattrath, at the city's south-western entrance from &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, asking players who pass by about the state of his stall. Peacekeeper Jadaar was standing guard outside Griftah's stall, while the troll's inventory was examined by &lt;a href=\"Asric\"&gt;Investigator Asric&lt;/a&gt;. However, when &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; was re-discovered, Griftah was let back into Shattrath selling his old goods, and sells a &lt;a href=\"Hula%20Girl%20Doll\"&gt;Hula Girl Doll&lt;/a&gt; necessary in crafting the &lt;a href=\"Turbo-Charged%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Turbo-Charged Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt;, the epic flying mount created by engineers.\nGriftah now has another chance to find customers during the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;. He can be spotted near the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Boardwalk\"&gt;boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; by a wagon.\nGriftah found his way to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Grummle%20Bazaar\"&gt;Grummle Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. He offers the original items he sells in Shattrath, plus the &lt;a href=\"Problem-Solving%20Pendant\"&gt;Problem-Solving Pendant&lt;/a&gt;.\nGriftah traveled on to , where he managed to sell some of his more useless junk to garrison troops in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a href=\"Tracking%20Griftah\"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt; to rough him up a bit in order to get a refund back.\nRogues can summon him through &lt;a href=\"Secretive%20Whistle\"&gt;Secretive Whistle&lt;/a&gt; and do &lt;a href=\"Da%20Big%20Score\"&gt;Da Big Score&lt;/a&gt;.\nGriftah is found in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and later also at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nGriftah traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, where he sells his wares at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was present in &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation. After &lt;a href=\"Mutinous%20Zanchuli%20Devout\"&gt;Mutinous Zanchuli Devout&lt;/a&gt;s attacked, he was sitting with a &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Speaker\"&gt;Revantusk Speaker&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Speaker\"&gt;Shatterspear Speaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nSomehow Griftah has made it across the veil to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where he has set up in the &lt;a href=\"Broker%27s%20Den\"&gt;Broker's Den&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nGriftah traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and is found selling amulets and other goods on the sly, at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Throne\"&gt;Obsidian Throne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nSells.\nHis standard inventory:\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive inventory:\nGriftah's exile from Shattrath City.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.2.0\"&gt;patch 2.2&lt;/a&gt;, Griftah was exiled from Shattrath City as a result of fraudulent activities.\nThe reactions of the players were varied, with some happy with the change while others were disgusted of what they think was Blizzard taking this action due the complaints by players who had got \"grifted\" (and perhaps because they would lose the opportunity of visiting his stall to hear his funny conversations with Peacekeeper Jadaar). \nHowever, his creator, World Designer &lt;a href=\"Kisirani\"&gt;Kisirani&lt;/a&gt;, answer the following to one of these claims:&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D1778033830%26amp%3BpostId%3D17777957535%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%2325\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nI can say with the utmost confidence that you are incorrect. There is no ret-con occurring here, and the changes to Griftah were not done as a result of player or GM complaints. I assure you, had that been the case, his amulets would likely have been removed entirely rather than merely relocating the NPC.They were done in the interest of making the world a bit more interesting, and from the vast majority of responses, it appears that motivation is a success.Wait and see. :)\nKisirani later explained: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinsider.com/2007/09/26/the-real-griftah-story/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nIt's a shame you're unwilling to believe what is, in essence, the truth\u2014that Griftah has been a small foray in progressive content as we gauge certain things.I'm the person behind making the content. I've no reason to deceive you.It's one of the goals of my job, at the heart of it, to make the world feel more alive. The larger parts of it primarily contain holiday content and world flavor; this was a small bit of the latter.\nGriftah was seen in Shattrath City again in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3.0\"&gt;patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nOld location (Shattrath).\nCheck &lt;a href=\"Peacekeeper%20Jadaar\"&gt;Peacekeeper Jadaar&lt;/a&gt; for some of his conversations with him.\nDuring his exile from Shattrath.\nNow, I know what ya be thinkin'. Ol' Griftah's in a spot of trouble. This be nothin'. I still got a lotta my stock on me, so c'mere and check out what I got.\nReturn to Shattrath.\nAhaha, ya see this? Griftah's BACK!

It has great walls and spires that reach toward a steel-gray sky, but the stronghold's bulk is underground. It was founded by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and later seized by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s as a prison for &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, but during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; this place is once more a war area with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult using it as a military base.\nHistory.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nAfter losing the civil war between the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; and his own clan, &lt;a href=\"Khardros\"&gt;Thane Khardros&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; led his people north through the barrier gates of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, and founded their own kingdom within the mountain of Grim Batol.\nFollowing years of bitterness after the war, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; of the Dark Irons launched a two-sided attack against the other dwarven clans from his city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Thane led his own forces against the Bronzebeard capital &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, while his sorceress wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, led forces against the Wildhammer's Grim Batol, in hopes they could wrest the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThaurissan's forces battled deep into Ironforge, but eventually the Bronzebeard dwarves successfully forced them from the city. While his forces retreated to Redridge, Modgud's war golems were breaking through the gates of Grim Batol. In order to further decimate the forces inside, before the gates were even down, she placed a curse on Grim Batol. She used the powers of her blade, &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, to call upon the shadows from the earth to attack the dwarves in their own fortress. The Wildhammers fought back viciously against the assaulting Dark Iron forces and living shadows. Thane Khardros rallied his remaining warriors to push through the invading onslaught \"with the single-minded focus of a war golem, only coming to a stop when he found Modgud\". Her blade was inexplicably absent when she reached for it, and Khardros struck her down with one mighty blow from his hammer.\nThe Wildhammers chased the retreating Dark Iron forces out of the city, and the few who had retreated deeper were later twisted into the &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt; by Xal'atath's curse. Leaderless, the remaining Dark Irons on the surface began a hasty retreat to Redridge only to be intercepted by the Ironforge armies headed to assist Grim Batol. Modgud's remaining forces were crushed between the Wildhammer and Bronzebeard armies, who then turned south towards the Redridge Mountains to finish off Thaurissan's remaining forces.\nFollowing the Sorcerer-Thane's quick and unintentional self-destruction in summoning &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Fire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer dwarves returned to their home of Grim Batol. But they found that Modgud's curse had left an evil taint in their fortress, and Grim Batol was uninhabitable. Ironforge offered them a home, but the Wildhammers refused, the majority of them turning north to settle in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they founded their new capital of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, while the rest settled in the region of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, not far from their cursed former home.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Grim Batol became the primary base of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; refining operations in Khaz Modan. The &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refineries&lt;/a&gt; were protected by the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, and after a personal inspection &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; declared that they were well maintained and fulfilling their quotas.\nThe mountain fortress itself was the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nGrim Batol was also the main base of the Horde's dragon breeding program, where &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the red &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, was kept captive and forced to produce &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to be used as mounts for &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; dragonriders. The Horde used the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; and Dark Iron chains to control the red brood. Grim Batol remained in orc hands long after the collapse of the Horde and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, largely due to the power of their dragons. Eventually, thanks to the efforts of Bronzebeard fighters and a band of unlikely heroes led by the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza was freed. The dragon queen immediately set about incinerating every orc she could find, utterly destroying the power of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; (in Azeroth) and killing her former captor &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the Battle of Grim Batol, most assumed that the fortress' evil legacy had been eradicated. However, the dwarves sensed that a darkness still permeated the mountain and so left shortly after the orcs' defeat. Alexstrasza and her consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; decided that it was the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s duty to seal off Grim Batol and sent red dragonkin forces to stand guard around the mountain and prevent anyone from entering.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Grim Batol was initially a subzone in the southeastern Wetlands. The fortress itself was inaccessible, consisting solely of a mountain road leading to a massive, closed door. The surrounding area was populated by various elite level 60+ red dragonkin and &lt;a href=\"Axtroz\"&gt;Axtroz&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty &lt;a href=\"red%20drake\"&gt;red drake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entrance was at , where one followed a path curving south to get to it at . It was inadvisable to try to enter from southeast Wetlands near its position on the map; one must take the north entrance, as there is a cliff wall.\nThe ruins of the orc caravan that tried to escape the fortress can still be seen strewn around the entrance and along the road outside of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight of the Dragon.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, corruption seeping from Grim Batol caused some of the red dragonkin forces to fall ill, with some even dying or going so mad that they had to be put down by their kin. The red flight finally did as all others had before them and abandoned the fortress. The taint from the cursed mountain gradually spread into the Wetlands, corrupting some of the wildlife.\nUnbeknownst to the outside world, &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s consort, moved into the citadel shortly after the red dragons left and used the tunnels to conduct experiments on dragon eggs she had collected over the centuries, leading to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Korialstrasz sensed something happening within the mountain and discovered Sinestra's efforts. Ultimately, thanks to Korialstrasz' allies, the sacrifice of the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, and the anger felt by &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; towards his \"mother\", Sinestra and her creation were defeated. However, Deathwing later continued his fallen consort's work.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, a sinister cult led by Cho'gall who worshiped Azeroth's malefic &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, allied with Deathwing and claimed the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; as its base of operations. The &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; drove off the agents of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who guarded Grim Batol (now at ) so that it may be used as a fortress for training Deathwing's minions.\nThe halls of Grim Batol run so deep into the highlands that it is unknown to what twisted end the Twilight's Hammer is using this doomed dwarven marvel.\nThe red dragonflight joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; for a unified attack on the ancient stronghold and ripped it free from the clutches of the Twilight's Hammer. The army within was led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Umbriss\"&gt;General Umbriss&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrim Batol is now considered part of the new &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; zone and features as a 5-man dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nAfter the defeat of the Twilight's Hammer, Grim Batol was yet again abandoned. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; led her Dragonmaw clan to the fortress to use it as a base of operations, with the warlord herself operating out of the room where Alexstrasza was tortured. After she succeeded in helping &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; escape his trial at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, Zaela, &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; briefly returned to the fortress.\nZaela later met her demise in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the ownership of Grim Batol unclear.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, it was rumored that the twilight dragonflight still existed within Grim Batol. This was confirmed when the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Eryna\"&gt;Eryna&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in the mountain had kept digging\u2014far deeper and further than even the red dragonflight thought possible\u2014and unearthed thousands of hidden twilight dragon eggs. Eryna later noticed more and more members of the twilight flight coming and going from the citadel and concluded that the flight was mobilizing at someone's command. Ultimately, the dragon &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; led the twilight dragonflight in swarming the nearby &lt;a href=\"Wyrms%27%20Bend\"&gt;Wyrms' Bend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Pass\"&gt;Dragonmaw Pass&lt;/a&gt; and launching an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; repelled the attack and defeated Vexiona near the entrance to Grim Batol, forcing her to retreat.\nSections.\nJust like &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, Grim Batol is a massive, multi-tiered underground city with many bridges and sections. While not depicted this way in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol%20%28instance%29\"&gt;the dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, the city spreads throughout all the mountain, as towers and other dwarven architecture can be seen spreading out from the other sides of the mountain Grim Batol is built inside of.\nIn its current state, several sections of the city have collapsed and something has cut an entire terrace down, exposing molten stone. \nNPCs.\nBefore the Cataclysm, the following &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; could be found around Grim Batol's entrance:\nIn the RPG.\nMembers of the red dragonflight were left behind to keep watch over and command Grim Batol, and for years they successfully guarded its desolate halls from further intrusion, citing that they were \"guarding a secret that living creatures are not meant to know.\" The red wyrm &lt;a href=\"Garshilan\"&gt;Garshilan&lt;/a&gt; leads the fortress' defenses, aided by the young &lt;a href=\"Acridistrasz\"&gt;Acridistrasz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baleflame\"&gt;Baleflame&lt;/a&gt;. A flight of red dragons now commands Grim Batol. The dragons guard a secret power within the fortress and let no one near.\nAlexstrasza the Life-Binder herself was involved with Grim Batol, making her too busy to do things such as work on rejuvenating the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Grim Batol was a ruined &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; base from the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; which still contained an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Temple of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall had to learn some &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;dark magics&lt;/a&gt; inside the Temple of the Damned and the Altar of Storms was used as a meeting points for the scattered clans of the Horde.\nIt was said to be in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; of Khaz Modan.

Seeing a chance to strike a decisive blow against the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Lord Lothar&lt;/a&gt; has ordered that you infiltrate Grim Batol and put an end to all Orcish activity there. Once Grim Batol has been destroyed, Lothar believes that the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s will have no further use for Khaz Modan, thus pulling their forces back to the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Victory could secure the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and greatly impede the Horde offensive.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nMilan's forces landed as close to Grim Batol as possible. From there they would have to march south, leaving the workers and &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s behind for safety. As they proceeded, they were disturbed to discover two enemy catapults, fortified behind a wall and guarded by several orcs. Swearing oaths to all the Gods, they steeled themselves and rushed directly toward them. Milan believes the Gods heard their prayers that day, for the catapults were unmanned, and after killing the guards, they broke through the wall and claimed them. Continuing south, they destroyed an enemy tower with the Horde's own war machines and claimed yet another catapult. Only then did they summon transports and &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s south to join them, following which their force boarded ship to land on the other side of the river. This time they swept northward, careful to remove enemy towers with the catapults, and soon leveled all the foul orcish structures so that they could raise their own.\nThey quickly erected a &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; near a &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; to the north and began collecting resources. Milan's commander was planning to build &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s for the attack, so a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Elven%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; and a shipyard were needed as soon as possible. While the shipyard was being built, they decided to place a refinery at the southeastern tip of a small peninsula, conveniently near an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Patch\"&gt;oil patch&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Oil%20tanker\"&gt;tankers&lt;/a&gt; had been build to exploit it, a &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; was raised near the shipyard, which provided the heavy &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s and armor for battleships. Unfortunately, the mine was running dry, so they built a transport to ferry workers across to another nearby mine and a temporary town hall near it to collect the resources. Finally, construction of battleships began; they spent their extra time and gold to develop better cannons and armor to ensure their success.\nAt last they had six tall battleships with which to attack and sailed them south into enemy territory. They made quick work of the enemy vessels that tried to stop them. Ignoring the &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt;s and refineries for a time, they then concentrated on removing the towers and catapults that guarded them. As the Horde watched helplessly, they began pounding their structures; soon they were forced to surrender to their might.\nAftermath.\nWhile Milan's unit had some success at destroying the surface structures around Grim Batol as well as its refineries, forcing the Horde units to surrender, they had failed to clear the Horde forces that were stationed in the underground portions of the city. Grim Batol would not be captured until after the Second War.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; complex located in the northwestern portion of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nHeroes brave enough to infiltrate the brooding depths of the stronghold must confront &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s agents to thwart the mysterious evil within. With the reemergence of Deathwing into the world of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and Twilight's Hammer cult have driven the red dragons away, and converted the dwarven-forged stone halls into a training ground. Grim Batol has once again become a battlefront.The &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has begun to assault the gates of Grim Batol from the air, but their assault is jeopardized by the black dragons, who fight back with characteristic intensity and viciousness. If the red flight doesn't receive support soon, the battles raging around Grim Batol will calm at last - and the fortress will rest firmly in the grasp of evil.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Don't be fooled by Grim Batol's humble exterior; many of this mountain fortress's desecrated chambers are buried deep in the Twilight Highlands. Once the stronghold of the Wildhammer dwarves, and later seized by orcs as a prison for Alextrasza,[sic] the city is now in the clutches of the Twilight's Hammer cult. Heroes brave enough to infiltrate the brooding depths of the stronghold must confront Deathwing's agents to thwart the mysterious evil within.\"\nAnnouncement.\n\"During a &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;bloody civil war among the three dwarven factions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;s ousted the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; clans from the ancient corridors of the mountain city. In the wake of the defeat, the Wildhammers ventured north and forged a new home, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, in the mountains of what is now the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. However, although they worked tirelessly to create a better future for themselves, the Dark Irons, who established the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, could not move beyond the memory of their defeat. Consumed by the desire for revenge and desperate to control the entire dwarven region of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Irons led a two-pronged assault on the Bronzebeards in Ironforge and the Wildhammers in Grim Batol. Despite their past differences, these two embattled rivals joined forces and drove the Dark Irons out of Khaz Modan, decimating the armies of the treacherous clan's sorcerer-thane, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. Yet victory carried grave consequences. Although Thaurissan's wife and queen, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, was slain during the attack on Grim Batol, her death tainted the mountain fortress. While the Bronzebeards rebuilt their glorious city of Ironforge, the Wildhammers felt forever changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They fled their cursed home and never returned.\"\n\"The abandoned city's defiled corridors later became home to a number of nefarious plots. When the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; and used to force &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s drakes to serve the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Grim Batol acted as the red &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;'s torturous prison. The Dragonmaw held Grim Batol through the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, before they were driven out by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, who planned to steal Alexstrasza's eggs. Yet as Deathwing carried out his plan, the Demon Soul was destroyed, and the powers locked within were returned to Alexstrasza, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. Deathwing narrowly escaped an assault by the four re-empowered Dragon Aspects, although he did not leave empty-handed; in his grasp were the eggs of Alexstrasza. For their vile transgressions, the fleeing Dragonmaw were shown no mercy, and the struggle came to a quick end. Members of the red dragonflight were left behind to keep watch over Grim Batol, and for years they successfully guarded its desolate halls from further intrusion... until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, a sinister cult who worshipped &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s malefic &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"The cult, seduced by Deathwing's thirst for absolute domination over Azeroth, has claimed the Twilight Highlands as its base of operations. The &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has driven off the agents of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who guarded Grim Batol so that it may be used as a fortress for training Deathwing's minions. The halls of Grim Batol run so deep into the highlands that it is unknown to what twisted end the Twilight's Hammer is using this doomed dwarven marvel.\"\n\"Called to action by the red dragonflight in the Twilight Highlands, players will be charged with putting a decisive end to the foul machinations developing within the level-85, 5-player dungeon of Grim Batol. The ferocity of the enemies within should not be underestimated, and with the assistance of brave Red Drakes and a handful of explosives, players can thin the ranks of Grim Batol's occupiers through bombing flights into the ruined city's corridors. Regardless of how successful these attacks might be, &lt;a href=\"General%20Umbriss\"&gt;General Umbriss&lt;/a&gt; will not allow his army to fall so quickly. In the end, adventurers will be left to their own devices, venturing into the darkest recesses of the dwarven fortress, where a nightmarish enemy is taking shape. Will you be able to uncover Grim Batol's secrets and emerge unscathed, or will your destiny be sealed within this tortured city, like so many brave heroes before you?\"\nGeography.\nThe first goal when assaulting Grim Batol will be to launch a bombing run through the halls, in order to thin the massive forces deployed by the Twilight's Hammer within the fortress. To get there, a few pulls will be necessary, but the path will be obvious - specifically, five red drakes caught in nets. After clearing the groups from around the drakes, cut them free and each player should mount up. Once mounted, the bombing run will commence almost immediately. The flight path is set - players cannot deviate. The bombing run will allow the group to damage various groups of NPCs in the first (Umbriss') and third (Drahga's) sections of the dungeon. Try to focus fire as much as possible in order to minimize pulls. It should be noted that unlike all other instances, in the event the group dies, these NPCs do not regenerate health.\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Throngus\"&gt;Forgemaster Throngus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Drahga%20Shadowburner\"&gt;Drahga Shadowburner&lt;/a&gt; respectively, if you should run back in from the &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, mounting a drake will fly you to the area of the last boss your group has done, namely &lt;a href=\"Khardros%27%20Anvil\"&gt;Khardros' Anvil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Scarred%20Terrace\"&gt;Scarred Terrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

A jovial brewer, he liked to give clues to his original quests by speaking in rhymes.

The two drank many cups of each others' beer, draining many a Thunderbrew keg and Chen's magic &lt;a href=\"Jug%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Cups\"&gt;Jug of a Thousand Cups&lt;/a&gt;, and both declared the other one better. To decide once and for all, they held a large brew taste-testing contest in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; that became the origin of &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Chen traveled onward, he left behind his Jug of a Thousand Cups with Grimbooze. In the personal opinion of his grandson &lt;a href=\"Daran%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Daran Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, Grimbooze enjoyed the use of the Jug a bit too much, as it caused his move to Westfall and the reason he spoke only in rhymes. He, in turn, left the Jug behind at home and Daran eventually came in possession of it. When &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; came to see him at Brewfest, Daran passed the Jug on to her saying that not only should the Jug stay in the Stormstout family, but that he didn't want to risk ending up like Grimbooze.\nBrewfest now holds appeal among all the races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, serving as a celebration of both Azerothian and brew culture. Grimbooze's son &lt;a href=\"Ragnar%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Ragnar&lt;/a&gt; co-hosts the tapping of the keg with &lt;a href=\"Maeve%20Barleybrew\"&gt;Maeve Barleybrew&lt;/a&gt;, but while giving their speech, claimed that it was his father that founded the festival, without mentioning Chen at all.\nQuotes.\nAdventure from lands far and near&lt;br&gt;\nMeeting with folks both odd and queer&lt;br&gt;\nBut if of me a question you ask&lt;br&gt;\nYou must first complete a simple task!\nGrab a pint!\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Larkin%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Larkin Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enohar%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Enohar Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thief%20Catcher%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Thief Catcher Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brogus%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Brogus Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarven%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Jarven Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keri%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Keri Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lana%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Lana Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jenna%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Jenna Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ita%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Ita Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;."}

As she instinctively held it up to the sky, a cascade of golden energy poured from the spearhead and took the shape of a great eagle. Arien and Gardrel both remembered the lore of their tribe and knew that &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; herself had blessed the site, and they knew that it should be renamed &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Peak\"&gt;Talon Peak&lt;/a&gt;.

The gnolls now began launching vicious attacks on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself, but only as a distraction \u2014 while the city soldiers were busy holding off the gnoll attack, farmsteads in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; would burn. The numbers of raiders attacking the capital were so great that the kingdom could not afford sending troops to protect the outer agricultural areas.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; beseeched the other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nations for aid, but received none, and so decided to take matters into his own hands. Accompanied by a small party of elite knights, the king rode east into the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where Garfang's camp was located. The camp had been left exposed and undefended; the packlord had sent nearly all of his raiders to attack the capital, but had not accompanied them himself; like other gnolls, Garfang preferred to let others do his hard work for him.\nThe battle between the king's knights and Garfang and his personal guards lasted for a full day and night, until King Barathen himself sank his blade into the packlord's neck. With Garfang's death, the gnolls fell to infighting. Though several new self-proclaimed packlords arose, none had Garfang's cunning, and before long the gnolls had decimated their own numbers, allowing King Barathen, known thereafter as the Adamant, to finally end the war and decimate what remained of the gnoll packs. Though pockets of gnolls would remain in the distant corners of the kingdom, they would never again rise to become a major threat to Stormwind."}

Also has a fire shield that does about 200 damage to melee combatants so it is a good idea to stand just outside of his fire shield and only run in when he starts his meteor which takes about 2 seconds to cast. To make this more clear: the damage of the meteor is spread among party members, the more that get hit, the more the damage is spread (and lessened). Therefore, when the spell is cast it is recommended that the party is in a group to mitigate damage from about 10k to 1-2k each. \nFor unknown reasons, this mob is susceptible to fire, unlike other Infernals.\nStrategies.\nTo allow everyone in the group to share the meteor and keep the casters out of the fire shield is to have the tank stand with his back to the group. The healer then stands about 5-6 yds behind the tank with everyone else in front of the healer or standing inside the healer. The aoe range of the meteor seems to be about 5 yds with the Abyssal's fire shield being about 3-4 yds so this keeps the casters just out of range. \nAlternatively, watch the enemy cast bar for when the Abyssal begins to cast Meteor, have everyone move away from the area that they were standing in. The meteor will hit where your party used to be instead of where it is currently and no one will take damage from the meteor. This strategy seems much easier \u2013 my group wiped three times trying to do it with the \"pile on\" method, and had little problem doing it by just moving away.\nTank Tip.\nDespite their infernal nature, fire resistance gear doesn't do much to resist the fire shield or meteor. You are best off in full tanking gear. Although paladin tanks switching to fire resistance aura from devotion aura is recommended to further lessen the damage taken by your party members by the fire shield and meteor attacks, and it can be used instead of retribution aura without fear of losing aggro due to the fact you can cast exorcism on this mob."}

Most of them serve the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe gargoyles of Northrend are voracious flying creatures who revel in slaughter and mayhem. Although they are beasts of flesh and blood, they have rough, crystalline hides which protect them from attacks and make them look like animated stone. When in danger, they can land and quickly condense their hides into a stone-like surface to make themselves almost impervious to damage. They must remain motionless while in this stone form, but it gives them time to replenish their energies. They can use this ability to pose as statues until an enemy gets close, at which point they come to life and attack.\nGargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have an obvious weakness: most of them have to go through long periods resting in stone form to maintain the energy needed to carry their heavy bodies through the air. During this time, they are vulnerable and can be easily destroyed. While in stone form, they can be shattered into fragments. In combat, gargoyles use their claws and teeth or kill their enemies by picking them up and dropping them from tall heights. Some can spit acid or poison.\nGargoyles serve as scouts, sentries, and powerful shock troopers in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Scourge gargoyles are \"made animate\" and given deadly attack capabilities at &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;crypts&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller gargoyles called &lt;a href=\"Grotesque%20Statue\"&gt;grotesques&lt;/a&gt; are used to divert the flow of rainwater on Scourge buildings to prevent mausoleum flooding. The Scourge brought gargoyles with them from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The creatures wheeled above &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' marching army like buzzards and notably intercepted the runners that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. During the attack on the capital, swarms of gargoyles clashed with and eventually outnumbered the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk%20rider\"&gt;dragonhawk rider&lt;/a&gt;s, while another flock attacked and sank three ships\u2014the \"&lt;a href=\"Morn%27danel\"&gt;Morn'danel&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Fellovar\"&gt;Fellovar&lt;/a&gt;\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"Varillian\"&gt;Varillian&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014trying to evacuate elven children.\nSome gargoyles have left the Scourge and serve the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s can summon them using special collars. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; gargoyles participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Grotesque%20Statue\"&gt;Grotesque Statue&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to drop from &lt;a href=\"Azgalor%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit%20%28Caverns%20of%20Time%29\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nGargoyles are not undead creatures in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;, unlike in \"Warcraft III\" and \"World of Warcraft\". &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" describes a different type of &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; which is described as formed of stone and earth and a proto-golem, however, the validity of the source is disputed. Many kinds of gargoyles can be found around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, some of the more common types include the subspecies of gargoyle represented by various groups of mobs, as well as the &lt;a href=\"dire%20gargoyle\"&gt;dire gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; (subspecies, possibly to differentiate from the normal gargoyle in Appendix Three). In \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt;, there are other subspecies of gargoyles: &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Gargoyles%2C%20all%20-%20Four-Armed%20Gargoyle%2C%20Green%20Gargoyle%2C%20Margoyle\"&gt;Four-Armed Gargoyle, Green Gargoyle, and Margoyle&lt;/a&gt;, however, the validity of the source is disputed.\nLanguage: &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIt is not known what relation, if any, the gargoyles of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; have to the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; gargoyles of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. They may be a result of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; seeing the stoneborn through the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and attempting to copy them, though the gargoyles' description in the implies that gargoyles are native creatures of Northrend that were simply recruited by the Scourge. They may be stoneborn themselves who escaped or were brought out of the Shadowlands somehow.\nAlternatively, they may have been created by the aforementioned &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; in the same way that other &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s created humanoid animal races."}

The Gargoyles are the Undead counterpart of the Human &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt;, Orc &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt; and Night Elf &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryph Rider&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe primary advantages of a Gargoyle are its fairly damaging ground and extremely powerful aerial attack, and swarms of Gargoyles can easily decimate most aerial armies in seconds if they aren't focused on. Gargoyles can also quickly regenerate themselves by hardening themselves, making them one of the few Undead units that can heal themselves outside of blighted ground without relying on a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s Unholy Aura or a fountain of life.\nGargoyles are best accompanied with a &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;, as his Vampiric Aura allows the Gargoyle to leech health off of enemy aerial units. Swarms of Gargoyles with this Aura often result in them only &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Batrider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Batriders&lt;/a&gt; being able to take them down as all other aerial units simply deal little to no damage due to the health they restore from their attacks.\nToggle the Gargoyle's air priority on when they are trained/amassed. This way they will immediately attack any enemy air units in range over other ground units with higher priority than them.\nLike Hippogryphs, Gargoyles possess Unarmored-type armor for balancing reasons. This makes them highly susceptible to all forms of attack.\nSpells and abilities.\nStone Form.\nDue to the high armor bonus players can often use Stone Form as a barricade of sorts, but the Gargoyle becomes attackable by ground units as soon as it is activated, and will often deprive the player of some additional damage. Stone Form is highly effective against &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Batrider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Batrider&lt;/a&gt;s if they attempt to use Unstable Concoction on them, as the Gargoyle is immediately considered a ground unit once Stone Form is activated, and Unstable Concoction only works on aerial units, which kills the Troll Batrider without harming the Gargoyle."}

She is an &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; and was an emissary of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the first invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and was the reluctant murderer of King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, she joined &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;her son&lt;/a&gt; and the other members of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; in their battle against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult.\nRecently, Garona has been aiding the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, notably during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. She is also one of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBirth and early life.\nThe events that would result in the birth of Garona were partially orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. He approached the &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind clan&lt;/a&gt; as a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them that the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; woes the orcs were suffering. The orcs all respected the Shadowmoon, tensions already ran high between the Bladewind clan and the draenei, and the Bladewind had no reason to question Gul'dan. Eager to change their fortunes, they formed raiding parties and began attacking draenei &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;s in greater numbers than they had in the past. They killed dozens of draenei and captured even more.\nAmong the prisoners was the draenei &lt;a href=\"Leran\"&gt;Leran&lt;/a&gt;, the sister of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;. Draenei scouts reported the Bladewind sacrificing their prisoners in gruesome rituals to appease the elements and Maraad urged the draenei to save the prisoners, his sister included. He led the assault on the Bladewind, but by the time they arrived, Leran and the others were dead. Before their death, Garona would be born to a Bladewind warrior and Leran. The result was a child that, as it would be discovered later, looked surprisingly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarona would be raised in &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; with her father's people. She was not the first half-breed in the clan, but she was one of the few who survived past childhood. Years of abuse turned her into a ferocious fighter, and apart from natural physical strength she also possessed keen intellect and a gift with languages. She mastered the &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;draenei language&lt;/a&gt; from the captives and her clan often used her as an interpreter. After the destruction of the Bladewind village by vengeful draenei, Garona fled into the wilds of Terokkar Forest. As she worked her way east she ran into the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and Gul'dan.\nBlade of the Shadow Council.\nAs it was the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan took Garona under his care. As a half-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, half-&lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; outcast, Garona had found survival to be brutally difficult. She had learned quickly how to avoid unwinnable fights, and how to quietly kill relentless pursuers. Gul'dan bound her mind to his will and began to secretly train her in the art of assassination. She did not fully understand his intentions, but she grew to resent his cruelty. Still, she obeyed. Survival demanded nothing less. Gul'dan had her magically aged and tortured. Having also traveled throughout &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Garona was well-versed in the culture of the orcs. She quickly became the chief interpreter of the Shadow Council and Gul'dan's personal &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. Due to her mixed blood, she would be hated by the bigger orcs for being different. Their judgments of her being \"ugly and deformed\" would become her own for years to come. Maraad, however, would not care that Garona was half-orc. Having learned that his sister had borne a child, he began to search for his niece that would stretch on for many years.\nGarona proved to be skilled with almost any weapon she held, but Gul'dan was not satisfied. His grip on the Horde was still tenuous; assassinating his enemies could backfire if the involvement of his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; became known. He needed weapons that would allow Garona to kill for him with impunity. Thus he turned to his master &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; for guidance and following his strict instructions, made a request to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orc was intrigued, for the warlock had asked for two daggers created from a mysterious type of ore that no orc had ever seen before, and he wanted them imbued with a power that would only reveal itself when the time was right. Blackhand agreed to make the weapons himself in his foundry. As Blackhand quenched the blades, he felt a terrible, dark presence fill them with unspeakable might. This was no &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Elemental Fury&lt;/a&gt;-it was the raw hatred of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; sinking deep within the daggers. Blackhand could feel untamed agony radiating from the weapons. He named them &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, for he knew they would never be satisfied unless there were drinking the blood of new victims.\nGul'dan was delighted with the daggers' power. Not only were they brimming with the dark presence of a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; lord, but they also were imbued with the means to control the will of the one who wielded them. To test the weapons' potential, Gul'dan handed them to Garona and gave her a simple command. She obeyed instantly. An unfortunate Shadow Council acolyte had no chance to defend himself before she tore open his throat with one slash. It was not a pleasant death. But it was fast, quiet, and efficient. When the orc took his last breath, the wound that killed him became irregular. Nobody would be able to tell whether he had died to a knife, an axe, or a spear. Gul'dan saw the possibilities immediately. A mysterious death could be used to sow confusion and redirect suspicion wherever he pleased.\nIn time &lt;a href=\"Zagrel\"&gt;Chieftain Zagrel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20Clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw Clan&lt;/a&gt; would call upon the clans to end the war with the draenei and focus their attention on &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic rituals under the belief that only through dedicated worship and adherence to old traditions could the orcs regain their relationship with the elements. Gul'dan fearing that Zagrel could eventually win the support of orcs who questioned the Horde, such as &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and his Frostwolves sent Garona to strike the Whiteclaw chieftain down. Garona silently slipped into the Whiteclaws' encampment and stabbed Zagrel through the heart. None of his clan would ever know she'd been there. After their leader's untimely death, inner turmoil gripped the clan as Zagrel's brothers and sons fought for the title of chieftain. The Whiteclaws would endure, but would never be as strong as they had once been.\nAs the Horde waged war on the draenei, Gul'dan dispatched Garona with care and precision. Influential orcs who expressed doubt or dissent were often found dead shortly after a skirmish with draenei forces. The wounds did not look as if they had come from orcish weapons, so Gul'dan was never suspected. Nor was Garona. As a half-breed, she lived beneath the notice of most orcs, and those who noticed her saw only a servant of Gul'dan, held on a tight leash. Her quiet work aided the Horde in securing victory against the draenei, and then her blades helped maintain control in the war's aftermath. Life on Draenor withered due to the presence of fel magic, but tensions within the Horde stayed manageable. Whenever they didn't, Gul'dan gave the command, and Garona obeyed.\nFor many years, Garona was bound to the will of the Shadow Council. She obeyed them to survive; she killed on their behalf to appease them. She often dreamed of using these daggers to slay her masters, but when she woke, her ensorcelled mind buried those thoughts, keeping her loyal.\nEmissary to Medivh.\nShe was a member of one of the first raiding parties into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; that fanned out across the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. The few &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hunters and traders encountered were mostly killed, but a handful were captured. While the orcs neglected to question the humans at first because they couldn't understand &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;their tongue&lt;/a&gt;, Garona had a talent for learning new languages and spent much of her time speaking with prisoners, learning human words in exchange for food and water. She did not ask things the captives might resist telling such as Stormwind's patrol routes, but did eventually find valuable information about the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; from a prisoner who cursed the orcs and said Stormwind's mage champion &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;who annihilated an entire troll army&lt;/a&gt; would make quick work of them. Garona set out for Karazhan alone and was captured by Medivh the moment she stepped within sight of the tower.\nThough Garona believed she would be killed, Medivh did not harm her because she had no information he needed and was a curiosity, having not seen her during his visits to Draenor. Medivh sympathized with how Garona was an outcast and was impressed with her intelligence, having already spoken the human tongue fairly well. He taught her new words and phrases she quickly picked up on. Seeing Garona was no threat and that she had no love for the Horde due to Gul'dan's cruelty, Medivh decided it was more valuable to have an ally (or even a friend) among the orcs than another spirit haunting his home. Medivh freed Garona and extended an invitation for her to return to Karazhan whenever she liked. When Garona returned to the Black Morass, she discovered Gul'dan had seen everything through her eyes, recognizing what she had not: that Medivh was the mysterious stranger who led the orcs to Azeroth. He ordered Garona to dig up information in Karazhan, hoping to discover the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Garona, having gained some information about magic, was kidnapped in the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; but soon rescued by the Horde. The abbey was destroyed.\nWhile her party was wiped out, she was spared and sent back to relay a message to the warlock &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan ordered Garona to find the sorcerer Medivh and keep an eye on him. After a period of time, she returned and met with the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Magus&lt;/a&gt; on many occasions. Eventually, she was granted the title of &lt;a href=\"Ambassador\"&gt;Emissary&lt;/a&gt; and sent to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that she met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh's apprentice (and observer from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;). Khadgar was, at first, furious at her presence, but the Magus demanded Khadgar treat her with respect. A trust was formed between the two when a bizarre &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the library of the great tower, and both had to utilize their skills together to defeat it. Garona and Khadgar continually criticized each other's race while defending their own. Eventually, Garona mentioned to Khadgar that the orcs had been arriving on Azeroth via a &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;gateway&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarona also began to respect Magus Medivh a great deal, and because of that respect, she started to debate her true loyalties. Stating that the \"Old Man\" had told her everything she wanted to know, despite knowing full well that she was a spy, she felt that she could never break that trust. She even made the comment that the bond of trust made her feel more 'human' and that she felt Medivh had a grand dream to bring something better to this world. It may have been around this time that Medivh fathered Garona's son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;. As Garona's relationship with high profile humans began to develop, Garona would see humans as a potential means of escaping Gul'dan.\nBattle with Medivh.\nDue to Medivh's bizarre behavior, Khadgar and Garona felt it necessary to investigate and uncover any connection between the sudden arrival of the orcs and Medivh's behavior. Using a spell to call forth a vision of the past, Khadgar and Garona discovered that Medivh was, in fact, the man who had brought the orcs into Azeroth, thus uncovering his plans of murder and deceit. This shook Garona to the core, and while at first she thought it to be a misfire of the spell, she eventually realized that Medivh was indeed the one who had opened the gateway for the orcs. After a short battle with Medivh, where Khadgar used his powers to summon a vision of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; that distracted the Magus, the two escaped and made their way to the (former) Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite a small interruption in their journey, they eventually met up with Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. They told their story to Lothar and King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, but Llane could not believe it was true. Despite Llane's skepticism, it was Lothar who realized that the Magus had truly gone insane, and at his suggestion, a small raiding party was gathered to confront Medivh in Karazhan. Later that very evening, Garona donned the colors of Azeroth at Lothar's request and joined the party as they set out via &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s to the tower. Unknown to Garona, Gul'dan had observed all of this through her eyes and tried to compel her to assassinate the King of Stormwind, although Garona was able to resist the command.\nAfter searching about the tower, they soon came across a hidden passageway downward but leading into a mirror image of the tower itself, where Medivh's second shadow &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; dwelled. It was also at this time that both Garona and Khadgar witnessed something that would forever change the half-orc. Karazhan presented Garona with a vision of her future, where she was forced to watch in horror as \"future-Garona\" murdered King Llane during the siege against &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. For a while, Garona was terrified of what she knew would eventually come to pass. Llane was one of the few people in her life who had treated her with kindness and she did not want to kill him. Khadgar finally snapped her out of her state of shock and forced her to focus on the more important matter at hand. He told her that if the vision was true, then it meant they would both get out of Karazhan alive (since Khadgar had previously seen a vision of his own future as well), and that if it was false then she could die taking comfort in the knowledge that she wasn't destined to betray King Llane.\nEventually, they found Medivh, who unleashed all the powers bestowed upon him by his mother and the demon lord Sargeras. Garona, now boiling with anger at Medivh's betrayal \u2014 and perhaps hoping to die rather than live out the vision she had seen \u2014 attacked the Magus head-on, only to be struck down by a powerful spell. Medivh expressed disappointment in Garona, telling her that he had hoped she of all people would understand what he was going through and not oppose him.\nFeeling little remorse for the half-orc, he then touched her head and cast a second spell, filling her mind with the doubts and divisions that he himself had carried. She fell to the floor, incapacitated. Moments later, after much conflict, Medivh was finally slain by Khadgar and Lothar (at that moment &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was still deep within the Guardian's thoughts causing him to go into a coma), but Garona was nowhere to be found...\nLlane's assassination and aid of Meryl.\nSoon after, Garona returned to King Llane, but because of Medivh's mind games she faltered and Gul'dan's earlier order to assassinate Llane flared up in her mind. Realizing that her vision had become a reality, she reluctantly carried out this task, and with a deep sadness, murdered King Llane, cutting his heart out. Llane's son, prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; witnessed the murder, but even years into his adulthood was confused as to why Garona had tears streaming down her face. At the time, she was pregnant with her son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarona did not receive a hero's welcome from the Horde. Warchief Blackhand had been killed by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan was in a coma, and his Shadow Council was in hiding. As she was trying to escape from Stormwind City, Garona was captured and Orgrim had her tortured for information on the Shadow Council's location. The Warchief would choose to spare her life and in response, Garona swore fealty to the Horde, where &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; would serve as her handler. Throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Garona served many functions from translating missives taken from captured &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; messengers to fighting with the Horde soldiers on the front lines. Believing that she could earn Eitrigg's trust, Garona told him that the Horde was in truth the pawn of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, who would then try to claim Azeroth for themselves once the Horde defeated the Alliance, however, her handler treated her words as poisonous on the grounds of her once having been Gul'dan's assassin. Following Eitrigg's rebuke, Garona would bide her time until she could make her escape, which she later accomplished during a chaotic battle within the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Though Garona did not know it, Eitrigg in fact allowed her to escape. Her former handler believed that fighting the Alliance was more important than hunting her down, he had also come to sympathize with her and wished that she could perhaps make a home for herself on Azeroth, something that she had never had before. Other Horde trackers were sent to hunt her down, but they never had a chance.\nIn time, Garona began to understand the power &lt;a href=\"the%20Kingslayers\"&gt;the Kingslayers&lt;/a&gt; were exerting on her will. Even with being so far away, she could feel Gul'dan trying to compel her back into his clutches. She sought out the help of an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mage named &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Winterstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt;, asking him to hide the &lt;a href=\"The%20Kingslayers\"&gt;blades&lt;/a&gt; somewhere beyond anyone's reach. Garona wanted to make sure that no other victim would die to them, and that no other mind would be subject to Gul'dan's trickery. The daggers remained buried for decades.\nAnd by this time, Garona had also given birth to her and Medivh's son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;. Citing her assassination of King Llane, she told Meryl that she was a danger to her child and entrusted the baby to him. Informing him of the baby's name, she asked that he never tell Med'an who his mother was. Bidding Meryl farewell, she disappeared from the rest of the world but would keep watch over her son from afar.\nReuniting with Khadgar.\nOnce Garona was confident that she had shattered Gul'dan's lingering mental chains, she journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to reunite with Khadgar. She spoke of her actions during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and so, openly confessed to killing King Llane. Khadgar believed her when she told him how Gul'dan's mind control had compelled her into doing so. He also sensed how the Shadow Council's mangled spellwork lingered, woven through her thoughts. This knowledge allowed both of them to realize that at least one member of the Shadow Council was still alive and on Azeroth, one who was trying to keep control over Garona. Over the next several months, Khadgar and Garona would meet outside of Nethergarde, the Archmage worked towards completely liberating Garona's mind from the Shadow Council's grasp, a task that he was successful in completing. In gratitude, Garona offered to eliminate the remaining Shadow Council on Azeroth.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; reopened the portal connecting &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, they sought out artifacts of power on Azeroth in order for the Horde to invade other worlds. When &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and his cohorts broke off from the Horde to acquire these artifacts, they were unknowingly followed by Garona. The moment Gorefiend split his forces into three, to better acquire the artifacts required, Garona followed the group heading towards &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, believing that they were out to seek the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that the human guards of the harbor would never trust an orc, she scrawled a note warning them about an impending attack. The note was successful in attracting the attention of the harbor guards, who promptly began to search for the band of orcs. While the note gave the humans warning, it did not stop the group of orcs from completing their mission.\nOnce the Horde had all the artifacts they needed, they recalled most of their forces back to Draenor. During this time, the Alliance formed an &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the amassing Horde, Garona wished to come and aid Khadgar though she was convinced to stay on Azeroth and hunt the remaining Shadow Council members on Azeroth. In time, Garona eventually picked up on &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s trail and she began tracking the former Shadow Council member to the mysterious lands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where Cho'gall and his surviving &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; minions had journeyed to at the command of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; after their defeat on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarona's return.\nGarona continued watching over her &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of \"\", &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; party formed by an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. As they were beating him, she suddenly appeared and killed the entire party but was captured by &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia Fallshadow&lt;/a&gt;. She was taken to &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen she got there she found that &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; was still alive and that he knew the spell that Gul'dan used on her mind to force her to do things against her will. He sent her to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate the newly returned King Varian Wrynn and thus ruining any possible chance of a human-orc alliance. Garona was also tasked to assassinate secondary targets Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; but was ordered to kill King Varian Wrynn at the summit at any cost. This attack failed and she was captured by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, while Med'an was recaptured by the Twilight's Hammer cult. Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; discovered that there was a spell placed on her mind but could not remove it without causing her great pain and possible death. In a deal she made with &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, she would endure the pain and give them some of the information they required if Valeera used the information to go save her son from the Twilight Hammer cult.\nWhile Valeera and Meryl Winterstorm went to rescue Med'an, Garona was secretly freed and rescued by her uncle &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack on Theramore. Later on, Maraad explained to Garona that her mother was his sister, thus making him her uncle. As they were talking, Valeera, who had been looking for Garona, came in and a fight erupted. Thinking that Valeera did not keep her part of the deal, she escaped while Maraad distracted Valeera but ran into Med'an, who had been following Valeera. Though Garona was happy to be reunited with her son, she explains that until Cho'gall is dead (he being the only one left who knows the safe word that would control her), it was not safe for her to be around him and that he should stay with his great uncle for now. Garona then went to &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to wait for her chance to kill &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarona failed to kill Cho'gall but succeeded in retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Base%20of%20Atiesh\"&gt;Base of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;. She gave Med'an the necessary components to restore the &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;staff of Atiesh&lt;/a&gt; and with its power, Med'an was able to defeat Chog'all. Garona, though still a fugitive of Stormwind, vowed to continue to hunt the remaining members of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. She left it to Valeera to explain her situation to King Varian.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Garona was encountered at &lt;a href=\"Bloodgulch\"&gt;Bloodgulch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, having come to end the life of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Displeased with having to rely on &lt;a href=\"farseer\"&gt;farseer&lt;/a&gt;s to further this goal, Garona took a more active approach to go about bringing his death. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurers were tasked with supporting her endeavor, and a delegation of elite &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; was sent to assist her. However, Cho'gall stroke the group, leaving only the adventurer and Garona to sabotage the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Citadel\"&gt;Twilight Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter freeing the trapped &lt;a href=\"Lirastrasza\"&gt;Lirastrasza&lt;/a&gt; and enlisting the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Garona goes about putting her revenge into motion- though Cho'gall had lured her right into his grasp. Cho'gall retreated into the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, and left the powerful Gronn &lt;a href=\"Skullcrusher%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Skullcrusher the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to destroy her and the adventurer. The timely arrival of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cozwynn\"&gt;Lady Cozwynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; forces turned the tables around, however, and the mighty gronn was slain.\nLegion.\nNow one of &lt;a href=\"The%20Uncrowned\"&gt;The Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, Garona was within the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in the secret &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. She found her long-hidden daggers &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt; and, against the wishes of &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; (actually &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; in disguise), Garona infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; while it was under lockdown to put an end to a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; cult. She and a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; brought an end to &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;Melris Malagan&lt;/a&gt; and stopped demons from being summoned into the city. Afterward, Garona gave her daggers to the adventurer as being in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; with them brings back too many bad memories.\nGarona participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, as a member of the Horde, Garona was aboard \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;The Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. She was ordered by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to organize missions and assemble a team in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Having been conscripted for the mission, Garona was faking her loyalty to keep herself alive. When questioned by &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; about her loyalty to the Horde, the undead revealed that he knew her killing of &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; wasn't her choice. Garona later pointed out to him that the zeal at which he struck out against the Alliance seemed to be motivated beyond his loyalty to Sylvanas, causing Nathanos to admit that after the Alliance rejected the fallen of Lordaeron and started hunting the Forsaken, he vowed to hunt them in turn.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Garona commented that their mistake wasn't that they acted against Sylvanas. Rather, she felt their mistake was that they acted too soon.\nShe later attended the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Vision of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s twisted desire for &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; made manifest, a &lt;a href=\"Garona%20%28Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;version of Garona&lt;/a&gt; was encountered. N'Zoth's agents seek her death as she plotted to send citizens within the &lt;a href=\"Drag\"&gt;Drag&lt;/a&gt; to safety.\nAfter the Fourth War.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his report that the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; are still active, and that Garona is an active and recognized member of the organization.\nDragonflight.\nHaving decided that the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth was an event worthy of coming out of seclusion for, Garona was one of the orcs in attendance for the festival in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, initially standing next to &lt;a href=\"Gordul\"&gt;Gordul&lt;/a&gt;. She was intrigued that so many orcs had answered the call and how none of them were fighting one another. As the Kosh'harg festival neared its ends, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chieftain\"&gt;Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thega%20Graveblade\"&gt;Thega Graveblade&lt;/a&gt; invited Garona into the clan, who promised to consider the matter. To orc champions, Garona admitted that she had never belonged to a clan, how being &lt;a href=\"Half-breed\"&gt;half-blooded&lt;/a&gt; used to mark one as an outcast. However, in seeing how she, the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; were accepted at the Kosh'harg, convinced her that times changed, and so she revealed her inclination was to take up Thega's offer.\nParentage.\nGarona's \"non-orcish\" heritage has been very much disputed over the years. Some believed her to be part human (i.e. &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt;) as she originally claimed. &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; believed that the human part was actually a &lt;a href=\"near-human\"&gt;near-human&lt;/a&gt; race from Draenor, and not the same race of humans from Azeroth. Others have suggested she is part draenei (i.e. &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt;) which has been confirmed.\nInitially, it was believed (even by Garona herself) that she was of &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"half-human\"&gt;half-human&lt;/a&gt; heritage, as she claimed in the and in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\". In the manual, Garona specifically states she is \"...of both Orc and Human lineage\". Garona also mentions that she was forced through the portal along with laborers into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that she was born on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven Medivh, the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, many orcs and humans, and others thought that she was half-orc and half-human. Humans tended to focus on her orc parts, and orcs focused on her human parts. To orcs, she had human hands, too pale, too weak, and too ugly.\nIt was ultimately revealed that &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was aware of her true parentage but lied to Garona and made her believe she was half-human so she could more easily infiltrate the court of King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs mentioned before, Garona herself had no reason to not believe Gul'dan's lies, until she met her pure-blooded draenei uncle &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;. When he revealed her heritage to her, Garona could not believe him until he pressed her memory. It was only then that Garona realized that he was telling her the truth. When she spoke to &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; a few minutes later, she also told him of their draenei heritage to his surprise, showing that she had fully accepted this revelation to be true.\nBefore her full race identity was revealed in the comic, this issue was brought up on the official forums where the former community manager &lt;a href=\"Caydiem\"&gt;Caydiem&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Garona was in fact half-orc and half-draenei. As the uncorrupted draenei in the \"\" expansion had not yet been revealed, Caydiem made this plausible by stating that the draenei seen so far in the game had been mutated as &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by portals and through their portal travels.\nResearchers such as &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had denied it (based on her appearance, draenei appearance, and their limited knowledge of other existing &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; in the world).\nHowever, as Brann pointed out, due to her age it would seem impossible for a human and orc to have produced her since she was already a young woman at the time of the First War. Brann implied that half-draenei have physical features from both orcs and draenei, but that her features did not match those of the draenei he had seen (which at the time were mostly &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s).\nAppearance.\nWith the recent revelation of the appearances of the \"true\" &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and their eredar-like forms \u2014 it was hard to believe that Garona was half-draenei since she lacked their cranial features, leg structure, presence of a tail, and hooves \u2014 her prowess as an assassin makes it unlikely she is \"half-uncorrupted\" draenei. However, in \"\", there is a half-orc half-draenei &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; ogres \u2014 who reuses &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s orc model lacking draenei features and human features. Although Lantresor's model may just be using an orc model due to the lack of a true &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; model in-game (in the same way that half-elves are represented by elven models in game), Garona looks like him, without draenei features.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20%28Wildstorm%20comic%29\"&gt;World of Warcraft (Wildstorm comic)&lt;/a&gt;, she is portrayed, similar to her older renditions, with dominant orcish features. Her only draenei features are the eye glows (not white, however, but purple) and the structure of her forehead. She also mentions to Maraad that her feet are \"almost like \"hooves\".\" Horns and the tail are missing, although it is possible that they have been physically removed or simply are rudimentary and hidden under her clothes and hair. Her leg structure has nothing in common with the draenei's though. Her son Med'an, even with only having 1/4 draenei genes, has more draenei features than she does.\nHer clothes, tattoo, and haircut are similar to 2003's &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; concept art by &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;, implying this may have been an older picture of Garona and not an unknown assassin.\nDisappearance from games.\nWarcraft III.\nIn early release information related to Warcraft III, including private demonstrations to the media, it was mentioned that Garona was intended to play a major role in the main campaign, likening her importance to that of Thrall himself. On April 27, 2000, IGN.com interviewed &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Pardo\"&gt;Rob Pardo&lt;/a&gt; about the game. In an interview conducted by IGN, Garona was mentioned as a playable &lt;a href=\"hero%20unit\"&gt;hero unit&lt;/a&gt;, but by the game's release in 2002, she was strangely missing.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDuring the \"World of Warcraft\" &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, she was seen in &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt;, the guild of assassins, with the title of \"Grand Master of the Assassin's League\" and affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; faction. She was removed before the game's release, but has since reappeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" in a flashback and in \"Cataclysm\" in person.\nOther appearances.\nGarona also appears as a hero unit in Warcraft I: &lt;a href=\"Garona%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Garona (Warcraft I)&lt;/a&gt;.\nMemorable quotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTwilight Highlands.\nI travelled all this way to speak with the famed \"Seer of the Dragonmaw.\" I wanted to see inside Cho'gall's dark heart before I tear it out.\nBut she's worthless to me.

Her flavor text reads: \"If you value your life, then watch the shadows for Garona Halforcen.

{"id": "19380", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19380", "title": "Garr", "text": "Garr is a &lt;a href=\"lava%20elemental\"&gt;lava elemental&lt;/a&gt; boss found in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Gehennas\"&gt;Gehennas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, and guarding the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Blaz\"&gt;Rune of Blaz&lt;/a&gt;. He is a melee boss with 8 &lt;a href=\"Firesworn\"&gt;Firesworn&lt;/a&gt; guards.\nBackground.\nGarr is described as one of the lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; who accompanied the Firelord into Azeroth during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. He carried out the betrayal of Lord &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince of Air and otherwise referred to as the \"Windseeker.\" During the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros sought to consume Thunderaan, and did so by having his two lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt; and Garr ambush him. Thunderaan, caught off guard, was utterly destroyed. Ragnaros almost completely consumed Thunderaan's essence, and stored the rest within a talisman of elemental binding. Ragnaros cleaved this talisman into two equal pieces, to which he assigned Baron Geddon and Garr.\nAs one of the two chief lieutenants serving under Ragnaros, Garr plays a key role in the current success of the Firelord and his spreading influence. Garr, like Baron Geddon, holds half of Bindings of the Windseeker, which contains the remaining essence of Thunderaan, Prince of Air. Tales say that after centuries of partnership, Geddon became suspicious of Garr and felt the elemental sought both halves of the talisman. Thus, relations between the two powers are strained. Both Garr and Baron Geddon draw their considerable might from the blazing runes carved deep into the floor of Molten Core.\nCataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Garr%20%28world%20boss%29\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; is back in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; at the west of the &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Spire\"&gt;Sulfuron Spire&lt;/a&gt; as a rare spawn.\nIn the RPG.\nTwo orbs of molten lava are set into the hill of stone that constitutes this creature\u2019s head, the whole resting atop a mountainous torso. Two immense bands of metal bind the creature at what might be its wrists, if those massive stone appendages can be called arms. Garr uses earth glide to rise up among the highest concentration of his enemies. He takes advantage of his magma shackles and anti-magic pulse by moving to keep his ground-based enemies within these areas of effect. He attacks and backs off to keep his opponents from making full attacks against him while his army of elementals surrounds and protects him. In melee he simply pummels his foes and pushes them into rivers and lakes of lava.\nHis alignment is &lt;a href=\"chaotic%20evil\"&gt;chaotic evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, &lt;a href=\"Magmakin%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Magmakin&lt;/a&gt; will spawn on top of Garr throughout the fight. They will charge a random raid member and then explode.\nStrategies.\nStrategy 1.\nThe more warlocks in a group, the easier this battle will be, but this strategy still works with only a couple. Each warlock is assigned one of the firesworn. For that specific firesworn, a warlock must keep the firesworn banished and have a voidwalker to tank it in between banish breaks. Every firesworn that is not assigned to a warlock must then be offtanked and killed by dps. During the fight, the group will benefit the most if all of the mobs are kept spread out, so as to prevent any difficulties with explosions and Garr's debuff abilities.\nCaution: when firesworns die they explode, causing large amounts of damage to all surrounding group members. When they are about to die, melee must get away from firesworns so as to save health and save healer mana.\nWhen all tank-assigned firesworn are down, the group can then focus on Garr, which should be tanked by the MT from the very start of the fight. Warlocks must remember keep their targets banished at least until Garr falls.\nOnce Garr is dead the raid needs to kill the remaining banished firesworn one at a time.\nStrategy 2.\nHave 1 player tank Garr and all the adds. Allow threat to be built up with Demoralizing shout prior to DPS. This can be tricky as the tank will obviously require a tremendous amount of healing. Several paladins or priests need to be constantly removing the Immolates from the tank. Once Garr is down the firesworn can be AoE'd down.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//video.google.com/videoplay%3Fdocid%3D5344009891776329150\"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating this strategy.\nLoot.\nGarr's death rewards 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; up to 20,999/21,000 Revered."}

These can be pulled separately from the boss and should be killed before Garr is pulled to make him considerably easier. Everytime a FIresworn dies, they will deal roughly 50,000 damage to anyone close to them so melee should move away when they're about to die.\nOnce all the Firesworn are dead, the tank can pull Garr. Ranged should try to stay at maximum range. Garr will periodically dispel any magic buffs the group have and will cast Magma shackles on the group. This should be dispelled from melee as soon as possible.\nEvery 30 seconds, Garr will begin to cast Massive Eruption. All melee must run away from Garr when he begins casting this or they will die. If you do die, it is possible to release spirit and rejoin the fight.\nOther than the slow debuff and the Massive Eruption, this is a rather straight-forward fight."}

When Garrick started down the hill he was shot in the back and started his journey to the other side.\nWhether these two are still friends living within the unnamed blighted forest is unknown."}

{"id": "386113", "revid": "612753", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=386113", "title": "Garrison", "text": "Garrisons are one of the main features of \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGarrisons are phased, highly customizable character-specific sub-zones, where players can arrange, construct and manage their own base of operations against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Expansive and fully explorable areas featuring dozens of different buildings and characters, garrisons are brought to life by the player's followers, interactable NPCs who must be inspired (or bribed) to join the player's ranks. Detailed characters in their own right, followers can be grouped up and sent off to undertake quick quests, delve into dangerous dungeons or join with an army of allies to tackle special raids against mighty foes. Successful missions can reward the player with epic loot and vital resources for the development of the garrison.\nEach garrison building offers a special purpose - be it to improve the player's followers, grant access to alternate professions, or provide the player with bonuses in other areas of the game. Buildings and followers can be customized, with every upgrade and specialization reflected in the appearance of the base. \nAs well as providing unique gameplay functions, garrisons also feature as extensive explorable areas in their own right, with standard fixtures such as merchants, quest givers and flight masters. Garrisons can also be entered by party members, whether to appraise the base's strategic planning, to interact with followers, or to trade in special resources. \nGarrisons are intended to be part of the expansion's leveling experience, and are integrated into the expansion's zones and gameplay, with players frequently redirected to their garrison throughout the leveling experience. However, they are also an ongoing feature at max level. Garrison development is tied to key quest lines throughout the expansion's zones, with each character's garrison located in their faction's home zone on Draenor. Garrison play extends beyond the garrison itself, with buffs that affect play in the rest of the game, and discoverable elements such as followers found through exploring the rest of the game world.\nGarrisons offer a high level of customization, with a number of possible buildings and followers from which the player must choose, each providing different rewards. However, these choices are not permanent and can be undone by the player.\nPlayers first begin to build their garrisons shortly after completing \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Dark Portal introductory experience. Horde players can find their garrison, &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, while Alliance players can find their garrison, &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, in .\nOfficial preview.\n\"As you progress toward level 100, you\u2019ll open up the opportunity to create your very own Garrison\u2014one of \"Warlords of Draenor\u2019\"s biggest new features. Once ground is broken, you can decide which buildings to construct, which followers to recruit, and which missions they should undertake. All of this becomes integral in your ultimate quest to advance your character, and you\u2019ll be returning to your Garrison frequently to further your goal of protecting Azeroth from the Iron Horde. ... Garrison will have specializations similar to talent trees, and will grow over three tiers.\"\n\"Commissioned by their faction leader to establish a foothold on Draenor and bolster defenses against the formidable Iron Horde, each player will need to build and manage their own Garrison, a customizable fortress that serves as your personal base of operations throughout the course of the expansion. As you complete quests and win allies to your cause, your Garrison will expand and you\u2019ll be able to choose which upgrades you\u2019d like to construct from a variety of options. You\u2019ll also meet and recruit NPC allies and followers who will join you at the Garrison, each providing different benefits.\"\n\"For example, a miner rescued from a dungeon might take up residence and help gather Mining resources. A heroic warrior you quarter might embark upon quests at your command, with a chance to return with valuable treasures. Other characters might provide you with quests that expand upon their own stories or lead you to valuable assets in your campaign.\"\n\"When it comes time to upgrade your Garrison, you might choose to build a Barracks to send more followers on missions simultaneously, an Inn to provide new recruits, or an Infirmary to speed up injured followers\u2019 recovery time between assignments. You may instead decide to build a Smithy and recruit a Blacksmith to research new plans and craft valuable resources (such as those with daily cooldowns). You\u2019ll also be able to invite friends to visit your Garrison to trade resources and see how your home base stacks up against their own.\"\n\"Your Garrison exists seamlessly in the world, but you won\u2019t need to go into an instance portal to visit your home base - as you travel through Draenor, you\u2019ll see your Garrison looming on the horizon.\"\nGarrisons and buildings.\nGarrisons are real zones placed within the actual game world, which the player can explore in detail, entering individual buildings and interacting with followers and other NPCs. Players are able to enter garrisons seamlessly, without a loading screen, similar to &lt;a href=\"Sunsong%20Ranch\"&gt;Sunsong Ranch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;. Each character's garrison is permanently located in their faction's home zone on Draenor - for the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde. Players are given a &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Garrison Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, allowing quick travel back to the garrison with a 20 minute cooldown.\nGarrisons provide various plots for a selection of buildings to construct, allowing easy switching of buildings that share the same plot sizes. Each building features lavish detail, and will change - outside and inside - as they are upgraded, developing from simple tents and huts to grand towers and imposing fortresses. Buildings can be entered and explored by the player, and are filled with related NPCs and objects which can be interacted with.\nGarrisons also look very different depending on the character's faction, featuring iconic design from \"Warcraft\" tradition. The Alliance garrison strongly reflects human architecture, while that of the Horde reflects traditional orcish designs. Individual buildings, primarily the professions buildings, offer \"racial hints\" from other races of the player's faction.\nParty members can visit the garrison of the current party leader through clicking on their portrait. This allows players to show off their garrisons and have their friends help fight off invading forces, and is often used to allow access to the variety of visiting NPCs randomly found in different garrisons each day (see below). Any number of friends can come in to your garrison, up to a 40-member raid.\nLike the buildings within them, garrisons initially start at level 1, and can be upgraded from there to level 2, and then level 3. Each level expands the garrison significantly, radically altering the physical zone, adding new building plots and architectural features, and unlocking new building Blueprints. Level 3 also unlocks end-game elements such as the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Support\"&gt;Garrison Support&lt;/a&gt; daily quests and the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Campaign\"&gt;Garrison Campaign&lt;/a&gt; quest line. Upgrading the garrison is achieved through special quests, available at specific points in the character's progress. The level 1 and level 2 garrisons become available through the introductory quest line, while the level 3 garrison is unlocked through reaching level 100. Upgrading the garrison requires a fair amount of gold and Garrison Resources.\nOutposts.\nWhile the introductory quest lines in Draenor's starting zones see the construction of the garrison itself, those in Draenor's other zones involve the construction of an outpost. \nOutposts are essentially small towns, complete with innkeepers, flightmasters and other NPCs, and represent the efforts of the faction to build a base of operations to tackle the threats within that zone. During the initial quest line, the player will be given the choice of two special buildings, each related to the zone in question, only one of which they can choose to construct for their outpost. Once chosen, the building will actually be constructed in the outpost much like a building in the garrison, complete with related NPCs. The choice will also grant access to the corresponding Blueprints, allowing the player to construct the building of the same (or similar) name at their garrison - although the relationship between the outpost building and garrison building generally stops there. Players are however able to purchase Blueprints for all zone-specific buildings at level 100, allowing players to eventually explore all building options, and ensuring that the questing experience is not mandatory in order to fully explore the garrison feature.\nBlueprints aside, the choice of building is only of consequence within the zone involved. Once a building is chosen, the player will be offered a related quest line, and more significantly is granted a permanent zone-specific special effect related to that building, such as the ability to summon a temporary guardian NPC to assist them in battle. These effects are only usable within the corresponding zone. For examples, players questing in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; are given the choice of constructing a Lumber Mill or a Sparring Arena in their Gorgrond outpost. The former grants access to a shredder vehicle and a quest line set in the densely forested south of the zone - while the latter grants the aid of a variety of bodyguards and a quest line set in the zone's rocky and ogre-filled north.\nInteraction.\nWhile at lower levels, garrisons require a reasonable amount of player interaction in order to recruit followers, gather resources and take on missions; as players progress, garrisons become less time-intensive, aiming to reduce player fatigue while continuing to reward participation:\nBuildings.\nBuildings are the individual \"pieces\" of each garrison. They improve and expand the functionality of the garrison, such as by improving the player's ability to recruit, use, and train followers; to craft; to complete missions; to run missions more quickly by reducing followers\u2019 downtime. Buildings can also grant bonuses for play in the rest of the game, including player buffs, once a day free resurrections and access to professions. Players are able to choose from 21 unique building types in total.\nGarrison buildings can be upgraded from level 1 to level 2, then level 3. Upgrading buildings will alter their appearance, causing them to grow larger and more impressive. More importantly, doing so will improve their function, granting additional or increased effects, and increasing &lt;a href=\"Work%20Orders\"&gt;work order&lt;/a&gt; numbers. For example, while a level 1 Barracks unlocks patrol missions, upgrading it to level 2 will allow a follower to escort you in Draenor as your bodyguard, while upgrading it to level 3 increases the number of followers the player is able to have active, as well as unlocking special racial guards and banners.\nProfession buildings allow players with that profession to purchase recipes using a profession-specific currency (which is on a daily cooldown). All players can place work orders to transform baseline materials into high-end materials for that profession. Players without the profession will be able to craft low and mid-level crafted gear/enchants/consumables through an NPC at the building, but high-end items will only be available from players with that profession. Having a profession building is similar to having that profession trained to a lower level, although the limited number of plots will force players to choose which professions to focus on. All professions buildings are small buildings.\nUpgrading and constructing buildings requires the player to have learned the blueprints for the building they wish to build or upgrade, and costs various amounts of &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt; and gold. The player can get a few blueprints by completing specific quests in zones around Draenor that reward a token redeemable at a vendor in &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the blueprints may be purchased from a vendor inside the garrison once they have been unlocked. Once the player has learned the blueprint, they may go to the architect table in their town hall and construct or upgrade the building.\nWork orders.\nMost buildings offer work orders, allowing the player to trade in baseline profession or world resources for refined resources or more &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt;. A level 3 building can have up to 21 work orders outstanding, and a level 3 &lt;a href=\"Storehouse\"&gt;Storehouse&lt;/a&gt; increases that to 36.\nWork orders can be started by speaking to an NPC within the building. Once the player has turned in the required resources, work will begin, with completed orders appearing in a bundle outside the building. Work orders generally take 4 hours to complete, and continue regardless of the player's actions or login status. With level 3 buildings allowing 21 work orders at a time, this allows players to retrieve work orders only once every 3 days if desired, so that they aren't required to keep a constant eye on production. Work orders can be completed immediately using &lt;a href=\"Rush%20Order\"&gt;Rush Order&lt;/a&gt; items.\nAs well as the stated resources, work orders also have a chance to produce Sorcerous items (&lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Air\"&gt;Sorcerous Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Earth\"&gt;Sorcerous Earth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Water\"&gt;Sorcerous Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Fire\"&gt;Sorcerous Fire&lt;/a&gt;) and a very small chance to produce &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollower perks.\nSome followers have specific profession traits that allow them to work at matching profession buildings. These can be assigned through the Architect Table. While a follower is at work at a profession building, collecting work orders from that building will yield double the usual resources. Followers who are working cannot be sent on missions, but do not usually need to be kept at profession buildings; simply put them to work there prior to collecting work orders in order to receive the benefits. Some profession buildings grant additional effects when a follower is working there. For example, assigning a follower to the Herb Garden allows the player to choose which type of herb to grow. While most of these can be accessed on demand, some, such as the Herb Garden, require the follower to remain working there in order to activate the additional effect.\nPlots.\nGarrisons have a number of plots for creating buildings. These come in three sizes: small, medium and large. Each building matches a certain size of plot, with the limited number of available plots forcing players to choose which of the many possible buildings to construct. Players can place buildings according to their own wishes, allowing for a variety of possible garrison designs. Buildings of the same sizes can easily be swapped at the architect table without rebuilding, allowing for refined customization.\nAt specific points, special quests will allow the garrison to be upgraded to the next level, in exchange for a fair amount of gold. Garrison buildings can be upgraded from level 1 to level 2, then level 3. Each level will grant a number of bonuses, such as increased &lt;a href=\"Work%20Orders\"&gt;work order&lt;/a&gt; number, increased mounted travel speed and specific buffs. Most importantly, higher level garrisons also open up more plots for buildings.\nThe player's garrison will offer 1 small and 1 medium building plots at level 1, up to a maximum of 2 large, 2 medium and 3 small plots at level 3.\nStationary buildings.\nThese buildings are given to the player for free after completing quests related to the buildings. They are unable to be moved around the garrison, but can still be upgraded.\nSmall buildings.\nSmall buildings are constructed on small plots, and mostly are for &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s. Most grant partial access to the corresponding profession, while the &lt;a href=\"Storehouse\"&gt;Storehouse&lt;/a&gt; helps out by proving the player with access to a bank, and the &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yard\"&gt;Salvage Yard&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to provide crates of salvage upon mission completion, with a chance to contain items to increase follower's item levels.\nMedium buildings.\nMedium buildings are constructed on medium plots, and provide a variety of benefits around Draenor and in your garrison. The Inn allows the player to find and add followers with specific traits or abilities, and offers another rested area in the garrison. The Barn allows for the trapping of Draenor beasts, providing ways to gain leather, cloth and s. \nLarge buildings.\nLarge buildings are constructed on large plots, and provide a more specialized benefit to the player. The Mage Tower allows the player to open ogre waygates around Draenor, with up to 3 spots for portals around different zones. The Barracks provides an increase in follower capacity, and also lets the player pick a follower to accompany them out into the world to help combat the savage wilds of Draenor.\nConstruction cost.\nConstructing buildings costs varying amounts of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt;. The gold cost is determined purely be level, while the Garrison Resources cost is also affected by the size of the building.\nConstruction sequence.\nAfter completing the Dark Portal counterstrike chain in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, the players will find themselves in /&lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. They will immediately be presented with a quest chain that ends with the construction of a Tier 1 garrison. They will quickly get a quest to build a &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in their only Large building slot.\nFollowers.\nFollowers are the life and soul of a garrison, NPCs that the player can recruit to join them in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Followers can be sent on missions to earn experience and loot for both themselves and the player. They can also be allocated to certain buildings, boosting production from tasks such as crafting or gathering resources and granting special bonuses. Once assigned to a mission, followers' actions will play out whether the player is online or offline. Management of followers is a key feature of garrisons.\nEach follower has a name, character level, item level, class and specialization. Followers may be recruited as uncommon, rare, or epic, and their rarity affects the number of abilities and traits they can have. Followers' rarity can be increased through experience once they reach level 100, and when first recruited, followers also have a chance to be granted a rarity upgrade similarly to quest rewards. Followers also come in types, such as melee, ranged and caster, and players can choose to recruit tank, DPS and healer followers.\nFollowers have a variety of abilities and traits that affect missions and tasks. Each mission offers one or more threats - each belonging to one of that mission's bosses - and countering these threats increases the mission's likelihood of success. For example, if a follower has the Taunt ability, they will be able to counter the Wild Aggression threat. Traits have a smaller impact than abilities, and can increase mission success chance in more synergistic ways, or add other benefits such as increasing experience gained. Some traits are not related to missions but rather to buildings, allowing that follower to be put to work at a specific building within the garrison, doubling &lt;a href=\"work%20order\"&gt;work order&lt;/a&gt; production and granting special bonuses. For example, if a follower has the Enchanting trait, the player will be able to assign them to the &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%27s%20Study\"&gt;Enchanter's Study&lt;/a&gt;, gaining twice as many &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Temporal%20Crystal\"&gt;Fractured Temporal Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s from work orders, and also granting access to unique cosmetic enchantments.\nFollowers can increase in level, rarity and item level by running missions. Followers start at between level 90 and 100, and have a maximum level of 100. Experience gained from missions will cause them to increase in level, allowing them to tackle higher level missions in a similar way to player character level. Once a follower has reached level 100, further experience will allow them to upgrade in rarity until they reach epic rarity. Regular followers cannot exceed epic rarity, although there is one legendary follower - . Once followers reach level 100, it becomes possible to improve the item level of their weapon and armor through special upgrade items provided as mission rewards. All followers start with item level 600 gear, and upgrading it will increase their chance of success against higher item level missions.\nFollowers exist in the garrison game world as NPCs, and feature more dynamic behavior than found in other NPCs. Players will be able to see followers walking around their garrison, while sending followers off on missions will cause them to stop what they are doing and travel together out through the front gate of the garrison. Followers will notice and walk around, rather than through, the player, respond dynamically to inputs such as placement of buildings, and can also be interacted with, with followers /waving to each other and /dancing with the player. Followers will also help the player defend their garrison when it is attacked by hostile NPCs (see below).\nRecruiting followers.\nFollowers must be recruited by the player, which can be achieved through various means. A reasonable number of followers are obtained while leveling to 100, either from quest lines or through encounters within zones, such as &lt;a href=\"Blook\"&gt;Blook&lt;/a&gt;, who must be tracked down atop his lonely perch in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and \"persuaded\" into the player's service through an impressive combat performance. Followers can also be recruited through the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, where a new follower can be chosen from a large range each week. Max-level quest lines, reputation-limited vendors and other means offer further sources of followers once at level 100.\nMissions.\nOne of the main uses of followers is to send them on missions. Missions are special undertakings which the player can send groups of followers to fulfil, ranging from 15 minute Quests to week-long Raids featuring dozens of followers. Successful missions can reward resources for developing the garrison and crafting reagents, as well as actual player loot usable by the character. In addition, missions serve to earn followers experience, slowly increasing their level and improving their abilities.\nEach mission has its own name, follower level (similar to player instances), specific duration, group size requirement, and other characteristics. Players can view available missions through the interface and choose which followers to send on a mission. Some missions are unlocked through having specific buildings. Missions are specific to the garrisons feature, and are not related to any playable content.\nPlayers can choose to send their followers on four different types of mission:\nQuests.\nQuests are very quick and generally used to level up your followers. Higher level quests can yield player loot.\nScenarios.\nSending your followers on a scenario will take longer, but has a higher chance to yield player loot.\nDungeons.\nDungeons are much more difficult and take longer, but are guaranteed to yield player loot.\nRaids.\nRaids unlock when you get 10 followers to level 100. Occasionally you will receive transmog missions for older raids.\nRewards.\nEach mission offers a special reward, available only if the mission is successfully completed. There are several types of reward, including player and follower XP, player and follower gear, Garrison Resources, and others such as contracts granting new followers.\nPlayer gear granted by missions will include some normal mode raid pieces and maybe a few heroic raid quality items towards the end of the raid tier. Mythic raiders will be fine without making use of their garrisons.\nAll missions also reward experience (XP) for followers, allowing them to level up. This XP is rewarded regardless of whether the mission is a success or a failure. Many missions also offer bonus XP as a reward for successfully completing the mission. Followers that are 3 or more levels below the mission level will only receive 10% of the mission XP and bonus XP.\nGarrison Blueprints.\nGarrison Blueprints are plans used to learn how to construct or upgrade buildings around your garrison. \nObtaining Blueprints.\nBlueprints are obtained in a few different ways, depending on the level and size of the Blueprints. Players may level through zones, allowing them to pick a building as an outpost and receiving that building's blueprint for the garrison, or at level 100 players may purchase blueprints from a vendor to acquire those that they missed during the leveling process. \nMonuments and pristine archaeology artifacts.\nAt Tier 3, garrisons also feature monuments and the ability to display &lt;a href=\"pristine\"&gt;pristine&lt;/a&gt; archaeology finds.\nMonuments can be earned by completing achievements. They can then be displayed on one of the three monument bases in the garrison. There are currently six known, with five available.\nPristine archaeology artifacts can be collected by completing the various &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; artifacts around Draenor and obtaining a pristine version. Once the player is level 100, the artifacts can be turned in at the player's Town Hall and displayed in the back room on tables, pedestals, and hung on the wall. These are permanent objects that, unlike at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be read (likely to reduce garrison server load).\nInvasions.\nGarrisons will sometimes be invaded by \"the enemies of Draenor\". Players will be able to defend their garrison with help from their followers and up to 2 friends. These assaults will happen repeatedly, and will get harder as time goes on.\nAt certain points, the player will be notified that an invasion is approaching. This is intended to occur ostensibly as a result of the player provoking the local Iron Horde forces through their actions in the area. When ready, the player can speak to an NPC to start the invasion.\nEach invasion sees attack by a variety of NPCs invading the base, and engaging in combat with the garrison's defenders. There are 6 or 7 different types of invasion, with each playing out differently. Invasions make use of new AI technology to randomise the experience, with invaders sometimes attacking NPCs or the garrison walls, and at others kidnapping followers. Objectives include defeating snipers and stealthed assassins who are picking off the garrison's defenders, and healing injured defenders before they die. Objectives are marked on the mini-map for players to see. Guards and buildings destroyed by invading forces will be replaced following the invasion.\nYou do not have to do the invasion immediately, despite your garrison UI indicator blinking. If you talk to the quest giver but do not start it, and then come back and find it is \"failed\", you can abandon the quest - you'll be able to pick it right back up and start the invasion.\nSuccess.\nSuccess in repelling invasions is measured by the number of enemies defeated and the number of guards and buildings that survive.\nPerformance is graded similarly to &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt; dungeons, with players awarded a Bronze, Silver or Gold medal, higher medals offering superior rewards. All players taking part in an invasion will be able to gain rewards from it. Each player can gain each medal once per week. After that, they can still gain Garrison Resources for completing invasions.\nHaving a larger number of players will improve the player's chances of attaining the higher rewards. In this way, garrisons are intended to encourage players to group with their friends, with each potentially taking turns to assist the others in their own invasions.\nTriggering invasions.\nThe first garrison invasion occurs after the player has improved their garrison to Tier 2, intended to be approximately mid-way through the Frostfire Ridge or Shadowmoon Valley questing experience. However, it is possible to reach Tier 3 before this invasion takes place.\nOnce the player reaches max level, invasions will be triggered \"organically\" by player actions within the wider world. These will primarily by triggered through actions in and around &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt; mission areas.\nVisitors.\nOne of four visitors will visit the garrisons of level 100 characters with a Tier 3 town hall each day. Each character is random, but the four visitors and the quests they offer are the same region-wide. That is, if one player has the fur trader in his or her town hall, all characters with a trader will have the fur trader, and no characters will have the herb or ore traders that day. Players need to visit other players' garrisons to pick up quests, but can turn in at their own garrison.\nBounty daily.\nBounty dailies, offered by &lt;a href=\"Renzik%20%22The%20Shiv%22\"&gt;Renzik \"The Shiv\"&lt;/a&gt; to Alliance characters and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Ty%27jin\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Ty'jin&lt;/a&gt; to Horde characters, are Group-3 quests that have players kill the specified bounty. Each bounty quest awards and a slim chance to loot the &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Stack%20of%20Invitations\"&gt;Bloody Stack of Invitations&lt;/a&gt; from the bounty.\nDungeon daily.\nDungeon dailies, offered by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to Alliance characters and &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; to Horde characters, task players to complete the specified \"Warlords of Draenor\" dungeon. The specified dungeon does not have to be completed in Heroic mode, but does require that the attempting character be level 100. Each dungeon quest awards .\nRaid weekly.\nRaid quests are once-weekly endeavors, and require the completion of a single specified raid encounter. They are offered by the same NPC as the Dungeon dailies, and at the same time. These quests can be accomplished on any difficulty level, from Raid Finder to Mythic, and will award a cache of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bounty%20Spoils\"&gt;Greater Bounty Spoils&lt;/a&gt; and . The spoils contain an item level 645 or 655 token, but the contents do not depend on the encounter difficulty.\nProfession daily.\nFive profession dailies are available, trading \"Warlords\" crafting reagents for &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Spirit\"&gt;Primal Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike the other daily quests, players need only to be level 90 to complete the daily quest. Also, rather than the vendors being randomly available, they appear in a set pattern: ore, dust, fur, leather, herb. After the daily quest, the traders also exchange the same reagents for a lesser quantity of Primal Spirits and additionally sell recipes for professions that use the reagent items.\nRelic daily.\n&lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt; offers one of six quest lines daily. The initial quests are linked here, but see the full series on each quest page. Completing all six quest chains awards the achievement &lt;a href=\"Master%20Relic%20Hunter\"&gt;Master Relic Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, needed for &lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Call%20Me%20Junior\"&gt;Don't Call Me Junior&lt;/a&gt;, which awards Harrison Jones as a follower! The final quest in the chain awards .\nJukebox.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1\"&gt;Patch 6.1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Jukebox\"&gt;Garrison Jukebox&lt;/a&gt; can be unlocked after completing a fetch quest, allowing players to change the music that plays in their garrison. 31 tracks are available from such varied sources as fishing in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Cavern\"&gt;Forlorn Cavern&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt;, to chests next to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to \nraid encounters like &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%27s%20End\"&gt;Nefarian's End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Madness of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nA full list is found in the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Jukebox\"&gt;Garrison Jukebox&lt;/a&gt; article.\nGarrison decorations.\n&lt;a href=\"Izzy%20Hollyfizzle\"&gt;Izzy Hollyfizzle&lt;/a&gt; will sell decorations for garrisons, in exchange for special resources available only during the &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt; events. There are several kinds of decorations, each adding new NPCs, objects and/or cosmetic effects to the player's garrison.\nOnce purchased, the items can be used to create the desired decorations. The decorations can be removed by speaking to Izzy Hollyfizzle again. Decorations are not time-limited, and can be used at any time of year. Multiple decorations can be combined for intense effect.\nStoryline.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Campaign\"&gt;Garrison Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach week characters with a level 3 garrison will be offered a Garrison Campaign quest. The quest is the same across all characters. Sometimes the quests can result in permanent upgrades to the garrison (like a mole machine that teleports the character to their outpost in Gorgrond).\n&lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Support\"&gt;Garrison Support&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters with a level 3 garrison will be provided with a choice of two random assault missions daily, only one of which can be completed each time. These assault missions take place across Draenor and reward a large number of &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPhasing.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt;, each &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; has their own, individual garrison. That garrison cannot be visited by anyone who has not been given permission to enter.\nDevelopment.\nGarrisons were partly conceived as a way of incorporating the concept of player housing found in other games into \"World of Warcraft\", but in a very \"Warcraft\" way. The developers had discussed the concept of adding player housing for \"a long time\" prior to \"Warlords\", but wanted to find a way to have the feature change the way people played the game, rather than merely providing a cosmetic addition. \n\"Warlords of Draenor\" provided \"the perfect time\" to implement player housing, with the storyline stranding players on an alternate Draenor, needing to build a base for their operations against the Iron Horde. The garrison was intended to be reminiscent of the \"Warcraft\" RTS games, with the player slowly developing a base of operations in a new region. The garrison was also intended to provide a form of external character progression, allowing max level players to continue to progress in the world. Garrisons also help to create a sense of importance and standing for characters themselves, with the player in charge of a sprawling base inhabited by NPCs which salute the player and refer to them as \"Commander\".\nAnother important development aspect was for the garrison to be integrated into levelling and activities in other zones, and to remain relevant at max level. The developers also wanted the garrison to feel \"part of the world\" rather than a separate feature. This was achieved through the incorporation of garrison-related quests, special abilities usable in each zone, and loot rewards from follower missions.\nIterations.\nThe garrison feature went through significant alterations following its original announcement at Blizzcon 2013:"}

He, like &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, has a sense of humor.\nBiography.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; arrived to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and took to safeguarding the powerful artifacts and magical lore within the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, for countless generations. At an unknown point in time, Azuregos would arrive to Azshara, which caused rumors that suggested that items of extreme significance, perhaps the fabled &lt;a href=\"The%20Vials%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Vials of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; themselves, may have been found in the wilderness of Azshara. Whatever Azuregos sought, one thing was certain: he would fight to the death to defend Azshara's magical treasures, and to that end he could be found in southeastern Azshara guarding the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scepter of the Shifting Sands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;scepter&lt;/a&gt; was created to make it possible to reopen the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;. The scepter was shattered however by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, and the shards were divided amongst the four mighty &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, in the hopes that it would be nearly impossible to reunite the pieces by anyone seeking to unleash the horrors of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; kept one piece to himself and gave the others to &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, and Azuregos.\nAs soon as &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; charged him with protecting the scepter shard, Azuregos knew he was in for an eternity of headache and pain. All he wanted to do was study the magic rich shorelines of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and take in what artifacts might remain from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. He held the scepter shard for 500 years and he thought it was nothing but trouble. It attracted all kinds of attention. He wanted to be left alone to his studies, not babysit some would-be hero's ticket to glory. So he gave it to a very special minnow, &lt;a href=\"Maws\"&gt;Maws&lt;/a&gt;. Any champion seeking to reunite the Scepter would come searching for Azuregos and face quite a challenge in order to claim the shard.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; sent agents to assassinate the rest of the weakened blue flight. When adventurers sought him out on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, they learned that Azuregos had not been seen since a group of bloodthirsty adventurers came through on some sort of quest to make a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Sinew%20Wrapped%20Lamina\"&gt;now-useless quiver&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually discovered hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;, where he had formed a relationship with a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anara\"&gt;Anara&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually agreed to help Kalecgos fight the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, but strongly disapproved of him becoming the new Aspect of Magic.\nAfter Azuregos aided Kalec in defeating &lt;a href=\"Malicion\"&gt;Malicion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Katrana\"&gt;Twilight Lord Katrana&lt;/a&gt;, both dragons departed Azshara with the intention of remaining discrete for a while.\nLegion.\nAzuregos returned to the now-abandoned &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to secure the magical artifacts contained within the vault, but was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; which had taken up residence. Bound by ethereal void energies, he was freed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;'s behest and together they took down &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt;. Azuregos stayed behind to secure the Nexus so it will not fall into the wrong hands again, giving his regards to Kalecgos.\nDragonflight.\nAzuregos remained in charge of the Oculus for several years, conducting research. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he ignored the summons of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Then at one point, hostile arcane memories suddenly appeared all over the Nexus. He fought against them and relocated to a northwestern chamber where soon Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;'s simulacrum, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; teleported in from the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;. Bitter as ever towards Kalecgos, Sindragosa reprimanded him, and he was told of their plan to locate the remaining blue dragons across the world. Since the memories were formed when Kalecgos had released the essences of Malygos and Sindragosa in the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, Azuregos agreed to aid in tracking the other blue dragons under the condition they take care of the arcane memories at the Nexus. He gave the adventurer one of his many staves, and they used it to battle the memories at the entrances to the Nexus.\nAfter the threat of the memories was calmed down, Azuregos created a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Locator\"&gt;magical globe&lt;/a&gt; to help find the other dragons across Azeroth. He gave it to Kalecgos and resolved to continue investigating the memories. As Kalecgos left, Sindragosa revealed that she knew why he was in seclusion in the Nexus - to find a way to tear barriers of realms in order to bring &lt;a href=\"Anara\"&gt;the one he once loved&lt;/a&gt; back to the world of the living. She advised him to instead turn to his draconic brethren who could help him.\nAzuregos later personally traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to seek out &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt;, who had traveled there while hunting a rouge mage group known as the &lt;a href=\"Sullied%20Banner\"&gt;Sullied Banner&lt;/a&gt;. He had also correctly anticipated that Kalecgos and the adventurer would travel to the ruins as well. The group discovered that the Sullied Banner were attempted to create the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; that had destroyed Theramore and called for the mages to be subdued instead of killed, which surprised Azuregos who noted that he believed that the encounter with &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; would have relieved him of that impulse. However, Kalecgos was adamant and pointed out how every time Malyogs intervened in the affairs of mortals, mages died which just continued a cycle of destruction that he had no desire to perpetuate. Though disagreeing with his methods, his fellow dragons agreed to follow his lead. When Azuregos continued to argue the point, Kalec revealed that the Sullied Banner flew the flag of Theramore and were grieving, fearing for their lives, and expressed hope that they could be reasoned with. After the leader of the mages, &lt;a href=\"Turi%20Flickerflame\"&gt;Turi Flickerflame&lt;/a&gt;, was apprehended Azuregos admitted that he didn't think Kalecgos' plan would work and declared that he had cleaned things up rather nicely.\nAs the blue dragonflight reunited at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt;, Azuregos continued to investigate Sindragosa and Malygos's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; memories, where he discovered that they were destroying the Veiled Ossuary and called upon Kalecgos for aid. While Kalecgos remained behind at the Azure Archives and worked with the simulacrum of Sindragosa to devise a plan, he sent &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanigosa\"&gt;Lanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, Surigosa, and &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt; to aid him. Working together the group were able to deduce that the violent deaths that Malygos and Sindragosa experienced had left them stranded in their final moments, thus Azuregos and the others recovered their essences and brought them back to Kalec at the Azure Archives. Kalecgos subsequently thanked the group for their efforts and revealed that he and the simulacrum of Sindragosa had devised a plan, though it was a dangerous one. Working together as one, the blue dragonflight used the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy within the Azure Archives to break the loop of death that Malygos and Sindragosa had found themselves trapped in. After Malygos and Sindragosa were properly soothed and released from their torment, Azuregos and the rest of the blue dragonflight witnessed them departing to the afterlife and then subsequently watched the last flight of &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; as he decided that the time had come for his long life to end at last.\nIn the aftermath, Kalecgos declared that the Azure Archives was the new home of the dragonflight to which Azuregos noted that the Archives were bigger than the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Vault\"&gt;the vaults&lt;/a&gt; seemed to have more knowledge that he hadn't recorded yet. While Lanigosa decided to join him in studying the vaults, the other dragons decided to rotate as to who would watch over the Nexus in Azuregos' absence.\nQuests.\nHe only appears in &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; events.

The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; Azuregos is a trusted servant of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. As a blue dragon he is incredibly interested in magical artifacts and their protection. For this reason he guarded the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, in modern day Azshara.\nSince &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2013th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 13th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, Azuregos is available during the anniversary event.\nBiography.\nFrom the official \"&lt;a href=\"Game%20Guide/Raid%20Areas%23Azuregos\"&gt;Raid Areas&lt;/a&gt;\" article:\nTactics.\nAbilities.\nAzuregos is immune to arcane spells and is very frost-resistant. His powers include:\nStrategy.\nOnce Azuregos has been aggroed, all the DPS and healers stand at his sides within teleport range. Melee attack on his sides to avoid his breath and other frontal attacks. The MT keeps Azuregos facing parallel to the dps/heal groups. A few healers keep the MT(s) up while the other concentrate on keeping everyone up.\nIt is key for everyone to be in teleport range when the teleport happens, as this clears his aggro. Each time a teleport occurs everyone runs back to their side positions. ALL DPS AND HEALING must STOP until the MT has aggro again; it is usually sufficient to give the MT 5 seconds before the rest of the raid unloads. DPS resumes until the teleport happens again. Obviously use potions and bandages as necessary after teleports. Rinse and repeat until Azuregos goes down.\nIf any casters need to drink, wait until the next teleport and then run away from the raid. Otherwise you will be the only person on Azuregos' aggro table and he will come after you.\nMages should keep themselves buffed with &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Ward\"&gt;Frost Ward&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireballs&lt;/a&gt; are not allowed, for three reasons: 1) When the magic shield goes up, it hurts a lot less 2) The scorch debuff does not stack up like the fireball one does 3) Quick casting time lets you get more in between teleports.\nThis fight is mana intensive. Curse of Elements and Judgement of Wisdom should be on the dragon at all times. If you have any &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Spring%20Totem\"&gt;mana spring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;mana tide&lt;/a&gt; should be up whenever possible.\nGreater Frost Protection Potions are very helpful in this fight. They require 1 elemental water, 1 dreamfoil, and 1 crystal vial.\nThere is no legitimate means to remove Mark of Frost.\nThe best place to put a low-level alt as a lookout is on a hill at .\nLoot.\nWotLK notes.\nAzuregos can once again be soloed by a hunter (3.0.3) and possibly any class that can out-heal the damage. Where it once took hours now just takes less than thirty minutes to accomplish.\nAzuregos can be soloed in under 10 minutes. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJzfNnrmSB80%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dplayer_embedded\"&gt;This video documents&lt;/a&gt; a Death Knight (3.2) out-healing the DPS output of this boss.\nQuotes.\nPre-Aggro\nYou seek to harm me, &lt;race&gt;?\nAggro\nArcane Vacuum\nKill"}

Remaining mostly untouched by sapient races until recently, the land has changed a great deal due to the recent crash of a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; inter-dimensional generation ship. Powerful and ominous crystals dot the lands, and energy storms ripple through the sky. The draenei capital city, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", is built around their crashed ship in the western part of Azuremyst Isle.\nEvidence that parts of the crashed ship are tainting and mutating the natural flora and fauna of the island has become apparent. The draenei are working to halt and if possible reverse these mutations as soon as possible, to restore the natural beauty and health of the island.\nHistory.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nVery little history is known of Azuremyst Isle and the surrounding islands. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; once populated the isles in large numbers. Ancient night elven ruins predating the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; are found scattered about both Azuremyst and Bloodmyst, most of them now inhabited by vile &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The remains of an elvish city can be seen at what is now &lt;a href=\"Wrathscale%20Point\"&gt;Wrathscale Point&lt;/a&gt; on southwestern Azuremyst. When the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the night elves had mostly abandoned these islands in favor of mainland Kalimdor. On the southern &lt;a href=\"Silvermyst%20Isle\"&gt;Silvermyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a dock and house of night elf architecture marks the dwelling of a family of night elves who made their home here. This settlement was later destroyed by deranged &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; is a small harbor operated by the night elves, connecting Azuremyst Isle to the mainland of Kalimdor.\nNot visited often by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; due to their out-of-the-way location, the isles' indigenous creatures have been left to their own devices over the centuries. Several tribes of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s live on the island, including the &lt;a href=\"Bristlelimb%20tribe\"&gt;Bristlelimb&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20tribe\"&gt;Stillpine&lt;/a&gt;. Due to being so far removed from their cousins in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, some of these furbolgs have remained uncorrupted, though they have recently been driven out of their ancestral holdings. &lt;a href=\"Owlbeast\"&gt;Owlbeast&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit the eastern &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Silvermyst%20Isle\"&gt;Silvermyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Siltfin%20tribe\"&gt;Siltfin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit the western shores of both Azuremyst and Silvermyst isles.\nThe island suffered extensive damage during the crash landing of the \"Exodar\", affecting and mutating its wildlife. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, however, the draenei had mostly reverted the damage. It was also not heavily affected by the Cataclysm itself. Thousands of the draenei have settled on the Azuremyst Isles.\nProphet's Lesson.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, rumors had spread that the draenei withstood the breaking of the world, and that refuge could be found on Azuremyst Isle. &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s arrived in lost humility at first, in ones and twos, by leaky boat and makeshift raft, risking the unknown to flee the horribly known. In the beginning, the draenei had aided as they could, giving the refugees a place outside the \"Exodar\", healing them, and sharing food and water. But then the outcasts had begun sending out word to find their friends and families, and the call echoed throughout Kalimdor: \"The Prophet holds Azuremyst safe. The Prophet foresaw the Cataclysm and will make everything right.\" and the refugee camp quickly grew and boasted a thousand exiles. When the draenei tested the nearly repaired \"Exodar\", the refugees thought the draenei were going to leave Azeroth, and started rioting. The riots escalated and both human and draenei were wounded in the conflict. The riots were stopped when High Prophet Velen spoke collectively to both sites, and not long after the refugees started returning to their former homes, to help rebuild after the Cataclysm.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Azuremyst Isle and the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" were &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the conflict, the area became a staging ground for the quest to invade &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and stop the Legion once and for all. The island's western shore was where the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were training. The \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", a draenei ship that provided passage to Argus could be seen hovering above the island.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, some of the survivors were evacuated to Azuremyst. The evacuation was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Dentaria%20Silverglade\"&gt;Dentaria Silverglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nArcane storms strike this peaceful area off the coast of Kalimdor. Evergreens and purple flowers cover the land. The island itself is divided into two parts by the &lt;a href=\"Crystalbrook%20River\"&gt;Crystalbrook River&lt;/a&gt;, running north-south. The eastern, slightly smaller region is dubbed &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt;, as it is sheltered by hills on all sides. To the southwest lies &lt;a href=\"Silvermyst%20Isle\"&gt;Silvermyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, close enough to reach by swimming without difficulty, and small enough to be considered part of the main island.\nAzuremyst Isle contains no dungeons, raid dungeons, micro dungeons, or battlegrounds. It is the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and contains a 1-5 leveling area, &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei city, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", can also be found in this zone with a flight path to &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The mainland is accessible by boat from &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; or by flight path from the \"Exodar\", both going to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunderstorms and foggy nights are common in the area.\nTravel hubs.\nHorde.\nTo reach the island as a Horde character you first have to fly to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. From there you can take the boat from &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable NPCs.\nAzuremyst Isle is the new home of several notable people; not all of the draenei. At the Crash Site in Ammen Vale, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Aldar\"&gt;Vindicator Aldar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Technician%20Zhanaa\"&gt;Technician Zhanaa&lt;/a&gt; work tirelessly to keep in contact with other draenei scattered across the island. At Azure Watch, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Menelaous\"&gt;Exarch Menelaous&lt;/a&gt; watches over the people of the village. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Odesyus\"&gt;Admiral Odesyus&lt;/a&gt;, recently forced to land on the southern coast of the island, does his best to root out the traitors in his crew and help his newfound allies, the draenei. And &lt;a href=\"High%20Chief%20Stillpine\"&gt;High Chief Stillpine&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid from the newly arrived draenei to take back Stillpine Hold.\nQuests.\nThe quests of Azuremyst Isle range from the early level 1-5 quests of &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt; to the level 5-10 quests of the main isle. Quests of note include the quest chain, in which draenei learn the language of the furbolgs; a quest chain involving &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Odesyus\"&gt;Admiral Odesyus&lt;/a&gt; as he hunts down the traitor in his crew; and quests given by the furbolgs of &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20Hold\"&gt;Stillpine Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the 1-5 quests are draenei-only, but the 6+ quests are available to any race."}

This farthest west part of the land was mostly untamed by the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; historians, it was left unsettled on purpose so that hungry beasts could feed off the land and hunters could trap the choicest prey. Despite being untamed, there was some &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; presence, including a city, judging by the presence of their ruins on them (and the fact that the area northwest of Mount Hyjal )\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; rent the world, Azuremyst split off and trapped all life here with it. The plants and animals that survived slowly adapted to the harsh new environment. With the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth not long before the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; caused chaos in the area. Their vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" - a satellite of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; - crash-landed on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; (the island from which the chain gets its name) and crystals from its superstructure are strewn throughout the island chain, causing severe damage to the islands' ecosystems and angering the elemental spirits. Some areas have a red tinge to the air and plant life. Many creatures of the isles have mutated from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Radiation\"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt;, and some even have become hostile and grown unnatural in size.\nThe draenei are unable to clear away the toxic blight.\nGeography.\nAzuremyst Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; is the southwestern of the two islands, and forms the starting zone to the playable &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; race. The crash-landed &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; vessel \"Exodar\" can be found on the western coast of the island and currently serves as the capital of the draenei on Azeroth. The island itself is divided into two parts by a river running north-south, the eastern and slightly smaller region dubbed &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt;, as it is sheltered by hills on all sides. To the south lies &lt;a href=\"Silvermyst%20Isle\"&gt;Silvermyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, close enough to reach by swimming without difficulty, and small enough to be considered part of the main island. Azuremyst Isle contains no dungeons, raid dungeons, micro dungeons, or battlegrounds. It is the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and contains a 1-5 leveling area, &lt;a href=\"Ammen%20Vale\"&gt;Ammen Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei city, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", can also be found in this zone with a flight path to &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The only access to the remainder of Kalimdor is by boat to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; at the southern edge of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodmyst Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, named as Silvergale by the draenei before they saw the full damage, is the northern of the two major isles of the Azuremyst Isles. Bloodmyst is often the next step in the journey for ambitious young draenei. The island is divided into two sections by a narrow strip of water. The smaller section, which is connected by bridge to Azuremyst Isle, is yet untainted by the red mist which covers the main part of the island. There are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds on Bloodmyst Isle. The micro dungeon, the &lt;a href=\"Vector%20Coil\"&gt;Vector Coil&lt;/a&gt;, can be found here. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt; serves as the zone's travel hub, connecting it to Azuremyst Isle."}

The BLP file structure consists of a header, up to 16 mipmaps of the texture, and a palette. Texture sizes must be powers of two, though the two dimensions do not have to be equal; 512x256 is valid, but 512x200 is not. The first mipmap (mipmap #0) is the full size image; each subsequent mipmap halves both dimensions. The final mipmap should be 1x1.\nInstead of converting to BLP files (see the end of this article for converters), the WoW engine also accepts &lt;a href=\"TGA%20files\"&gt;TGA files&lt;/a&gt;, which can be edited directly in graphics editors.\nThe .BLP header.\n struct blp2header {\n uint8_t ident[4]; // \"BLP2\" magic number\n uint32_t type; // Texture type: 0 = JPG, 1 = S3TC\n uint8_t compression; // Compression mode: 1 = raw, 2 = DXTC\n uint8_t alpha_bits; // 0, 1, 4, or 8\n uint8_t alpha_type; // 0, 1, 7, or 8\n uint8_t has_mips; // 0 = no mips levels, 1 = has mips (number of levels determined by image size)\n uint32_t width; // Image width in pixels\n uint32_t height; // Image height in pixels\n uint32_t mipmap_offsets[16]; // The file offsets of each mipmap, 0 for unused\n uint32_t mipmap_lengths[16]; // The length of each mipmap data block\n } blp2header;\n\"World of Warcraft\" does not use JPG textures. A discussion of BLP files using JPG compression is beyond the scope of this article. The type flag should always be 1, which indicates the use of either RAW, DXT1, DXT3, or DXT5 compression. Each compression type will be covered separately.\nThe .BLP color palette.\nThe header is always followed by a 256-entry color table. Each entry a 32-bit BGRA 8888 value. This table is only used for RAW images, but is present in all BLPs regardless.\nRAW compression.\nRAW1.\nIf codice_1 is set to 1, each mipmap is stored as an array of 8-bit values, one per pixel, left to right, top to bottom. Each value is an index to the palette.\nIf codice_2 is greater than 0, an alpha channel will immediately follow the image data, and comes in 1, 4, and 8 bit varieties. The 1 and 4 bit versions have multiple values packed into a single byte, with the least significant bit belonging to the first packed value.\nRAW3.\nWith the codice_1 set to 3, each mipmap contains what appears to be 32 bit BGRA data. codice_2 seems to represent a set of bit flags rather than depth, as all images of this type seem to have 4 bytes per pixel regardless of depth, and it has been seen to exceed 8. Their meaning is unknown.\nDXTn compression.\nIf codice_1 is set to 2, each mipmap is composed of 4\u00d74 blocks of pixels. The blocks and the pixels within each block are ordered from left to right, top to bottom.\nSee for the technical details.\nDXT1.\nIf codice_6 is 0, then DXT1 compression is used.\nEach block is 64 bits and begins with two 16 bit values, and are used to derived a 4 color palette.\nThe values are interpreted as 565 RGB colors, with the least significant bits corresponding to blue, to create the first two colors in the palette.\nIf the first value is less than or equal to the second, the final entry of the palette is reserved. If codice_2 is 0, the reserved color is black. If codice_2 is 1, the reserved color is transparent.\nThe remaining colors are created by interpolating between the first two colors in the palette.\nThe remaining 32 bits are 16 2-bit values acting as a lookups to specify the colors in the block.\nDXT3.\nIf codice_6 is 1, then DXT3 compression is used.\nEach block is 128 bits and begins identically to DXT1, except that no special color is reserved in the palette.\nIt is followed by 16 4-bit values corresponding to the alpha values for each of the pixels in the block.\nDXT5.\nIf codice_6 is 7, then DXT5 compression is used. This format was first used for Burning Crusade images.\nEach block is 128 bits and begins with two 8-bit values to create an 8 element lookup table for alpha values.\nThe first two elements in the lookup table are copies of those values.\nIf the first value is less than or equal to the second, the final two entries of the lookup table are reserved for transparent and opaque.\nThe remaining entries are created by interpolating between the first two entries in the lookup table.\nThe next 48 bits make up 16 3-bit values acting as lookups specifying the alpha values for each of the pixels in the block.\nThe remaining 64 bits are identical to DXT1, except that no special color is reserved in the palette.\nSample Files.\nBelow is a list of BLP files, each with some unique characteristic.\nThe following files require an MPQ viewer to access, as they aren't exposed by Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3Flocale%3Den_US%26amp%3BarticleId%3D21466\"&gt;AddOn Kit&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversion tools.\nThere exist BLP tools to convert both from and to the BLP format. They can be found in &lt;a href=\"UI%20FAQ/AddOn%20Author%20Resources%23Resources\"&gt;UI Authors resource list&lt;/a&gt;."}

If BRB is to mean \"time to take a general bathroom break\", it is advisable to set a time limit by saying \"BRB, everyone be back in 5 minutes\", since it would be ineffective to leave it open to allow everyone to return at their own leisure.\nThere is also an in-game emote activated by codice_1. This is very handy if you wish to inform a member of the opposite faction that you are AFK or that you will return soon after moving your character away to do something."}

Pets are also a source of damage and &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s, working together alongside the hunter's own attacks to bring a target down.\nTypes of pets.\nPet families.\nEach hunter pet belongs to a specific family of &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s, based on its species. Some families are fairly specific, like the &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt; family; others are looser groupings, like the &lt;a href=\"scalehide\"&gt;scalehide&lt;/a&gt; family, which contains &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mushan\"&gt;mushan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ankylodon\"&gt;ankylodon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPet specializations.\nEach pet has one of three specializations, determined by its pet family. This specialization grants the pet a passive ability and an active ability:\nPrior to \"\", pet specialization could be changed after taming, and it had a more profound effect on a pet's role in combat. Cunning pets, for example, did less damage than Ferocity pets but offered a variety of &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;-oriented abilities. Now, each specialization deals the same amount of damage, and the two spec-specific abilities are the only difference.\nObtaining pets.\nStarter pets.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet&lt;/a&gt; and other pet utilities aren't learned until level 5; as a result, level 1 hunters no longer start with a pet. Only &lt;a href=\"Class%20Trial\"&gt;Class Trial&lt;/a&gt; characters and &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s receive a starter pet upon creation.\n&lt;a href=\"Class%20Trial\"&gt;Class Trial&lt;/a&gt; hunter characters start with a brown-and-gray classic &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;. Its internal name is &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/npc%3D165189/generic-hunter-pet\"&gt;Generic Hunter Pet&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;Allied race&lt;/a&gt; characters, on the other hand, begin with a pet specific to their race. Although the pets shown for some races on the &lt;a href=\"character%20creation%20screen\"&gt;character creation screen&lt;/a&gt; were changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt; (for instance, &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; are now shown with a &lt;a href=\"panthara\"&gt;panthara&lt;/a&gt;), none of the allied races' starter pets were actually changed.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, all level 1 &lt;a href=\"core%20race\"&gt;core race&lt;/a&gt; hunters also started with a race-specific pet, listed below for historical purposes.\nTaming.\nOther pets can be obtained once a hunter gains the &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;Tame Beast&lt;/a&gt; ability at level 5. Tame Beast can only be used on &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s (and &lt;a href=\"mechanicize%20animals\"&gt;mechanical beasts&lt;/a&gt;) at or below the hunter's level. During the taming process, the hunter cannot perform any other actions without canceling.\nThe taming process takes 6 seconds; its &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;cast time&lt;/a&gt; is not pushed back by damage taken, but it can be &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ed. If the hunter loses &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; to another player, the tame will fail.\nNote that not all beasts can be tamed. Only specific species are tameable, and even among those species, some &lt;a href=\"rare%20mob\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; individuals and &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s may be immune to taming. Other species are tameable only by &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Mastery\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; hunters, who gain the &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; passive at level 65. &lt;a href=\"Critter\"&gt;Critter&lt;/a&gt;s are never tameable, even beast-sized ones such as &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"giraffe\"&gt;giraffe&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Pet%20family%23List%20of%20families\"&gt;list of pet families&lt;/a&gt; for information on what species can be tamed.\nExile's Reach.\nHunter characters who start on &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt; get to tame a pet specific to their race, similar to a starter pet. The beast is first seen as an NPC on the Alliance or Horde ship, then it disappears until &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20the%20Stalker\"&gt;Hunting the Stalker&lt;/a&gt; later in the storyline. In the next quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20Taming\"&gt;The Art of Taming&lt;/a&gt;, the hunter is allowed to tame it.\nTaming challenges.\nTaming challenges allow hunters to tame beasts, but with more of a challenge, often requiring special tactics not required for normal pets. The following beasts offer these challenges:\nA different type of challenge was introduced in \"\", where the following beasts would be hidden and hard to see tracks had to be followed in order to find the invisible beasts. Only &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt; would reveal the following:\nA hidden quest and a dropped item help you tame two challenging beasts in \"\" including:\nPet management.\nFeeding.\n&lt;a href=\"Feed%20Pet\"&gt;Feed Pet&lt;/a&gt; allows hunters to heal their pets for 50% of their health while out of combat. It's a convenient way to minimize downtime between fights since it heals instantly and for much more than &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt;.\nRenaming.\nBy default, pets will begin with a basic name\u2014generally the name of their pet family, such as \"Bear\" or \"Cat\". Hunters can replace this with a custom name by right-clicking on the pet's &lt;a href=\"portrait\"&gt;portrait&lt;/a&gt; and selecting \"Rename\" from the menu.\nAfter a pet has been given a custom name, it can only be renamed again with &lt;a href=\"Certificate%20of%20Ownership\"&gt;Certificate of Ownership&lt;/a&gt;, an item created with &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;. There's no limit on how many times a pet can be renamed, though a new certificate is needed each time.\nStabling.\nUp to five pets can be kept active at once, depending on the hunter's level. In order to tame any more pets, existing ones must either be stabled or abandoned.\nTo stable a pet simply talk to a &lt;a href=\"stable%20master\"&gt;stable master&lt;/a&gt;, select the \"\" option, and drag the pet's icon from an active slot on the left to a stable slot on the right. Up to 50 pets can be stabled at once, allowing hunters to \"store\" pets for later use or for collection purposes.\nAbandoning.\nTo get rid of a pet, right-click its &lt;a href=\"portrait\"&gt;portrait&lt;/a&gt; and select \"Abandon Pet.\" Keep in mind that this is permanent, so be careful not to abandon the wrong pet.\nFighting alongside your pet.\nGenerally, a Hunter will send the pet in from a distance and allow it to get &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; on a mob before opening fire. Try to keep the mob on the pet so you can use the full power of your ranged weapon to take it down.\nA nice trick is to use your pet to pull mobs that are out of range towards you. Use &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt; to send your pet in and as soon as it attracts the attention of the mob, use &lt;a href=\"Follow\"&gt;Follow&lt;/a&gt; to call the pet back. The pet will start running towards you and the mob will follow. Once the mob is within range, use &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt; again. The pet will turn around and attack the mob, and you can use your ranged weapon on it. This pull works over quite a long distance and even around corners, as long as you can get a mob targeted. It also ensures that any additional mobs will have aggro on the pet, rather than you. It does not work as well with mobs who have a ranged attack. Also, be careful that the pet does not pull any extra mobs on the way to the mob and back again.\nIt is possible to have the pet fight one mob while the Hunter attacks another. Note: the Hunter will not gain loot or experience from a mob that the pet kills solo. This is a deliberate decision by Blizzard, not a bug. If you intend on pulling multiple mobs and having your pet kill one or more of them while you focus on others, it would be best to try to get at least one shot or hit on each of the mobs and then allow your pet to do its work on them.\nRaiding alongside your pet.\nWith all pets being equal in terms of damage-dealing, it falls upon the special abilities of the pets, the encounter, and what other classes are present which determines which pet a hunter would use. Often it would be wise to talk amongst the other hunters in the raid to determine which pet each one could use since their buffs/debuffs will not stack with each others or other player's abilities. It is common for a raid consisting of several hunters to no longer have duplicate pets.\nAlthough each pet family comes with a default talent specialization, you can change your pet's spec at any time so long as you are not in combat. &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Cunning\"&gt;Cunning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Ferocity\"&gt;Ferocity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt;. Ferocity pets are good for continuous damage, tenacity pets make good tanks for soloing, and cunning pets have unique abilities which can be very useful in certain situations, such as &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being almost as viable as &lt;a href=\"Pet%20talents%23Ferocity\"&gt;Ferocity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;.\nPet skills.\nPet skills come in two types: passive enhancement skills, and active skills.\nPassive skills change the pet's stats and do not require resources.\nMost active skills require &lt;a href=\"Focus\"&gt;Focus&lt;/a&gt;, a constantly-recharging point pool that works much like a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; bar. Some active skills are free. Every pet has 100 Focus, and Focus regenerates at a base rate of 5 points per second.\nActive skills can be activated in several ways:\nAn active skill does not have to be in the pet action bar to be used, even on autocast. It is perfectly okay to leave Growl in the spellbook and have it on autocast.\nIf using a /cast macro, the skill can be addressed as if it were a Hunter skill, so if the pet has the skill \"Taunt\", /cast Taunt will taunt the current target.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"patch%201.7\"&gt;patch 1.7&lt;/a&gt; onward, Blizzard started introducing special active pet skills. Each skill can only be used by a specific type of pet and the benefit is quite useful, usually in PvE. This increases the diversity among Hunter's pets and often promotes Hunters possessing several pets at the same time. It is expected that, with time, Blizzard will continue to add special skills to other beasts' types as well. \nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the following aspects of hunter pet training became obsolete: &lt;a href=\"pet%20trainer\"&gt;pet trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, learning skills from wild beasts, and &lt;a href=\"loyalty\"&gt;loyalty&lt;/a&gt;.\nNewly tamed beasts will automatically have their level increased to the hunter's level.\nChoosing a pet.\nThere are several factors beyond combat ability to consider when choosing a pet:\nAppearance.\nMany hunters choose their pets based on visual aesthetic: cool-looking, menacing, cute, etc. Collecting &lt;a href=\"rare%20pets\"&gt;pets with unusual appearances&lt;/a&gt; is a common hobby among hunter players. Some hunters even like to match their hunter pet with their &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion pet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=\"Takk%20the%20Leaper\"&gt;Takk the Leaper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leaping%20Hatchling\"&gt;Leaping Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; make a good matching pair.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-petopia.com/\"&gt;Petopia&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent visual guide of pet appearances.\nPrestige.\nCertain pets are considered especially interesting or cool among players. Some choices of prestigious pets include:\nSize.\nA pet's size is directly related to its level. Many beasts will dramatically shrink the moment they are tamed, then regain size as they level. However, certain species are still larger than others; for example, &lt;a href=\"rhino\"&gt;rhino&lt;/a&gt;s are large enough to be a sight obstruction in certain areas, which can be to the player's advantage (&lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;) or disadvantage (&lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s). Flying pets can have a similar effect with their constantly-moving wings. This can work both for you and against you, but you will probably find it at least a little annoying. Both of these issues can be at least somewhat fixed with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Lesser%20Proportion\"&gt;Glyph of Lesser Proportion&lt;/a&gt;.\nShort pets, like &lt;a href=\"crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s, can fit into places taller pets cannot go. This is not a highly significant feature, but it may occasionally come up.\nHunter pets that keep their name after taming.\nIn patch 8.1.5, some mobs keep their name after being tamed, the following is a list of them (work in progress):"}

{"id": "130510", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=130510", "title": "Hunter races", "text": "This article lists the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to become hunters, along with the lore behind each.\nThose of the hunter class are in-touch with nature and spend much time in the wild, often possessing many of same skills and survival know-how of hunters-by-profession, and the one lends to the other well.\nAlliance.\nHuman.\nPresumably during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, it was believed that human tribesmen had to hunt to support themselves. After all, humans have long had domesticated beasts and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s. It was only a matter of time before they combined and evolved into proper hunters. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the archers of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; used their skill in the &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; to deal death from a distance. They were slightly more maneuverable than &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt;, but the cost is the lighter armor they must wear. The ability to launch their deadly rain of missiles from a distance makes them a force not to be discounted. Sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; became the first ever human &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; lord. Human hunters premiered prominently in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Amberpine%20Lodge\"&gt;Amberpine Lodge&lt;/a&gt; acting as &lt;a href=\"Amberpine%20Woodsman\"&gt;woodsmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trapper\"&gt;Trapper&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20%28playable%29\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; also have hunters among their ranks. In the dark forests of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; has a long tradition of using &lt;a href=\"falconer\"&gt;falconry&lt;/a&gt; to train &lt;a href=\"birds%20of%20prey\"&gt;birds of prey&lt;/a&gt;. Two inquisitors of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; are hunters, &lt;a href=\"Notley\"&gt;Notley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yorrick\"&gt;Yorrick&lt;/a&gt;. On the mainland, hunting appears to be common amongst both the nobility and common folk of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aldrius%20Norwington\"&gt;Lord Aldrius Norwington&lt;/a&gt; invites all hunters to participate in hunting and equestrian &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Equestrian%20and%20Hunt%20Festival\"&gt;competitions&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Estate\"&gt;Norwington Estate&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Roughnecks\"&gt;Roughnecks&lt;/a&gt; are fierce mountaineers that tame &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s and sell them to be used by the people of Kul Tiras. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Outriggers\"&gt;Outriggers&lt;/a&gt; are skilled hunters who specialize in taking down the largest and deadliest of beasts that threaten Boralus. \nDwarf.\nAs descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, Dwarves have a special connection to the land. Commonly dwarven hunters are called &lt;a href=\"mountaineer\"&gt;mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;s seen guarding their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Many dwarf hunters also hunt to find &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts and discover more about their ancient past. Dwarf hunters are also commonly seen armed with barrel guns. Brave dwarven &lt;a href=\"Rifleman\"&gt;Riflemen&lt;/a&gt; have faithfully protected their mountain kingdom of Khaz Modan for hundreds of years. Using the legendary single-shot Blunderbuss Long Rifles, riflemen are excellent marksmen and can shoot both land-based and airborne opponents. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; is a notable dwarven hunter. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; also have hunters among their ranks, typically with hunting dogs known as &lt;a href=\"Bloodhound\"&gt;Bloodhound&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Houndmaster%20Grebmar\"&gt;Houndmaster Grebmar&lt;/a&gt; is one such hunter.\nNight elf.\nThe night elves are natural experts at stealth and cunning and so they can very easily stalk and hunt their prey. Night elves are also very adept with the bow with many female members of the race becoming archers who ride atop &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; companions. The first rank of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; army is comprised of Archers. These brave warrior women are expert marksmen and use the concealing forests of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to their advantage. Their lightning-quick ambushes are legendary - for few &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s can match the speed and cunning of the proud Archers.\nDraenei.\nThe draenei once hunted the beasts native to Draenor, now called &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Living in exile on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they are discovering a new environment once again, filled with unfamiliar beasts and plants, slowly learning to become masters of the wild once more.\nDraenei hunters would often hunt the mighty &lt;a href=\"Talbuk%20mounts\"&gt;talbuks&lt;/a&gt; as a show of skill. As a hunter, you carry on this tradition in the new world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorgen.\nWorgen hunters likely have a similar past to humans as hunters, alongside their &lt;a href=\"mastiff\"&gt;mastiff&lt;/a&gt; companions they would also hunt in their &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming worgen, it would make sense for them to gain an even greater aptitude for the wilds. \nPandaren.\nThe pandaren of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; became skilled hunters during their long isolation from their home continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They became proficient at hunting beasts living on the island, for resources and food as well as learning to make traps in which to capture them with. Due to them living on &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;, some have chosen to befriend the dragon turtles out of respect. Some pandaren chose to join the Alliance in their quest to explore and aid the Alliance in return for saving their island. These pandaren follow the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; philosophy. \nGnome.\nLong at the forefront of cutting-edge technology in Azeroth, the inventive gnomes are finally ready to break out the big guns. Their propensity for things that go \"bang\" and knack for high-tech weapons like rocket launchers, high-powered rifles, and death rays make them perfect candidates for hunting down prey.\nAnd with the events about to unfold on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; has commanded his people to get outfitted and ready for battle\u2014any way they know how.\nHorde.\nOrc.\nMany Orcs were hunters back on Draenor. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grunt\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s were trained in the use of the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;. They are faster than their &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;ax&lt;/a&gt; wielding brethren, but have lighter armor so that they may move about more freely. The ability to hurl their deadly missiles across a battlefield makes them a formidable unit to employ. The basic spearmen evolved into &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; riding &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s who throw poisoned spears. Even the basic &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; was able to hunker down in a &lt;a href=\"Burrow\"&gt;Burrow&lt;/a&gt; and throw spears with accuracy during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral clans on the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; have also been observed being hunters. The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf Orcs&lt;/a&gt; typically tame, ride, and fight alongside &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolves\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt;. The 's &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Raider\"&gt;raiders&lt;/a&gt; tame the brown wolves of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Thunderlord Clan&lt;/a&gt; seem to be hunters. Their fiercest warriors can tame and ride &lt;a href=\"Clefthoof\"&gt;clefthooves&lt;/a&gt;. Their chieftain, the , had a pet &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Chilltongue\"&gt;Chilltongue&lt;/a&gt;. Some powerful Thunderlords, such as &lt;a href=\"Hatock%20the%20Gronnmaster\"&gt;Hatock the Gronnmaster&lt;/a&gt;, were even able to find ways to break semi-intelligent &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s to their will, such as &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gronnling\"&gt;gronnling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nJungle troll.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Isle\"&gt;Darkspear Isle&lt;/a&gt;s, the savage troll headhunters would stalk their prey in the dark of their forests armed with large spears. These cunning warriors are trained from birth to hunt, track and trap the most dangerous beasts in the wild. &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter\"&gt;Shadow Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s also exist in Darkspear culture, combining their hunting prowess with the dark voodoo magics of the loa. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is a shadow hunter.\nIn times of war, however, Troll Headhunters turn their mighty spears upon the enemies of the Horde without hesitation. Capable of hurling their deadly spears at distant enemies, Troll Headhunters provide invaluable cover fire for the other warriors of the Horde.\nBlood elf.\nStill having the wonderous agility and affinity for nature that their night elf predecessors had, the blood elves continue to hunt the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. A blood elf hunter is essentially a &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; having passed the techniques down for generations. The &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s are some of the most sophisticated archers in the world. While most of the blood elves prefer to be &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, many still choose the old ways of a Farstrider. &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; is a blood elven hunter.\nTauren.\nTauren are natural hunters, having hunted in the great plains of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt; for generations. The tauren venerate the Hunt as a passing rite for young tauren into adulthood. Their belief in the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; also makes tauren hold great respect for nature and all of its creatures.\nGoblin.\n&lt;a href=\"Liza%20Cutlerflix\"&gt;Liza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warpy\"&gt;Warpy&lt;/a&gt;, a goblin hunter and her pet were seen as early as \"The Burning Crusade\".\nIt is possible that the exotic yet harsh wilderness on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; inspired the goblins to become hunters. They can also use their technological prowess to construct advanced firearms and explosive ammunition.\nUndead.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were once humans, any proficiency they had in hunting most likely followed them in undeath. The Forsaken's Banshee Queen, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, was a hunter/ranger during her lifetime and after being raised into undeath by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; found herself out of touch with the wilds, which was replaced by necromancy, making her a &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; which would later be taken up by others in the Forsaken. Dark Rangers grew in numbers during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and likely have instructed new forsaken trainees to expand their ranks after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; has recently been training a new generation of Forsaken rangers comprising of undead humans, making the undead racial composition of the order more diverse. These Forsaken hunters appear to favor the woodsman axe and the crossbow in contrast to the bow and arrow typically employed by their undead &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; counterparts. Like Nathanos, they sport a leather-looking outfit and optionally a hood and face mask.\nPandaren.\nThe pandaren of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; became skilled hunters during their long isolation from their home continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They learned how to be proficient at hunting beasts living on the island, for resources and food, as well as the creation of traps in which to capture them. Due to living on a massive turtle, many have chosen to befriend the dragon turtles as companions out of respect. Some pandaren chose to join the Horde in their quest to explore and aid the Horde in return for saving their island. These pandaren follow the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; philosophy.\nZandalari trolls.\nThe hunters of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; are known as &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28Zandalari%29\"&gt;Predators&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Ward\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Ward&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to raising powerful beasts in times of war. The Zandalari seem to primarily focus on raising &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s as their companions, such as &lt;a href=\"ravasaur\"&gt;ravasaur&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;s. While Zandalari prefer to respect their animal companions, in times of desperation, they can forcibly control them with magic fetishes and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;blood rituals&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightborne.\nWhile they no longer possess the same, deep connection with nature as their &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; ancestors did, the shal'dorei are still capable hunters. They are typically seen keeping the &lt;a href=\"manasaber\"&gt;manasaber&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; as pets. Several of their hunters joined the &lt;a href=\"Felborne\"&gt;Felborne&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Felborne%20Trapper\"&gt;Felborne Trapper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Nighthuntress%20Lexera\"&gt;Nighthuntress Lexera&lt;/a&gt;, and used &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted wildlife to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nighthuntress%20Syrenne\"&gt;Nighthuntress Syrenne&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to oppose the Legion.\nFemale nightborne hunters are often referred to as nighthuntresses.\nIn the RPG.\nOrcs.\nMany orcs find the path of the hunt appealing due to their increasing closeness with the wilds, they have a particular affinity for &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; whom they treat as hunting partners.\nHalf-ogre.\nThe mighty sons and daughters of Nath are natural hunters, having spent long years in the wilderness. They have a natural rapport with wild animals and even those who are not hunters often enter battle with loyal, trained companions at their sides. They seek to discover the essence of combat through observing and mimicking wild beasts. Most &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt; also become melee hunters; those who don't use massive composite longbows - something to which they can apply their great strength. The iconic half-ogre hunter emerges from the woods or desert on the eve of battle, silently taking their place next to their allies in the Horde. A great bear, lion or wolf remains by their side, looking docile enough, but growling when others get close. The hunter hefts their axes and looks to the horizon. They breathe deep, savoring the smell of the land and preparing themselves for the conflict to come.\nForest troll.\nForest trolls on Lordaeron were hunters. They taught the orcs to hunt."}

When Wrath came out I had a few annoyances including the moving of Readiness into the Marksmanship tree, but the 3.0.8 buffs to the SV tree have more than made up for it. Notes on my spec follow:\nWotLK Spec Possibilities.\nNote: This Section is Intended for Specs that take advantage of 71 Talent points, although our tree has YET to actually be designed for WotLK.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Ftalent%3Dcx0GdxtoizZxxbRVuGsso\"&gt;33/38/0&lt;/a&gt;\nSolo/DPS build - This build is a good PvE DPS build althogh im not sure but could be good for PvP so give it a try. - &lt;a href=\"Denni1234\"&gt;Denni1234&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Ftalent%3Dcxbh0xgRwuVoVVbRyz0x\"&gt;41/30/0&lt;/a&gt;\nSolo/DPS build - This spec contains all talents needed for a 71 point DPS hunter, obviously it would require testing but if talents stay as they are it should work well. \nJebus22's Raid Dps Build\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wotlk.wowhead.com/%3Ftalent%3DcZ0eAcomzMgoxZe00i0MIhx\"&gt;0/40/31&lt;/a&gt;\nDPS build - This spec contains the majority of the percentage increasing talents. this build will scale very very well with gear. variations can be made by swapping master marksman with expose weakness. the idea of this build is to gain 100% of int added to ap (+4% int), 30% of stam added to ap (with +10% stam), +19% agi, 5% more damage with ranged weapons, and +10% to ap. all with a major crit chance on most attacks\nArgonsol's balanced DPS build\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/hunter/talents.html%3Ftal%3D502030015252122501005313200153050012300100000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"&gt;50/21/0&lt;/a&gt;\nDPS build - the idea here is to get maximum damage combined between you and your pet. The combination of bestial wrath (3min cooldown) + Rapid Fire (3 min cooldown) + Readiness (3 min cooldown) means in raid boss battles you can use both bestial wrath and rapid fire two times against one boss ( BW, RF, Readiness, BW, RF) and then only have to wait 3 min before you can repeat the process.\n3.1 Builds:\nRaid:\nSome hunters out there that are not into PvP might be wondering what the dualspec has to offer them. They may find this a usefull suggestion. In my opnion I find this specc only worth going for in 25 man raids or maybe when your off to raid a capital or WG, allthough you probably won't get props for raid support in WG. Also before taking this build I would suggest using as a rule of thumb that the lowest dps gear rating in your raid is somewhere around 1900 on WoW-heroes. The major drawback of this build is that it will pretty much cut your dps in half, if however you followed the rules of thumb above it will be like you brought between 1,5/2 extra dps'ers to the raid overall. There is no point in having other hybrid hunters in the raid when your there, probably is no point in bringing an MM Hunter at all. Also make sure that the other hunters understand that your Hunter's Mark goes on the big boss and they should stick theirs elsewhere, don't forget to smack yours on the add that needs to be burned down quick too."}

Since &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the way that pets operate has been drastically changed. Pet trainers now exist to allow the hunter to &lt;a href=\"Talent_build%23Re-spec\"&gt;re-spec&lt;/a&gt; his or her pet's talents. Unlike player character re-specs, pet re-specs are always free.

{"id": "13094", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13094", "title": "Hunter trap", "text": "A hunter trap is a &lt;a href=\"trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; that Survival &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can set on the ground. A trap produces a damaging or slowing effect to enemies who come within its range. The ability to set traps is exclusive to hunters.\nTactics.\nA trap skill allows you to set a trap on the ground which will exist for 1 minute, and will activate when a mob comes within range, performing their designated function. Since patch 2.0.1, traps can be placed while in combat. Place a trap and lead a monster back into it to set it off. This becomes easier with your ranged weapon.\nPlayers now need to be wary of relying on traps against higher level mobs. Traps have been resistible since patch 1.6 (according to Blizzard, this has always been intended). When they are resisted they just either disappear without notice or sometimes Freezing Traps will break early. The resist rate is relatively high versus higher level &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTraps.\nTraps are placed together in a pullout button, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet&lt;/a&gt; and mage teleports/portals.\nTrap Launcher.\nAs of patch 4.0.1, hunters can now use a &lt;a href=\"Trap%20Launcher\"&gt;Trap Launcher&lt;/a&gt; to lay traps up to 40 yards away at a cost of 20 focus. This ability will allow the hunter to use traps as a ranged-attack method and throw traps on mobs and bosses without having to enter melee range. Hunters can reduce the focus cost of Trap Launcher by 10 with the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Trap%20Launcher\"&gt;Glyph of Trap Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", the Trap Launcher longer needs to be activated each time the hunter wants to shoot a trap, instead the launcher acts as an active buff, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. While active, all traps used have the target ring to shoot them at the specific location, while inactive, the traps are placed at the hunter's feet. The focus cost has also been removed.\nUses.\nFreezing Trap is a great trap to use while &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;taming&lt;/a&gt;. Activate the trap at the very edge of the targeted beast's aggro range and then taunt it to attack, having to cross the trap to do so. The mob will be frozen in place and you will have a precious few more seconds to focus and tame the beast.\nA well placed freezing trap can save your main healer and by extension the group, or can crowd control one extra mob during a pull. Laying an explosive trap, feigning death and laying another is a great way to take down a big group of mobs, who might be attacking in numbers. A fire trap is another nice damage dealer and during PvP battles (particularly in the Battlegrounds) an ice trap can be the thing that turns a battle. The best hunters are the ones who know how to use their traps, know which one to use in a particular situation, where to place a trap to maximize damage and/or crowd control, and how know to lay double and sometimes triple traps. All of these skills take experience and practice, and this, along with superior pet control, differentiates an average hunter from a great one."}

Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, several classes\u2014including hunters\u2014carried both a ranged and melee weapon at the same time, with hunters being able to &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s as well as equip two-handed swords, &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; as \"&lt;a href=\"StatStick\"&gt;stat sticks&lt;/a&gt;\". They gained ranged &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt; from both &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;, and some abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt; used mana and benefited from intellect and &lt;a href=\"spell%20power\"&gt;spell power&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis led to some hunter players laying claim to a wide variety of weapons as \"hunter weapons\", which quickly escalated to calling any weapon or even non-weapons \"hunter weapon\" as sarcasm. With the simplification of stats in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; and the changes to the class in 5.0.4, which removed the ability for hunters to equip a melee weapon in addition to their ranged weapon, the need for conflict over melee weapons was removed. While &lt;a href=\"Hunter%23Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; hunters were changed to use melee weapons in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, changes to how &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt;s work and the various &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; systems in place means that \"hunter weapon\" loot debates are now unlikely to occur."}

Huntresses are strong and swift, and merciless to those who would defile the sanctity of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elf huntress is a &lt;a href=\"mounted%20warrior\"&gt;mounted warrior&lt;/a&gt;. Like all night elf women, huntresses are able to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmeld\"&gt;Shadowmeld&lt;/a&gt; at night. Huntresses also have a close bond with the &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s of the forest. These owls relay information and spy for the Sentinel army.\nHuntresses are the elite of Sentinels with millennia of expertise and experience. They serve as officers, adjutants to &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; and as &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s. Leading sentinel squads to battle, protecting the priestesses or doing reconnaissance with the help of their &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28owl%29\"&gt;owl companions&lt;/a&gt;. When heading to battle huntresses most often prefer to be at back of their loyal nightsabers and carry a glaive or a lance and a shield to combat, making a ferocious foe for anyone who tempts the wrath of night elves.\nNotably, they participated in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;s under the command of &lt;a href=\"Denea\"&gt;Denea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Su%27ura%20Swiftarrow\"&gt;Su'ura Swiftarrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nExcept for the night elves, they are also found in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nNight elf female &lt;a href=\"mounted%20warrior\"&gt;mounted warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are called huntress.\nNight elf women are trained in stealth and combat. Many fight to protect their homes, their lands and their people. At the forefront of this army ride the huntresses. This elite cadre calls upon the moon goddess Elune for strength. Huntresses ride their fearsome nightsaber panthers into battle and wield moon glaives with deadly accuracy. In times of peace, the huntresses protect night elf lands from trespassers. In times of war, however, they extend their activities to anyone foolish enough to attack their people or their allies. These women are tall and lean, lithe like the cats they ride and so dusk-skinned their purple flesh blends into their panthers' fur, making them seem almost single beasts intent upon slaughter. They wear light armor designed for mobility as much as strength, and each wields a moon glaive that flashes in the night. The huntress is a warrior, first and foremost. She takes the fight to her foes, charging close to the enemy before flinging her moon glaive. The panther's speed and agility allow her to attack quickly, and she often dispatches her first foe with a single toss, spreading terror and panic among those nearby."}

Altimor is a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; who fights the raid with a trio of &lt;a href=\"gargon\"&gt;gargon&lt;/a&gt;, each with a different set of abilities, but all sharing the same health pool with Altimor. Margore will leap at enemies, Bargast creates ghostly shades of itself, and Hecutis uses overwhelming stone might to crush the raid.\nHuntsman Altimor is typically fought as the second boss, after &lt;a href=\"Shriekwing\"&gt;Shriekwing&lt;/a&gt;, as is seen as one of the easier bosses in the instance.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Sire Denathrius seldom engages in the hunts himself, but Altimor makes certain the master has the finest beasts should he ever choose to indulge. &lt;a href=\"Margore\"&gt;Margore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barghast\"&gt;Barghast&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hecutis\"&gt;Hecutis&lt;/a&gt; have been trained longer than most beasts have existed, and each is ready to deliver the Huntsman's wrath to any in his domain.\"\nStrategy.\nHuntsman Altimor requires two tanks. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; effects should be saved for the third phase, where raid-wide damage is at its highest. Huntsman Altimor retains the same abilities from start to finish, with only his three beasts having different abilities, who come out when the last one dies. Altimor will start with Margore, then release Bargast, and finally Hecutis. All damage done to the beasts is also done to the boss, so classes with a lot of cleave-damage will do well in Phases 1 and 3.\nThe Boss: Altimor melees the tank for relatively weak physical damage. He will periodically fire Sinseeker bolts, targeting 3 players and showing 3 red arrows coming from the boss to show where they are going. The bolts will strike any player in front of- and behind the targeted players. To respond to this, the targeted players should typically stand still and let other players move away from them. Unless the targeted players happen to be on-top of each other, it is far less messy for other players to move away. In addition, he will periodically fire Spreadshots, a cone of bolts targeted at random players who need to be healed through.\nPhase 1, Margore: Starting the fight, Margore should be tanked on top of the Huntsman to cleave them both. Margore will hit the tank with Jagged Claws, causing a bleed effect that forces tanks to swap every few stacks. He will also target random non-tank players with Vicious Lunge, creating a targeting circle on the player. When the debuff expires, Margore will leap at the player and deal a large amount of damage evenly split among all players in the targeting circle. Nearby players should simply stack to soak the lunge. Some classes can also immune effects like &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; to nullify the attack. This phase is quite basic and should not cause much trouble. Once Margore is down, Bargast will join the fight.\nPhase 2, Bargast: This phase requires far more coordination than the last. Tanks should position Altimor far away from Bargast, though still in range of healers, because of the Rip Soul ability. Rip Soul will create a ghost of Bargast's current tank, which will begin walking towards Altimor. Should this ghost reach Altimor, he will become empowered and deal 100% more damage, likely causing a wipe. The ghost is friendly and must be healed to full to force it to despawn. If necessary, Altimor's tank can also keep moving the boss away from the shade to buy the healers more time.\nAnother deadly mechanic is Shades of Bargast, which is cast shortly after the Rip Soul cast. Unlike the Ripped Soul mob, this shade is hostile and will begin casting Deathly Roar, a nasty dot that will likely wipe the raid if it goes off. However, the shade is vulnerable to almost every form of crowd control, including stuns, traps, and fears. In addition, the longer the shade is CC'd, the more damage it takes due to the Destabilize debuff that increases when it is under loss of control effects. Typically, the raid should wait until it has between 10-15 stacks of Destabilize to kill the shade, as when the shade reaches 100% energy, it will become immune to all CC effects and promptly cast Death Roar, wiping the raid. The timing on slaying the Shade of Bargast is critical to surviving this phase, with DPS classes saving their burst damage effects for this moment. The raid needs to remember to have the shades down prior to the transition to Phase 3, as having a messy transition could potentially lead to a wipe.\nPhase 3, Hecutis: Bloodlust effects should be used immediately, as letting this phase go on for too long can potentially lead to raid damage becoming non-survivable. Altimor and Hecutis can be stacked on each other for cleave damage. Players will periodically be afflicted with Petrifying Howl, causing a large circle to appear around them. After the debuff expires, a circle of permanent stone shards will appear on the ground. Similar to Echolocation on &lt;a href=\"Shriekwing\"&gt;Shriekwing&lt;/a&gt;, these circles should be dropped at the edges of the room to keep movement around the room safe. In addition to hitting the tanks hard, Hecutis will also be gaining a stacking buff called Crushing Stone which can be removed by moving. However, each time a stack is shed, it will trigger a large burst of raid-wide nature damage. Consequently, tanks and healers need to coordinate and call out when they would like Hecutis to be moved, allowing the healers to time cooldowns to keep the raid topped up and the tanks safe. Due to the large amount of raid-wide damage from Crushing Stone, all players must be ready to use their personal defensive cooldowns and warlock &lt;a href=\"healthstones\"&gt;healthstones&lt;/a&gt;. Coordination between the tanks and healers is key to keeping everyone alive and defeating this final phase.\nAfter Hecutis is dead, Altimor will gain a damage buff, but provided at least most of the raid is alive at this point, the boss should go down in short order."}

When the Wandering Isle pandaren reestablished contact with the outside world, the Huojin would be drawn to the scrappy practicality of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and would commit to aiding their new allies in many of the conflicts to come.\nThose who follow the path of the Houjin are impulsive, quick to action, and practical. To them, inaction in the face of adversity will always be the greatest injustice. Their ideological opposites are the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, fellow Wandering Islanders, who sided with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; instead when the time came. Both groups represent the majority of pandaren within their respective factions.\nHistory.\nJoining the Horde.\nHuojin philosophy first originated among the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, eventually gaining a large number of adherents among the populace. By the time the mists of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; fell, the order was led by the spirited &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;. The Huojin at this time lived in balanced coexistence with their philosophical opposites in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Huojin were active in defending &lt;a href=\"Wu-Song%20Village\"&gt;Wu-Song Village&lt;/a&gt; from an incursion of &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;. Soon afterward, the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;\" would fatefully crash into &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; and the island, with dire consequences. The event gravely wounded the giant turtle and would require the combined efforts of the Huojin, Tushui, and the Alliance and Horde survivors to repair.\nDuring the crisis, the two rival pandaren philosophies would come to a head, with Ji Firepaw and the Huojin taking violent, drastic, and risky action in order to prevent disaster. Though their actions came close to killing Shen-zin Su, the Huojin and their allies were successful in reversing the damage done and healing the island.\nAfter these events, and the difficult choices involved, Ji and the Huojin decided to leave the Wandering Isle. They found themselves naturally attracted to the Horde's values of strength and conviction, as opposed to the Tushui interest in the Alliance. Ji would accept the invitation to join the Horde, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with some companions to meet with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in person. After proving himself to the Warchief, Ji and the Huojin were officially inducted into the Horde.\nSince that time, they have committed themselves to their new faction, such as representing the Horde in the conflict over the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The Huojin would also later establish a &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Landing\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; from which Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; explored the island. Ji Firepaw himself quickly became a major Horde leader, though this cost him dearly during the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite what happened in the Siege, Ji and his pandaren remained in the Horde.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Huojin reinforced the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; garrison with &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Guard\"&gt;Frostwall Guard&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Captain%20Liang\"&gt;Shield Captain Liang&lt;/a&gt;. Their banners can be found next to them.\nBefore the Storm.\nJi Firepaw was not present for the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; parade or the dinner as he was far away. His followers, however, participated in the feast and presented their rituals, an idea requested by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Huojin would join the other factions of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in fighting the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Huojin &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s subsequently took part in many &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Command%20Table\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; alongside heroes of the Horde, directed at various targets across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, a force of Huojin led by &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Lin\"&gt;Brewmaster Lin&lt;/a&gt; set up a command post in the north of the region and began helping to direct the local defense. Lin and his troops were ultimately targeted by the Alliance, who sought to destroy the Horde's command structure in the area. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Faction Assault on Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Disciple\"&gt;Huojin Disciple&lt;/a&gt; was sent to support the invasion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20in%20the%20Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Assault in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Defender\"&gt;Huojin Defender&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; fought to protect the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuojin philosophy.\nThe Huojin philosophy is also exemplified by the following scroll that can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Shang%20Xi%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Shang Xi Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt;:"}

In over a decade, the mischievous drunkard has left the tavern only once to steal a top-secret recipe for &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Lager%20Keg\"&gt;Thunderbrew Lager&lt;/a&gt;. Blackbreath has occasionally sobered up enough to make the concoction himself, and he claims it grants unimaginable strength and courage.\"\nStrategy.\nBlackbreath and the cronies are elites. The strategy is simple: Have your tank bash the kegs and everyone stand back in the NW corner of the room. Your tank can then charge/attack Blackbreath to draw aggro. Stomp, or whatever is a good idea just to get everyone hitting the tank. The fight is fairly straightforward. Use any crowd control techniques you have (sheep someone, for example). Blackbreath has a lot of hit-points, so whether you choose to or not, you'll probably take out the cronies first (and in this manner, reduce the damage your tank is taking). "}

Its ability to control the arcane was too tempting, and when it was toyed with, its shattering cursed the Highborne. Kel'Theril suffered until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; destroyed it for good, and now the dead wander the ruins as ghosts.\nOne hundred years ago, a group of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Maenius\"&gt;Archmage Maenius&lt;/a&gt; came from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to Winterspring in search of the crystal. They found its shards, but like the Highborne of millennia before they too ended up as ghosts wandering the ruins. Decades years later, &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora Skycaller&lt;/a&gt; managed to forge the relic's shattered pieces together with the help of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.

A third group of elves, this time &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, were turned into &lt;a href=\"wretched\"&gt;wretched&lt;/a&gt; by its power. One year after they became wretched Umbranse was slain by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, but the crystal was not recovered.

At ~14 AP = 1 dps a weapon that swung once per second would basically be getting ~98 AP/14 dps with an additional ~15.5 dps being addend in when used. Some investigation would have to be done to determine if this is damage that is normalized or not. If it simply adds a flat adjustent to weapon damage, it would appear that this is a very handy trinket for characters that dual wield fast weapons. \nAlso, this trinket cycles at twice the speed of most +AP trinkets, making it substantially better."}

{"id": "33253", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33253", "title": "Crystalsong Forest", "text": "Crystalsong Forest, also known as Crystal Song Woods and originally called Moonsong, is a landlocked region in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally known as Moonsong Forest, the outpost of Shandaral was established here during the height of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, around 10,000 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, in the northern reaches of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It was to be a repository of arcane relics and artifacts that the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; collected. When the continent was shattered by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the elves living there were isolated from the rest of the world. With no source of power to sustain them, they were left vulnerable to disease and other ailments. For centuries, the Shandaral Highborne scoured the forests of &lt;a href=\"Moonsong\"&gt;Moonsong&lt;/a&gt; for a means to sustain themselves.\nAround 6,000 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, after witnessing &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s crystallize living things and draw power from them, the elves tried to interact with the dragons, who responded with either ignorance or open hostility. Out of desperation, a group of Highborne &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and learned the dragons' techniques, but greed pushed them to pilfer some of the powerful relics stored in the blue flight's lair. This triggered magical wards which sent the blues into a frenzy. Though the elves managed to escape with their lives, they knew that the dragons would retaliate.\nDozens of blue dragons indeed came down upon Shandaral. The elven sorcerers, desperate to save themselves, gathered on a cliff overlooking Moonsong, and agreed to use techniques they had acquired from the Nexus. They focused their power, hoping to crystallize a small portion of the forest and use its energies as a weapon to destroy the dragons. Their attempt failed horribly, as their reckless casting set off an enormous explosion, releasing a torrent of energy that crystallized the entire forest.\nThe physical form of most every living creature in the region, except for the blue dragons who had sensed the impending spellwork and left, was instantly shattered, while their spirits were warped by the spell and cursed to mindlessly wander the haunted land which would become known as &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Those that survived were twisted into maddened half-crystal creatures that attacked anyone they saw, such as the &lt;a href=\"crystal%20satyr\"&gt;crystal satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crystal%20dryad\"&gt;crystal dryad&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTheir last living remnants appear to be the &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;, who still wander the ruins of their ancient home.\nApproximately 1,500 years later, in 4,500 BDP, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; planted branches of Nordrassil across Northrend to stop the spread of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;. One of these branches was placed within Crystalsong, and would eventually become a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree%20%28Crystalsong%20Forest%29\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt; in Crystalsong.\nWar against the Lich King.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the magical city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was lifted and moved over Crystalsong Forest, not far from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Stand\"&gt;Violet Stand&lt;/a&gt; was created as a land-outpost beneath Dalaran and was protected by a magical barrier to keep it safe from outside threats. The &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; also moved into the region, claiming the areas of &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%27s%20Overlook\"&gt;Windrunner's Overlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Command\"&gt;Sunreaver's Command&lt;/a&gt;; two ruined Highborne towers. The blue dragonflight, in pursuit of the Kirin Tor as part of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, had set up the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Front\"&gt;Azure Front&lt;/a&gt; as well as several &lt;a href=\"Surge%20needle\"&gt;Surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRecent times.\nSeveral years following the fall of the Lich King, the Bronzebeard brothers returned to Northrend and cataloged their adventures. They made note that the Violet Stand no longer existed, though many other outposts still remained. The Azure Front remained active as an outpost, with the surge needles having been disabled; though the area still patrolled by dragonkin. The Sunreavers and Silver Covenant also remained active in the area in their respective outposts; despite neither outpost serving much of any purpose during the original wars.\nGeography.\nCrystalsong Forest is a barren place, though possessed of a sort of haunting loveliness in its strangeness.\nNotable characters.\nCrystalsong Forest is home to a group of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"the%20Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;the Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and an opposing group of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"the%20Sunreavers\"&gt;the Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Daelin\"&gt;Scout Captain Daelin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Scout Captain Elsia&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. At the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Stand\"&gt;Violet Stand&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mages led by &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20Melindra\"&gt;Gatekeeper Melindra&lt;/a&gt; stand guard against the encroaching &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and above, the great enchanted city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; hovers in place, with a large populace of its own.\nDig sites.\nCrystalsong Forest has two &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn the RPG.\nCrystalsong Forest is a very unique place located in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Picture a forest crafted from crystal, but it would not be accurate since these are not trees. Imagine a place where crystals are as tall as trees sprout from the ground, though the ground itself is crystal as well. Better think of a winter scene, snow and ice blanketing the ground, rocks and trees. Then change that snow and ice to crystal that glows from within. That is as close as someone can describe this forest and it does not begin to explain the beauty and peace that fills it. The crystals make noise \u2014 they sing. Ancient magic is at work here.\nCrystalsong has few residents, though they defend the forest effectively. Its crystals contain mysterious and impressive &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, enough to tempt any &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;. For those allowed entry, the forest also provides an easy way to reach the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kaskala\"&gt;Kaskala&lt;/a&gt; some &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; can tell you some rumors about Crystalsong Forest's history although several of these rumors conflict, and who knows if they have any truth to them. One thing is sure though, the Scourge cannot pass through this forest.\nHistory.\nCrystalsong Forest was not always as it is now. Once, it resembled a normal landscape. Then, &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragon\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s fought a great battle here where lots of them died. Their magic released into the air and settled as glittering light on the ground, rocks and trees. Finally, an elder blue dragon, beset by many blacks, unleashed a powerful spell to strip the life from his attackers and turn them to stone. The loose magic altered and amplified the spell, spreading it across the entire region and changing soil, stone, wood and flesh into living crystal. Only the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree%20%28Crystalsong%20Forest%29\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt; was spared, protected by its &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt; guardians. After the battle ended, the &lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s investigated this strange new place discovering in the process that the crystals contained strong magic of their own, and began mining the forest for their own purposes. They created &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20golem\"&gt;crystalline golem&lt;/a&gt;s to handle the actual work, and left these creatures to defend the forest and carry crystals back to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Dark One&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Northrend, he immediately sensed the power of the forest. He dispatched several of his mightiest servants to secure the region for his use. The golems destroyed them, and the green dragons eliminated the servants who approached the Great Tree. The Dark One tried again, this time sending a small army into Crystalsong, and this time the forest itself took steps. As the monstrosities approached, the forest's song grew louder, shaking every spire, and the creatures burst like shattered glass. The Dark One never made a third attempt, perhaps accepting that some force protected the forest and would not let him pass.\nPeople and culture.\nOnly two races live within Crystalsong Forest: &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20golem\"&gt;crystalline golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"green%20dragons\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Neither are particularly friendly or have any real home or culture.\nThe crystalline golems are constructs created by the storm giants up in Ulduar who use crystal from this forest in their experiments and items, and send the golems to fetch it. The golems also protect this place from travelers who might despoil it or settle here and destroy the region's magic. But if you are peaceful, you may pass trough the forest freely.\nGreen dragons live only around the Great Tree. They don't care about anyone that is crossing the forest unless they approach the Great Tree, in which case they will be warned and destroyed if do not turn back.\nGeography.\nThe ground here rolls slightly, not enough to produce real hills or valleys but enough to keep it from being utterly flat. The crystals vary in size, from a few feet to hundreds of feet high, and from a small tree to a large house in width. Small streams flow here and there, probably where snowmelt has worn channels in the crystal. When those streams reach the edge of one level and fall to the next they turn into waterfalls. It is breathtaking watching that water cascade down, lit from behind by the crystals' light.\nIt is unknown who dubbed this place a forest, though. Some people would have found more fitting naming it as Crystalsong Canyon, or Valley or Landscape. Many of the crystals do rise like trees, tall and straight, but others are wide and flat or slightly curved or tilted at some strange angle. It really is an entire land of crystal, as if something took an ordinary region and transformed everything within it.\nThe only other creatures here are &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s. They perch everywhere, flitting from crystal to crystal and singing as they go. The sound echoes, and the crystals resonate to it, amplifying notes and creating new melodies from several sources. The forest itself seems to be playing music, and you can feel it through your feet and up through your bones. It is lovely and in most places so soft you strain to hear it, but it never completely fades. It is important to note, though, that even if there were no birds here, the crystals would still sing. This is old magic and has nothing to do with wildlife.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree%20%28Crystalsong%20Forest%29\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt; is the only settlement of any sort in the forest, although there is &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20%28Crystalsong%20Forest%29\"&gt;a mysterious chamber&lt;/a&gt; near its center. The golems are not technically alive and are always busy here, so they have no camp anywhere. Travelers who are allowed entrance set up camp anywhere the ground is level enough and open enough, but they never stay long. Only the dragons remain."}

Ruined and deadened by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s march to Silvermoon, the Ghostlands are a haunted, plagued, decrepit, and dangerous area. Vengeful phantoms of the battles with the Scourge and a majority of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; remnants left over from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; still linger here, as well as one of the most &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;vile traitors&lt;/a&gt; to the elven people.\nHistory.\nOnce a part of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Elrendar%20River\"&gt;Elrendar River&lt;/a&gt; was all that separated these forests from the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;northern woodland&lt;/a&gt;. Its largest settlement was &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;, and housed the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;abode&lt;/a&gt; of the renowned &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; family. &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"An%27telas\"&gt;An'telas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt;, three locations in the forest from which key &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s forked, were each imbued with a mooncrystal that connected all the way to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. With the crystals in place, they passively empowered &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;, the great magic shield protecting Silvermoon. The mooncrystals' locations were hidden in an invisibility stasis and protected by guardians, to ensure no invaders learned their secrets. The fierce &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls also based their power in this region of Quel'Thalas, from their foreboding city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormal entrance to Quel'Thalas is taken through the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt;, located far to the south.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded and set fire to &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The southern stretches of the forest were &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; by their actions. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; tried to suppress the fires by summoning a vast storm, which stretched across the entire battlefront and exhausted his entire magic supply. The weather made the fighting soggy and miserable, but only managed to put out the fires for a time, as the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s' waves of flame were so hot that under their breath trees blackened in an instant, crumbling to ash despite being soaked minutes before.\nThird War and reclamation.\nThe Ghostlands claimed their name during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invaded Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and capriciously defiled, slaughtered, and tore their way through the woodlands. The &lt;a href=\"Elfgate\"&gt;Elfgate&lt;/a&gt;s were overcome, the mooncrystals were pilfered, their guardians slain, and the entire southern woodland fell to the Scourge's corruption. Most, if not all of the elven settlements were obliterated during the invasion, not to be reclaimed until years later. Towns and villages were razed, and human necromancers saw to the reanimation of fallen elves. Under Ranger General &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; put up a vicious but impossible fight against the Scourge, and were forced north. \nThe elves, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; elves in honor of the perished, eventually gathered their strength and began taking back portions of Eversong Woods, restoring much of their kingdom, including their beloved capital. However, the elves were divided on how to approach the Ghostlands. Some were content to remain north, while others (such as &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;) would not rest until all of Quel'Thalas was reclaimed, the Scourge destroyed and driven from the land forever. When the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; order was formed, several of their first missions took place in the Ghostlands, and the Farstriders also began re-establishing a presence.\nIt was also in the Ghostlands that Dar'khan ambushed the Blood Knights as well as setting Lor'themar Theron ablaze before being killed by the Regent Lord.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Ghostlands are a level 10-20 zone blood elves and all Horde characters can quest through. The zone's story begins some time after \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", and focuses mostly on reclaiming the land from the Scourge. The remnants of the Scourge still dwell in the deadened forests, lingering spirits continue to aimlessly haunt the land they had lost their lives defending, and all manner of undead horrors still plague the land; however, the blood elves, reinforced by their new &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; allies - Sylvanas Windrunner's people - have begun to make real progress against the invaders. Among other things, adventurers are tasked with reclaiming the fallen spires and towns, laying restless spirits to rest, battling the opportunistic Amani trolls, and finding a way to bring the great traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; to justice once more. \n&lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Enclave\"&gt;Farstrider Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Sanctum of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; have been reclaimed as key points to stand strong against the elves' many enemies. Dar'Khan rules the lingering undead from &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;, while the Amani have scattered outposts across the zone. A &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; of night elves, far from Kalimdor, has also arrived in the Ghostlands in a hostile manner.\nThe Magisters and the Farstriders, with help from adventurers, succeeded in killing Dar'Khan and halting his plans for the region. &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the feared warlord of the Amani, would also fall in the months to come, ridding the Ghostlands of two of its most hated enemies.\nAlthough the blood elves had made progress against the Scourge, even without the presence of Dar'Khan, the undead still occupied the land in great numbers. The vigilant Farstriders hold onto the land tenuously, relying on continued Forsaken aid and, recently, the support of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; formed a new troll empire, the Amani remnants, now led by &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Warlord Daakara&lt;/a&gt;, pledged their allegiance to it. Instructed to gather in Zul'Aman and marshal their forces, the Amani found enemies in Silvermoon's ranger-general &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and his Farstriders, as well as his Horde ally &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Atal-Mhuto\"&gt;Atal-Mhuto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her rangers from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. The three of them combined their forces, and the Amani's latest attempt to reassert dominance ended in failure.\nWar Crimes.\nThe Ghostlands was used as a covert meeting location by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and Vereesa Windrunner, who bonded in the place of their birth. The Scourge still seems to be active in the Ghostlands to some degree.\nWindrunner: Three Sisters.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sisters reunited and traveled to the Ghostlands witnessing the corruption. They passed through the &lt;a href=\"Goldenmist%20Village\"&gt;Goldenmist Village&lt;/a&gt; and killed its ghostly inhabitants. They continued to the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the undead elves stationed there. Sylvanas had planned to ambush &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; bringing her dark rangers along, hiding near the Spire. Sylvanas didn't give the signal for the ambush, so Sylvanas' sisters left the area via teleport without knowing about the threat.\nLegion.\nIn search of the exiled group of blood elves led by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria returned to the Ghostlands, accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Sanctum of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andilien%20Estate\"&gt;Andilien Estate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt; finding clues about Umbric's research of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and whereabouts.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs part of a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;ceremony of remembrance&lt;/a&gt; held each year in the kingdom, Lor'themar Theron accompanied the blood elf adventurer throughout the Ghostlands, shining the light of the Sunwell to reenact the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge's invasion of their lands&lt;/a&gt; and the sacrifices made in Quel'Thalas' darkest hour. The journey took them from &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where the battle began; north through the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, where the elves made a valiant but futile attempt to halt the invaders' advance; to &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;, where specters of slain rangers were laid to rest and a statue has been erected to honor the heroism ranger-general Sylvanas displayed in life. The adventurer continued the ceremony in Eversong and Quel'Danas before returning to Silvermoon.\nAfter being deposed as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, Sylvanas briefly returned to the Ghostlands to rendezvous with her most loyal followers at her family's fallen spire. She did not sojourn there long, hunted on both continents by the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, night elf &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and troll &lt;a href=\"headhunter\"&gt;headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and left for parts unknown after sharing her parting thoughts on the war and what is to come.\nNotable characters.\nGhostlands is home to several characters of note. At Tranquillien, &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Auriferous\"&gt;Dame Auriferous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Mavren\"&gt;High Executor Mavren&lt;/a&gt; work together in the battle against the Scourge. At the Farstrider Enclave, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Helios\"&gt;Captain Helios&lt;/a&gt; and his rangers attempt to fight back the relentless attacks from the Amani trolls. And at the Sanctum of the Sun, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Kaendris\"&gt;Magister Kaendris&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the heart of evil itself \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, in the center of his fortress of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;. Outside &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; discuss plans concerning the renewed &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; threat.\nIn the RPG.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ghostlands is an alternate name for the &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Woods\"&gt;Blackened Woods&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is an alternative name for &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;."}

Your action buttons will be to throw a harpoon, increase speed by 200%, and repairing your ship. The targets are &lt;a href=\"Helmouth%20Soulraider\"&gt;Helmouth Soulraider&lt;/a&gt;s standing on land, and your harpoon uses a targeting circle; they're often standing close enough that you can kill two with one throw.\nIf you're within their range, the soulraiders will throw their own harpoons, damaging your ship. Any water, no matter how shallow, will count as sailable waters, but running into land will also cause damage.

These lumbering, rotting corpses were once innocent townsfolk who have made the final transition into true undeath. Ghouls have great stamina and revel in combat with living beings. Ghouls are ravenous &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;cannibals&lt;/a&gt; who can replenish their health by devouring the flesh of fallen warriors, friend and foe alike.\nGhouls are found in several places throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, primarily the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Most notable are those who terrorize the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; as the front lines of the Scourge. Heavy concentrations can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Mindless ghouls can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGhouls have the appearance of a bent, twisted humanoid figure. Much of their flesh has rotted away, exposing a fair amount of bone and twisting facial features until they are unrecognizable as human. As undeath progresses in a victim, it twists and corrupts the body, growing fangs and claws.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Scourge crypts&lt;/a&gt;, ghouls are trained to cannibalizing fallen foes to renew strength. They are also raised by &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to fight alongside them as well.\nAlthough most ghouls are mindless, &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; is one that managed to retain a fair amount of intelligence, and was given a very high rank in the Scourge. It has been shown that ghouls can speak but most of what they say are driven through some sort of hunger for meat, such as &lt;a href=\"Eliza\"&gt;Eliza&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, ghouls were used as basic attack units and also used to harvest lumber to build Scourge structures. \nDuring the later stages of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fleshwerks\"&gt;Fleshwerks&lt;/a&gt; started to use scraps of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; from building &lt;a href=\"Malykriss\"&gt;Malykriss&lt;/a&gt; to enhance ghouls.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; summoned packs of ghouls to combat the Legion. Though individually frail and unintelligent, ghouls served them as fodder, overwhelming their enemies with sheer numbers.\nAs a death knight minion.\nUnholy &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s have abilities that raise ghouls.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", ghouls are the basic warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being combat units, ghouls also harvest lumber. They harvest 20 lumber as opposed to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;peasants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;peons&lt;/a&gt; that start with 10.\nIn the RPG.\nGhouls are the main forces of the undead Scourge. They are vicious creatures, retaining little of their humanity. The plague has torn away most of their memories, leaving only hunger and basic survival instincts in their place. Ghouls are feral and animalistic and are often considered to be the lowest form of undead. While generally humanoid in appearance, a ghoul is easy to recognize on the battlefield by its pallor, hunched-over posture, and feral face. Even those who were close to the individual in life have difficulty recognizing their loved one; the transformation removes most vestiges of humanity as well as identifying features of voice and body structure. Ghouls of the Scourge are strong fighters, but they are not particularly tough. Their ability to regenerate, coupled with cannibalizing the dead, makes them far tougher opponents than they may seem. Because of their limited intelligence, their greatest tactical insight is to hit something until it\u2019s dead. Thus, more intelligent beings often direct ghouls of the Scourge or send them into suicide situations where no tactics are needed. Ghoulish tenacity and fearlessness make them feared and loathed opponents (as does their habit of eating slain foes). They have some animalistic cunning when it comes to ambushes and other primitive attack strategies. They do not use weapons (having little brains with which to understand the concept) and fight with their bare hands or with a club or other found item.\nGhouls speak in growling, phlegmy voices, but they only mutter to themselves; they do not normally communicate meaningfully."}

{"id": "228417", "revid": "1487011", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=228417", "title": "Ghoul (Warcraft III)", "text": "Ghouls are the basic warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. These lumbering, rotting corpses were once Zombies that have made the final transition into true 'undeath'. Ghouls have great stamina and revel in combat with living beings. Ghouls are ravenous cannibals who can regenerate their wounds by eating the flesh of fallen warriors.\nIn addition to being combat units, Ghouls also harvest Lumber. They harvest 20 Lumber as opposed to Human &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peasant&lt;/a&gt;s and Orc &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peon&lt;/a&gt;s that start with 10.\nInformation.\nGhouls are the basic shock troops, who also serve as lumber harvesters for the Undead. They can carry up to 20 wood at a time, whereas peasants and peons can gather 10 (though peasants can be on par and later surpass with researches) and wisps 5. Ideally, the player should have three to five Ghouls devoted to gathering wood. If the map contains a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Laboratory%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Goblin Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, replace them with two &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shredder%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Goblin Shredder&lt;/a&gt;s, as they'll gather 400 wood for the same food cost.\nGhouls work exceptionally well with Dreadlords; the Dreadlord casts Sleep on an enemy Hero, who is then surrounded by the ghouls and quickly torn apart if they cannot teleport out. His Vampiric Aura also allows them to leech some health off from their attacks, since they are melee fighters.\nIf the player intends to use ghouls for combat, then it is important to research Cannibalize and Ghoul Frenzy. Both of these technologies will make your ghouls significantly stronger, although the latter requires a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Black Citadel&lt;/a&gt; which means the tech tree must be rushed, as Ghouls will quickly fall out of usefulness otherwise.\nGhouls are best when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Unholy%20Aura\"&gt;Unholy Aura&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dread Lord&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Vampiric%20Aura\"&gt;Vampiric Aura&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't continue to focus on Ghouls when it is clear that they are not cutting it. Instead, build up to &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrms&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and Abilities.\nCannibalize.\nNotes: The most wounded units are prioritized, if a group is ordered to cannibalize.\nThe ghoul requires a corpse in order to start cannibalizing, whether it be on the field or provided by a &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Wagon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Meat Wagon&lt;/a&gt;. Since the corpse is being devoured by the ghoul, it cannot be used for reanimation or the summoning of skeletons. If the ghoul dies or is forcibly moved while cannibalizing the corpse, then it automatically disappears. Ghouls will also not follow group orders while cannibalizing a corpse; they will only do so after they finish.\nUpgrades.\nIf ghouls are intended to be use in combat, then this research is mandatory for them."}

The category includes most &lt;a href=\"semi-intelligent\"&gt;semi-intelligent&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"intelligent\"&gt;intelligent&lt;/a&gt; large humanoids. Most giants are &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the giants on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were created by the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s as part of their ordering of Azeroth in the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, meant to protect and oversee the land and ocean. According to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, most of Azeroth's giants were hit with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't seem to have affected them much. Only a handful remain in the most untouched areas of Azeroth, where they are still fulfilling their ancient duties, although some (molten giants and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Kazum\"&gt;Baron Kazum&lt;/a&gt; for example) seem to serve the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; against their will.
